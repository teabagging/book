Detective Monk awakes in a hospital after an accident with amnesia. He quickly realizes that in order to keep his job he must solve the case without letting his boss know that he has no memory of life before the accident. The author does a very good job of keeping your interest with a great cast of characters. I am very excited to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"The idea of the book being William Monk awakens in hospitial without a memory. The book is as much a search for his identity as it is solving the crime. I enjoyed the overall idea for the book, even if it is a tad unrealistic. But I am willing to cut the author a little slack. William Monk is a likable hero even though he often seems a little weak. His sidekick was also interesting but not fully defined. This may have changed in later books. The only problems i really had with the book is her use of Victorian slang, she does not always let us know what the slang means. The book ends very abruptly without finding out what happened to the arrested party. The book is a much better read in Victorian England. I am not sure that it would have held my interest had it been modern. Although not on a level with Sherlock Holmes novels, this book was still interesting and enjoyable. If you like Victorian mystery then give this book a read."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Interesting twist to the normal murder mystery plot. Nice character development made all the richer by the setting in Victorian England. I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read more Ann Perry Novels and learn more about William Monk!!"},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"This is the second Anne Perry novel I've read, and unfortunately it's likely to be the last. Her plotting is strong, but she clearly wants to focus on character development. That would be fine if her writing skills were stronger. I found the first sixty pages of this book so repetitive that I nearly didn't bother to finish it. The premise -- that Monk has lost his memory and must relearn who he is -- is quite interesting, but Perry tries to develop Monk's character through the constant and highly repetitive (read: increasingly tedious) exposition of his thoughts in the form of questions. How many times does the reader need to know explicitly that Monk is asking himself what sort of man has few friends and no loves, or inspires trepidation in his coworkers? If Perry were a more skilled writer she could convey \\"character\\" less directly and more effectively. Was her editor asleep on the job?"},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Overall, I liked this book, but didn't love it. I have only read one other Anne Perry, The Cater Street Hangman, which I didn't like at all. So, this was a vast improvement. That said, parts of it were very slow and repetitious which detracted from an otherwise good story. I really wanted to like these books as they came so highly recommended by friends with whom I share a lot of common interests and a love of historical fiction. This just isn't my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I enjoyed this, but man... it took me a long time. Two weeks! Part of that was the fault of my schedule, but it was also a slow-moving story. When you first meet Monk, he doesn't know who he is. I think this lends an extra bit of flair to this book -- you don't have any background about your main character. As he relearns about himself, you're learning about him too. And since he doesn't particularly like what he's learned about himself, you get to see him grow. He really doesn't have a choice but to become an entirely new person.The mystery here is interesting, but it's the main reason that the plot is slow-going. Things didn't become really interesting until Monk started putting the pieces together and remembering things, and that's more than 3/4 of the way through the book. My only other experience with Anne Perry is her Thomas and Charlotte Pitt novels, and I didn't think this was quite as good. I'll read more in the series because I really like a good historical mystery, but I'm going to have to work my way into the next one."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I can't wait to read another of Anne Perry's Books. This book kept be busy for hours on end."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Having heard the author speak on the radio, her works praised highly by the host, I decided to start with the first of the Monk series. Unfortunately, I found the main character thoroughly unsympathetic and unlikable. The story was slow as molasses with bits and pieces of useless information thrown in to fatten the book. Also, I don't know the clinical features of amnesia, but it seemed that Monk's memory loss was selective and inconsistent. The ending was highly anti-climactic and the fate of the characters in question never revealed. I was very much looking forward to reading her books, but was sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"This was the first Anne Perry book I have read, but it will be the last. I found the basic premise of the main character's amnesia to be a gimmick. It irritated me that he would never \\"come clean\\" about his lack of memory, especially when we find out that the people he worked with could see through it. I have enjoyed other murder-mysteries where the villain was a lot less obvious to the reader. It seems from her sales figures that I am in the minority - what am I missing?"},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I loved Kate Ross's 'Julian Kestrel' Series and Ashley Gardner's 'Captain Lacey' series and I have been looking for another series that I might enjoy as much. This looked like it might have promise.I've read the first two books in this series over the course of just a few days. I will say that I liked the first one enough to run out to the library just before they closed so that I could pick up number two in the series even though I have a ridiculous number of books already waiting to be read inside the house.William Monk awakens in a hospital bed not knowing who or where he is. What he later learns is that the was in an handsome cab accident that took the life of the cab driver. He is a London detective and was working on a case at the time of his accident but now cannot remember anything about the details he learned through the course of his investigation. He recalls nothing of the man he was, what he valued or who his friends are. He feels sure his direct supervisor Inspector Runcorn has no fond feelings for him at all.I like the character William Monk, I liked the premise that he has to conceal his memory loss so that he won't lose his livelihood, I liked the gritty period details and the character of Hester Latterly who has just returned from nursing in the Crimean War. The mystery was interesting and I was fearful about what Monk would discover about the murder as well as himself. I also liked Monk's coworker Sergeant John Evan. There was a good element of suspense that kept me reading and at the end of this novel as I said before I wanted to continue reading about Monk and Hester Latterly."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"The first book in the Monk series was enjoyable and I am ready to read more. I love the setting."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"The Face of a Stranger was enjoyable more for its time travel tour of London circa 1857 than for it mystery, which wasn't bad either. I had read other titles in the Monk series so I went into this book with preexisting knowledge of the main characters, but how fascinating it must be for those reading this mystery as an introduction to Anne Perry's 1850s series. Incidentally, I didn't figure out the solution to the mystery, but then again I am blessed with a capacity to sit back and be entertained instead of trying to figure things out. While not an earth shaking conclusion or even a pleasing one, there was and often is realism in how Ms. Perry wraps up her tales of sanguine crime.On to the next!"},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"William Monk doesn't remember his name. He doesn't remember his life, his past, who he is and what he's like. Those who know him tell him he's a detective with the police, but Monk can't remember having anything to do with the police. In fact, he doesn't even remember his family, or his childhood. When he looks in the mirror, he sees a stranger, not his own face. But he must hide his lack of memory if he's to discover who he is. Life as a detective may give him some insight as to who he is. But then he is put on the most difficult case - the case of Major Joscelin Grey, who has been beaten to death in his own appartment, and then further beaten after he was dead. As Monk tries to hide his loss of memory, he must solve the two cases thrust upon him - Major Grey's as well as his own - at the cost of much more than anyone can fathom.____________________________________________I'm utterly impressed. What a story - what characters - what a murder and a way to solve it. I've read one other Anne Perry novel (Buckingham Palace Gardens) and was completely engrossed. I expected to love this one....and boy, did I!I'll start with the characters. You know those characters that you love from the moment you meet them? Well, here's one that I loved from page one...literally. I loved him when he was waking in darkness, all alone, with no memory. I wanted to be his friend, to see him well, to watch him build success after such an accident - such a downfall. His name is William Monk. All of Anne Perry's characters are very humanized, to say the least. They all feel - love, hate. They cry and laugh. They all struggle with something deeper than the surface. And while it is fascinating to see this in her other characters, with William Monk, it was a treat, a desert to be savored. We watch him as he is seeing himself - as though for the first time, with no recollection of the past. We are a part, from the very beginning, of his self-discovery. We see what he sees, understand what he understands. We are kept in the dark and we are captivated by the newness of Monk's life as it is to him, however old or young he may be. The rest of Anne Perry's characters, while not seen from this angle and depth, are all so well drawn out that within a few sentences about them, you feel as though you know them, and yet you have a fascination to learn evern more.I really enjoyed Evan's character as well, and the part he plays in the story. He's a young, new detective who looks up to the brilliant William Monk with an innocence that makes him human. As you watch Monk and the story unfolding, you also see what it's like to be a newbie detective in Victorian England. Evan affected Monk's character in ways that I loved - but you'll have to read the book to see for yourself!The story line here is interesting and quite original. (There have been books about lost memories before, and there will be more, I'm sure, but this had something unique to it.) While it fluctuates from being a page-turner to just your average mystery novel, it never lost my interest...not once. And I never felt lost about what was going on. Even with twists in the story and new additions of suspects and characters, I felt on top of the case and ready to kick some murderer-butt.And then there is the writing.... It's smooth, like melted chocolate - and it tastes just as good. She writes simply, elegantly, and with a class and style that is a God-given gift. The quote that I posted last week is an example of her perfect and realistic descriptions. I read this and I immediately cared for the woman she was describing - and I didn't even know her name. (Her dialogue is also realistic and very intriguing. It's very right for the time period.)Oh, and the end... Don't even get me started on how shocked and excited and nervous I got.So would I recommend this book? Yes: to anyone (probably older teen to adult) who can read. It's captivating, realistic (that's another thing - Anne Perry doesn't hold back on her crimes, which is also the reason I recommend it to older teens), and intense. And there's Monk - need I say more? I think we've established this, by now, that he's my favorite character. And one word I would use to describe this book: exquisite. (Like melted chocolate.) This book is especially wonderful if you're looking for a mystery with the feel of Sherlock Holmes - except one that's longer and has more depth. You'll get that...and a story that relies deeply on the patterns of human nature to solve crimes, which makes for a very interesting case."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I have only recently discovered Anne Perry and her two series of Victorian mysteries. I am in love with William Monk. I have read both series, Charlotte and Thomas Pitt and William Monk, and Monk is my favorite by just a hair.

Get these books you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"The only reason I didn't rate \\"I love it\\" is that statement is offensive to me except in something (or someone) I really love, as: I love God, I love The Lord with all my heart, I love my wife. I really did like the story and the suspense went to the very end. Very enjoyable. Anne Perry does well."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I loved this book!

Very exciting - can't wait to read the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"After reading the last of the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Series I felt let down with nothing to follow. I finally, after some months and reading various other authors, started with the first of Perry's Monk series. Wow, I am happy again in the familiarity of this author's classy style. 'Face of A Stranger', the 1st in the Monk Series, is full of suspense, is really an interesting story, and was hard to put down once I had started to read. I am truly looking forward to reading the next in this series."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Let me begin by saying I am a fan of Anne Perry. The Thomas andCharlotte Pitt series is very good. Ms. Perry writes with suchdetail about this era and it is always very evocative. I like theWilliam Monk/Hester Latterly series very much. Monk is a man withouta memory in this first book and Nurse Latterly helps solve the murderwhile easing Monk's fears that he knows something quite terribleabout the murder but has forgotten it. I have read the next two booksin this series and I can honestly say that Monk & Latterly will bea team as the series moves on. Very enjoyable so far."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"In a nutshell: This is the first in Anne Perry's \\"William Monk\\" mysteries. William Monk, detective, lost his memory in a carriage accident. He tries to recover bits and pieces of his life while trying to solve the murder of Joscelin Grey, a member of the nobility. To help him in this is his partner, Evan, and Hester Latterly, formerly one of Florence Nightingale's nurses.My opinion: I like the characters in this, but I prefer Perry's other Victorian series, featuring Charlotte & Thomas Pitt. That aside, I thought the characters were rather well developed but this story focused primarily on Monk, due to his loss of memory. That was ok with me since I didn't really care all that much for Hester anyway. She was a little too harsh for me to like her, but I thought she was well-written.Meanwhile, I ruined this book for myself by inadvertently reading the second book first. Hence, I already knew who the killer was since he stands trial in the second book,A Dangerous Mourning. I do believe, if I hadn't already known, I would have been very surprised by the outcome, something to be desired in a mystery novel. On a historical note: I am not an \\"expert\\" on Victorian England, since I tend to focus a little more on the Regency, but what I read seemed quite accurate.I apologize if my thoughts here seem a little haphazard. Truthfully, I started this book over a year ago and had trouble getting into it. I completely blame my mistake for this (see above), not the author."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I was delighted and captivated by this Anne Perry mystery. Her character, detective William Monk, wakes up in a Victorian hospital in 1857 or so, with no memory of who he is--but he does know enough to realize that the man visiting him at the hospital--his boss--is an unmitigated jerk who will ruin him, if he can. So Monk hides the depth of his amnesia and returns to work, to catch a killer and wrestle with the mystery of his own identity.He discovers two disquieting and alarming facts--that he is not a man imbued with sweetness and light, and that he might himself have been responsible for a murder.This is set against a canvas of exquisitely detailed mid-Victorian life and culture--bran pillows in the hospital!--and against Monk's own mysterious personality, which is in some ways, a character in its own right.I believe it is quite clear from the way Perry writes, what she thinks of her own actions. A very strong moral code tuns through all of her stories. I cannot praise this book or the author enough. She is no Charles Manson."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"The best Anne Perry book I've ever read! Character development that creates compassion and intrigue. Sometimes Perry takes you on an amazing ride that fizzles out in the end, but this story delivers interest and meaning through to the very end. If you like mysteries, you'll LOVE it. If you like historical fiction, you'll LOVE it. If you like good stories, you'll LOVE it."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"The entire William Monk series by Anne Perry is a must read for anybody interested in historical mysteries. It is absorbing and well written. I was excited to see that recently (i.e., over the past few years) Ballentine Books is re-publishing the entire series in paperback. While the covers are absolutely beautiful, unfortunately, the paper that they use for the book is of mediocre quality. Further, given that the print is painfully small, with a poor choice of font and close typesetting, it becomes difficult to read this particular reprint of the book. The new paperbacks are definitely not worth the ~$15 price tag. I was a little surprised by this since the Random House Publishing Group has a reputation for quality work and Ballantine Books is one of their divisions."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"He wakes up in a London hospital in terrible pain. It's the nineteenth century, when hospitals kill as many people as they cure. He doesn't know how he got there or who he is. His very face in the mirror is the face of a stranger.Only when his boss appears at his bedside does he learn his name and profession: William Monk, police detective.Out of fear of seeming incompetent and/or losing his livelihood, Monk hides his memory loss from his landlady, his sister and his professional associates. Back at the station, he's given a difficult and sensitive case, the brutal murder of Major Joscelin Grey, and he struggles to solve it with no knowledge of his own skills.Oddly, his skills seem to be in place although his memory is not. This seems a bit far-fetched, but I'm assuming the author has researched amnesia.So William Monk is in the position of detecting a murderer, while detecting his own personality and history. He does observe, to his chagrin, that no one seemed to like the original William Monk, and he aspires to change this.The story, believable or not, is a good one, replete with family scandals, romantic elements and Victorian ambiance. I look forward to reading the next book in the series: A Dangerous Mourning. Will Monk ever recover his past entirely? Will he fall in love with - but I mustn't speculate!"},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"\\"Face of a Stranger,\\" a British mystery, is first in the series of historical novels about William Monk, a British Victorian-era policeman stationed in London, then, thanks to air pollution, the Big Smoke. It is written by Anne Perry, veteran prolific author of 14 further William Monk novels, also the popular Thomas and Charlotte Pitt novels, as well as series on World War I and Christmas.Perry is surely one of the most unusual of mystery novelists, as she is, herself, a convicted murderer. She was born Juliet Hulme, in England, in 1938, daughter of Dr. Henry Hulme, a physicist. As she was diagnosed with tuberculosis, she was sent by her family to the Caribbean and South Africa, in search of healthier climes. She rejoined her family when her father took a position as rector of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. There she became extremely close friends with another teenager, Pauline Parker; the two girls brutally murdered Parker's mother in an extremely famous case, filmed in 1994 asHeavenly Creatures,( in which, I believe, the teenage Kate Winslet made her film debut, playing Hulme.) The girls were underage, and so were sentenced to incarceration at the discretion of the Minister of Justice, which proved to be for five years each. After she was released from prison, Hulme returned to England to become a flight attendant; she then settled in the United States, and finally Scotland, where she apparently still lives.The Cleveland Plain Dealer has said that \\"her grasp of Victorian character and conscience still astonishes,\\" and any reader must concur. She renders not only an extremely accurate account of the period, and its mores, but a passionate one, as regards the torment of the poor. For make no mistake, only a lucky few lived in the comfortable, easy \\"Masterpiece Theatre\\" style we have come to take for granted; and, furthermore, only a lucky few were able to find positions as domestic servants to these people, and to benefit even a little from their comfort. The rest of the population lived short and miserable lives, in overcrowded, starved, diseased conditions; and William Monk, Perry's detective, is very aware of the dichotomy, and angered by it. Moreover, Perry sets the book during Britain's famed Crimean war: remember that classic poem, \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\\" by William Simpson? Well, British generalship at that war was extremely hidebound, and inadequate, and there never should have been a charge of the Light Brigade. In addition, conditions there for man and beast were so terrible as to bring the legendary Florence Nightingale, and her cadre of devoted nurses to the scene; to attempt to care for the wounded in a decent and sanitary way. And Perry has generously given us an interesting character, the proto feminist Hester Latterly, as a nurse who was there working with Nightingale, and witnessed it all. Well, it does occur to me, some of you may like this tough-minded history less than I do...The book is, of course, a mystery. William Monk comes to in a filthy London hospital after a head injury received in a serious accident; he has amnesia, and no idea who he is. Until his supervisor Runcorn shows up to tell him, and assigns him a recent case: the brutal murder of Major the Honorable Joscelin Grey, younger brother of the nobility, a popular man about town, and injured Crimean War veteran. \\"Face of a Stranger\\" is excellently done, well-written in plot, dialog, narrative, and nature description. I was initially annoyed by the over-used amnesia plot device, but have never seen it better handled, and am impressed by the writer's inventiveness - she is able to offer us several convincing scenarios as to what may have happened. Seems to me it's worth getting to know Victorian-era detective William Monk better."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Who knew that a character with no memory of who he is would be so compelling? Most authors who use the old \\"main character with amnesia\\" hook gradually return pieces of the past, eventually leading up to a final revelation that clears up all confusion. Perry is a brave author, she leaves her protagonist and the reader with fewer clues and more questions than they started with.The Face of a Stranger begins in a squalid hospital in Victorian England, where a patient has just woken from a coma. Having no memory of who he is or why he is there, he is shaken and fearful of what he might learn. Soon enough it comes to light that he is William Monk, a police officer who lost his memory in a violent carriage accident. Rather than admit he has no memory of his former life and risk losing his job, he returns to work and is immediately placed on the puzzling murder of a prominent English gentleman. As he investigates the case, he also searches for some recollection of his former life. Through the eyes of people he once knew, he learns that he was not a very nice man, in fact even he doesn't like his former self. One thing is undeniable though, he was an excellent crime solver and his skills are one thing that he has managed to retain. The only allies he has are his partner, John Evan, and a young nurse fresh home from the Crimean war, Hester Latterly. Evan seems to genuinely like Monk, while Hester can barely stand him. Together, they must piece together the solution to the case before all of London is calling for Monk's resignation.I can't explain what it is about this book that interests me. I'm not a big fan of historical fiction, but the interesting plot is a good point in Anne Perry's favor. William Monk is a very captivating lead, and Hester Latterly is a formidable foil for him. I'll definitely be picking up the next book."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"A man wakes up in a hospital with no memory of who he is or what has happened to him.This is the first Anne Perry mystery I read and it had me hooked from the first page.Perry uses the artifice of amnesia to create a fascinating protagonist, a multifaceted character of exceptional depth. The reader joins Monk as he slowly discovers who he is--it is not always a pretty picture. One feels his desperation as he attempts to hide his memory loss and his frustration as he tries to solve a cold murder case and save his career.The story evokes all the splendor and squalor of Victorian era London. Perry has gift for creating atmosphere--you can almost feel the fog and smell the coal smoke.The murder mystery itself is interesting, it's resolution heartbreaking. But it is the enigma of William Monk that will stay in your mind long after you have closed the book.Happily, there are many more Monk novels to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"The first novel in a prospective mystery series must have certain qualities in order to be successful. First and foremost, the lead character must be appealing, even when flawed; the character must have redeeming qualities to endear him in some way to the reader. Then it helps if the mystery is well thought out, challenging and intriguing, and finally the supporting players must be well-rounded, characters that will continue to grow with the series. Perry succeeds in all these things with her introduction of William Monk. An amnesiac detective, in the middle of a case that will break him if handled incorrectly, fights to regain some semblance of what his life used to be all the while attempting to hide his impairment from all those involved. Monk's gradual discovery of his own past personality and his distaste for the man he was is an excellent idea to start the series and his original meeting with nurse Hester Latterly is a great example of the \\"tempestuous\\" meeting that often leads to romantic involvement in these types of books. Sure there's predictability to these types of books but with Monk, Perry has created a solid addition to the Victorian thriller genre."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"After waking in a hospital ward with no recollection of who or what he is, the man who comes to know himself as William Monk is forced to learn the rest, beyond his name and job title: Detective. Can he learn all there is to find, in order to keep on top of his job? For what is there for the unemployed in Victorian London other than social shame and the poorhouse's cold charity?Forced to seek himself without letting anyone else in on the secret - he appeals to me on multiple levels. (So many &quot;want to find themselves&quot;, but don't want to admit they're looking.)A gritty, gruesome look at the reality behind the trashy romance novels of our day, Perry gives Dickens a run for his money in attemptying to portray a hand-to-mouth existance cohabitating with the posh luxury of 1850's London.Those familiar with 19th Century literature or who simply have a well-educated vocabulary will have little or no need of linguistic assistance. The standard American high school education will probably leave you needing a good English dictionary for some of the slang used (or interpreting English currency).It is a toss-up between Face of a Stranger or Sins of the Wolf, as to which is her best book to date (Dec. 2000)."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Anne Perry is a prolific novelist with a big following, but I had never heard of her until \\"The Face of a Stranger\\" came to my attention. It is the first of her 18 books in her Detective Monk series. Monk is a Scotland Yard detective in the 1850's, who navigates through London's upper crust to solve the murder of an aristocrat. He is aided by Hester, whom he marries in later books, who herself was a nurse with Florence Nightingale in the Crimean War. \\"The Face of a Stranger\\" is an easy book to read and the solution of the murder is not obvious, but evolves from careful detective work carried out against the very interesting background of Victorian London. Enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Introduction to a series which obviously became rather popular. This offering peaked my curiosity enough to read the second in the series. However, that is where I had to stop."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Ms. Perry's depiction of post-traumatic head injury is completely irresponsible. She apparently did no research at all. Amnesia of the type she describes here does not exist. Thus, the underlying premise of this book unbelievable, even infuriating, to anyone with the most basic knowledge of brain injury. In addition to this, Monk's investigative skills are virtually nonexistent. His interviews with informants and suspects are fragmentary and incomplete. Suspense is not built, action is nearly absent, and the eventual solution is anticlimactic. Laden with turgid prose, this book is absolutely dreadful."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I recently finished reading the whole of Perry's \\"Thomas & Charlotte\\" Pitt series, set in London of the 1880s and \`90s, so it seems reasonable now to work my way through this second, and in some ways subsidiary, series. Like Pitt, Inspector William Monk is a London cop -- but of a full generation before. This first novel is set in 1856, shortly after the Crimean War, when Pitt (as near as I can estimate) would have been a very small boy running around the estate where his father was the gamekeeper. Monk was apparently born around 1820 in a fishing village in Northumberland, and that difference of some three decades saw enormous changes in England, both socially and economically. (Similar to the changes in the world in which your grandparents lived in the 1930s, compared with 2008.) At the beginning of the story, Monk wakes up in hospital, having been involved in a terrible traffic accident in which he struck his head traumatically. Now he remembers nothing -- not even his name or what he looks like. By sheer luck and authorially mandated coincidence, he identifies his profession and finds his way to his rented rooms, but he's lost all his detective skills, all memory of his earlier cases. He has even apparently undergone a basic change in personality and doesn't care for what he discovers about his own character and reputation. Now, amnesia simply doesn't work like that, as Perry ought to know -- or as she ought to have found out while doing her research. Amnesiacs don't lose their own names any more than they forget how to walk or speak their native language. However, if one is willing to commit a willing suspension of disbelief, as they say, and accept what the author says has happened to Monk, then the portrait she paints of a strongwilled, intelligent, ambitious man struggling to find himself (and to defend himself) is quite fascinating. The actual plot involves the bloody beating-to-death of Major Joscelin Grey in his rooms by persons unknown and it doesn't take Monk long to eliminate all the possible suspects -- not a happy situation for a detective. As the investigation progresses (which Monk appears to manage more by instinct than by mounting an organized investigation), he meets a young married woman who obviously knew him before his accident -- but, of course, he doesn't remember her, though he certainly wishes he did. However, it's the woman's sister-in-law, Hester Latterly, who is obviously intended to become Monk's sidekick. She's a willful sort who went off to the Crimea to nurse the wounded and sick under Florence Nightingale and who has a very low tolerance for crap of any sort. (One has to wonder if she might have known Aunt Vespasia in her younger years. . . .) The plot and the action are pretty well worked out but it's the detailed characters who will hold your attention. And somehow, given Monk's rather dark psyche, I don't think he and Pitt would get along."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Face of a Stranger. Some sections were just a little slow moving, but on the whole I thought the pace was good - the setting is Victorian England, after all, where police work couldn't be expected to go at breakneck speed. The characterization was excellent, and I found myself becoming more and more involved in Monk's dilemma over his amnesia and his realizations about his own personality. If the amnesia is not accurately presented from a medical point of view I really don't mind, as I'm reading a novel not a textbook and I'm willing to suspend disbelief. Hester Latterly is a wonderful character, and I look forward to her appearances in the later books in the series. The conventions, attitudes, repressed emotions and hidebound respectability of the upper and middle classes of the time are accurate and very well described. A really good and involving read."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Since I started somewhere in the middle of the series, this book was the explanation of who Monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory. This is a wonderful series and I would recommend it to anyone and suggest beginning with this book, &#34;The Face of a Stranger&#34; which is the first in the series, for a more complete appreciation of each following book."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"An excellent and &#34;clean&#34; author of intriguing mysteries. It's nice to pick up a book and not have to wonder if there will be content that will be offensive!"},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I will keep this short and to the point... the plot and characterization are brilliant but the writing inserts repetitive analytic asides on almost every page... a good writer does indeed use this technique to enrich the story and Perry does succeed quite nicely at times... the problem is totally that she repeats the ideas with little added information many times. If Perry were to rewrite this novel and remove about 30 or so pages of this baggage, she would have one of the best detective novels ever written. Still I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I started reading Ann Perry's Pitt series in 2005. It's a good read. The Pitts are safe. The Monk's series is dark and intriguing. I love Monk! He is so courageous and does what it takes to get the truth. I hope Perry allows him to get his full memory or at least 80% back."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Introduction to Inspector Monk. The amnesia angle I didn't care that much for but Perry uses it to slowly develop her hero. To a degree this works and gives her plenty of room to take him wherever she feels. Hester is also a very good character who I see by other book jackets is a regular in the Monk mysteries. She's independent, clever and mature. It's pleasing to note that there's not a flicker of romance between the two, and I wait to see how the pair work together in the next book. The murder mystery is fairly standard but as always with Perry, the social constraints of the time are evoked well. You understand how men & women behaved the way they did."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"In Victorian-era London, a man awakens in a place he doesn't recognize. Gradually he realizes that he is in a hospital, and a nurse informs him that he has been waking each day unable to recall the day before. Now he can remember from day to day, but the past - his entire lifetime before the carriage accident that put him here - is a void. He knows he must be past 30 years old, but he cannot even recall his own name.He is William Monk, a police detective, according to the superior officer named Runcorn who grudgingly visits him. When he is released and goes to the address where he's told he lives, he discovers almost nothing about his past personal life. There are only paid bills in his desk, and letters from a sister in Northumberland. Since he knows of no other personal connection, and he is not yet well enough to work, he visits his sister - whom he has not seen in many years, so she finds it not a bit odd that they meet as strangers. After that he returns to London and reports to the police station, where Runcorn assigns him a case. Monk works desperately hard to keep everyone around him from guessing that he remembers nothing, and as he begins to learn about himself through the eyes of others he finds that he does not like the man he was at all. As for the case, he finds himself moving inexorably toward suspecting that the murderer may just be...none other than William Monk.I've read this series far out of order, catching up with its debut volume only after reading many subsequent installments. That did not harm my enjoyment one bit. I did find that the story flowed with less assurance, but that is only natural in the first book of a newly launched series. It was fun to learn how Monk met Hester Latterly, the former Crimean war nurse who later becomes such an important part of his new life; and the mystery worked well, although I did find it hard to believe that almost no one realized Monk's altered behavior was due to loss of memory.--Reviewed by Nina M.

When I was in college at Prestonsburg Community College, this book was required reading and then was more of a chore rather than an eye opening experience. After moving from Kentucky to Michigan, I yearned for home. I ordered this book from Amazon.com hoping that it would take me back to the home I longed for. And that it did. I cried when reading the book. Not because it had sad or heart breaking but because it took me back to the home I love so much. I have since sent the book to my dad and he agrees that this book is a must read. It should be required reading in all schools in Eastern Kentucky. Thank you Verna Mae for taking me back home."},{"Title":"What my heart wants to tell","review":"In response to Paul D. Williams review, I have to say that Verna Mae would be upset with her last name being spelled Sloan. She was very proud of the Slone spelling of the name. Verna Mae and my grandmother, Alice Slone, went to school together and were close friends until their deaths.This book reminds me of the poor South Eastern Kentucky I grew to know as a kid visiting my family there, in Knott County. Mousie specifically, and Hindman being the biggest town nearby. I have read this book multiple times, and have had occasion to ask Verna Mae about the authenticity of the stories. I have no reason to believe she did anything other than document the truth. She was an amazing woman, as can be gathered from even a casual read of any of her books. To speak to her in person was like re-living history. And she was always happy to speak to visitors, apologizing for keeping us so long, and willing to entertain for as long as she could. As if living history needs to apologize for anything.I count having \\"knowed\\" her personally as one of the high points of my life."},{"Title":"What my heart wants to tell","review":"Appalachia has gotten a bad rap...hillbillies, poor, ignorant, etc. Those who have lived there, or know people who have, know this is false. After all, Appalachians formed the bedrock of the union movement in this country (think United Mine Workers), fought much of the Civil War, and ran our steel miils.Ms. Slone does a powerful job of exposing the powerful inner strength developed by residents of these mountains over the generations. She makes you believe that &quot;hillbilly&quot; is not an epithet, but--as she says--an adaptation of the Shakesperean Wiiliam (&quot;Billy&quot;) to the mountains--hence, hill billy's.A great book for anyone who wants to understand (or who already admires) this very important region in our country."},{"Title":"What my heart wants to tell","review":"Verna Mae is and always will be a part of my family. These families lived and are still living in Caney; Pippa Passes and the Hindman, KY areas just a few miles from where Verna Mae lives today.I was there for a long weekend in July 2007 visiting with family; some that I have never met and some that I have not seen now for some 50 yrs. I was visiting one of my 2nd cousins in Hindman, Ruth Taylor-Lake.I picked up a book on Ruth's end table that was titled, \\"What my Heart Wants to Tell,\\" by: Verna Mae Slone. Recognizing the author's name from my 10+ years of my family genealogy work, I asked Ruth about the book. She said, \\"the author lives right here in Hindman, and I will take you and introduce you to her, as she is family to; but before we see her, we need to go over to Caney and meet her son, Orbin and get one of her books for her to autograph for you.\\"As I wanted to visit my Great Aunt's (Dora Belle Taylor; Ruth's Grandmother) resting place on what is now part of the extended grounds of Alice Lloyd College, we would be passing right by her son Orbin's home so that we could stop and get a copy of Verna Mae's book. Orbin was out when we went by, so Ruth said that I could have her book for the signing and she would get herself another from Orbin later on.Ruth took me to meet one of her closest friends, Mrs. Verna Mae Slone. We saw the reason that Orbin was not at home as he was there visiting with his mother. We waited until Orbin finished his visit and departed and as soon as Ruth introduced me and told Verna Mae that I was part of the family, Verna Mae reached out to me for a hug, and I gave that hug back with all my heart.This woman is sharp as a tack. After some Taylor Family, short story telling by my cousin Ruth so that Verna Mae would know where I fit into the family, this beautiful woman of 92 yrs of age began reciting some of her very private poems and verses and telling of her life stories to Ruth and I as though she were writing them at that moment. Much of the personal stories she shared with Ruth and I that day cannot be found in any book, and they came straight from her heart. This almost three hour-verbal treasure I will hold in my heart forever, and will hold the autographed book, \\"What my heart wants to Tell,\\" close by on my reading table as well.Asking her permission, I had one of the nurses take a photo of Verna Mae and myself, and asked Verna Mae if it was OK for me to attach this photo over her autograph in the front of the book. She said, \\"You're family, it's your book and our photo;\\" I had to leave Ruth and Verna Mae together for a moment while I went into the hallway to take a breath and have a moment of my own.During this visit, Ruth and Verna Mae was like two school girls together; laughing and cutting up; each in turn reminding the other about things that they enjoyed; \\"back in the day\\". Once in a while one of them would start to tell the other something, and would pause a moment to give a glance my way, and after realizing I was still in the room and within earshot, would then lean closer in and tell the other something that would make them just burst out laughing; a private joke or a private something, I supposed. They really had a time that day and I was feeling very good about making my trip back to see some of my family of long ago.Verna Mae, you and your words, \\"What My Heart Wants to Tell,\\" mentions two of my direct ancestors; Dora Belle Taylor and Sarah Reynolds, where they assisted your father in preparing your mother's body for burial when she passed; God Bless her. I have, at times wondered what it would be like if I was able to go back to see and speak to the rest of our ancestors. Although much of that wonder still remains with me today, you have made it possible for me to do some of that, and I thank you, from my heart to yours.With love in Christ,Paul D.

Or somewhere in between? This book dives into the subject with a series of interviews with people who have crossed paths with him at one time or another during his stormy life. We are warned that any friend of Fischer who talks too much is completely cut out of his life, so this is not a tell all-learn all book. But it's probably as close as we are going to get.Why all the interest in this man? Some of his comments about the U.S. and the Jewish people are horrifying.Some people question his sanity. He clearly has some MAJOR bitterness in him! But if you were alive during the early 70's, when ,during the cold war, he single handedly took on the Russians,and became world champion,you'll never forget it. And he inspired millions of kids, like me, to learn chess...probably most from his book:\\"Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess\\".He did so much for chess in this country..but he could have done so much more. This book explains why he didn't...or maybe why he couldn't.Excellent!"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer","review":"For this new generation, the name of Bobby Fisher may mean a mere anecdote, but for all those who lived that decade, Fisher meant the epic of the irreverent chess player, signed by a curious personality, surrounded of mystery.Since his match with Tigran Petrossian, I became an enthusiatic player; as a matter of fact I acquired a fabulous text with all these games, but that jast was the prelude for the final combat with Boris Spassky.The world was aware that far beyond a simple match, that duel meant the challenge between West and East, where the Soviet hegemony was being seriously carved in relief. In this sense, the aroused interest by every one of those games was in the headlines of the great newspapers by then.Today, I was shocked by his early death (64). With his departure, an epic chapter has been over. If you are a hard fan of the chess game, it's useless to remark the transcendence of his legend, and for all those newcomers on the fabulous game, it would be very recommendable to get close to him, because, the chess game reached a legendary status like the Baseball, Football, Basketball and even the Olympic games.In memory of Bobby Fisher!"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer","review":"This book was put together by some Dutch guys that made a documentary about Fischer. Its an interview style book where various people give their recollections and thoughts on Fischer. Most of them were people who only had fleeting encounters with Fischer. There is also a lot of the predictable \\"Fischer was nuts because he said bad things about the Jews\\" in this, both from the interviewees and the people who put this book together. In spite of that I thought this was a reasonably good book mainly due to Fischer himself being such a fascinating character.Fischer of course was a little nutty. What can you say about a foaming at the mouth Jew hater whose Mother, and possibly his Father were Jews. However he did have reason to be paranoid and angry. He was watched by both the FBI and the KGB. &Eacute;ven his Mother had been watched by the FBI for years because of her Russian Jewish background and left wing activism. He was being pursued by the US Government and he did get financially ripped off numerous times, including having all his possessions confiscated from a storage unit where he was late on one payment after years of paying on time. So like I said the guy did have reason to be paranoid and angry. The definitive biography on Fischer has yet to be written. Till then books like this are of interest."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer","review":"charging $33 for a poorly written book that is not new; that can be purchased new for $6 elsewhere is robbery. shame on you"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer","review":"There was never a great champion in chess than Bobby Fischer. He was a artist over the board. His combinations, his sacrifices, and opening moves are still some of the most popular attractions. In later years, Bobby has developed a mental illness that has caused serious damage to his reputation and to the world. This book, I was hoping, would deal with his background, mostly his chess career. It disappointed me because the book was really a T.V. documentary, and much of the book was interviews with various people who have come across in Bobby's life. I wanted to learn about this amazing talent, not so much about his off-the-wall comments over the years. I feel for Bobby, he is sick, and died recently a paranoid man. At 13, Bobby was beating grandmasters. He is a special talent, one in a million. This was not a great book on his background. It was mostly a book about the issues around Bobby, but not his chess."},{"Title":"Quin se ha llevado mi queso?

Mark Stein, the psychoterapist, is somewhat laughable as he employs militaristic strategies to communicate with George Rosencranz. At the same time, he represents my ideal of a pastoral counselor because he is seminary-trained with LPC (licensed professinal counselor) credentials and is a United States Navy veteran.

It is also a story about the difficulty experienced by exiles, trying to adapt to life in their newly adopted country. It is a love story, and highlights the difficulty of making the right choices, and living with the consequences of those choices.Philip Casey uses the technique of multiple voices, narrating the same bit of personal history from the the different perspective of each of the characters. However, in each successive narration, one learns a bit more , another facet, of each event as it unfolds.The &quot;menage a trois&quot; involves an attractive, capable and independent young British woman, in the prime of life: a traumatised and isolated German man, who is a guilt-ridden survivor of war: and a young and inexperienced young Irish man, a manual worker. The German has intelligence and depth, and is fond of contemplating the mystery and beauty of Spirals found in Maths and Astronomy. He finds solace and healing in the music of Mahler. The young Irishman has a sexual awakening, and comes to adulthood and parenthood, under the tutelage of the heroine. She herself has to deal with the necessity of making hard choices.The book is an enjoyable and light read, and involves other minor characters. Towards the end of the book one is given a glimpse of the beauty and poverty of Ireland, contrasted to the life of working class Britain. What I found hard to believe was that in the house owned by the heroine, there is an indoor bathroom! It is my experience that homes from that era usually had outdoor bathrooms. But...read it for yourself, and YOU decide!"},{"Title":"I Listen: A Document of Digital Voyeurism","review":"Other reviews have trashed this book but don't explain why. It's a fascinating collection of cell phone conversations recorded illegally over a period of about 5 years. The slightly edited transcripts go a long way to showing how strange, and yet how human, the world is around us. Drugs, sex and relationships predominate. Some of the stories are pretty frightening, but all of it provides a great document about who our neighbors are, what they're doing, thinking and talking about when they're not being observed. Definitely not for the easily offended, but more than worth your time to read."},{"Title":"I Listen: A Document of Digital Voyeurism","review":"I first picked up this book in a store about three years ago; I found it intriguing, the Spacewurm intercepting calls and taking down the gory details.Some of the calls were funny, while others were a bit disturbing. What they do is show people as they are, no different than any of us.The argument between Tracy and Richard is a good example; a broken relationship, with recriminations that many can identify with.While the legality of picking off cell calls puts him in a gray area, it doesn't seem to have gotten the Wurm in trouble (yet). Not a great work of art by any stretch of the imagination, but a cautionary tale: be careful what you say on your cellphone!"},{"Title":"I Listen: A Document of Digital Voyeurism","review":"I picked up this book thinking the idea was pretty interesting- a number of phone conversations illegally recorded and transcribed into writing by the author. Normally I'm not into &quot;eavesdropping&quot; but I thought, &quot;What the hell, I don't mind conspiracy theory fodder every now and again&quot;. I was hoping that this book wouldn't rely too much on &quot;sensation&quot;, but unfortunately that's what it did.The general gist of the conversations are: lovers' quarrels, people trying to pick each other up, people talking about sex, people insulting each other, and so on. There are one or two moments in the book that are good for a brief chuckle, but otherwise it's about as boring as Jerry Springer. Each conversation is accompanied by a brief commentary by the author- how he picked up the call, a story surrounding it, etc. I got the idea that the &quot;true&quot; humor was in the very situation, at the moment it was happening. It's just trite and obnoxious in book form.Also, I found the typeface the book was written in to be VERY annoying. It's a &quot;computer&quot;-look font that made reading much more difficult than it should have been. It seemed the designer was trying to go for a &quot;futuristic&quot; or &quot;cyber&quot; look, but for the whole book to be displayed that way was just overkill. Not to mention the whole &quot;this is the future, it's sooo scary&quot; feeling the author was shooting for was completely laughable.Conclusion: if you still consider daytime talk shows to be a great source of entertainment, or are into non-intellectual &quot;futurist&quot; manifesto, you might dig this book.

My most personal memory of Mount Dora is a wonderful, sleepy day of drinking far too many Dos Equis at the Mexican restaurant while celebrating Cinco de Mayo, years ago.In contrast, author Cook takes you along with Brandy O'Bannon, an enthusiastic if inexperienced journalist, to the Mount Dora where cottonmouths strike out of the dark and old murderers flit across the mists. A classic mystery novel, Trace Their Shadows has more than a fair share of crime, clues and villains.Cook brings an old south knowledge of the people and place alive, reviving memories of the Florida, good and bad, that is rapidly disappearing, replaced by developments and theme parks. O'Bannon reminds me of what I imagine Nancy Drew would be if she were plopped into the twenty-first century, a little more worldly-wise, but still inquisitive and forever into things she shouldn't.Trace their Shadows is well crafted, an entertaining trip across the new Florida to the old."},{"Title":"Trace Their Shadows","review":"Ann Turner Cook was one of the celebrated Gerber babies at the beginning of her life.

Brookfield Able bequeathed the old mansion to his sister Sylvania, with the understanding that she could sell it if she so desired. There are rumors that the mansion is haunted, and the tale of a bizarre drowning forty-five years ago adds to the mystery. Brandy enlists the aid of Sylvania's grand-nephew, architect John Able, to gain access to Sylvania and the mansion's sad and eerie history. John and Brandy connect after sharing life-threatening experiences as they &quot;look around&quot; the mansion for artifacts and find human remains:&quot;At the same instant, the moccasin's fangs sank into John's hand. She gave a sob, sprang out of the boat, and rushed toward John as the moccasin drew back and slid over the edge of the pier into the water. John had dropped to his knees, supporting his wounded arm with the other hand.&quot;Ann Turner Cook's twenty-six years of teaching high school literature shines through in her writing. The plot is first-rate; characters are people who are easy to relate to and care about; the action is nonstop; and the denouement is excellent. Ms. Cook intertwines a sad but wonderful ghost story into her plot, which keeps the reader guessing from page one until the delightful finale. I got totally caught up in her tale and couldn't put the book down! I personally wish I could have experienced Ann T. Cook's teaching, because I'll bet she was a superb teacher. Trace Their Shadows is an entertaining mystery and ghost story that can't help but please.Shelley GlodowskiReviewer"},{"Title":"Trace Their Shadows","review":"Yes, Ann Turner Cook is yet another Florida mystery writer with the distinction of having been the Gerber Baby. A beloved English teacher by many accounts, she began writing after her retirement from teaching. I enjoyed this book very much. It isn't quite as tame and straightforward as something like Nancy Drew but certainly doesn't twist and turn like Chandler or smoulder like Sheldon. That being said, it should definitely keep the reader interested and offers many passages of excitement. I decided to read this because it takes place in Lake County, FL where I have spent a few great years of my life. I was not disappointed with Turner-Cook's depiction of the County and the Harris chain of lakes. I would recommend this book to any fan of Florida fiction. It's a ghost story and murder mystery with an undertone of romance. The characters are easily imagined yet are far from being one-dimensional. Turner-Cook's knowledge of plants and flowers is impressive and her description of the landscape vivid. You will imagine wading birds taking flight from the pages before your eyes. There is nothing pretentious or agenda driven in the book which makes it a good solid lighter read for most anyone's tastes. Read it !"},{"Title":"Trace Their Shadows","review":"A+ to Seller.

It wasn't long after everything was working out perfectly. Thanks"},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding","review":"Every pregnant woman has questions about how to care for her soon-to-arrive baby. I'm expecting a baby girl in about three months and my husband has been adamant that he wants me to breastfeed. I wasn't thrilled with the idea, but I had heard about the physical benefits for both me and the baby. After reading New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding, I am convinced that I do want to breastfeed and that the benefits far outweigh the hassles.Far from being a book that glorified breastfeeding and made it sound like a walk in the park, New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding plainly explained the aspects of breastfeeding while emphasizing the benefits. The book's step-by-step approach was very informative and made me feel confident that I can breastfeed my child. It covered a variety of topics and many points that I never even thought to have questions about. I will definitely be keeping this book as a reference tool for when baby arrives."},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding","review":"This is a good guidebook to keep around the house.

Of particular interest was his rocky marriage to Mary Todd, and the constant battles and rivalries within Lincoln's cabinet. Lincoln truely was &quot;A man of sorrows&quot;.

This book is terrific right from page one until the very end. I bought this book used, I forget how much I paid. Whatever I paid, it was worth it. It's not often in one's lifetime that one comes across a book like this, both educational and entertaining. Dale Carnegie pulls you right into the story from the very first page and you just can't extricate yourself from then on until the book ends. Not only was the story so interesting, but Lincoln comes across as the wisest of men. \\"With malice towards none and charity for all...\\" these, his words, keep echoing in my mind. Though he fought the civil war, a terribly bloody war, he did this to save this great nation. His words and his sentiment must be what is meant by 'love your enemies'(St Luke 6:27). Lincoln had no church; he said, \\"When I do good, I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion\\". But through his life he exemplies the best which man can aspire to. After reading this book, for me Lincoln stands head and shoulders above all the greatest men of whom I know something (there may be others like him but I haven't met or read about them). This book should be required reading in all the high schools - in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"I first read this book in early 1994. It left a lasting impression on me. The account of Abraham Lincoln's life is remarkably written by Dale Carnegie. This is not the story about the Lincoln that we learned about in school. Lincoln used his life struggles and applied them to his life to make him one of the greatest Presidents. Mr. Carnegie goes deep into the background to bring us a story of a young man and the trials that he went through to get to the White House. We can see the problems that Lincoln had while in the office of President. It would be hard to imagine what this country would be like if Lincoln had not been President because his foresight about this country and what he wanted to accomplish was remarkable. For example, the conflicts with staff and generals of the armies made Lincoln sometimes judge himself harshly. This book should be read by anyone who has an interest in Political Science or just wants to know more about the President. This is a very interesting book that I found hard to put down. I have read this many times and I cherish each moment that I spend reading the book."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"This is a thoroughly engrossing book. I could not put it down after finding it in my grandmother's collection of old books. It inspired me to become a better person and to strive for perfection and integrity in everything that I do. This book talks about the Lincoln that we were not taught about in history classes. I was impressed with the fact that Lincoln totally despised slavery. Especially after witnessing the treatment of a mulatto slave girl on the auction block by prospective buyers. His triumphs and failures make him seem much more human. Not only was he a great President, but a great human being as well. It illustrates the fact that the only true measure of real success is the ability to endure pain. If you can get your hands on this book, it is a must read."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"All I can say is, if you really want to get most out of your life, and wish to be able to tell your friends and family you had a great life at your last day, you should read this book."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"A lost love he mourned for his whole life, an extremely difficult wife, endless attempts to undermine his authority, constant personal sorrow - who knew?

President Lincoln had such depth of character, gained through the many trials of his life. Mr. Carnegie provided so many rich details about Lincoln and communicated them in his typical breezy fashion. The book was written for &quot;the average hurried citizen&quot; in 1932. The style is superb for even today's reader (in 1999). This is an excellent biography of one of history's greatest figures. The reader is treated to the experiences and people who formed Lincoln's thinking, to his enemies and friends, and to the millions of citizens who have been affected by his leadership in the past 135+years."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"The storytellers of other nations and cultures have to manufacture myths to give themselves heroes. Americans don't have to. Abraham Lincoln is inspiring because of his greatness, yet he is inspiring also because of his human frailties, which make his monumental achievements all the more fantastic. This book is a labor of love by Mr. Carnegie about his hero; it's his way of making his hero available to us all. I love particularly the introduction in which Mr. Carnegie tells his reasons for writing the book and his method of composing it. This is one of the best books I've ever read. All the wisdom and insight Mr. Carnegie ever collected in his \\"how to\\" books can be found more poignantly and abundantly here, because Lincoln exemplified everything that Mr. Carnegie ever taught. This book is what will keep Mr. Carnegie's name alive, long after his institute has folded and his \\"how to\\" books have gone out of print. In this book Mr. Carnegie captures the living reality of Lincoln: his wisdom, his virtues, his beautiful and unfettered English prose, his perserverance, his commitment to justice and liberty, his keen understanding of the paradoxical condition of mankind, his deep reverence, and his abiding love.This book also demonstrates that heroes don't just descend from Olympic heights to awe mankind with superhuman prowess; they are regular folks who face troubles, pains, and long-odds like the rest of us; but when most people act out of self-concern and a desire for ease and convenience, true heroes do what is RIGHT, in spite of the cost to themselves and the apparent futility of the task at hand. Lincoln was such a hero."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"If you don't know anything about Lincoln this book is for you!The author, Carnegie, was enthralled with Lincoln and by the end of the book you will be too.The book does an excellent job portraying who Loncoln was from childhood to adult to Presidency.

I surely wasn't interested in Lincoln when I read it. This book is perfect for anyone, from any background, with any perspective (business, investing, leadership, life, history, family, Dale Carnegie, and much more). I'm personally interested in business and investing, yet I loved this book.Whenever I'm nervous about the future of the US, I just read this book, then imagine living during the civil war and imagine where we are today. Nobody then could have imagined where the US would be 150 years later, just like we can't imagine where things will be in another 150 years. It's a reminder of how important faith is. Faith in people, society, and out future. To be pessimistic of our future is to not have faith in todays youth. They are hungry to put their their own mark on the world and do better than previous generations, just as their kids will also do one day. For me, the book was a reminder to be optimistic about investing for the long term.The other aspect I loved, was the human interaction perspective Dale gives the book. It's almost a continuation of his book How to Win Friends and Influence People, except only focused on a master of human interaction - Lincoln. Also, I didn't realize how much Lincoln failed. He failed at politics, business, and more. He spent 14 years, even while in congress, paying back debt from a failed grocery store. He set up a lecture once and no one attended. He failed to get elected a number of times. However, he remained committed to doing good. It's a true underdog story that is inspirational and uplifing.I cannot recommend this book enough. This is one of the few books that has potential to change your life."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"This is my most favorite book of all.

It was such an incredibley good read that I purchased a copy for my son! A +++++++++"},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"Dale Carnegie is famous for his books and classes on self-improvement, and no doubt he was the early master of what has now become an industry in its own. Some of Carnegie's methods are based on his close studies of Abraham Lincoln, whom he admired, and who emerged from the most modest origins imaginable at the time to become President of the United States, something that was usually reserved for people from renowned, wealthy and educated families.Carnegies focus was not so much on political impact or wartime strategy, but on Lincoln's private life and character. Therefore, his book can't be measured by scientific standards and would not necessarily be included in \\"serious\\" bibliographies. But it provides a unique insight on many aspects of this fascinating man, and it is as well a sometimes stunning picture of the time. The description of his election campaign just leave us speechless about how long a way the U.S. have gone, and how small and limited the financial frame of the time was.Doing the research for his book back in the 1910s and 20ies, Carnegie found many traces of Lincoln gone today, and he still met people who had known Lincoln personally. So, we get to know a lot of anecdotes that sum up to a colourful and sometimes unbelievable description of Lincoln and his time.But after all, this is a Carnegie book with his typical language from the 193ies, entertaining and lively, never boring. It was published in 1932, when the term \\"negro\\" was obviously not considered to be offensive, allthough it makes us swallow today reading it. Carnegie admits frankly that Lincoln himself was willing to stick to slavery to save the Union, and turned anti-slavery to win the war. He also reveals in many details that Lincoln's marriage must have been an ordeal to him, and you can almost see Carnegie shaking his head about Lincoln's wife all the time."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"This is the best book on Lincoln I have ever read. A true joy to read."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"Dale Carnegie, the self-help course guru, was a big admirer of Abraham Lincoln. He set out to write a quick and easy to read summation of Honest Abe's private life, and succeeded.Few people had as much to overcome as the 16th president of the United States. Born into grinding poverty, losing his mother at an early age and having a father who did not value education, it would be easy for young Abraham to give up on life and be a failure. He didn't.Tragedy seemed to follow Lincoln at every turn. The love of his life died before he could marry her. A business failed. His wife was an absoulte shrew. All but one of his sons died in childhood. Little wonder he was prone to depression!Yet out of this mire of melancholy arose one of the greatest men of all time. Lincoln realized taking on the institution of slavery would likely result in his death. He did it, anyway; it was the right thing to do. And he changed history forever.Reading this book gives one a renewed appreciation of a man with unprecedented courage who led this nation through the crisis of the Civil War. His personality -- the sparkling wit, practical jokes, great sense of humor, as well as the depths of despair and the long-suffering patience with which he endured his marital mismatch -- is ably summed up by the founder of the famed motivational seminars. This brief biography showing how Lincoln overcame so much difficulty to become one of our greatest presidents is an inspirational tale that will stay with you long after you read the last page."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"I came home to visit my mom for Christmas after my dad passed away. When I was a kid, I often saw this book on the shelf but never bothered to read it. Now I felt as if I wanted to read a book so I picked up this one off the old shelf.When I used to think about Lincoln in school he was a president who made a famous speech after Gettysburg and emancipated the slaves. But I had never known his real life and love. For example, I had not known that Mary Todd was the witch from hell and how Lincoln emerged from obscurity and became the Republican nominee at the 1860 Chicago convention by a series of coincidences. I had not known the humor of Lincoln, how he loved to tell funny stories and was a huge fan of Shakespeare. And despite what you might have already learned about Lincoln, would you have ever guessed he was one of the most despised men of his day (by the elitist Northern press) during his presidency? His policies were called a disaster - The war was lost - The worst president of all time - a very close re-election - and so forth.In short, this book is written masterfully and you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"I recieved this book (which is \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" and \\"How to Stop Worrying and Start Living\\" in one edition) as a gift from a Dale Carnegie Instructor (Thanks again Ron!).

Not reading it would be a punishment to yourself, and you deserve better."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"Not really a bad book; quite readable and containing even obscure facts not easily found in the most erudite of Lincoln biographical works. So what's the problem? To my thinking, there are two primary issues, the first of which is in my title. Carnegie loses his compass at some point and it becomes difficult to discern whether he is focused on \\"Lincoln the Unknown\\" or on his wife (whom everybody generally acknowledges was not a run of the mill first lady). Her eccentricities are intertwined throughout the book, and the author does not necessarily make a case as to how these effect the life and presidency of her illustrious husband. Carnegie even wraps the work up with a summary of her life after Father Abraham, which hardly led her to a Promised Land.Secondly, my impression is that Carnegie has an intense admiration for the character of Lincoln (and what politically and historically savvy person doesn't?). The problem as I see it is that his judgment on Lincoln's life is clouded by his idolatry. Lincoln's flaws(and they are many, and sometimes major) are glossied over in a work that is less narrative than tributary.This said, I still think it is a good piece for every beginner to start with, and I plan on passing it on to my students."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the Unknown","review":"The book is all about the life and struggles of Abe Lincoln, on how he led a life of poverty to presidency. The book goes into not the history of the time but the relationships he created to the common everyday person he dealt with. I read the book and just devoured it.

Writing was torture. He needed an escape mechanism, and he also needed money. This edition unites the 2 products of that double motive. The first is a collection of essays about the sea, the second a short autobiographic walkabout.I like A Personal Record a lot better than The Mirror of the Sea.With Conrad, fiction beats non-fiction.An amazon friend's review of a Gide essay collection recently was entitled \`non fiction beats fiction'. (Gide was Conrad's French friend in the literary world.)My opinion on Conrad is: while Gide's fiction may have sunk with time, and his essays may still be floating, with Conrad it is the other way round. His sea fiction has enormous buoyancy, while his essays have a certain leaden quality.During his struggle with Nostromo, in 1904/5, Conrad wrote, on the side, and by dictation at night (I am wondering about the opportunities involved in that), a series of sketches of autobiographical nature. They were all published separately in newspapers and magazines, and then collectively as The Mirror of the Sea.The book was a critical success, but it has been shown that it was unreliable as a biographical source. Conrad made things up and misrepresented facts. Which proves my point, he was a fiction writer.The book is a lament of the lost culture of the sailing ship, and at the same time of a closed chapter of his own life. He had quit the sea for the life of a writer on land, and it was a hard life, the writing.JC says in his own introduction: I have attempted here to lay bare ... the terms of my relation with the sea. ... for twenty years I have lived like a hermit with my passion! ...Within these pages I make a full confession not of my sins but of my emotions.So, he goes and writes, at times entertainingly, about landfalls and departures, anchors and wrong language (casting!), drinking captains and presumptuous mates, storms, pleasure sailing, the ethics of craftsmanship, ships in calamity (overdue, missing, stranded, lost), the near mystic relation between man and ship (a she!), between man and nature, about river estuaries, ports, docks, about Nelson and Trafalgar and about some stories from his youth... This is an easy process for Conrad, compared to the hard labor of his fiction. The writing did not require his usual meticulous composition; the voice is that of a TV documentary host. The texts are assembled without subtitles, and in a sequence which is different from the publishing chronology.Is it worth it? For me and for other members of the fan club, sure. For aficionados of the subject, i.e. ships and the sea, certainly. For others, hardly.Now the Personal Record is another matter entirely. JC wrote it for his soon to be former friend F.M.Ford, who wanted to start a new magazine and publish literary autobiographies. JC's text focuses mainly on two subjects: his escape from Poland for the sea, which meant moving to the West, and his escape from the sea for writing as a living. Interestingly, he denies explicitly that the question why he chose to write in English is a legitimate question at all. After all, what else could he have done?We follow different episodes involving the growth of Almayer's Folly, his first novel. We follow JC on a visit to Poland to his relatives and hear a lot about the family history back to Napoleon and about the uncle, who had adopted JC when his parents had died.Why did he \`run away' to the sea after all? He was a reader from childhood on. He likens his escape to the exodus of Don Qijote from his village in La Mancha: the romance of adventure.Now, honestly, does that amount to a \`Personal Record'? Critics at the time were annoyed. Not only was the text absolutely no record of anything, rather a rambling discourse which jumps through chronos like we love it from Conrad's fiction. Well, some of us do. I do.Conrad anticipated some opposition. He quotes Marcus Aurelius asking for heroic truth. He makes a categorical statement: JC's truth is more of the humble kind.And anyway, another quote, now from Novalis (not so beloved by me): I will believe myself as soon as I find somebody else who believes me. (Maybe that's less a quote than a free interpretation.)As I said, Conrad was great at fiction, his fiction beats his non-fiction hands down. Lucky for us, he was no fanatic of bare facts."},{"Title":"Dance to the Piper","review":"I read this book years ago as well as all the other &quot;Agnes&quot; books and am sorry to find that it is completely unavailable. Ms. de Mille writes about dance in such a way that anyone can appreciate and understand the evolution and importance of dance in America. She gives a frontier spirit to her story of life in Hollywood in the twenties, and of her struggles to become a dancer and choreographer. I went to a lecture she gave in 1978 at the &quot;Y&quot; in Philadelphia and, even after two strokes, this courageous lady managed to keep an entire audience in thrall with her enthusiasm for dance and America...they don't make 'em like they used to"},{"Title":"Dance to the Piper","review":"I am VERY taken with the extensive autobiographical writings of choreographer and dancer Agnes de Mille (1905-1993). I read them all and recommend them highly, though if you're not interested in ballet or modern dance you may find them less interesting (my wife read one or two only). Titles (in chronological order) are: Dance to the Piper; And Promenade Home; Speak to Me, Dance with Me; Where the Wings Grow; and Reprieve, written after her stroke. She also wrote Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death, about the Lizzie Borden case and de Mille's ballet, Fall River Legend, and some other books.This book in particular is probably the most interesting of de Mille's volumes for the general reader. It tells the story of her growing up in Hollywood, with some fascinating looks at her uncle C. B. de Mille and early film making, and her difficult struggle to get into dance. In addition, her writing is very charming and professional. You'll probably like this book even if you have no interest in dance."},{"Title":"The Ships","review":"The title of this first novel from Honduran writer Quesada refers to the ships that come with empty holds ready to whisk the pineapple harvest to the four corners of the earth. Their arrival is the one beacon of hope for the poor field workers who populate this novel: \\"The ships made us all happy; we knew that when they came in we'd earn more money, and there couldn't be any more money than in those ships anywhere.... The city might be a lot of fun but when there were no ships, everything quieted down, even the music.\\" The ships represent hope and the outside world&oacute;brief flashes of happiness.Guillermo is a young man living in the coastal city of La Ceiba in 1979. He'd like to be attending college in the capital, studying to be a writer, but instead we find him about to start work as a pineapple picker for Standard Fruit Company. Fortunately, the other workers who show him the ropes don't hold his intellectual ambitions against him, and he's soon a part of the group. The story sort of meanders along choppily as Guillermo falls in love with a clerk at Standard Fruit and larger events drift across the background. Chief among these are a strike by the union to try and get the raise they are promised in their contract. Meanwhile, across the border in Nicaragua, the Sandinistas have given Somoza the boot, and the question is whether the winds of change are going to spill over the border.Guillermo is thinly portrayed, and too often feels like the author's attempt as self-portrait of the artist as a young worker. None of the supporting cast emerge in great detail either, and the book suffers as a result. The strike and the war next door give Quesada the opportunity to trot out some of the bitter leftist sentiment one might expect from a Latin American writer of the era. It doesn't help that the prose falls into some of the stylistic traps one often sees from young writers, especially Quesada's attempt to cram all manner of narrative delivery forms into the book. We get omniscient narration, interior monologues, letters, an overarching story, and a series of unfathomable sections in italics about intellectual freedom. All in all, there are moments of flash, but it's not a particularly rewarding read."},{"Title":"The Ships","review":"This book is very well written and very easy to read. It contains short chapters that give a glimpse into the lives of everyday people and their concerns, personal relationships, fears and daily work.I read the book because I am going to Honduras soon and wanted to have some idea of what a writer from this country might be talking about and what the style of the writing would be like.I highly recommend this book it gives vivid descriptions of several towns and the daily lives of company workers.However, my next read was \\"The Big Banana\\" by the same author and I enjoyed it even more.I hope he writes some more stories very soon."},{"Title":"The Birthday Presents","review":"This is a dear, sweet book about being happy with what you have. \\"The Birthday Presents\\" is Paul Stewart's short but sweet tale about two pals, a rabbit and a hedgehog, and how they go about trying their darndest to pick the most wonderful possible birthday gifts for each other.Deciding that Rabbit's hole is just a mite dark, Hedgehog bottles up a bunch of moonlight. Simultaneously, Rabbit worries that Hedgehog might be bothered by the sunlight while sleeping out in the open--so he packs up a mossy box of darkness. Of course the pals are disappointed when they open their gifts, but they later figure out on their own the good wishes behind each gift--and the best way to put the gifts to real, everyday use.Any small child can begin to learn from this book the secret of choosing to be happy with what you have, instead of worrying about what you don't have, and parents and kids alike will get a kick out of Chris Riddell's vivid illustrations."},{"Title":"The Birthday Presents","review":"The Birthday Presents is such a wonderful book. Poor Hedgehog and Rabbit don't know when their birthdays are. They decide they will celebrate them together and go about choosing a gift for each. Each of them chooses a gift with love and care. You can almost feel how much thought they put into their gift. This book focuses on the act of giving, not just the gift itself. A great book for any age!"},{"Title":"Muhammad (Past masters)","review":"I have been a serious student of the history of western religions for 5 or 6 years, with emphasis on the beginnings and early years of Christianity in the context of the cultures, philosophies and religions of the time (Jewish, Greek, Roman, Persian etc.), and the subsequent development of the 6th-7th century world in which Islam arose and flourished. I have accumulated a sizable reference collection and thought I hadn't missed very much. But I just ran across Michael Cook's 'Muhammad', and it is the book I would recommend that any interested beginner read for a short account of Muhammed and the origins of Islam. Only 89 pages, it is especially good on the relationships between Islam and its Arabian cultural roots, and between Islam and Judaism & Christianity. The writing style is so clear and effective that it took my breath away more than once. Other reviewers here criticize it as an apology for Islam, as speculating things that are in dispute, and as not being the best source on this subject. The first says less about this book or about Islam than it does about the reviewer. The second is true but trivial - Cook is clear that he is speculating when he does and it is a strength of this book that he is willing to. From my extensive reading, there is nothing in his speculations that is unreasonable. On the third, there are other good introductory books such as Karen Armstrong's 'History of God' and 'Islam', but this is the best well-written short treatment I have seen. Cook wrote a short, clear book in part by leaving out all the \\"maybes\\" and \\"so-and-so doesn't agree with this theory\\" verbiage. If you want a longer, every question & detail covered, a struggle to get through, reference-style treatment, well, they're out there. That's not what this is."},{"Title":"Muhammad (Past masters)","review":"This book is not a biography of Muhammad; the Prophet's life is covered only in Chapter 2. It is rather an account of Muhammad in his historial context, with emphasis on pre-Islamic Arabia, the traditions of monotheism, and the sources for early Islamic history on which it is based.The main flaw in this book is that it presents as authoritative information which is in reality quite controversial. For example, his chapter on Muhammad's life includes a brief phrase about the satanic verses incident (without calling it that) that fails to describe differing points of view on the subject. The whole chapter on the Prophet's life, and much of the rest of the book, has perhaps also been too much influences by anti-Semitism in the Middle East arising after the founding of Israel. He also reports lots of traditions outside the mainstream (such as Ishmaelite Arabs who followed Jewish law) without giving a clear indication of how they might have fit into the larger scheme of things.His chapter on \\"The Sources,\\" while perhaps the most controversial, does give a fair presentation of the dilemma scholars face as to whether the Islamic tradition about the Prophet is fundamentally correct or fundamentally a later invention. I disagree with his conclusion, but it's his book. Here he presents enough of the evidence for interested readers to make up their own minds.Given the contraints of this series, Cook may have done all he could. This is an interesting work, but there are probably better ones out there."},{"Title":"Muhammad (Past masters)","review":"At the time this book was published in 1983, Michael Cook was a lecturer \\"at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the University of London, (and) the author or editor of several books on the history of the Middle East.\\"He wrote in the Preface, \\"My own reservations about writing this book arise from different grounds. Muhammad made too great an impact on posterity for it to be an easy matter to place him in his original context... The result is that the only aspect about the book about which I feel no qualms is the brevity imposed by the format of the series. The attempt to write about Muhammad within such a compass has brought me to confront issues I might not otherwise have faced...\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"As might be expected, the Jesus of the Koran is still recognizable as the Jesus of the New Testament... There are, however, divergences. For no obvious reason the Koran insists that Jesus was not really crucified... But the crucial point of divergence is the insistence that Jesus, though a messenger of God, was not His son, still less God Himself.\\" (Pg. 32-33)\\"We may end this account with a brief relation of the future course of history as it appeared to early Muslims... The Muslim community will break up into a mass of conflicting sects... Eventually God will send a redeemer... This redeemer, the Mahdi, will receive allegiance at the sanctuary in Mecca, whence his emigration (hijra) will be to Jerusalem; there he will reign in justice... Thereafter the Antichrist (the Dajjal) will appear from Iraq, reducing the Muslims to a remnant... In the hour of their need, Jesus will descend to earth in armour and lead them against Antichrist...\\" (Pg. 41)\\"There is a rich body of traditions as to how the Koran was collected and edited... the traditions are not a model of consistency. We learn that some of Muhammad's followers already knew the whole Koran by heart in his lifetime---yet subsequently it had to be pieced together out of fragments collected from here and there.\\" (Pg. 67)\\"The results of this research can perhaps be summarized as follows: First, nothing resembling the Koran as such is to be found in any other tradition; the book remains sui generis, and if it had predecessors, we know nothing of them.\\" (Pg. 78)"},{"Title":"Muhammad (Past masters)","review":"I enjoyed it as much as I had enjoyed Cook's A Short History of Quran. He writes, plainly and is compellingly very impressive."},{"Title":"Muhammad (Past masters)","review":"An interesting and original semi-biography. If you want a chronological description of his life, then this is not for you. But if you are interested in an original perspective, check out this small book."},{"Title":"Muhammad (Past masters)","review":"This is a very short book that could be read in one seat, yet it contains substantial information about Muhammad's life, teachings and politics. Michael Cook draws both from traditional Muslim sources (such as the \\"Sira\\" of Ibn Ishaq and, obviously, the Koran) and from modern criticism.I particularly enjoyed Chapter 2, a concise presentation of the traditional account of Muhammad's life, as opposed to other chapters where the author attempts to question the historical reliability of the traditional sources."},{"Title":"Muhammad (Past masters)","review":"Cook says early on in the text that most Muslims are \\"Sunni\\" and that Islam is more monolithic than Christianity. This is his round-about way of stating his intent to retell Sunni beliefs and history from his own, personal opinion. Sunni beliefs are read into the Qur'an, and controversial Hadiths are cited, sometimes as fact, without pointing out opposing arguments. You leave this book with the notion that Muhammad was as intelligent a product as his culture could make him; a self-proclaimed prophet that invented polemics against Jews and Christians in order to extend his own political influence. Religious animosity is highlighted, especially negative feelings certain Muslims harbor toward Jews, while positive inter-faith interaction is downplayed. If you want a book that discusses the multitude of opinions regarding Muhammad and the Qur'an, don't get this. But if you want a quick, yet biased, introduction against conservative, Sunni Islam, this is your book. If you want a genuine introduction to Islam, I'd recommend anything written by Karen Armstrong."},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"Read all the Customer Reviews when you look at PMP Prep Books and if the strengths and weaknesses sound like you then its the right book. Me? I had $50 bucks or less after the exam fee so I bought this book because I like the Dummies books for hints, insights, organization and I hit the jackpot. I used this book and a printout of the PMBOK Guide to memorize the core processes, learn question strategies and hit my weak areas.

The book is pretty good, but the computerized test bank has lots of problems showing all the answers and the like. You cannot do less than a full test which makes practicing on areas impossible. The only other computerized test bank that I have found is Rita Mulcahy's which costs $300 so you might want to put up with the problems. On the other hand, it will cost over $400 to take the test so you may decide to buy some additional book(s).There are lots of technical errors with formulas--some of which are so clearly nonsensical it makes wonder what other problems there are. For example, the book never does manage to get the square root symbol correct.Which brings me to a compliant about PMI and the PMP certification--a lot of this stuff is the official line and many questions are is X a part of Y process? In other words, lots of detail that do not impact or measure your skills as a project manager. There are also quesitons about various motivational theories which get mentioned a lot in introductory college courses, but have little or no research to validate them.Bottom line...the price is good, but the book could stand a good technical editing."},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"First off, I own about 4 dummies books (Wine, Photoshop, HTML 4, & Italy). I bought this book to use with my PMP study group, and I and my group found it to be one of the more confusing books out there, and certainly the worst Dummies book I have bought. It may be because this is only the first edition, but there are better books out there by far.Here is what I liked and did not like about PMP for Dummies.What the book did well:1. The sample test questions were really good.2. I found the accompanying CD to be helpful.3. The charts in the book were some of the clearest and best-illustrated I have seen.What the book did poorly:1. It has a bizarre organization to the material. For instance, the staff management plan and procurement plan were organized under the chapter on the WBS, which made no sense to anyone. That kind of organizational philosophy was followed throughout the book. It confused everyone who picked it up. It is set up by process, and that also gets very confusing. The net result is that you read some info about scope in one chapter and some more in another, and it becomes nearly impossible to follow. I would prefer to have a chapter on integration, scope, time, etc like the PMBOK does.2. There is a whole section starting on page 131 dedicated to calculating future value, present value, and IRR, and according to every other test prep book I have picked up, these calculations were taken off the exam three years ago.3. I liked the questions but I though the explanations of the answers were not complete enough.4. Final gripe, the CD that came with this only had 300 questions on it. That is much fewer than the other resources I've seen."},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"The book is a great starting point.However, you definitely need to buy something else if you want to pass the PMP exam which is really complex.I'd recommend to read this book first and the the Rita Mulcahy's PMO Certification Book"},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"I figured this book would be a good companion to the PMBOK, but it is a little dated (for previous exam) and there are some glaring errors and omissions in the text that made it hard to follow.

They are really harder to understand and follow than PMP Cert For Dummies.Simply, this is the best self study guide for passing the exam. Don't rely on any one book to pass the exam, but use this one and the others. Remember tha the exam is only 70% based on the PMBOK. This helps fill in the other 30% of the score! Anybody without this book is at a competitive disadvantage.This For Dummies book helped me to overcome my fear of passing the exam.

PMP Certification For Dummies is the easy way to study for the exam. It has the clearest style - the other books are dry and boring. Rita's re-cycled class workbook was such a bore that it put us to sleep, so she must be a great class lecturer. Kim's prep book was a snore. (Even her husband's book on the competitive test was a better read.)The tricks about the exam were great. It gave many helpful hints in each chapter to look inside the PMI mindset, so you get to know the pattern of what they are seeking to test. PMP CERT teams you how to answer the exam questions. For that alone, it's worth the price and the time.This was also the best on showing the inter-relationships between processes. Nobody else gets this point; that the PMI methodology has this big feedback loop built in.The book is an overview of PM topics and goes into some real depth in several areas like formulas for the exam. As others have mentioned, the formula chapter is the best of all PMP prep books.Get this book. Don't let anyone tell you that this book won't help you pass the exam.

Furthermore, it's importance overshadows its difficulty. What this book brings to the table is the 'For Dummies' style and treatment of the material. This style has been prepared carefully over many years and (I guess) thousands of titles.My recommendation ...Start with this book. Go through it twice. The first time go through it rather quickly so that you get an overall grasp of the material. Second, go through it more slowly to pick up the details that you skipped over before. Third work the practice test and other material that's on the CD.After this, read the PMBOK.Then get another, harder test preparation book, perhaps the Chu/Altwies/Walker book.

I used this book as well as the Mulcahy and Ward books to study for the exam. If I had to sum up this book in two words they would be \\"well intentioned\\". The authors obviously mean well and seem to truly care about helping people pass the exam but the book is riddled with mistakes, typos and basic math errors. It's good information but doesn't really get the core concepts across in a clear way. It's also very confusing to try to use this book and the PMBOK simultaneously because they are structured very differently. Part of my buying decision was the fact that this book contained a practice exam CD. If this is your motivation, DON'T BOTHER! The CD is so full of errors as to be almost worthless. It asks questions based on charts and diagrams but fails to present the user with the diagrams in question. Scores are also inaccurate. While I appreciate the authors' efforts, I'd strongly suggest they re-read Chapter 8 in the PMBOK, the chapter on QUALITY. Either that or fire their editor. You'll have more luck with the Mulcahy book."},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"Like a previous reviewer, I am also a big fan of Dummies guides and also had high hopes for this book. I was disappointed by the numerous errors, lack of correlation between topics emphasized in the book and the actual exam questions, and problems with the included software.The book is riddled with errors. For example, there is an incorrect process name in the P.M. process matrix (pg 43); the text repeatedly confuse the PMBOK definition of \\"quality\\" with that of \\"customer satisfaction\\" (one example is on pg 92); there is a Prep Test question that states that the project plan is created during Initiation (pg 78); etc. Additionally, the software didn't run properly until I stumbled upon a patch Nathan and Jones had posted on their web site. Even after the software was patched, it still had runtime problems. Finally, having recently taken the exam, I note that my performance on their practice exam was not a good predictor of my actual exam score. Additionally, Nathan and Jones emphasized a number of topic that did not appear on the exam and gave scant attention to several topics that were emphasized. (I can not provide any supporting evidence because I am bound not to disclose details of the exam.)My recommendation is buy PMP Exam Prep (4th Edition) by Rita Mulcahy.

Digging a little deeper, I noticed a number of sample questions where the answers in the book were wrong. Some of the mistakes were obvious, such as an answer that said &quot;...plus the probability of .60 x 50,000 = 18,000&quot;. Other mistakes were more subtle, and the last thing you want to do when preparing for an exam is study inaccurate material.I also found the material on the CD difficult and unreliable to use.

Actually, it is a great exercise, you get a bad book and you correct it. After this you know the subject.I have mailed questions to the author, regarding the mistakes in the first chapters. He recognised some mistakes but the anser afterwards was very doubtfull. He also answered 3 weeks after my first e-mail. Considering that a study period is about 3 months, you have time to find the answers yourself.Some areas are cvering an old version of the PMBOK and no information is given about this fact.Finally, the hints the author gives you to help to memorize the inputs and outputs are highly useless.

That provides a linear flow through the project lifecycle, which is how I work. This book (and the less complete ISBN 0782141064) are both based on how the exam is structured, rather than on the PMBOK Guide's structure. While this organization can be confusing to beginning project managers, PMI repeats over and over that these processes all connect, overlap and interact with each other. The PMBOK Guide was originally written by a bunch of engineers who really liked the idea of feedback loops and they understood that these processes happen simultaneously. So, in order to pass the exam, you have to think along the timeline of the project lifecycle as well as the Knowledge Areas. Otherwise, you'd miss every question \\"what do you do first?\\"1. The familiar For Dummies icons make it easy to spot important information.2. The answers are the most complete of any of the cert books. The questions are well thought out and representative of what is on the exam.3. The CD has a study schedule (Microsoft Project template file) that provides a detailed roadmap to keep you on track.

I had just completed an online PMP course and was waiting to take the exam itself. In the terminology of PM, the book is of (somewhat) high grade and (extremely) low quality. It is seriously flawed both technically and literarily but its approach of taking the PM process linearly through making a movie and taking the PMP test is refreshing -- although not totally effective. Many of the movie examples were interesting and vividly demonstrated the PM principle.However, it is riddled with factual errors and is an utter disaster in terms of its editing. As a project, the book demonstrates very bad PM technique -- and should be deemed a failure. The authors obviously failed in the PM Quality and Control processes. Why should anyone take the advice of PM's who fail so badly in THEIR OWN literary work? Is this the PMI way of Project Management?For those who say these errors don't matter, will you accept this level of error in the projects you manage? [Shudder!] I would suggest that if the material which I know about is inaccurate it calls into question the accuracy of the material I don't know! What level of 'error' is acceptible? PM is still more art than science, full of ambiguity, with many techniques extant, but the book often disagrees with other PM training, and not infrequently with the PMBOK 'bible' itself.Typos, misspellings, and serious grammatical errors abound! The editor (if there was one!) really, really blew it! I can't believe anyone checked the proofs! There are many places where a correction was attempted but the 'wrong' text was left intact (like following the period!). There are references to non-existent figures and figures that are never referenced. It is also somewhat 'convoluted' in terms of its organization and logical progression. All of these should certainly have been on the project's 'activity list'.The math is absurd -- and often wrong. Many equations substitute the summation (sigma) symbol for division and a lack of parenthesis or other groupings make the associations incorrect. The book often confuses 'standard deviation' and 'variance'. If you don't know the formulas beforehand, this book won't help you! And if you rely on these, you'll get the answer wrong!I never did find a useful arrangement for the wall chart. It appeared to be organized randomly and there was no good way to tape it together to get other than a 'spaghetti' view of process interactions, although the 'spaghetti' did help clarify some relationships.The sample test/CD -- the real reason I bought the book -- is almost unusable in that many (most!?) of the questions have serious typos, syntax, semantic, or editing errors which renders them ridiculous. Some questions have no answers, or the answer given is incorrect. Some answers make no sense in context, for example, using 'not' in the question when all answers would require 'is'. The auxiliary images and charts could not be displayed.The situation improved slightly with the errata file from the Wiley Website, but that introduced another set of bugs, different typos, and still didn't display the correct auxiliaries. I finally printed the image files!Based on my PMP test (which I passed), the book's sample questions are simply weird and bear little relationship to the test I took. My questions were straight forward and much less subtle than the samples. The book was trying to be 'clever' if not comical with its questions. It was not particularly successful. Since each PMP test is randomly generated from a master set, each test will differ. But I suspect only slightly.So why is there any redeeming value? Reading the book and taking the sample test allowed (encouraged!?) me to review my understanding of PM and PMBOK. Each time I discovered a supposed error, researching it made me dig deeper into the 'truth' and thus reinforced my knowledge. In that sense, the book is useful.... But you have to devote the time! By itself, the book is worthless -- except as a bad example.I assume that subsequent printings of the book will correct many of the most glaring errors, so if you plan to buy this book wait for the second printing."},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"I had the misfortune to pick this book off the shelf in my local [bookstore]because it was the only one in stock that claimed to help the reader prepare for the certification exam. I am no expert in project management, but even I can tell that the book is riddled with errors and inconsistencies. Explanations tend to be extremely dry and sometimes confusing, occasionally punctuated by amusing remarks like, \\"If you're ever forced to spend these funds, your project is in serious trouble, and you're likely to be thrown to some hungry alligators as a snack.\\" I was especially disgusted with the quick assessments and the prep tests that begin and end each chapter. The questions were highly ambiguous - more so than I would expect on the actual test. And instead of clarifying, in many cases the answers appeared to be totally capricious. In some places, the answers were just wrong. For example, in the prep test at the end of chapter 9 the reader is asked to calculate the numbers on a network diagram such as early start, late start, slack, etc. The algorithm given in the text says to start with day 0. But the answers given for the prep test assume that you start with day 1. Furthermore many of the earned value formulas given in the same chapter are truncated and use the symbol for sigma, instead of division ''.I could go on with a littany of errors, but I think I made my point. In my opinion, this book is worse than useless because it may confuse and misinform you. Do not use this book - even if somebody gives it to you for free!"},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"I bought this book to help facilitate a review course and found the practice exam at the back was loaded with mistakes on the formula-based questions. Not only typos, but just plain getting the concepts wrong (e.g., trying to calculate based on 1/2 of a standard deviation).I strongly recommend Rita Mulcahy's PMP Exam Prep instead: More expensive but very readable with good review questions.Another option is PMP Exam Cram 2, by David Frnacis and Greg Hornie."},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"The book is extremely easy to follow, but between the practice exam in the book and the one on CD, it is written extremely badly. In some cases, the explanation of the correct answer is inconsistent with the actual answer (e.g. the Correct answer is C - 50%; but in the explanation, they say \\"D\\" as the answer, but still say it's 50%). Additionally, there are tons of spelling errors in the CD practice exam. It's almost as if they were rushing to get this book on the market as soon as possible without really taking the time to complete a quality review. Lots of potential, but right now, I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"Studying PMP Cert For Dummies will help you pass the exam.My study group purchased all the books in the category that we can find. None of the books alone will guarantee that you pass the PMP exam. You need to purchase several books. All have gaps and omissions - especially Rita's. All have errors, both in grammar, spelling, and in the technical subject matter. Our ranking from worse to best: ESI's has the most amount of errors (worst), Newell's has next to worst, Kim's is next (her errata list is very long), For Dummies comes in the middle, Rita is better, and Crowe's has the least errors (best, but there are plenty of errors &amp; omissions). Get over the errors and omissions; all have them. In all books, you should easily spot an error. If you cannot spot an error, or are bothered about them, you are not ready to take the exam. Remember these books are review guides, not intro books! You should already know project management.PM is a young discipline and even the best authorities have conflicting notions about some definitions. Last fall in the official PMI magazine, the cover article was on a billion dollar construction project where the PM flubbed the formulas for EV. He switched numerator and denominator and got all the EV formulas wrong. He would have missed all test questions on EV. No one at PMI Publications caught the error either! Get over error issues. Be able to spot them without being an indignant whiner or you are not ready to take the exam. Enough said here.None of my study group felt that Rita's book was suitable to self-study. Rita's is a re-cycled workbook taken from her $1,100 training class. If you want to use her book, take her class instead and you get her $ 90 workbook and the $300 Question CD included. Most of the reviews comments are from people who have taken her course, where the omissions can be corrected. Rita's quality section is pretty skimpy and doesn't use charts well. She omits time value of money (PV, IRR) which are still on the exam (I check with PMI). (Kim includes these too; but Dummies explains it better.) For example, Rita and Kim mistakenly refer to process groups as phases of a project. Controlling is a phase? Nope, as Dummies points out, it's a \`process'. That why PMBOK Guide calls them \\"Process Groups\\".Kim's CD has 200 questions; For Dummies CD has 300 questions. Rita has no CD in her book, her question CD is $300 extra. Newell and Crowe don't even include a CD. For Dummies is the best value just for the questions alone!All other PM books are very dry and hard to read. For Dummies is the friendliest and the easiest to spot what is important and where you need to pay attention. They spoon feed you the formulas - ones other books omit. I have several other Dummies Cert books and they are different from the general interest Dummies books. They are only interested in how to pass the exam."},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"I feel so strongly that this is my first Amazon review. Of all the PMP review books, this For Dummies book helps you think like a PMP. It breaks down what's important and shows you how to under patterns in the questions.

By the time you finish For Dummies, you'll be ready for passing the exam on your only try.Here's why everyone in my study group thinks this is the best book on the category.Most questions on the CDBest explainations of questionsBest charts &amp; illustrationsBest insider tips &amp; warningsBest method of matching up patterns of questionsBest chapter on formulasOverall best value for your time and money"},{"Title":"PMP Certification for Dummies","review":"I was recommended this book by some folks in my local PMI chapter. Based on that recommendation, I was hoping for a more accurate book on the test. This book does a good job of positioning the PMP lifecycle in a logical flow of information. I also thought that the information on the new ethical component of the test was very useful.Other reviews of this book already mention the large number of errors and ommissions, which really do detract from the overall experience -- assuming that this book would be used in a stand alone situation. If you were only going to buy one study guide, this is not the book to purchase. However, if you are looking at an addition to the study process (in addition to the Kim Heldman book for instance) along with the PMBOK -- then this is a great book to fill in some of the holes.As with any study guide, the questions &amp; answers reference you back to the specific sections of the PMBOK. Even in the cases where there are errors, you will still be referenced to the PMBOK which will give you the &quot;official&quot; correct answer.The format is familiar and the book adds value.

I found the text in this guide very irritating and distracting for a number of reasons, not the least of which was because it didn't really corelate with the PMBOK.After giving up on the text, I hoped that I could at least use the practice tests on the CDROM that comes with it in order to get some simulated computer testing experience.

It was so outstanding, true to life, so full of authentic details about procedures, etc., that I felt the author must have had considerable experience working for an American intelligence agency, either the CIA or its predecessor, the OSS. I hoped the author had written other books, but could not find any. I tried to find out something about Mr Maxfield, but ran into a brick wall; it was as if he had disappeared.The story is excellent; Mr Slater is given an assignment in Europe to locate a missing American embassy employee. It goes from there through many twists and turns; many characters become involved, some friendly, some unfriendly. I don't want to give much away in this review, but I can say that in this story things are seldom what they seem. The craft of field work is presented in a most realistic way, and Slater's problems with the home office are true to life; there are no James Bond gadgets or super-human antics. This is a realistic, down to earth spy story that will grab the reader and once it is finished I predict that most readers will return to this story again. The character development is outstanding; the reader gets to know the characters and to feel their pain and successes. I obtained a used paperback of the book some years ago (it was out of print for a long period), and have reread it every four or five years. Also I occasionally checked for Mr. Maxfield on the internet when I thought of it, all to no avail until very recently. It turns out that he had written a number of other novels, but were unpublished until a year or so ago. I have purchased all of them from Amazon, and have not been disappointed. Also it was disclosed that Mr Maxfield was indeed a CIA employee as I suspected, as well as a flying officer of the U.S. Army Air Corps who saw action in the European Theatre in WWII; his wartime experiences undoubtedly formed the basis for one of his other outstanding novels.I recommend this novel to all who have an interest in intelligence gathering and field work, put in context with the human cost required in carrying out such missions. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Cerberus: Wolf in Fold","review":"The conceit of the Four Lords of the Diamond Series is that the Earth (and corresponding colonies) are ruled by a society which has everything regimented and controlled. Malcontents and criminals are sent to a planetary system infested by a virus which has different forms on each of the four planets, but which has in common on all that you cannot live without the virus in your system once you have been exposed.In this second book, an agent is sent to assassinate the Lord of the second planet, Cerberus. On Cerberus, you can change bodies with others at will.Like virtually every other Chalker book and series, the Four Lords series is concerned with issues of gender, sexuality and identity. In this book it is not irritating nor distracting from the plot. This is one of Chalker's better outings, I believe."},{"Title":"Cerberus: Wolf in Fold","review":"This book is #2 of the series I recommend that you read them in order (at least the first an last book) The series are amazing and this book is very good"},{"Title":"Vegan Feasts","review":"I've tried several recipes out of this book and have been very disappointed with the results. The 'Broccoli and almond quiche' is very oily and doesn't taste that great. The 'Lentil loaf' is just awful. The 'Couscous with chickpea stew' is okay, but doesn't give enough reason to buy this book.This book contains a lot of oily, deep-fry, margarine and sugar recipes.

A quality vegan recipe book is important for those of us who don't use products from animals and who want diversity in our meals. Rose Elliot dispels many of the myths commonly associated with vegetarian and vegan diets. At the beginning of her book, Elliot deals with misconceptions that much of society has concerning protein, iron, calcium and vitamin B12. After putting the reader's mind to rest concerning these items, Elliot briefly states some of the benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets. The book has a variety of nutritious recipes in the following sections: Soups; Dips; Sandwiches and Bread-based Snacks; Salads, Dressings and Appetizers; Sauces; Pastry Dishes; Pasta Dishes; Legume Dishes; Grain and Nut Dishes; Potato Dishes; Desserts; and Scones, Cakes and Cookies.As with her book Vegetarian Christmas, Elliot's recipes are easy to prepare and sound delicious. Each recipe includes the number of servings it makes and many recipes include variations. A few of the recipes that I'm looking forward to trying are: Lentil Loaf, Stuffed Nut Roast, Instant Vegan Raspberry Ice, Christmas (plum) Pudding, Spring Rolls with Dipping Sauce, and Bread Sauce.Vegan Feasts is an excellent recipe book that will be a significant addition to any vegetarian's or vegan's cookbook library! -Reviewed by N. Glenn Perrett"},{"Title":"Vegan Feasts","review":"The thing that makes this book worth having is the dessert section. I haven't made many of the savory recipies as I can manage without a recipie book for those, the thing I think every vegan needs help on is puddings and sweet things. As a vegan I really miss things like 'steamed suryp pudding' and 'chocolate cheese cake' and 'rum truffles' - untill now. This book is great because it doesn't assume that because you're vegan you only want to eat low fat carob things, it gives great recipies using proper chocolate, vegan buiscits and vegan cream. This is heaven for those of you who really miss dairy desserts - you need never go without treats again!!"},{"Title":"Crude Dominance","review":"Excellent story development. I would like to know of any other books this author has written since I like his style. Thank you"},{"Title":"Paris, 2nd (City Guides - Cadogan)","review":"By Bill Marsano. If you were to go to a really well-stocked bookstore and start counting the guidebooks devoted to Paris, there's a fair chance you wouldn't finish on the same day you started. Paris is like the Battle of Gettysburg: Everyone wants to write about it and almost everyone does. (Some more than once.) So while you might consider yourself spoiled for choice, it's more likely that you'll be overwhelmed and baffled.I can help you out here because I'm almost uniquely qualified to judge. I've used guides, written for guides and even sold guides in a travel bookstore. And from that I conclude that this is the best guide to Paris available, bar none.Dana Facaros and Michael Pauls have written literally dozens of guides; I first came to know their work in Italy two decades ago. They lived there at the time just as they are now writing guides to France and live there too. It's fair to say that from depth of experience and local perspective, they can't be beat. They are not quick in-and-outers dependent on what the local tourist office is pushing.Their Paris book has all you'd expect from any decent competitor, of which there are plenty: details and overviews of nightlife, sports, parks, hotels, transport, restaurants, museums, walking tours, festivals, flea markets, shopping. All that and more. What sets it apart--far apart--is the quality and freshness of the writing, which is informed, stylish and witty (the historical notes are especially fine and a delight to read). The reader truly feels guided by this book--taken in hand by an expert (two of them in this case) and given the key to the city. This is a genuinely sophisticated approach to the City of Light. A triomphe, in fact.If you're going to Paris for a week or more, you may very well wish to embark upon a daytrip beyond the city. For that you must buy \\"An Hour from Paris,\\" by Annabel Simms (a Brit long resident in Paris). She's a perfect companion to Facaros and Pauls, and almost their equal as a writer. She lists 20 splendid daytrips, most of them little known, all available by public transport, and none more than an hour away.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning travel writer and editor."},{"Title":"Paris, 2nd (City Guides - Cadogan)","review":"After using several other Paris guides for the past 10 years, this one seems to have hit the mark. It will help on our trip in June 2013.New without cracked spine or torn/dog-earred pages, the book nonetheless had several stickers on the front and back, and it took almost 3 weeks to arrive without expedited shipping. Otherwise it would have been a 5.0."},{"Title":"American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States (Galaxy Books)","review":"I am taking a course in church history and this is the book we are currently using. I find that the text gives a good view of what catholic have had to face here in the US. It begins in Colonial times and goes into the 20th century (the book was written in 1981).However, alot of topics are given a brief look with some names and dates mentioned, but no real detail. This makes the book boring at times and it would really be bad if my instructer didn't explain things more in class. This is a real good glance at the Church and I would recommend it along with a book that gives much more detail. The American Catholic Experience by jay Nolan would be a good bet."},{"Title":"American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States (Galaxy Books)","review":"This book is a great resource for names, dates, places & fairly brief descriptions of events in American Catholic history. At times it is like browsing a phone book because the descriptions, analysis, summaries etc are so brief. Some pages have literally a dozen or more references. So my guess is this book is best suited for academics who want a good source for this kind of info.For a more accessible history (for interested readers vs. academics) of Catholics in USA I'd also recommend the \\"American Catholic Experience\\" by J.Dolan"},{"Title":"Love Takes Wing (Love Comes Softly Series #7)","review":"Belinda is featured in this seventh book of the series. Her brother, Dr. Luke has trained her well and she is working full time as his nurse.

After the critical period, Belinda then becomes a private duty nurse in their small town.Meanwhile, she has seen her 2 best friends and nieces Melissa and Amy Jo marry and move out west. Nursing has consumed so much of her time that she has hardly realized that life is passing and she does becomes aware of TWO possible suitors at the same, exact time - Jackson has returned as a Doctor and joins Luke's practice. Rand is an up and coming builder who has plans for a home for Belinda and himself. An offer to accompany the rich old woman to her home in Boston removes Belinda from the predicament of 2 suitors and no real love on her part.Not only does she accompany, but she stays on at the Boston mansion of her employer. Never has she seen or even dreamed of such finery but she does learn to adjust. &quot;Aunt Virgie&quot; thinks of Belinda more as a daughter than a nurse which causes no small stir among the other household help. Matters are complicated even more when the old woman's grandson Peter comes to America for a visit. Will a friendship or romance develop between the two young people? Aunt Virginia hopes so, to keep her beloved Peter nearby.Belinda travels abroad with her employer, and even though she is experiencing once in a lifetime events, she is empty and dissatisfied inside. Has she traded her peace of mind in a tiny prairie town for a life of luxury and discontentment?I am excited to begin book eight in this series, Love Finds a Home."},{"Title":"Love Takes Wing (Love Comes Softly Series #7)","review":"I would recommend this book wholeheartedly. One word of advice though if you have decided to read the book after seeing the series on the Hallmark Channel,like I did, it might take a little bit to figure out where you are until you get a little further into it. Just keep reading you will come to a point in the book that will make the reading seem to match up where the series left off. I would suggest having book 8 and the Prairie Legacy series on hand because once you start reading you will not want to put the books down. If you are wondering if you should start with book 1 rather than starting with book 7 I would suggest that only because they are a great read and they grab your attention making you feel like you are actually there living each situation with the characters."},{"Title":"Love Takes Wing (Love Comes Softly Series #7)","review":"The continuing saga of Clark and Marty finds Belinda, their youngest child, traveling to faraway Boston as a private nurse.

First, the Davis family have their first family rift in regard to Abe's arm injury. The rift lays heavy on Clark and Marty's heart. Family gatherings are tense. I think this builds reality in the storyline as families are always going to be divisional / disagreeable, and you seek help for family unity. The second plot occurs when Virginia Stafford-Smyth arrives as a patient with a stroke and resides several months in the Davis' small prairie town. Belinda's nursing care to Ms. Stafford-Smyth leads to new adventures in Belinda's life -- east to Boston and even across the ocean -- into such a busy lifestyle that Belinda was not including God in her life.

As Clausewitz himself stated, he wrote a \\"collection of materials from which a theory of war was to have been distilled.\\" Professor Howard, the co-author of the standard English translation of Clausewitz, begins that distillation process in these few pages.He first places Clausewitz in context, with a review of his family origins and military experience. He was commissioned as an officer in the Prussian Army at the age of 12, fought in his first campaign in 1793 at the age of 13 against the forces of Revolutionary France on the Rhine and then in the Vosges. In 1806 he was captured following the French defeat of Prussian forces at Auerstadt, a subsidiary of Napoleon's great victory over the Prussians at Jena. He then spent two years in captivity as a prisoner of war in France. When later the Prussian king allied himself with Napoleon, Clausewitz resigned from the Prussian Army and joined the Russian Army, where he participated in the Russian victory over Napoleon at Borodino. When the Prussian King, Frederick William III, eventually joined the Alliance against Napoleon in 1813, Clausewitz became an advisor to General Blucher during the Leipzig campaign, though still in Russian uniform. After being allowed by the King to rejoin the Prussian Army he became chief of staff to the Prussian III Corps, which acted as a blocking force at Waterloo. He then spent 12 years at the Prussian Army War College, where he spent much of his time writing his most famous work, On War. He died in 1831, at the age of 51, in a cholera epidemic in Breslau, where he had been sent to institute a cordon sanitaire to prevent the disease from spreading.Clausewitz' ideas were formed in the cauldron of the transition from formalized 18th century warfare to the total war of the French Revolution and Napoleonic era. The successive Prussian defeats had a profound effect on him, stimulating a rethinking of the theory of warfare as it evolved in his lifetime. There is much debate about how much of his work applies only to the particular circumstances of his era and how much is applicable to warfare in general.He is frequently contradictory and ambiguous, which is not surprising, given the extreme complexity of the human social phenomenon he is attempting to analyze. These are a few of his better-known concepts:- the FRICTION of war (now often called the \\"FOG of war\\")- successful warfare always involves a FIGHT, although paradoxically, an \\"unfought fight\\", such as the nuclear exchange that didn't happen during the Cold War, can have as much effect as an actual fight- the necessity of attacking the enemy's CENTER- the power of the DEFENSE- the necessity of SUPERIOR FORCE for VICTORY- the importance of MORALE- the concept of WAR AS AN EXTENSION OF POLITICSProf. Howard provides a good summary of the way Clausewitz influenced the ideas and operations of the great wars of the 20th century - WWI, WWII, and the Cold War - and gives guidance for further study. He recommends in particular three books:Peter Paret - \\"Clausewitz and the State\\"Azar Gat - \\"The Origins of Military Thought from theEnlightenment to Clausewitz\\"Raymond Aron - \\"Penser la guerre, Clausewitz\\"There is as yet no complete English translation of Clausewitz' works.Highly recommended as an introduction to the study of history's foremost philosopher of warfare."},{"Title":"Clausewitz: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Clausewitz is notoriously difficult for the novice to master -- some would argue that no one has ever entirely &quot;mastered&quot; Clausewitz. Be that as it may, a legion of frustrated amateur strategists can attest to the difficulty of picking up Clausewitz's &quot;On War&quot; and trying to read it through without a guide. In the &quot;Clausewitz&quot; volume in the Past Masters series, the novice as well as the experienced strategist can gain an introduction to the master's life, experiences, and writings that will make the first reading intelligible and that will serve as a quick review of Clausewitz's main concepts in a format that can easily be read in an evening.This is a book that should stand next to &quot;On War&quot; in every strategist's library."},{"Title":"Clausewitz: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Years ago, I read a book entitled \\"On Strategy: a Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War.\\" The author, Col. Harry Sumner, relied heavily on Clausewitz in critiquing the US effort in that war. Having been led by other military historians to believe that Clausewitz was more or less clueless about strategy, I was somewhat taken aback by Sumner's heavy reliance on Clausewitz.Then came Desert Storm, and even my untutored eye could see that the US military had taken the teachings of \\"On Strategy\\" to heart. One could say that the US victory in Desert Storm was essentially \\"Clausewitzian\\". Maybe Clausewitz had been getting some undeserved bad press.\\"Clausewitz: a Very Short Introduction\\" rehabilitates the Prussian officer's reputation, giving his biography and distilling his thought into a manageable amount of reading. Clausewitz was no armchair theoretician. He was a professional soldier who saw extensive combat during the Napoleonic Wars, and he knew what he was talking about. He may even be the first author to recognize Murphy's Law. He called it \\"friction,\\" and he wrote that it plagued every sort of military endeavor.For those of us who are unwilling to grapple with the unabridged Clausewitz, this little book is just what the general ordered."},{"Title":"Clausewitz: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Reading \\"On War\\" is a long, hard slog that I have yet to complete. For military professionals as well as those who seek to direct policy and need to quickly get the goodness out of Clausewitz, this is an excellent primer.I'm a fan of the Very Short Introduction series, the credibility of which lies with the academic achievement of its authors. However, the quality of writing can sometimes lean towards the dry, verbose style that characterizes much writing in the ivory tower. Michael Howard shines compared to his peers. Though his style is very English (lots of \\"indeeds\\" and so on) to my American ears, it is still clear and concise. See also his excellent VSI contribution:The First World War: A Very Short Introduction.One quibble: the index is near useless. All the names of people, places, and events are there, but missing is any reference to some of the key clausewitzian concepts that endure e.g., friction, centers...d'oh!...centres of gravity and so on.Overall, very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Clausewitz: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This is an excellent brief overview of Clausewitz and his incomplete theory of war (cholera took him before he could edit On War and his wife published his notes as one volume).

It is amazing how much insight and illumination he packs into so small a book. Well worth reading as a model for a compact biography as much as for its enlightening treatment of changing ideas about war and the man who helped to change those ideas as much as anyone in history."},{"Title":"Clausewitz: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Given that the goal of this book is to impart upon the reading a sense of understanding and knowledge about basic ideas of military theorist von Clausewitz, I can only say that this book hit its mark in brilliant fashion.Short, concise, yet filled to the brim with information. I particularly enjoyed how author Mr. Howard set a chapter on \\"Clausewitz in his time\\" wherein we see the thinking of the day, the atmosphere in which Clausewitz 'thought,' and so forth. This really set the basis for which one can understand Clausewitz further. I also liked the chapter on the legacy of Clausewitz in which Mr. Howard presents various criticisms of Clausewitz's ideas, and then proceeds to counter them.Overall a must read for all those who are interested in understanding military endeavors- historical or current- which, if you are reading this, then it's safe to say you are in fact interested. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"When the Market Moves, Will You Be Ready?","review":"Though the title of this book leads one to take it as the sequel to the author's first book &quot;If it's raining in Brazil, buy Starbucks&quot;, it is quite different from it coz &quot;if&quot; is more like an &quot;if then if then&quot; excercise/reminder for relatively veteran investors, whilst this book is more like a beginner's guide to the author's concept of &quot;Macrowave Investing&quot;, essence of which can be described by its three golden rules and four stages:-R1. Buy strong stocks in strong sectors in an upward-trending marketR2. Short weak stocks in weak sectors in a downward-trending marketR3. Stay out of the market and in cash when there is no definable trend.S1. Diagnose and prognose on corporate earnings news, flow of macroeconomic data, conduct of fiscal and monetary policy of govt, and exogenous shocks like wars and rain in Brazil, the so called four dynamic factors.S2. Determine broad market and individual sector trends wrt business cycle, stock market cycle and interest rate cycle.S3. Screen individual stock thru fundamental and technical analysis.S4. Uses risk/money/trade management toolsThe author said that this book is for all. As a professional trader, I believe that it is much more suitable for amateur long term stock investors who favors fundamental analysis. The coverage on S1 and S2 are brilliant, but not for S3 and S4. Serious investors should read some books else to compliment the inadequacies on TA and risk/money management.In short, a good book. The Q&A; and resource reference in the end of each chapter is very helpful. A value buy!"},{"Title":"When the Market Moves, Will You Be Ready?","review":"Professor Peter Navarro teaches at the University of California (Irvine) and has written an interesting workbook on the \\"macro-investing\\" method. It focuses on getting a handle on the big picture.As a teacher, Navarro firmly believes that learning involves not only reading material, but also understanding it which can be assessed by using pertinent questions and exercises. That is why he places questions and exercises after each of his 20 chapters, and provides the answers in a separate 25-page section at the end of the book. This is an excellent reinforcement approach which more books should follow, especially those that are more dense.Navarro puts forth his three key macro-investing rules:1. buy strong stocks in strong sectors in markets2. short weak stocks in weak sectors in declining markets3. stay in cash in a trendless marketHe warns investors that even buying the best stock in the wrong sector in a down market is suicide. According to Navarro, eighty percent of investors lost one-half of their money in the 2000-2002 bear market. Therefore, he urges investors to be on the lookout for macro-economic events, what he refers to as \\"macrowaves\\" that precede market action. These include such items as government reports on inflation, employment, growth, Fed policy changes, and large company earnings. He believes this news drives markets up and down.In multiple chapters, Navarro explains the four steps of macrowave investing and the three key cycles (business, interest rate, and stock market) and which stock sectors would be best to invest in during each aspect of the cycles.One chapter explains the yield curve and how to use it to understand the changes in stocks can bonds. He then reviews the basics in selecting strong and weak stocks, as well as the basics of fundamental and technical analysis in back-to-back chapters. Additional chapters are devoted to risk management, money management, trade management, and execution.Overall, Navarro has delivered a solid primer on preparing yourself for trading the market's large moves. The logical step-by-step approach is easy to follow and will provide investors with a good understanding of the markets, and hopefully will result in better investment results."},{"Title":"When the Market Moves, Will You Be Ready?","review":"Very well written, clear, and concise book on the market, emphasizing using both fundamental value and technical chart analysis to play the market. Perhaps the most important point made in the book is the author pointing out that one must pick strong stocks in strong sectors in order to be really successful. This tip might be worth the price of the book by itself, since 3 out of 4 stocks will ultimately follow the broad market anyway. (You can get that sector strength information from the Investor's Business Daily paper or the paid version of the website, but you'll have to pay the premium subscription price to get it).One other extremely interesting section is where the author shows that buying stocks during the cold months and selling them during the warm months of the year can produce almost twice the gains of holding them throughout the year. This strategy tested out as valid in the American market going back several decades and incredibly was valid in the British market going back to 1694. The basic point is that holding stocks from October to April resulted in an average return of about 12%, whereas holding them throughout the year resulted in a performance of almost half that, because stocks often declined during the warmer months. Again, that little tidbit of advice might be worth the price of the book by itself, and is reminiscent of the strategy of buying the index and going long when the stock market crosses its 200-day moving average on the upside, and shorting it when it crosses the 200-day moving average on the downside, which has produced an average return of 17%. I've looked at dozens of simple and complex strategies but I hadn't heard of this sort of seasonal strategy before and was very interested to find that out, and may give it a try myself. So overall, a fine book on the market that should be useful to the beginning as well as more experienced investor and trader."},{"Title":"When the Market Moves, Will You Be Ready?","review":"In this book, the author takes a top-down approach to investing. He combined macro economic factors with fundamental/technical approach to the market. In many ways, this book reminds me of Martin Zweig's Winning on Wall Street, which in my eyes is one of the greatest investing books ever published. This book gave me a great number of possible ideas I can use to develop potential models from, and for that it is well worth the purchase price, even if none of them pan out."},{"Title":"When the Market Moves, Will You Be Ready?","review":"Navarro's book is just excellent. He is a very good writer and an educator and knows how people learn. When you read this book you will want to keep your highlighter handy. He uses a very logical flow of concepts and supports them with good information. Of the over 200 stock market and investment books I've read over the past few years, this one is one of the best and you will go away saying...that really makes sense. This book easily stands on its own, so if you haven't read his If it is Raining in Brazil, don't worry about it. Just give it a read and you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"When the Market Moves, Will You Be Ready?","review":"A great 'workbook' to build a solid foundation on for investing. The exercises at the end of each chapter as well as the suggested links and reference books are the reason why I feel confident entering the market today.

Even better when you also listen to Navarro's 8 CDs on the same topic."},{"Title":"The Laugh We Make When We Fall","review":"First and foremost, this very interesting book of poems by Professor Susan Firer, which won the 2001 Backwaters Prize, is divided into four sections: Proem, Peonies, Blacklights, and Ghost Poets. By virtue of the title, The Laugh We Make When We Fall, one should obtain a new realization regarding life as expressed by such words. Who would laugh upon falling? Normally, there is a cry of pain and something in the line of agony is uttered from the lips. Unless one is in a playful mood where laughter is being enjoyed, one would expect to share such joy upon falling; however, that may not be the case. Most of the time pain is associated with falling, or a cry of despair normally comes from the lips.Secondly, this book of poems has a new perspective on life to share. It espouses the concept from the title alone that we ought not to stay down upon falling. As humankind we are resilient people who are expected to get up, shake off the dust, and get right back into the game. The act of crying my only last a short moment internally or externally; however, we are expected to drive on with life, enjoy the process, do the best we can, and achieve the utmost. Furthermore, at the same time we should be able to show others that we are capable of enlightening many while we are falling and getting back upon our feet. This is the essence of The Laugh We Make When We Fall. Can you do it? The answer should be in the affirmative!Next, the introductory poem \\"Permission Slips\\" has a lot to offer about life. One could look at this poem and equate it with the singing of the sparrows; the beautiful sunflower reflecting golden memories; a night in Venice floating on a Gondola; and cheerleaders determined to make this performance the best yet while dancing with the hula hoop. Wow! This is just a whole lot of energy and lots of fun to read about. What a wonderful way to start this book and it gets even better upon turning the pages.Some of the most memorable times we have lived were during our youthful days. The love of mom and dad, the sheltering of their wings, and the warmth of their loving arms protecting us through life bring refreshing memories. The poem \\"Every Thing A While\\" brings back such wonderful experience. For example, imagine the days of sea butterflies, contraception museums, tootsie roll pops, movie popcorn, wish bones, zafu crescents and other great stuff just oozing from the memory bank of wonderful words. In some ways, such wonders of life have diminished when we transitioned to adulthood. Now when we fall our parents may not be there to pick us up, kiss our knees, elbows or forehead. We have to make our own music. As a result, we learn how to sing and laugh while falling, and getting back up to drive on with the expectation of achieving.Additionally, the poem \\"Phonies\\" has such a wonderful fragrance stimulating the senses. This is the kind of poem where one has to relax and enjoy the essence of the theme. Just imagine the art of a holy-trinity peony buds; the double-flowered Longfellow peonies; ruffled silk slippers with peonies; unfurled dropping petals; and above all, rubbing a peony petal between the thumb and index finger; thus, experiencing a feeling smoother than magnolia and sweeter that yellow cake, just like a fragrance flower whispering sweet songs in the ear. This is such a wonderful experience to touch, see, smell, as the senses are aroused from the turning of the pages.Furthermore, the poem \\"All Souls' Day\\" is truly packed with reverence. The comparative analysis of All Souls' Day with Corpus Christi, Ascension Day or Trinity Sunday should leave you thinking holiness. The essence of the pure eye of God as a golden sunray should move the reader. Additionally, one is able to relax with some Motown remembrances. Reading the words regarding the Supremes and Martha Reeves and The Vandellas is memorable and moving. I have listened to their spiritual recordings, and believe me they certainly hit those high notes a Pipe Organ would have to stretch to reach. After kneeling, praying, and being blessed with incense and candles, the saints in this poem should be ready for a heavenly trip with this book.In conclusion, the symbology of water is cleansing to the soul of many as in the poem \\"Opening The Rain.\\" Additionally, one is able to feel the soothing touch of water in the poem \\"Bathing With Birds.\\" The combining of water and the singing of birds together as an entity, should give the soul a moving sensation. Additionally, a fragrance bunch of lilacs in the poem \\"Lilacs\\" should extend such rhapsody to another level. What an inspiring book of poems and uplifting thoughts awaiting the soul to experience in this volume. One must read it to appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Laugh We Make When We Fall","review":"Susan Firer's wording and imagry present in her poetry light up the subjects of her work and assaults your mind with delightful arrangement and depth. She is truley one of the greatest poets alive today."},{"Title":"Beyond the Brain: Birth, Death, and Transendence in Psychotherapy (Suny Series in Transpersonal & Humanistic Psychology)","review":"BEYOND THE BRAIN presents the distilled essence of the lifework of Stanislav Grof, M.D.: the insights and conclusions he has come to as a result of his seventeen years as apioneering LSD psychotherapist.The opening chapter explores the convergence of modern physics with ancient mysticism, and the resulting radical implications for human psychology, thus setting the stage for the rest of the book.Chapter two, \\"Dimensions of the Human Psyche: Cartography of Inner Space,\\" describes the stages a person passes through when undergoing a series of low-dose psychedelic therapy sessions; these stages correspond to increasingly deeper layers of the psyche.During the first few therapy sessions, one relives childhood traumas. Subsequent sessions gradually deepen into a reliving of one's birth, and a confrontation with death. After many such death-rebirth sessions, one experiences the final ego death: a profound psychospiritual annihilation, followed by visions of blinding white supernatural light, with feelings of ecstasy and rebirth. All subsequent psychedelic sessions are transpersonal: embryonic memories, encountering deceased relatives, ESP episodes, etc.These three levels of the psyche, as revealed by LSD psychotherapy--biographical, death-rebirth, and transpersonal--provide a working model of the psyche.Chapter three, \\"The World of Psychotherapy: Towards an Integration of Approaches,\\" describes and critiques about a dozen major schools of psychotherapy from Freud, Adler, and Jung through Maslow and the modern experiential therapies of gestalt, primal scream, and bodywork. Grof feels that each is talking about a different level of the psyche: Freud deals with events occurring since birth, Reich and Rank describe the birth trauma, while Jung and Maslow focus on the transpersonal/spiritual dimension. The author integrates all into a coherent whole: while acknowledging childhood influences, he sees the trauma of birth as primary; he also recognizes the profound healing potential of ecstatic mystical/peak experiences.Chapter four, \\"The Architecture of Emotional Disorders,\\" is for me the core of the book. It examines how the birth trauma is the root cause of much psychopathology, from sexual dysfunctions and variations (impotence, sadomasochism, etc.), to extreme violence and aggression (such as serial murders), to neuroses (anxiety, depression, psychosomatic symptoms, and the like), to psychosis. Grof holds out hope of healing for all mental/emotional illness; even with psychosis, he has found that deliberately intensifying symptoms, using experiential or psychedelic therapy, leads to a radical breakthrough and positive resolution.Chapter five explains why the medical model is ineffective and inappropriate in psychiatry; rather than suppression of symptoms, the author has found that purposefully intensifying symptoms results in spontaneous, autonomous healing.In chapter six, the various mechanisms of healing are discussed, from abreaction and catharsis, to death-rebirth experiences and reliving fetal traumas, to direct mystical/peak experiences of the divine.Chapter seven describes hyperventilation therapy as well as other nondrug experiential therapies. It also outlines the basic principles of psychotherapy; Grof Feels that \\"the psychotherapeutic process is not the treatment of a disease, but an adventure of self-exploration and self-discovery....the client is the main protagonist with full responsibility. The therapist functions as a facilitator\\" (p. 375).The book concludes with an epilogue, a fascinating examination of how \\"in wars and revolutions nations act out a group fantasy of birth\\" (p. 423), as documented by psychohistorian Lloyd de Mause.Scattered throughout the book are three dozen or so illustrations, mostly from the author's and others' LSD psychotherapy sessions, which suitably enhance the text and help bring it to life.This book is not light reading, but to the intellectually curious, motivated layperson or psychotherapist, I believe it will yield its fruits and prove itself well worth reading.It has served as a guidebook on my own psychotherapeutic journey (involving legal, safe psychedelic therapy complemented by hyperventilation therapy), helping me understand what I am going through, and letting me know what to expect next; it has also helped me understand other people, including their religious fanaticism, sexual preferences, and even, with several persons, their psychotic symptoms.In conclusion, if I could have only one book in my library (beyond a dictionary and a Bible), BEYOND THE BRAIN: BIRTH, DEATH, AND TRANSCENDENCE IN PSYCHOTHERAPY would be that book.Other books by Stanislav Grof which I've enjoyed: THE ADVENTURE OF SELF-DISCOVERY, about the author's form of group hyperventilation therapy (which as therapeutic effects similar to psychedelic therapy); LSD PSYCHOTHERAPY, guidelines for psychedelic therapists; and STORMY SEARCH FOR THE SELF, written by Stanislav with his wife Christina, about difficult spontanious psychospiritual awakenings--such as triggered by mystical, near-death, or UFO experiences, and including Christinas's own kundalini/alcoholism crisis--which are often mis-diagnosed as psychosis, and yet have the potential for radical growth and healing."},{"Title":"Beyond the Brain: Birth, Death, and Transendence in Psychotherapy (Suny Series in Transpersonal & Humanistic Psychology)","review":"This book is the most marked up, beat up, and well-thumbed book I have. In my opinion, it's the most complete explanation and synthesis of all that has been studied and written about the philosophy of human existence and transformational psychology. It provides a big picture that clearly explains things no other book even approaches.Because of my severe clinical depression, I've gone through the normal route of countless anti-depressant drugs and psychiatrists. At the end of my rope, I decided that I am the only one who could help me. I turned to books and my own intellect for help, and in so doing I discovered many wonderful books, especially &quot;Meeting the Shadow: The Hidden Power of the Dark Side of Human Nature&quot; edited by Connie Zweig, &quot;The Psychology of Self-Esteem&quot; and &quot;The Disowned Self&quot; by Nathaniel Branden, &quot;Inner Work&quot; by Robert A. Johnson, and &quot;Life Between Life&quot; by Joel L. Whitton. In my opinion, though, Stanislav Grof's &quot;Beyond the Brain&quot; is the best book ever written for expanding one's consciousness so that we can see how far we can go toward discovering our awesome heritage as human beings and beyond. &quot;Beyond the Brain&quot; has been and still is a tremendous guide to my personal evolution.I also use Grof's &quot;The Holotropic Mind&quot; for my study."},{"Title":"Beyond the Brain: Birth, Death, and Transendence in Psychotherapy (Suny Series in Transpersonal & Humanistic Psychology)","review":"Read it in 1990 at the age of 29 and was not yet ready to be convinced. Reread it in 1999, older, humbler and still ailing, and found it to be a work so absorbing, so obviously true, that I became depressed at how entrenched medical orthodoxy has been and may continue to be. This book rethinks virtually all aspects of human maturation science, paying crucial attention to the simple observational facts of birthing and how they vary individual to individual in contributing to a staggering range of lasting psychopathologies. The result is one of the essential speculative works of the 20th century. It became the key to my own discovery of long harbored and misunderstood neuroses, and marked the beginning of a long campaign of recovery and personal transformation. This is a massive, clinically-worded text for the advanced psychology reader that testfies to the fact that events of lasting developmental significance happen to many people before the dawn of ego and conscious memory(age 3-4). If you've exhausted all other modern medical strategies for healing without finding whats wrong with you, and are ready to open the door to the huge new world waiting, this is the book. Grof is a caring, brave voice that always allows room for every imaginable personal particular. While it does not provide any firm mechanisms which relate transpersonal phenomena to the biochemical level of functioning, it poses many questions crucial to further investigation in the realm of pure consciousness. The one book by Grof that enters the deepest, most complete account of his thought."},{"Title":"Beyond the Brain: Birth, Death, and Transendence in Psychotherapy (Suny Series in Transpersonal & Humanistic Psychology)","review":"I first encountered Stanislav Grof in the late 'seventies at a seminar held in Pacific Grove, California. He was a featured speaker, and to say that I was impressed would be an understatement.In this book, he speaks of paradigms--the model of reality that scientists work within, accepting certain basic assumptions. He points out that the Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm (a system of thought based on the work of Isaac Newton and Rene Descartes) is still accepted and the orthodox foundation of precepts in use in psychiatry, psychology, anthropology and medicine. He points out that physics has moved on to a new paradigm: relativity and quantum theory and beyond, while the previously named sciences have languished, and opines that it is time for them to re-examine their fundamental belief structure as well.Grof said, at the seminar, that he was originally--in Czechoslovakia where he originated--a dyed-in-the-wool Freudian, until he began to perceive difficulties with that approach. He grew from there. He was one of the original medical investigators to used-lysergic acid diethylamide in serious psychiatric research, from which he derived some astonishing results.Grof was formerly Chief of Psychiatric Research at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He is no lightweight airhead, but rather is a highly qualified, credentialed and credible researcher. This and his other books are well worth your time, if you have the necessary vocabulary and the scientific background to benefit from them.Grof makes a bold argument that understanding of the perinatal and transpersonal levels changes much of how we view both mental illness and mental health. His research in transpersonal experience evokes serious questions into such areas as reincarnation and the spritual side of the human being.Joseph H.

I read this shortly after finishing Grof's book \\"LSD Psychotherapy\\", which I found to be an interesting, even excellent, read. \\"Beyond the Brain\\" certainly has exciting ideas in it, and is a strong attempt to look at the idea of consciousness in a new light. Grof has much to say about the Newtonian-Cartesian worldview, and makes plain its deficiencies in relation to our concept of the human mind. The book is well researched and covers a lot of ground. Much of what Grof writes about here relates to the field of physics, which he appears to have a firm grasp of.But, it's also long (400+ pages of text), verbose, and convoluted. A great deal of the book involves psychological/emotional issues, which Grof categorizes according to his concept of \\"COEX systems\\". He also discussed the COEX idea at some length in \\"LSD Psychotherapy\\", but I just can't buy into the COEX paradigm. As another reviewer pointed out, it pins most psychological issues directly to residual birth trauma.If you want a very complex, thought provoking read, this should be just the thing. But don't say you weren't warned."},{"Title":"Beyond the Brain: Birth, Death, and Transendence in Psychotherapy (Suny Series in Transpersonal & Humanistic Psychology)","review":"This book is a bit like a gold mine. There are plenty of nuggets there, but I also found a lot of gravel. I'm no psychotherapist, and I do buy into the concept of a holographic universe and transendental consciousness, which is heady stuff indeed, but the insistance that almost all psychological issues are tied in with birth trauma (perinatal matrices), and the constant references to LSD studies got a bit tiresome after a time. I found the summary of the major (historical) contributors to the field of psychotherapy excellent, and much food for thought in Grof's appoaches to mental &quot;illness&quot; (noting, that he seriously challenges the usual definitions of mental illness, and, indeed, mental wellness). For me the book was a bit of a plow, but definitely worth it for the nuggets."},{"Title":"Beyond the Brain: Birth, Death, and Transendence in Psychotherapy (Suny Series in Transpersonal & Humanistic Psychology)","review":"One has to read a lot of books to get the benefit of as much knowledge and understanding as the author has put into this one. It treats no less than five areas at the frontier of our intellect, and does so with academic skill, depth, and aplomb, a rare and worthy presentation indeed in today's world of slickly produced \\"overnight wonder books.\\"First, his review of where we are in this most comprehensive treatment of the scientific method and its contributions to our intellectual growth and development, may just be the most economical and coherent I have yet read. The same is true for his discussion of the other half of his thesis, the spiritual and psychological paradigms.Second, even though he points out the flaws, gaps, missteps, and weaknesses of the scientific method, he refuses to do what most academics \\"pushing a theoretical cause\\" usually do at this point: They make the flawed scientific method an excuse for allowing them to then proceed in an \\"anything goes\\" approach. That is, they make it an academic license to engage in intellectual anarchy. No, this author doe not do that: he tightens rather than relaxes his criteria of enquiry. Touche to him on this very important point.Third, he introduces a new expanded framework for a more wholistic approach to the scientific method that takes into account, sidesteps or goes around some of the existing flaws, gaps, and missteps. In particular, the ideas he suggests about how LSD should have been used as an analytic tool initially, still in my view should be implemented. The idea of a patient reporting to a therapist in real time, what is happening to him, is an idea whose time has come.Fourth, in a heroic and much needed effort, he expands the framework of Freudian Analysis so that it now incorporates the work of those kicked out of the Vienna family for their heretical views. And here I mean in particular the important work of Otto Rank, Wilhelm Reich, and Karl Jung just to mention the more important ones. The way he does it is novel, skillful and satisfies all the criteria one would expect of an expanded Freudian framework, one in which many of the things left out on the spiritual side, can now find a comfortable epistemological home.Fifth and finally, the author leads us up to the same frontier as the Quantum Physicists like Einstein and Bohm have taken us, coming to the same awesome conclusion: He does not flinch from the fact that in the end consciousness may be our only reality?As a reader who did have a singular LSD experience when I was in my 20s, I want to voice a mild disagreement with the author's bias towards the automatic view that there is always something spiritual involved in entering the expanded LSD reality. While many things happened to me, the most important and startling was the sheer increase in power of my brain. Without exaggeration it must have increased a hundred-fold.I had an exterior point of view just outside and above my normal body. I could attend to ten independent tracks of information simultaneously, including monitoring all of my internal body functions such as heart beats, blood flowing in my veins and arteries. I could even see my ideas as they formed and were being routed back and forth from memory, which I also could see from the beginning of my life (almost day-by-day) to the present. I could even monitor and evaluate the conversations of everybody in my space, quickly and quietly without them knowing. In an instance I had analyzed what they were thinking and why; what politics about our world is all about; solved a complex calculus problem which I had written down and brought along just for that purpose, etc., etc.Always what I determined that the normal world was about was \\"fear-based\\" nonsense. In fact the only epiphenomenon that stayed with me the longest was how utterly trivial the basis of all our human interactions at the lower level of existence seemed to be! Not once did any ideas of spirituality or God or any of that nonsense ever come to my mind. When I return to a normal state, the only question I had was: Why could we not reach this exterior, much more powerful state of brainpower except through the use of illegal drugs?This automatic bias towards spirituality, as if it is more than just a powerful metaphor is the only problem I had with the book.The author began as an Atheist and ends as a confirmed religionist, even though not one of the traditional Western variety. In fact, to his credit, he sees Western Religion as not being spiritual at all but being secular, political and ideological nonsense -- as my own experience tells me it most assuredly is. But even so, I think even in the Eastern version \\"spiritual\\" is little more a handy metaphor than it is an epistemological reality.Whether East or West, the proof of religion has to be in the pudding.

Her tantalizingly brief period of study in the conservatory of Carl Tausig ended by the master's untimely death, she sought other teachers, and succeeded in obtaining an introduction to Franz Liszt.

It's arguments completely integrate natural law (science) and spiritual law. (theology). Absolutely phenomenal."},{"Title":"Natural law in the spiritual world","review":"It should be stressed that this is not an attempt to use science to \\"prove\\" religious truths. Drummond, who was both an accomplished scientist and a Christian missionary in the late 19th Century, is clear in his rejection of all such attempts from his opening sentence onwards. Yet he also rejects the idea that there is an artificial division between the natural and the Spiritual. To him, there is no such thing as \\"the supernatural\\". The Spiritual is simply the continuation of the natural by other means, or, rather, the natural is a lower order of the Spiritual. He appears to accept Darwin's theory of evolution in its entirety, but gives it a Spiritual purpose by arguing that the ultimate product of evolution, and its objective, is the Spiritual man. This is a thesis worthy of serious consideration. Drummond develops it by showing how several orthodox Christian doctrines are consistent with patterns already observed in the natural world. In describing the natural world, he is scrupulously fair, relying not on any special Christian view but on the scientific consensus of his time, and going out of his way to show respect for the opinions of the celebrity agnostics of the era, Spencer and Huxley. Ironically, this proves to be the central weakness of the book. It is hardly Drummond's fault - he was writing on the basis of the best scientific evidence then available - but 19th Century science is now very dated and, in many vital aspects, has been proved to be wholly inaccurate. His attempt to reconcile his Christianity with contemporary scientific consensus fails not because Christianity has been proved wrong but because his contemporary scientific consensus has been proved wrong. Today's scientists should reflect on this and be careful to quote our current scientific consensus only with humility. It is also a warning to Christians not to try to \\"prove\\" religious truths using contemporary scientific consensus: if truths are truths, then they are eternal truths, and need no proof, but contemporary scientific consensus is sometimes less solid than it pretends. If faith tries to prop itself up on science, it is science which may prove the broken reed. A Christian with a strong scientific background might be better employed in taking up the challenge Drummond set himself and restating Drummond's thesis in the light of the scientific advances of the last century. Many sincere Christians see the doctrine of evolution as hostile to their faith, but Drummond sees it as illuminating the central truths of Christianity, and, by illuminating, supporting. This could be a profitable line of study for a Christian with roots in mainstream science."},{"Title":"Natural law in the spiritual world","review":"Since the mid-sixties I have had the book, Natural Law in the Spiritual World.

This book was not the typical western at all, and had characters quite unlike any I'd seen in westerns before, but I liked them, they were interesting, smart, and different. Wheeler knows the West very well, and has an excellent sense of history that comes through clearly in his writing.

Drawing on the work of Nobel laureate Amartya Sen (source of &quot;the capabilities approach&quot;) and her own Aristotelian social philosophy, Nussbaum takes a hard look at key debates about development, rejecting both free market fundamentalism and underexamined cultural relativism. Her universalist stance is controversial but courageous, a sincere effort to think through a political ethic in the wake of globalization. Not everyone will agree with Nussbaum, but she asks the right questions and lays out positions to be argued with."},{"Title":"Women and Human Development: The Capabilities Approach (The Seeley Lectures)","review":"Nussbaum's book is excellent reading for those with little background in philosophy or economics. She explains her important ideas about the goals of development very clearly. The point of development is to permit people to achieve a fully human functioning. What she writes might strike many readers as, well, just common sense.But this is far from the case. Nussbaum's claim that the point of development is to help people achieve a fully human functioning is actually very foreign to most standard theories of economics and economic development.Readers with a good background in economics and/or philosophy will find her book quite impressive. In fact the more you know about the relevant subjects the more you can see how good, original, and important her ideas are. She adroitly deals with many of the flaws of standard economics to present a thoughtful alternative vision of what it means to be developed.She also addresses long-standing debates involving those for--and against--postmodernist thought. She sneaks this in so that it is easy for many readers to miss that she is doing this. Although she accepts many of the charges made by postmodernists against modernist thinking, she explicitly rejects the pure egoistic subjectivity offered by postmodernism. Stated crudely, what Nussbaum offers is a dignified vision of what humans should be without invoking God or \\"objective reality.\\"Really good stuff. I've used this book for college undergraduates and many have praised this book highly and many had said they had their eyes opened to important issues they didn't think about before."},{"Title":"Women and Human Development: The Capabilities Approach (The Seeley Lectures)","review":"I recommend everyone read this book! Nussbaum, indebted to Aristotle, provides a solution to the problems of globalization that allows an individual to flourish, but do so in her own way--that is, she walks a very fine line between universalism (human flourishing) and relativism (respecting one's autonomy to pursue a particular way of life). Her theory has even been adopted by the United Nations Development Programme."},{"Title":"Women and Human Development: The Capabilities Approach (The Seeley Lectures)","review":"For anyone who has read Nussbaum's books on political issues, her latest is more of the same: the West has a moral obligation to rectify various wrongs suffered by women due to cultural/religious belief systems. All of this would be fascinating if Nussbaum would bother to first provide an argument stating why her thick conception of the Good must take precedence over those she dismisses out of hand. The irony here is that many of the things she points to as evil are the same things the British thought necessary to abolish when India was treated as a colony. Why, then, was imperialism bad then but perfectly okay now that self-styled leftists like comrade Nussbaum have decided its time their global vision of world socialism be forced on these other cultures? The problem for Nussbaum is that whatever hybrid version of political liberalism she wants to ascribe to has to be argued for -- it cannot simply be assumed. For instance, for Nussbaum the treatment of a woman in an islamic society might seem at odds with a Kantian notion of moral autonomy and the dignity of treating persons as ends in themselves. Consequently,if one adopts such a view of the moral life (and this ought to be argued for first), then such societies may seem morally undeveloped and thus harmful to their members. However, to a muslim observing the amount of autonomy people have in the West, the fact that our children are allowed certain kinds of entertainments, that women are displayed in advertisments in various stages of undress may indicate to them an equally appalling level of harm we allow our children and women to endure. In the end, the arguments go deeper than what Nussbaum provides since they go to questions concerning human nature, the Good, the status of Natural Rights, the role of Reason in ethical theories, and whether a teleological or deontological theory of morality best accords with the true nature of the good. These seem to be the questions most of Nussbaum's 'applied theory' begs."},{"Title":"The First World War (3): The Western Front 1917-1918 (Essential Histories)","review":"Peter Simkins, a former senior historian at the Imperial War Museum, picks up in this volume of Osprey's Essential Histories series where he left off at the end of 1916. As in the first volume, Simkins' narrative is clear and concise, but skewed with an Anglo-centric focus that downplays the participation of non-Englishmen on the Western Front.Rather than the standard section on &quot;background to war,&quot; Simkins begins this volume with a discussion of Allied and German strategic choices for 1917. Since this volume is a continuation of the first, the normal sections with background material on the warring sides and the political issues are omitted, which renders this volume less than ideal as a stand-alone. The author provides ten maps to support his narrative: the Western Front 1914-1918; the German withdrawal in 1917; the Battle of Arras; the Nivelle Offensive; the Third Battle of Ypres; Operation Michael; the end of Operation Michael; the German 1918 offensives; the Battle of Amiens; the final Allied offensives. As in the first volume, Simkins' Anglo-centric bias is evident in the maps, which primarily emphasize British offensives. The lack of any maps depicting the American St. Mihiel or Argonne offensives, or the Franco-American counterattack at Soissons are noteworthy omissions. Air operations are also slighted in this volume, as in the first.Simkins' narrative begins with the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line in March 1917, followed by the British offensive at Arras and the French Nivelle offensive. Simkins is honest that the Arras offensive represented a mixed bag, with the capture of Vimy Ridge to its credit, but balanced against the highest daily casualty rate of the war for the British. Simkins also notes that the British were slow to modify their tactics, e.g. using tanks in &quot;penny packets&quot; over bad terrain. Although the author notes that the British had &quot;ambiguous objectives and a faulty plan&quot; in describing the follow-up offensive that resulted in the Third Battle of Ypres, his discussion fails to convey the utter stupidity of that offensive. Indeed, throughout the text, Simkins defends the British BEF commander, General Douglas Haig, despite enormous evidence that Haig's bull-headedness caused unnecessary loss of life by maintaining an almost religious belief that &quot;one more push&quot; would gain a breakthrough at Ypres. Nor does Simkins ever discuss whether Haig's belief that a breakthrough at Ypres would prove decisive was really justified other than a few small channel ports, no major objectives were near Ypres).In covering the fighting in 1918, Simkins is honest about the defects in the British defenses that facilitated the initial German success in the spring offensives, although again he avoids mentioning mistakes made by higher British officers, i.e. Lieutenant General Gough. Simkins' coverage of the Allied efforts to blunt the German offensives is good, but he criticizes General Pershing's reluctance to send in the partly-trained American divisions piece-meal (failing to note that Pershing was planning for the long-term and that it was not his fault that the Allied front had virtually collapsed). It is also interesting that Simkins' map which depicts the final Allied offensive in September-November 1918 shows no French participation. American successes at St. Mihiel and in the Argonne are mentioned, but off to the side, as if they were sideshows. The crucial role played by the arrival of American forces in 1918 - often exaggerated by American authors - is minimized here. Simkins does fail to note that British forces held less of the front than either French or American troops at the end of the war.In the final sections, Simkins once again displays unabashed Anglo-centrism with his &quot;portrait of a soldier&quot; (British Private Noakes) and &quot;portrait of a civilian&quot; (British munitions worker Caroline Webb). These characters are so similar to the two British characters described in the first volume (both soldiers were English privates born in 1896) that it is apparent that the author made no effort whatsoever to personalize the war from the French or German perspectives (or the loyal Canadians and ANZACs who came to defend the empire). Certainly Ernst J&uuml;nger's memoirs would have been a suitable basis for representing a German point of view, and there are numerous French memoirs as well. According to this type of historiography, the only people on the Western Front who mattered were Englishmen. The final section, on how the war ended skimps over unrest in Germany that led to the collapse of the monarchy and it is odd that there is no mention of the total casualties suffered by each of the combatants. A final section summarizing the human and financial costs of one of the most vicious wars in history would certainly seem appropriate, but it is not provided. Overall, this volume is not quite as good as the first."},{"Title":"Gwendolen, a Novel of Regency England","review":"Lady Ortilia and Mr. Hugh Quarters have three daughters.

However, Mr. Quarters is also a wastral, and very heavily indebted to the notorious moneylenders Messers Smith and Brown. Therefore even a Marquis with fifty thousand pounds a year is not to be whistled down the wind.Into this situation Lyndale arrives with a flash of carriage wheels, sending Gwendolen who happened to be strolling along the same narrow lane tumbling into a ditch to avoid being run down. This is symbolic of the way in which everyone's neat plans are overturned.Jane is such a dutiful thing that if not managed correctly she might accept the Marquis as a well of salvaging the family fortunes. Gwendolen discovers that her handsome heroic captain is really a pompous bore. Campaspe, the third daughter, in an effort to save Jane alienates her fiance. It hardly seems that all will come right in the end.The main problem with the book and the reason I would have given it 3 1/2 stars instead of 4 if it were possible, was that Ms. Darcy has a problem getting all of her lovers situated for the denouement. In fact the strategem is downright silly. However, there are enough fun moments in this book to make up for this.One of the things that I think might disturb readers used to recent Regency romances, is that the plot is not so much two people coming to understand they are in permanent ecstatic love, blah, blah, blah. The plot instead involves overcoming all of the obstacles: familial, financial and social that stand between two people coming to an understanding. Ms. Darcy is also really very knowledgeable about the Regency period, from the price of a post chaise to how bets were placed at a race, but her plots could have used a stronger editorial hand."},{"Title":"Gwendolen, a Novel of Regency England","review":"Okay, this story was CUTE and FUNNY! The main guy, Lord Lyndale is hilarious as is Gwendolyn's younger naive and bold little sister. This book seemed a bit like a Georgette Heyer story in that the humor actually got laugh-out-loud funny at times. This made up for what I did not like about the story. The plot was just weird, although clare darcy made you believe, \\"hey! It could happen!...maybe\\" It seemed like a bigger deal was made about something that could have been solved on Lord Lyndale's first visit. Made him seem a little slow because when it came to the end and his whole scheme was out, his reasoning was OKAY... Also, I did not like that hints that he gave throughout the book, while really obvious to the reader, went over the head of our dear heroine so many times. And she was supposed to be the wiser of the bunch, or atleast it seemed. Maybe it had to be done to keep the story going but sometimes it was so plain that it was her he loved and his comments to her made this so clear that the fact that she did not understand them was somewhat rediculous at times.Even still I would read this again. The humorous parts make it worth it. I also enjoyed that it ended just tad bit different than usual... although still happily. It is a sweet, funny, enjoyable read. For those days you just want to pick up a dependable love story with a bit of intrigue that doesn't make you think too hard.3 stars out of 5. I will reread when i've forgotten it a bit...not something I could pick up again right this minute.recommend? Still, yes!"},{"Title":"Gwendolen, a Novel of Regency England","review":"I took to reading Clare Darcy on the recommendation of people who consider her to be the closest to Georgette Heyer. Well, she is nowhere near Heyer. While her heroines are generally vivacious and her heroes are always handsome, there is less wit and irony, and less attention to the historical details and social mores. For example, in GWENDOLEN, a young lady corresponds merrily with a naval hero and then becomes betrothed by correspondence - without the knowledge, one assumes, of her parents, at least initially. Unfortunately, in the Regency period, no couple would correspond unless closely related or betrothed (in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, the fact that Marianne corresponds secretly with Willoughby leads her family to assume that they are secretly engaged). This and some other deviations from social mores rather strained my belief in the story.The amazingly headstrong antics of the youngest sister were also hard to believe. While I am sure that headstrong young women existed then, such behavior would have been labelled as fast and been condemned by society. The ability of Gwendolen to persuade a would-be seducer to change his itinerary was also hard to believe - especially given what we were told about the man's character.Enjoy the story for its own sake. It is not particularly true to Regency society, and the story line may be a bit too tame for today's readers. However, the absence of explicit details and the generally decorous behavior of most of the characters might please more conservative readers who are put off by explicit sex in modern Regencies. Those who like the genre should however try at least one Clare Darcy to see the transition between Heyer and the modern Regency exemplified by Signet and Zebra (in the American market).A spoiler - the story plot is described simply because there is no editorial description. The heroine Gwendolen starts the book engaged to a naval hero; her middle sister Jane has been a social success and returns home with a Marquess following her to propose marriage. She however is in love with the secretary on a neighboring estate. Jane however has several problems. First, she is in love with a poor man. Second, her love is the wrong nationality, from the point of view of her father. Third, this man works for one of her father's most-hated neighbors. Fourth, Jane would be seen as foolish to marry for love, when she has a title and wealth on offer; in fact, her family is in desperate straits. As if this were not enough, the youngest sister is also engaged to an impecunious young officer, and must delay her marriage.During the novel, all three romances come unstuck. Only Jane remains in love with her secretary, but must consent to a pseudo-engagement to throw off others. Gwendolen dismisses her fiance in an amusing scene; the youngest behaves with indiscretion and impetuosity in dismissing her lover. On top of all this, their father loses their family home and they are obliged to move away. Fear not, at the end, each young woman is reunited with the man whom she secretly desires."},{"Title":"Lenchens Geheimnis (German Edition)","review":"I read this story rewritten in simple German language published by Egmont Easy Readers.However, this is indeed a very much interesting story, the author can penetrate into the mental world of a little girl, and wrote this story from a viewpoint of a child.

You have to sit down and read an entire chapter to find some important piece of information nestled away in it. There should be a clear table for T&amp;T's complex transportation system, rather than confusing prose descriptions scattered all over the place. There should be an index of maps.

Spelman, the state pathologist of Vermont and an associate professor in Pathology at the University of Vermont. He is a member of the group qualified to investigate deaths in a scientific manner to determine the cause and time of death. Gardner has spent years in writing to make people aware of the importance of forensic medicine.Mrs. Enright A. Harlan visits Perry Mason to discuss the \\"domestic difficulties\\" of a cheating husband. Sybil doesn't want a divorce, separate maintenance, community property, or alimony; she just wants her husband back. Sybil wants Perry to buy stock in a real estate development company, and then create difficulties that will affect Enright's affair with Mrs. Roxy Claffin (Chapter 1). Perry goes to buy the stock from George Lutts, paying $32,750 for 2,000 shares, and learns more about this property that is a run-down residential district. Perry finds that Roxy owns adjoining property (Chapter 2). Mrs. Harlan then tells Perry about this property, how the new freeway will be close and increase the worth of this run-down property. They drive to the neglected old mansion which had been partitioned for small businesses. They observe Roxy by her swimming pool (Chapter 3). Perry attends the director's meeting, and says Roxy has invaded their \\"right of lateral support\\" by removing fill dirt, and could be sued (Chapter 4). Late in the afternoon Perry gets an emotional phone call from Sybil; when she was at the old house with George Lutts someone shot Lutts. Earlier Lutts bought 3,000 shares of the stock for $24,000 from another director. After Sybil tells all at Perry's office, they find that the gun in Sybil's car is now missing! Perry gives instructions to Sybil that must be followed (Chapter 5). Paul Drake monitors taxicabs by their radio frequency. Sybil calls Perry to tell him she followed his advice (Chapter 6).In Chapter 7 Perry calls Herbert Doxey and asks to inspect the property. They find Lutts' car, and then the body. The police are called. Sergeant Holcomb suspects something from Perry's presence. Roxy's problems and complaints to Enright have sent him back to Sybil. Paul tells Perry the police found the murder weapon; it was sold to Enright A. Harlan! The taxidriver reported picking up a woman near the murder scene, another taxidriver brought the woman to Enright A. Harlan's home (Chapter 8). Perry goes to visit Sybil Harlan in jail. Perry then assigns his detectives to get information on the other people who are involved (Chapter 9).The preliminary hearing begins, the details about the death are given (Chapter 10). [Did you notice anything?] The taxidriver's testimony is contradicted by the printed receipt! Next we learn that some woman other than the defendant signed to buy the murder weapon. The case is dismissed and Sybil is released from custody. Perry and Della perform an experiment to test the testimony (Chapter 11). The District Attorney presents new evidence at the trial. Perry finds out that Sybil didn't tell him the whole truth, and she explains why (Chapter 13). Sybil's friend is called as a prosecution witness, and so are others (Chapter 14). Roxy Claffin has thrown out junk like boards and torn canvas sacks at the dump, but it disappeared (Chapter 15). Other witnesses are questioned. The questioning of Enright Harlan uncovers a surprising fact (Chapter 17)! A new witness admits to facts that point to another person (Chapter 18). Perry explains his observations in Chapter 19, just before the judge instructs the jury to return a verdict of not guilty for Sybil."},{"Title":"perry mason: the case of nervous accomplice","review":"Very well-plotted mystery.

This is one of Louis' better westerns, right there with Shalako, Hondo, Radigan, and several others.As the map in the hardcover edition shows, the action takes place in Arizona, mainly at Rockingstraw Mountain. The central action revolves around placer mining from an alluvial fan, to dangerous extraction farther up a mountain, from a strip of rotten quartz \\"six feet wide, and cobwebbed with gold.\\" In all Adam Stark is seeking $100,000.00. All of this is interwoven with numerous Apache attacks, tension in a marriage, and Taggart's attempt to evade capture by a bounty hunter. How this all works out, of course, will be known to the reader upon finishing the book.The author, who died in 1988, was a very experienced writer and some of his books go beyond western fiction, to become just good literature. This book is close to that class of writing. It can be read in a few hours, but the characters Louis L'Amour created in this effort will stay with the reader much longer.If you haven't read this one, please do so. If you have, do as I've done several times, read it again.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Taggart","review":"I had the pleasure of reading the Bantam rack-size edition of this western printed in 1959.

This a classic western about a cowboy, Swante Taggart, who is on the run from a bounty hunter and ends up right in the middle of Apache country and is not expecting what he runs into.

That is the basic plot of this interesting story in Arizona of a rancher on the run who helps a man and two women protect their cache of gold in the heart of Apache country. A ruthless bounty hunter also complicates matters by laying claim to the gold strike as Indians search the canyons and mountaintops for the small party of whites. L'Amour had a gift for weaving philosophy, logic and romance into his plots and the elements all work well here. The story is a quick read but captures the flavor of the deserts and mountains of the arid, dry southwest."},{"Title":"Taggart","review":"This reads like it was cobbled together from abouth three different pulp novellas.

Since my area of research is paleomagnetism and rock magnetism the name of William Lowrie was sort of a guarantee that the book would be good. However, in the middle of the term I had to switch back to the \\"great classics\\", namely Stacey's and Garland's books. There are several problems with this book, firstly most of the formulae are presented out of the blues without a comprehensive deduction. That is not the most serious problem though, I also found several mistakes in the 2000 edition (I do not know if further editions took care of these problems). Some of these mistakes are pretty serious. As an example: he states that the international formula for the gravity normal to the Earth's ellipsoid derives directly from MacCullah's formula. That is not correct since in MacCullah's formula the centrifugal term coming from Earth's rotation is not considered!!!! There are also lots of minor mistakes related to missing terms in several formulae and derivatives.

He's very conceited and literally loves the sound of his voice. He comes across a young woman carrying water from the river and decides to tickle her for fun. The fun is at his expense when she captures him and drags him home for further training before the wrestling season commences. When they arrive back at the farm, the wrestler encounters her mother carrying a cow over one shoulder and her grandmother as she uproots a tree that gets in her way and tosses miles away. The three women put him to work to strengthen him and after three months when he goes to the capital he easily defeats and scares off his opponents. He returns to the three women to marry the daughter and live life as a farmer.I love that the book ends with the young woman carrying the wrestler up the mountain before she lets him carry her, though I sort of wish the illustration showed the former instead of the latter. The illustrations by Kazue Mizumura are lovely, sort of reminiscent of Japanese calligraphy done with loose brush strokes in shades of black, white, and red. The main lesson relates to humility and assumptions. While the wrestler pays the price for his assumptions, the outcome is positive all around. There is also an implicit message about class and idleness in the representation of the courtiers. Finally, the book seems to celebrate humility, simple living, and, of course, hard work."},{"Title":"Three Strong Women A Tall Tale from Japan","review":"I read this story with my seven year old daugther.

Since then a number of glossy books, notably from Taunton Press, have approached workshop design with lots of photographs. This book is more traditional with a strong focus on hand tools and longer text discussion that considers principles as well as technique. There is a distinctive British style to the writing. The subtittle to \\"The Workshop\\" is \\"designing, building, equipping.\\" This is an ambitious range of topics since any one of these could be a book into itself. The author had to limit the depth of coverage on some aspects of designing and building a shop. Kingshot does cover stationary and portable power tools. But the reader might be more interested by the author's focus on traditional hand tools. There is an interesting chapter on benches where the author looks at a cabinetmaker's bench, a joiner's bench and a stair builder's bench.

In this story, Buster Baxter finds himself in danger of failing third grade if he doesn't receive at least a B+ on an important test.The book version makes a few important changes to the story. Unlike many other television adaptations, Stephen Krensky's alterations always seem to be for the better. This version enriches the story with new details and enlightening descriptions of character fantasy sequences. Also one important detail is changed --- in the television version, the characters are tested over everything they've learned in third grade, while in the book it is only a math test.The only problem with this adaptation is that a rather odd bit is left in regarding division. At one point, Francine and Muffy attempt to tutor Buster by having him split a group of 20 candies evenly. He correctly splits then into two sets of 10, but struggles when they ask him to split them into even groups of three. They then criticize him when he begins eating candies, even though he has the correct general idea --- 20 candies cannot be split evenly among a group of 3."},{"Title":"Murder must wait","review":"Four babies are missing in the town of Mitford, New South Wales.

A superior officer advises that Napoleon Bonaparte is to look at the baby cases. Yoti goes to the scene of a murder. A woman has been murdered and the baby cot is empty. The baby is the fifth one to go missing.When Bony returns from the murdered woman's rooms he has a pair of shoes. Inspection of footprints yields the point that a man may have done the killing and a woman the taking of the baby. A neighbor, a Mrs. thring, feels that Mrs. Rockcliff, the victim, had no husband and had no friends.The Victoria Police Department sends Alice McGorr to help Bony in the investigation. Bony sets Alice McGorr to discovering patterns regarding the abducted babies. Bony is a half-caste detective and his assistant, Alice, is a member of the lower classes.

Warning: the first part of the mystery is very hard to understand because we don't know what's going on, but towards the end it will reveal what happened. Another downfall of this book is the way Faulkner puts the narrator in third person, using &quot;he&quot; and of course there are other &quot;he's&quot; in the story which makes it very difficult to figure out who's talking; if this is his type of writing, he should've used at least a capital H to distinguish when &quot;he&quot; is the narrator and &quot;he&quot; is another person, and the other characters, even though the reader might be confused who they are at first, Faulkner will describe them more throughout the book. Warning: there are also flashbacks which are put in parentheses, and yes sometimes the parentheses will be about 1 page long, so be careful. Well in conclusion, this is a good book but is badly structured. Advice: since the sentences are extremely long, sometimes to 2 pages, you must read it out loud, like you're talking to someone, and must read it with feeling and criticism; another advice: don't read this book at night while lying on a bed, you will be wear out and become very sleepy and cannot concentrate; read it during daytime and sit on a chair and read, not on a bed. Well, I hope if you have to read this book either for school or just for entertainment that you will enjoy it and understand it more than I did; of course how I understood it (the main parts) was because the help of my English teacher."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"This is basically a genre novel written by a literary master.

The symbolism is OK if you're into that sort of thing.On the negative: He must have written this while out and out drunk and the editor, publisher and the adoring public make great allowance because this is \\"William Faulkner\\". The sentences are not just run-on, but change subjects midstream and simply make no sense. The dialogue is the same as the narrative except for the quotes surrounding it and thus since everyone talks the same, there is not much for characterization.

When it came to ordinary literature, he boldly repudiated. His goal in literature remains as obscure as his style of writing. And Intruder in the Dust is a perfect example of what Faulkner was made of.Rooted in the South - in his famous Yoknapatawpha County - Intruder in the Dust is the story of Lucas Beauchamp and the men who toil for his freedom. It's a story that, though complex, is touching and wonderful. A nonconformical work of art that is surreal in language and impressionistic in symbolism.This book will not keep you at the edge of your seat, but it will indeed make you think. There's, of course, some entertainment (for it's the major characteristic of any novel), but the novel is mostly made of stuff to make you think.

I found it only slightly easier, with no real improvement. I believe that the problem stems from something that Douglas Adams had once said: \\"I'm trying to be literate, not literary.\\" I get the feeling that Faulkner was trying to create literature as an artform, rather than try to convey his story to the masses.I can appreciate that many people love this story, and that it is a literary masterpiece, but I cannot say that I think it is good."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"I have a Literature exam tomorrow - kind of a final- and this is one of the books included.

Mr. Faulkner enfolds his prose around you like kudzu and makes you part of his world.In a small Mississippi town in 1948, black Lucas Beauchamp is wrongfully arrested for shooting white Vinson Cowrie in the back. Sixteen-year old Charles Mallison owes Lucas a debt of honor incurred four years ago. Lucas hires Charles' cynical uncle, Gavin Stevens, to defend him. The most pressing matter is not Lucas' guilt or innocence; it is keeping him from getting lynched before he is arraigned. Lucas is a nightmare of a client. He is stubborn, stiff necked and proud. He dresses like an old time plantation owner and neither owes nor accepts favors from anyone. Uncle Gavin is trying to save Lucas' neck while Charles is trying to clear him. Gavin laments that Lucas would be easier to keep alive if \\"he would just ACT like a n----r.\\" This Lucas refuses to do. There is body snatching, graveyards at night and some thoroughly frightening characters to liven up the journey.Another reviewer mentioned \\"drunk on his prose,\\" and it is a very apt description. It works best if read aloud; you will find Faulkner's rhythm and make it your own. The long sentences don't trouble if you just let his prose carry you along. Mr. Faulkner thinks any southern woman over 35 years old is a secret Amazon of quiet strength and fortitude, which makes for interesting characters, but is a little hard on credibility. There is long section on how \\"outsiders\\" (read \\"Northerners\\") have interfered and thereby delayed integration. However true or false this may be, it slowed the story down and seemed tacked on.\\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is not generally ranked with \\"premier\\" Faulkner (\\"Light in August,\\" \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\"), but it stands on its own as a fine read and certainly is one of his best post-WWII books.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"No it's not one of Faulkner's &quot;big four&quot; (the classics &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; &quot;As I Lay Dying,&quot; &quot;Light in August&quot; and &quot;Absalom! Absalom!&quot;), but &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; is certainly in his next tier of top novels, and is the one book that can fly in the face of the &quot;he never wrote anything great after World War II&quot; way of thinking. I enjoyed this book immensely. Yes, the sentences tend to be extremely long and the book is slow to get going, but find Faulkner's rhythm and stick with the story; you'll be glad you did. As always, the highlight is Faulkner's beautiful use of language, which always towers over whatever story he's writing and whatever flaws you may stumble upon along the way. This story of a black man wrongly accused of murder doesn't always go where you think it will or even where you want it to, but somehow it works brilliantly. Faulkner throws in his take (apparently) on how the South should handle civil rights on its own -- not really necessary to include and a small flaw in the book, I think. But stick with it, get drunk on the prose and enjoy an underappreciated work from a master. This relatively short book will be over too soon."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"After twenty years of writing experimental fiction and Hollywood screenplays, Faulkner seemed destined to create a novel like \\"Intruder in the Dust\\"--a noir-ish mystery set in Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, that incorporates his signature prose style into a continuing commentary on race relations in the South. The premise of the accusation of a black man for the murder of a white man may seem too facile, but the novel does not rely solely or even primarily on plot-driven intrigue; it is the criminal aspect only as it relates to the prevalent social attitudes that generates interest.One day a local white man named Vinson Gowrie is found shot to death, and a black man named Lucas Beauchamp is arrested at the scene and charged with the murder. In this part of the country at this time in history, a black man who is even suspected of murdering a white man is in danger of being lynched, especially by people like Gowrie's relatives, who are from a particularly rough and bloodthirsty enclave living in an area called Beat Four.The story is told in the third person but from the viewpoint of a white boy named Charles \\"Chick\\" Mallison, who in the past has tried to befriend the solitary but kind Beauchamp and is convinced of his innocence. With the help of his uncle Gavin Stevens, a lawyer who decides to represent Beauchamp, his black friend Aleck Sander, and an elderly spinster named Miss Habersham, Chick investigates the matter and discovers, unsurprisingly, that there is more to the case than initially meets the eye.This sounds like generic pulp detective stuff, and indeed there is not much to say about the plot except that it involves a lumber scam, quicksand, a false grave, and a real culprit who is not too bright; but what makes this novel worth reading is the insight it gives about how easily in this milieu a black man can conveniently take the heat for a white man's crime, regardless of provability of guilt, and the ethical implications that arise from this situation. There is a particular manner in which the characters communicate with each other that reveals this information, conveying Faulkner's sublime sense of the range of personal moralities.Faulkner has several narrative modes at his disposal, and the one he chooses here is similar to that of \\"Absalom! Absalom!\\", employing impossibly long and syntactically deformed run-on sentences that compress copious visual detail into quickly moving scenic impressions. This technique could annoy many, but for those who know how to \\"read\\" Faulkner, it may be accepted as a characteristic part of the package. I'd place \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" somewhat below \\"Sanctuary\\" as an aesthetic achievement, but I still commend it as satisfying, like that tasty last bit of dessert after a full meal."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"This novel has a traditional detective story plot and a conventional attitude about race relations (although it was progressive for the South in the late 40s). After that, all bets are off. The style is like a thicket, but that's because Faulkner puts you into the head of a confused boy caught up in events beyond his control. Chick Mallison is white, and his friend Aleck Sander is black (Aleck Sander doesn't know his name isn't two words, because he can't read or write). The paired adult characters of equivalent race are Chick's uncle, Gavin Stevens, a lawyer, who defends Lucas Beauchamp (pronounced \\"Beecham\\"), a black tenant farmer accused of a murder he didn't commit by the people who did it. They know that in a prejudiced society, white people are likely to believe a black man is guilty, so they try to palm it off on him. Lucas is a rather severe character who often doesn't seem to appreciate the help he's getting (part of the plot involves trying to prevent the citizens from pulling him out of jail and lynching him), but he's a marvelous character and something of a father figure to Chick by the end of the book. Reading the book is a bit of a chore at first, but I got through it in high school years ago, and am reading it now for the third time. If you want some help getting into the book, you might try a \\"Masterplots\\" description of it or a reader's guide to Faulkner (there are several around). You might also look for the 1949 film based on the book, which was filmed in Faulkner's home town of Oxford, Mississippi, with local citizens as extras, and with the great Juano Hernandez playing Lucas."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"I am in 11th grade, and my hackles naturally went up upon reading the several reviews written by high schoolers on the subject of this novel. Do not be put off by such efforts to defile a masterpiece. This is one of the most profound and convincing novels I have ever read.Tolstoy once wrote that the success of any work of art depends ultimately upon the artist's maintaining an \\"independent moral relation\\" to his subject, and that he who does not bring to his work a fresh and enlightened view of the universe will invariably fail in attempting to create good art. Applying this criterion to Intruder in the Dust, Faulkner's novel stands as a paradigm of great art; for its moral scope and philosophical perspective are singularly awesome. Faulkner is simultaneously sympathetic toward and critical of that Southern society which serves as his subject, and yet he manages never to stoop to petty preaching or outright sermonizing. His work is a marvel of artistic delicacy and intensity. Bravo."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"Those who follow the AP Book of Rules for writing (i.e., subject, predicate, no commas, no decora) will have a tough time negotiating Faulkner's peregrinating sentences, but it's worth it. This book delivers several experiences at one time: a look at the Southern social codes, a textured appraisal of racial relations, an adolescent's step off into adult life, and an entertaining murder mystery. The lead characters are nicely drawn, with surprises; the action and crowd scenes are portrayed in easily visualized imagery. For all the Southern writing I've read, this added more information about the culture and people. I feel sorry for those who don't have the patience for Faulkner's style: a taste for it isn't that difficult to acquire and it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"This novel is not only a supervivid representation of the ugly and cowardly side of racism, but also one of the best coming of age stories I've ever read.

The meal was served to 12 year old Charles Mallison, after he had fallen in an icy pond, and the server, who didn't mean mister, was Lucas Beauchamp. Four years later the \\"bill\\" for those collard greens would come due, and it would be Mallison's actions that would save Beauchamp's life. \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is one of Faulkner's later works, written just after World War II. The perennial themes of his works are exhibited: his examination of life in barely fictional Yoknapatawpha County, whose county seat is Jefferson, (Oxford, MS) and the continued fall-out from America's \\"original sin,\\" slavery. From Faulkner's majestically southern mansion of Rowan Oaks, he wrote in fear of the \\"white trash\\" that surrounded him, so often identified as the Snopes family, but in this novel they are transformed into the Gowries, from \\"Beat Four.\\" Faulkner's stream-of-consciousness style always challenges the reader to stay engaged, or a vital clue to the story will be missed. And like those slower internet connections, he \\"backs and fills\\" his pixels, slowly revealing the entire story. This is also an excellent \\"mystery\\" novel; the particular situations involving the grave seem \\"impossible,\\" but Faulkner makes it all so understandable, masterfully so, in the fullness of time. Faulkner is certainly not for the \\"fun read\\" crowd, nor, apparently, based on the reviews posted here, for sophomores in \\"Advanced Placement\\" English. I shutter at the thought of how many students have become confirmed non-readers of serious books for the rest of their lives as a result of such classes.I am an immense fan of Faulkner, and still hope to read or re-read all his works. This time it was a re-read, after 35 or so years, and fortunately, even the first time was not a dreaded school assignment. There remain the wonderful, original descriptive passages that contain nuggets like: \\"...and forlorn across the long peaceful creep of late afternoon, into the mauve windless dome of dusk...\\" and \\"...if there were only some way to efface the clumsy room-devouring carcasses which can be done but the memory which cannot.\\" But on the re-read I noticed Faulkner's \\"feet of clay.\\" In referring to a patched roof, how much meaning is conveyed by \\"insolent promptitude,\\" or a lathe's \\"ineluctable shaft,\\" or \\"incredulous disbelief\\"?But the real \\"feet of clay\\" are political, and there is a three page defense of the South's \\"go slow\\" policy for granting Blacks equal rights. The passage doesn't work in a literary sense, in that it plops, \\"cut and pasted,\\" interrupting the dramatic tension of an enthralling mystery. Consider: \\"...only we (meaning white Southerners) must do it, and we alone without help or interference or even (thank you) advice since only we can if Lucas's equality is to be anything more than its own prisoner inside an impregnable barricade of the direct heirs of the victory of 1861-1865...\\" James Baldwin, in \\"Nobody Knows My Name,\\" in his chapter entitled \\"Faulkner and Desegregation,\\" offers the seminal critique of such an attitude: \\"After more than two hundred years in slavery and ninety years of quasi-freedom, it is hard to think very highly of William Faulkner's advice to \`go slow.' \`They don't mean go slow,' Thurgood Marshall is reported to have said, \`they mean don't go.'\\"Upon the re-read I was also struck by how derivative Harper Lee's classic book,To Kill a Mockingbirdis, down to the two different men, both sitting in the doorway of the jailhouse, to prevent a lynching, as well as even the mockingbird! It is a point another reviewer made, but I had never realized it before, nor seen it in a critique of Lee's work.Faulkner may be most associated with black-white relations, but he also has something to say about male-female relations. Consider: \\"...just enough dirt to hide the body temporarily from sight with something of that frantic desperation of the wife flinging her peignoir over the lover's forgotten glove...\\" or \\"I am fifty-plus years old,' his uncle said. \`I spent the middle fifteen of them fumbling beneath skirts. My experience was that few of them were interested in love or sex either. They wanted to be married.'\\"It pains me to knock a star from a Nobel-prize winning \\"idol,\\" but the \\"feet of clay\\" are most certainly there."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"Probably one of the most intense books I've ever read -- well worth the effort.

However, as Faulkner got further entrenched in his stream of consciousness technique and he continued to reiterate the significance of the events on what essentailly is a 24-36 hour period, I began to come to the conclusion that this must have started off as a short story and was extended strictly to satisfy elements of style and to send a message to the rest of the country (let The South solve its own Civil Rights problem). I have previously successfully navigated the stream of consciousness style in such books as Absalom Absalom! and found that in the retelling of a 50 year saga it was very effective. Here however, it seems to get in the way and serves only to extend a basic (but interesting) storyline from an evening read, to an extended read. I recommend it for the Faulkner fan since it was one of his rare commercial successes, but the Faulkner novice may be better off with easier books such as The Unvanquished or even for that matter Light in August."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"This novel is, in form, a thriller with a classic thriller plot- the fight to prove the innocence of a man accused of a crime he did not commit. (Alfred Hitchcock used this plot in a number of his films, and \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" was itself made into a very good film by Clarence Brown in 1949, only a year after its publication). Faulkner takes this basic plot and uses it to explore the problem of racism in America's Deep South; Harper Lee was later to take a similar plot, and use it for a similar purpose, in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".The book is set in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County and its capital, Jefferson, based upon the real Lafayette County and Faulkner's own home town of Oxford. The innocent man wrongly accused is Lucas Beauchamp, an elderly, widowed black farmer. Although Beauchamp is honest and respectable, he is resented by many whites because he refuses to \\"behave like a nigger\\", that is to say behave in a servile manner. When a white man named Vinson Gowrie is shot dead, Beauchamp is accused of the crime. Gowrie was from Beat Four, a wild, hilly district of the county, whose white inhabitants are noted for their lawless ways and their ingrained prejudices against blacks. A mob, mostly members of Gowrie's extended family, gathers in Jefferson, threatening to break into the jail and lynch Beauchamp.The story is told through the eyes of Charles Mallison, the sixteen-year-old nephew of Gavin Stevens, the relatively liberal white lawyer who acts for Beauchamp. Charles, who regards himself as being in Beauchamp's debt ever since, four years earlier, the old man rescued him after he fell in a stream, sets out to prove that Beauchamp did not fire the fatal shot. Together with his black friend Aleck and Miss Habersham, an elderly spinster (did Faulkner derive her name from Dickens' Miss Havisham?) he makes the dangerous body to Beat Four to exhume the body of the murdered man- and makes a surprising discovery.Racial issues play an important part in Faulkner's work; indeed, it would probably be difficult for any Southern writer to avoid them altogether. His own views on the topic, however, seem to have been rather mixed. On the one hand he was an anti-racist, regarding the intolerant prejudice of many white Southerners as an affront to both decency and rationality. On the other hand, he was himself a proud Southerner, conscious of his family's Confederate heritage; his great-grandfather, Colonel William Falkner (thus spelt), had been a Confederate hero in the Civil War. In this novel Faulkner himself seems to adopt what might be called a neo-Confederate position, believing that, if the South could not be an independent, sovereign state it should at least form a culturally autonomous unit within the USA and have the right to deal with its own problems without interference from the North. He devotes several pages of the novel to his thesis that attempts by outsiders to combat racism in the south had actually been counter-productive and that black Southerners would never achieve equality until white Southerners were allowed to address the issue on their own terms.The novel was written in the late forties, before the rise of the Civil Rights movement, and I think that Faulkner was wrong about race. The large-scale exodus of rural Southern blacks to Northern industrial cities in the first half of the twentieth century meant that race relations could no longer (if indeed they ever could) be thought of as solely a Southern issue. Since 1948 race relations in America have seen an immense change for the better; as I write this in October 2008 it seems quite likely that next month Barack Obama will not only be elected America's first black President but will also carry several Southern states. This change would not have been possible without the Civil Rights movement and the active involvement of Northerners, both black and white, and of the institutions of the Federal government.Despite my disagreements with him, I nevertheless found Faulkner's analysis of the South's racial problems a stimulating and thought-provoking one. The characters are, for the most part, memorable and powerfully drawn. I did not, however, altogether enjoy this book, largely because of the eccentricities of the prose style that the author adopts here, a prose style characterised by long, rambling (and often syntactically disorganised) sentences, sometimes extending over several pages. He also has a weakness for obscure vocabulary items.Faulkner was, presumably, aiming at the sort of stream-of-consciousness style he had used to good effect in other, better, novels, such as \\"As I Lay Dying\\". This style can be a valuable tool for showing us the world through the eyes of a fictional character or, in the case of \\"As I Lay Dying\\" which uses first-person multiple-narrator technique, through the eyes of a string of different characters. When stream-of-consciousness is used to represent the writer's own authorial voice, it becomes much less effective. \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is a third-person narrative, and, although Charles is the central character, we are not always certain if it is his voice we are hearing, or the author's. The effect is less stream-of-consciousness than stream-of-confusion. As a result of this uncertainty, and of his often impenetrable syntax, the author's train of thought is in places difficult to follow, which means that, despite its interesting themes, \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is not as effective a book as it could have been."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"I had been looking for William Faulkner's \\"Intruder in the Dust\\", because I wanted to have Charlie Mallison's quote about Pickett's Charge on file.The copy sent to me was hard cover, 16th printing of the first edition, in excellent shape, and meets my requirements in every way.I am totally satisfied."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"he purposely made the sentences long like that for a reason. through his style, he was trying to show you the mindset of people in the South after World War 2.

It is not an easy romp through the pages, but with patience and the ability to watch for key nouns and verbs, you will enjoy this book with the layers of intrigue it offers. Kind of like peeling an onion to get to the core. Faulkner's style is unmistakable and takes some practice to enjoy and decipher. Few beginning readers should be turned loose on their own to cut their literary teeth on this author, however."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"We are in the South, in a rural city and area. A crime is committed, a white man is shot dead and an old black man is arrested for it on Saturday night, red-handed, because he was next to the dead shot body with a gun in his pocket. This black man has had a past of refusing samboism. He always behaved in a non standard way for a black man in the South. No question is asked. A lawyer is called by the black man and the lawyer does not ask questions and assumes the black man is guilty of the crime he is accused of committing. It will take a white teenager (16 and the lawyer's nephew), a black teenager (his friend) and a white older lady with a truck to accept to go and explore the grave of the dead man on the request of the black man. They find out the man in the grave is not the man it should be, but is another assassinated white man. And then the plot thickens tremendously because these three people plus the lawyer will manage to take over and convince the sheriff to go investigate this tomb with them. The father and two sons of the victim have been summoned by the sheriff. The two sons will dig out the grave and find it empty. Then they all manage to find the body the teenagers and the woman had found more or less carelessly hidden in some sand and the body of the first assassinated person in a patch of quicksand. The black man is definitely saved. The criminal will be found out to be a fourth son of the old man, a brother of the victim himself because the murdering brother was cheating some wood out of a forest patch that was being cut down and sawn into boards to be sold later on, at a profit of course, from the assassinated brother with an accomplice, the second man who was killed two days later and hidden in the assassinated brother's tomb. This murdering brother will be forced to commit suicide in jail for the white community not to have a trial, not to have to hang a white man for the killing of two white men while at first a black man had been accused and had by pure chance escaped a lynching. But the book is interesting for a lot more than this murder plot. It is no thriller because we nearly know from the very start that the lynching will not happen. The interest of the book is in the narrator who looks at the situation and events through the sole eyes of the lawyer's nephew that is always referred to as \\"he\\", third person singular, and never with a name. This awkward narration creates a distanciation in the fictional voyeurism of the book that kind of keeps us active and alert. The second interest is in the long speeches and explanations the lawyer delivers to his nephew in order to initiate him to adulthood. The discourse is a general speculation about racism, samboism, the liberation of black people or rather of the South from this samboism and racism, how it can only happen from inside and not from outside, the reaction of the whites in front of this accused black and the possibility or impossibility of a lynching, etc. It is a close examination of the racial conscience of the South, and not only the whites, but also the blacks. The third interest is in the initiation of this young teenager that goes far beyond only understanding the southern mind, the southern past and future, the southern race relations and how to free them from the heritage of slavery and the end of it imposed from outside. It has to do with physical growing and even the sexual or emotional levels of that growing, how some sexual emotion can appear in the strangest of all situations and distort the teenager's vision for a while. Finally it also depicts the complexity and beauty, contradictory confusion and clarity of their mentality and consciousness, or unconsciousness. Faulkner has it all wrong as for how the liberation of the blacks will come, but it does not matter : it represents the vision the whites had at a certain moment in history, in fact between the two world wars. He could not take into account the consequences of WW2 on the mental liberation of the black community and particularly the weight and power northern blacks will find in the war that will make them go down South, if necessary and with white people too eventually, to help their black brothers down South to get on the road to civil liberties. But it is this very historical limitation that makes the novel all the more interesting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"Thanks to its stream-of-conscious narrative, this book leans more toward the incomprehensible side of Faulkner's canon, despite a simple plot that often feels as if it would have been suited to a short story and was dragged out to fit the necessary length for a full-length book. When you add to that the blatant preachiness and, aside from the inciting event, a predictable storyline, this book ends up being more work than its worth."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"This novel doesn't rank with Faulkner's classic work and there are dozens of reviews here that tell why--but the most basic problem is the difficulty of writing a mystery, a plot-driven story, in prose that is often gibberish."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"My opinion is that this book was overly long and boring. The ideas and the narratives are difficult to understand. Of course, the book is an enticing novel or racism in the south. Of couse what the hell do I know? I am 16 years old."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"Excellent novel about a black man (Lucas Beauchamp) falsely accused of murdering a white man and the boy who believes him and sets out to prove his innocence. On the one hand, it's about sticking to your guns when you know a man is being wronged (&quot;Some things you must always be unable to bear. Some things you must never stop refusing to bear. Injustice and outrage and dishonor and shame. No matter how young you are or how old you have got. Not for kudos and not for cash: your picture in the paper nor money in the bank either. Just refuse to bear them&quot; (p201)). On the other hand, Faulkner goes off a bit at the end about the Civil War (no surprise here) and says that the North stuck to its guns too severely -- that most Southerners believed slavery was wrong but just needed the time to work it all out, not the strongarming into a position weren't ready to assume: &quot;. . .and you [the North] say At least we perish in the name of humanity and we [the South] reply When all is stricken but that nominative pronoun and that verb what price Lucas' humanity then?&quot;(p. 212). God, I love that man. This is a good one to start with if you're a Faulkner rookie -- it's pretty short and doesn't do any flipping around in time.As for all the comments about how bad Faulkner's grammar is (run-on sentences, no punctuation, etc. etc. ad nauseum), you guys are all forgetting that there are only rules governing these things when you're writing a paper for English Comp. In the real world, manipulating the language is what makes writers great. Say you don't like it, but don't say it's garbage just because it doesn't live up to Strunk and White. Being a critic is cool, being a criticaster is not."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"This is a story about a post-Civil War pre-civil rights southern town that almost gets up the gumption to lynch a falsely accused black man. This is also the coming-of-age story of one Chick Mallison, I think his last name is, who takes the initiative to prove the accused innocent. This is a platform for Faulkner to vent some political views through Chick's uncle, a successful southern lawyer who defends the prisoner. There's nothing really new about any of these themes.Really and truly what makes this book one to be remembered is that somehow Faulkner managed to write in such a way that he captured the way time and thought bend, expand and contract around each other. It would be impossible to give you a taste of this without inserting a quote that's two pages long, but once you get caught up in his long dream-like stream-of-consciousness flows, you almost find yourself jerking back to reality along with Chick when he is moving in and out of a sleep state over his breakfast after a long night of digging up graves and eluding murderers.Faulkner also manages to capture the ambiguous emotions that we all have around the powerful events and people in our lives. No human emotion or action is ever purely black or white; in Chick's case we get to hear all of the inner voices--need for love and approval, order and security; shame, anger, pity, wonder, fear, love--really I could go on and on, but the point is that they are mixed and presented on the page in the way that our emotions are--a constant flow of thoughts and voices, sometimes linked, sometimes random, sometimes contradictory, and often below the surface of our conscious mind.In truth, I have never really read anybody else who writes like this. I read the Sound and the Fury in my early twenties and found it a bit daunting, but now having read As I Lay Dying and Intruder in the Dust (at the age of 34) I think I'd like to give it another read, along with the rest of his works. By the way, for those of you who are struggling with any of Faulkner's works, try picking up a literary bio that explains the order in which he wrote them, where he was in his life, and what he was experimenting with (and I don't mean drugs). I have found all of that info to be enormously helpful and a spur to further reading. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"While not one of Faulkner's classics, this book is a fine introduction to the writer, his myth, his style and his story telling. While it appears on the surface to be a mystery, the book is deeply involved with southern consciousness attempting to deal with its own racial identity and the perceived impossibility of resolving it. Chick Mallison's quote regarding Pickett's Charge is the core of this work. \\"For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it's still not yet two o'clock on that July afternoon in 1863...\\" Seems to me that there are still a lot of folks trying to work that out.Faulkner is never easy to read. It is dangerous art, and requires work on the part of the reader. If that is not your cup of tea, stay away. Ignore the one-star reviews written by the impatient people who seem to think that literature should be as easy to read, approachable and safe. If you are willing to do the work, there is great treasure in Yoknapatawpha County.In regards to the one-star review by the gentleman who intercepted the book because his fourteen year old had been asked to read it as a class assignment: yes, there are rules, but the dangerous artists know how to break them and in doing so transcend normal story-telling."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"I had to choose a novel for an independent reading assignment, so of course, being the striver I am, I had to choose an obscure Faulkner novel. I thought the book was excellent. Faulkner's rich prose helped to develop his deeply southern charachters. The culture of the South and it's deeply imbedded morals were brought out through Faulkner's lengthy sentences and gothic elements such as suspense and enhanced senses. The coming of age story of Chick Mallison and several subplots gave the novel many layers with which to envelop the reader. Overall, the novel turned out to be a tough read that was well worth the time."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"Stream of consciousness is not an easy form to read, but it is well worth the effort. This book is actually a mystery, so the ambiguities of the form are appropriate to the story. The language is poetic, very Southern. It reads like a murmur, a drawl. I tried to say it in my Brooklyn accent, and it doesn't work. It takes place in Mississippi in 1948, at the beginning of the civil rights movements in this country and addresses some of the questions raised by the sentiments in Congress at the time, in a very literary way. The characters are three-dimensional and paint a picture of the town: rednecks and middle class, farmers and townspeople, boys and old gentlewomen, deputy sheriffs and lawyers, blacks and whites. You may not agree with Faulkner's musings about the American character and the American destiny, but his thoughts are well worth reading."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust (The Modern library of the world's best books [351])","review":"This is not my favorite Faulkner book, but it's not painful. However, it is a really interesting read for anyone familiar with To Kill a Mockingbird as it becomes exceedingly clear that Harper Lee ripped off an enormous amount from this book. Ok, I know, good writers borrow, great writers steal, but beyond the general plot similarity: black man accused of a crime he didn't commit told from a child's point of view saved by a goodly lawyer pillar of the community, there are some unbelievable details as well.For one, there is are two references to the shooting of a mad dog in Intruder, an event used to establish a character in an offhand way. That scene is extended memorably in Mockingbird. Another clincher for me is the closing of chapter X in Intruder where the sheriff is complaining about the racket made by, and I'm not kidding, a mockingbird. The fate of the mockingbird is left undetermined in a singularly Faulkner manner, but the intent to kill is clearly there. Twenty years later, we can assume that the bird is still alive because Harper has taught us it is a sin . . .I'm surprised I don't hear this shouted from the rooftops.

It's a fascinating tale of the efforts of two boys (one white, one black) to save the life of a Mississippi black man accused of shooting a white man in the back. The writing includes some of Faulkner's interesting---and to some readers, maddening---techniques of writing, including motives, thoughts, scenes described in the negative (what they are not) and the use of multiple nearly synonymous verbs side by side, as if he couldn't make up his mind which to use.

Sometimes the new material is major, sometimes minor. I immediately liked this book because I found a tiny bit of information that I've been curious about for years. A famous unsung, middle-class patron of many of the world's great artists who resided in Montparnasse ran a \\"Cremerie\\" directly across the street from Academie Colarossi Art School. The tiny caf&eacute; was described in numerous biographies but the shop owner was always described simply as \\"Madame Charlotte.\\" I'd done a little research trying to discover more about this fascinating businesswoman whose building was stuffed with artworks and who loaned money to Gauguin so he could travel to the South Seas, but was unable to find her last name. It seemed to have been lost to history. On page 22 of this book the mystery was solved. She was identified as \\"Madame Charlotte Caron.\\" That discovery immediately led me to buy this book that is chuck full of interesting biographies as well as more than 700 photographs of the artists described and their work as well as information about the people around this legendary Roaring Twenties artist's community. This encyclopedia of information is tied together by featuring Kiki (Alice Prin) at various points. It could have been tied together by using anyone of several artists who were such an integral part of the \\"Camelot of Paris Art.\\" Picasso or Man Ray would have done equally as well, but neither of them was French or as sexy to look at in the nude.This book is well worth reading. In many ways, it's like looking at a personal photo album with really good captions explaining the pictures and the people in them. Unlike most personal photo albums this one includes pictures of the \\"underside\\" of Paris along with pictures of its residents dressed and undressed. The residents apparently loved to party as demonstrated by the huge number of masked balls and other wild parties shown in picture after picture. This book is extra interesting because of the informal portraits of so many famous artists at work and definitely at play. With snapshots of the smoky world of the cafes, the brothels, the art schools, and the hedonistic picnics, the book makes that by-gone era live again. Kiki, with her cabaret dancing, nude modeling, infamous lovemaking and bubbling personality was the very personification of the hedonistic age that produced creativity the likes of which the world has seldom witnessed.

He begins by surveying the ups and downs of Donne's reputation. Dr. Johnson did not find a high place for him and he was not celebrated for a long- time. The pioneering scholarship of Herbert Grierson who published in 1912 an edition of the poetry, and above all the re-evalutation of T.S. Eliot made Donne into a central figure of the Tradition. Donne's poetry was worshipped in the world of Critical opinion which Eliot for more than half-a- century set the tone in.Donne is a complicated, difficult and remarkably original poet. He is a poet of strong feeling and argument. His poems seem to lay out a line of thought which the reader must stay with through hard mental effort. Along with this the great innovation of the Metaphysical Poets of which Donne was the chief was that linking together violently of worlds of experience which were not ordinarily associated. This adventure of Mind gives Donne's poetry a quality of excitement, newness and interest.This volume contains the poems Donne is most known for, the early love poems,the Holy Sonnets, Epigrams,Elegies,Anniversaries,Epithalmio0n, Divine poems, Anniversaries.There are endnotes but they are scanty. With a poet like Donne one needs a lot of help, and for those who really want to understand him a more comprehensive critical edition is recommended.But the great poems are here.I would only add as a minor note that while I recognize the distinctive power of Donne's poetry it does not hold me or move me in the way that of Shakespeare Wordsworth Keats Hopkins Stevens do.

It is written on a laymans level and is able to help those who have questions regarding this doctrine.Mr. Bickersteth is writing specifically to Unitarians friends as he reaches out to them and seeks to convey the Scriptural teaching. This book will be just as helpful to those seeking to reach Jehovah's Witnesses or Christadelphians.This writer found it extremely helpful as he sought encouragement after separating himself from Jehovah's Witnesses. I recommend it heartily."},{"Title":"THE TRINITY","review":"This book is about 100 years old now, but the many truths expressed in this book are truly timeless. I found much of the material in this book to be just as relevant today as it has ever been, with almost none of the material being dated at all. This is truly one of the preeminent books on the truth of Trinitarianism.In this book, Bickersteth attempts to demonstrate the truth of the Trinity by showing the personhood and deity, as articulated in Scripture, of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. In this book, Bickersteth brutally refutes various objections to Trinitarianism, mainly voiced by the Unitarians of his day. In the end, the reader is left with a comprehensive sense that to deny Trinitarianism is to make a mockery of Scripture, since the Bible exhaustively demonstrates the truth of the Trinity.Among many highlights in this book, the biggest is clearly Bickersteth's exhaustive Scripture examination and comparison. In the chapters where he attempts to establish the coequal deity of the Son with the Father, Bickersteth analyzes and compares over 100 Scripture passages to show that the same phraseology that is used in Scripture to establish the divinity of the Father is also used to establish the divinity of the Son. Bickersteth goes on to conduct a similar Scripture comparison in demonstrating the divinity of the Holy Spirit. Bickersteth, in addition to establishing the divinity of the three persons of the Godhead, also effectively demonstrates that each Person is unique, personal, and in possession of an individual will, though the wills of all three are in perfect unison. This effectively heads off the assertion that Father, Son, and Spirit are merely three manifestations of the same person, rather than &quot;three who's of one what&quot;. Oneness pentecostalism is one of the many movements that argues in favor of the three manifestations concept, but this book effectively shows that in order to truly embrace this idea, one has to conduct major spiritual gymnastics in order to get away from what Scripture clearly teaches on this point.The only area of this book that I thought could have been improved concerned the functional subordination aspect of Trinitarianism seen in Scripture. Bickersteth does touch on this in a couple of places, but not exhaustively. The coequality aspect of Trinitarianism is a difficult concept to understand in light of the offices each Person appears to hold. But what should be clear from Bickersteth's book is that without regard to roles, each Person of the Godhead is equally divine and equally due our worship as a matter of ontology.But with the exception of this one regret where I wish Bickersteth had been more thorough, this book is truly a classic on Trinitarianism that has stood the test of time, mainly because the truths it depicts are timeless and eternal. This is a must read for anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the truth of Trinitarianism and how to combat objections with massive amounts of Scriptural support."},{"Title":"THE TRINITY","review":"The book titled \\"The Trinity,\\" by Edward Henry Bickersteth was recommended to me as a thorough presentation of Trinitarian theology. What I didn't know at the time was this study was originally published over one-hundred years ago. In essence, this book is both an impressive doctrinal defense of the Triune Godhead, while at the same time an open encouragement to the Unitarians of Bickersteth's era to return to that Trinitarian view of God.Though the book is dated, the material is not. Bickersteth has amassed and carefully presents an enormous amount of scripture to beautifully reveal the eternal Trinitarian Godhead. As with other books on this subject, he doesn't rely on systematized arguments supported by a few proof texts. Instead, Bickersteth's defense reads more like an open letter to the Unitarians, presenting a comprehensive comparative study of scripture, revealing the divine nature and holiness of God the Father in contrast to the fallen sinfulness of man, and the glorious deity of Christ Jesus from both the OT and NT. Bickersteth follows with comparative studies of the coequal deity of the Father and Jesus Christ by comparing their coequal attributes, majesty, claims, and Divine worship due and given to each one, while also maintaining the individuality of each member. A similar study is included revealing by scripture the Divinely coequal Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).At times, Bickersteth chose to just lay relevant scripture side by side in a column style for the reader to view a comparative study of the Godhead, simply letting the power of scripture speak for itself. These sections were especially compelling. Besides the exhaustive examination of scripture, I was personally moved by Bickersteth's personal humility and genuine love and concern for those he was writing to. His compassion for the wayward Unitarians is impressive, and at the same time personally challenging to me.I would have preferred Bickersteth had spent more time addressing some of the common arguments presented by non-Trinitarian groups like the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses. Especially when explaining how the subordinate roles of the persons within the Godhead do not affect their coequal Divine natures. How Jesus being the Son does not in anyway make him inferior to the Father.I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend Bickersteth's book. It is probably the finest defense of the Trinitian doctrine available. The language is somewhat dated, but the reader shouldn't find it difficult. Bickersteth's exhaustive use of scripture has made this a timeless volume on the Trinity. It is also clear that Bickersteth did not rush through this book, but spent years of detailed and earnest effort into its preparation. It definitely shows as this is truly a classic defense of the Trinitarian doctrine."},{"Title":"THE TRINITY","review":"Edward H. Bickersteth (1812-1906), long time pastor and Bishop in England, delivered countless scripture verses declaring the Triune nature of God. It would be very difficult to remain a cultist after reading this volume and its innumerous supply of proof-texts for the Trinity.In \\"The Trinity,\\" Bickersteth presented the church with a great theological gift that has become an apologetic classic. He presents Old Testament and New Testament verses which elucidate the tri-personal nature of the one true God.\\"Christianity Today\\" stated: \\"Required reading ... furnishes conclusive refutation of cults which reduce Jesus Christ to a created being.\\"This book has old font communicated in boxy language, nevertheless it is an important easy-to-reference resource.Chapters include:- Why Study the Trinity?- God the Creator- Our confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ- Deity of Christ Coequal with the Father- Coequal Godhead: The Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit- Assurance of the Trinity- and more.This is an indispensable resource for the Christian scholar and the lay-person. Own this and study it before the cultists knock on your door.Robert Morey's more recent book on the Trinity is as precise but more comprehensive.God Does Exist!: Defending the faith using presuppositional apologetics, evidence, and the impossibility of the contrary"},{"Title":"THE TRINITY","review":"I must echo the positive comments of others who point out Bickersteth's solid treatment of Scripture, his clarity of wonderful truths expressed to Christ's sheep, and the book's usefulness in combatting the wide range of attacks against such a precious doctrine. The primary focus on Scripture is key. Bickersteth shows that the Trinity isn't based on Catholic dictionary definitions, pagan concepts of God, physical analogies in nature such as water, arbitrary numerics, or even in the Church's creeds that faithfully represent Scripture's teaching, but in God's inspired revelation of Himself to His people. If you embrace the ideas of this book, you will have a much greater appreciation for the Triune God Who expresses perfect Love within Himself (1 John 4:8) eternally first, and then reaches to share that love with His people (1 John 1:1-7). Then you can appreciate the God to Whom Christ submitted and prayed in His human nature, and called His Father, being 'like us' as our example."},{"Title":"Life on Tour with David Bowie: We Can Be Heroes","review":"This is an intriguing view of David Bowie's life when on tour in 1978.

Written effectively. Enjoyable."},{"Title":"Life on Tour with David Bowie: We Can Be Heroes","review":"This is a really interesting book about the highs and lows of being on a major year long tour in the late 1970s. Long before the Serious Moonlight tour changed how the game is played. First class travel and high end parties one day, crappy hotels and seedy bars the next. What is unusual and interesting is the constant search for casual sex which runs through the book, with females, but mostly males. It's not done in a seedy way but don't buy if this type of thing bothers you. Also if you are expecting the majority of the book to be about the actual shows and Bowie then again this isn't for you. The shows are discussed and it's interesting but it's mainly in passing (also the photos aren't anything special). It's clear that Bowie enjoyed Sean Mayes company and Mayes admired Bowie hugely and there is lots of interesting anecdotes of time they spent together and how Bowie handled his fans.

O'Neil and support his response to the irresponsible and misinformed review of M. Story. I also use this text in teaching a college course on European Politics. As O'Neil correctly points out, Richard Rose is one of the world's leading authorities on British politics and political history, and his chapter on Britain provides an excellent overview. The chapters on the other countries are equally thorough and impressive."},{"Title":"European Politics Today (3rd Edition)","review":"Because this is a textbook, I feel strongly that a description of the physical properties of the book is every bit as important as the content. You are not likely considering this purchase for the content because this book is likely a required text for a college course in European Political Science.That said, this book is a disaster. The only good thing about it is an excellent and organized division of subject matter in the chapters as well as a comfortable weight and size for study. On to my complaints:1.) The cover of the book, even brand new, is flimsy and cracks near the spine upon first opening. I have ever reason to expect that this cover will break off clean simply from being opened and exposed to the normal wear of a student reading. I don't bend covers back or force them to open flat, but even with gentle use, the cover is threatening to tear clean away, and I've only had it for three days.2.) The pages of this book are printed on super-thin paper that cannot be highlighted without significant bleed-through. If, like me, you are a student who highlights your textbooks (I keep them forever and often look back at my marginalia and highlighted sections), the only option for you will be to use a crayon to highlight or one of those expensive highlighters made for Bible pages/tissue paper.3.) The margins in this book are only 1/2\\" on the sides and slightly less on the bottom of the pages. This precludes any notes in the margins. Again, marginalia is part of my studying process. If you are in the habit of writing margin notes in your textbooks as you read, you will not be able to do that in this book.The quality of this paperback is absolutely horrific. I could forgive it in a book meant for personal use, but this is a textbook. It's unacceptable, and I strongly encourage you to purchase the hardcover if any of the above-mentioned deficiencies are important to you as a student."},{"Title":"European Politics Today (3rd Edition)","review":"The description said used, and that statement is correct. However, the pages were worn, torn, folded, and extremely highlighted/ underlined through out the book. The description did not mention this. Afterall, there were other selections to choose from, and had the description said that I would've selected a different book."},{"Title":"European Politics Today (3rd Edition)","review":"I was recommended this book on the basis that it might serve as an introduction to comparisons between European political systems. Having spent an extortionate amount of money on a copy, I found it to be an introduction to things that go wrong if you let your secretary write your book. Being English I was able to spot the glaring errors written about my own country with ease (examples include the authors being unaware of the Stormont Parliament, using the words Britain and United Kingdom interchangeably, and a total lack of understanding of the way in which parliamentary democracy works in the UK), but when I turned to the chapters concerning countries in mainland Europe, about whose governmental machinations I knew (and still know) little, I found myself unable to trust the material, since I had no way of knowing whether any of it was true. It may have been a momentary lapse of the part of the authors that led them to fail so miserably in their attempt to understand the United Kingdom, but I am sure it is much easier for a team based in the United States to examine British political life than to look closely at the parliamentary process of Sweden or the Czech Republic, and since they were unable to avoid schoolboy errors in their reporting of the former, I feel I can be forgiven for my assumption that their accuracy in the latter probably left something to be desired."},{"Title":"The Art of Magic: The Companion to the Pbs Special","review":"Richly informative and easily able to hold the attention of the modern-day reader while acquainting him with the fully illustrated history of this continuing marvel right up to the present day.

So it was refreshing and exciting for me to learn about a journalism pioneer who broke the barriers that had previously kept minorities out of mainstream newspapers. Ted Poston comes across as a proud man, striving to reserve his dignity in a world that spits in his face. He is shown to be quick-witted and dedicated. But the author, Kathleen A. Hauke, doesn't pull any punches. She also reveals Poston's dark side, how his drive for professional success eroded his personal happiness. As a background, we see Poston at his best as he works in the Jim Crow world of the 1930s and 40s and uses humor as a weapon to win acceptance. Heavily detailed, the book authoritatively discusses Poston's life and career through his body of work and the memories of those who knew and worked with him."},{"Title":"Ted Poston; Pioneer American Journalist","review":"Anybody who is interested in Black Culture and History should read TED POSTON, PIONEER AMERICAN JOURNALIST, by Kathleen A.

In \\"The Hero With A Thousand Faces,\\" Joseph Campbell explores the theory that significant myths in many cultures around the world survived because they all share a fundamental structure, which Campbell calls the monomyth or the hero's journey. Similarly, pulp fiction contains a predictable narrative structure: the hero, the trusty sidekick, the romantic interest, and the seemingly, unattainable mission. The narrative plot in \\"Orders Is Orders follows this typical structure. The non-stop action begins in China in the 1930's, during the Japanese invasion. James Mitchell, a tough marine gunnery sergeant along with private first class Toughey Spivits have been ordered to embark on a treacherous 200 mile mission to deliver cholera anti-serum and gold to the American consulate in Skunkien.

Ron HubbardMulti-cast performanceProduced by Galaxy Audio (2008)approx 2.5 hoursGalaxy Audio is getting ready to release some new collections of audiobooks from L. Ron Hubbard's Pulp Fiction writings of the mid-20th Century and before I get to them I realized there was one release I've missed. You see, since 2008 Galaxy Press and Galaxy Audio have been gathering all of the stories Hubbard wrote during the hey day of pulp fiction and have been releasing the New York Times bestselling author's writings in their own new pulp magazine forms. The paperbacks have the feel of the old pulps (but are a little more sturdy), and the audio book forms, well let's just say, Galaxy Audio has created the new format of Audio Pulps. The audiobook releases are all around 2 hours in length and while some may contain one story there are some that have 2 or 3 short stories. This one is only one story but, as are all of them, it is a fun and exciting adventure story.The way Galaxy Audio has created this Audio Pulp format is by casting multiple talented people to play the parts in the story and then incorporating excellent sound effects and perfect music between chapters. The final products sound like old time radio with over the top acting for the over the top characters created by Hubbard. The voice work alone makes these recordings fun to hear.As for the stories, well I will have to say there is a bit of a pulp fiction formula to them, but Hubbard uses that formula perfectly. I had originally thought this was just a Hubbard gimmick, but following the success of Galaxy Audio/Galaxy Press re-releasing the old pulp-fiction stories other publishers have begun releasing other stories from the pulp-fiction days, and it seems that the formula is a pulp-fiction formula and Hubbard just seemed to master it. That formula? Well, you gotta have a hero, a sidekick (preferably with some strange quirk) a dame and an impossible mission or crime to solve, then throw in some pretty enemies that are impossible to overcome and have the good guys win. It works and let me tell you, it is extremely fun.This story, \\"Orders Is Orders\\" was originally published in the December, 1937 issue of \\"Argosy weekly\\" and tells the story of just such formulaic characters. Two marines, Gunnery Sergeant James Mitchell and Private First Class \\"Tuffy\\" Spivits, and a girl, a fan dancer trying to escape the war-torn area, dodge bullets on a 200-mile trek through embattled China to bring serum and gold to the American consulate, an isolated island of safety in a sea of dead and dying.Japan and China are battling it out and caught in the middle, in the Chinese city of Shunkien, is the American Consulate. The American refugees cannot escape due to the war being waged and the Asiatic form of cholera is threatening unless they can get the serum on time. Sgt, Mitchell is just the man to do it, but he has one weakness, liquor, if he can stay away from it he can stay clear headed enough to get the job done. One of the many things that make Mitchell the perfect candidate is that he was raised in the area. Mitchell's father is a missionary and he was raised there until a falling out caused him to leave abruptly, he's been on his own ever-since.Mitchell and Spivets come to the aid of a fan dancer who is trying to escape, but they end up taking her the wrong way when they commandeer her car in order to make the mission succeed. Along the way they come to where Mitchell's father has set up is mission and find it nearly in ruins due to the war. Since their last car broke down they have to commandeer one and reluctantly Mitchell's father joins in. With constant battles going on they strange landing party fight all odds to get to Shunkien on time without getting the U.S. involved in this war.It may be the old Pulp-Fiction formula, but L. Ron Hubbard could write the action that keeps you hooked until the very end.http://gilwilson.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"Orders is orders (Classic fiction series)","review":"The soldier simply won't give up.

I am so happy I did because in this one in particular (though I've loved all the Galaxy audio stories I've thus far listened to), I felt the main actor (a voice actor by the name of Michael Yurchak) did a phenomenal job capturing the character of Gunnery Sergeant James Mitchell with an appealingly masculine voice that just makes you want him to succeed.

I much prefer talking to people and listening rather than reading - I guess it is a personal thing. However I liked this book for a number of reasons. Firstly I believe that you can read this book cover to cover. It follows a good pattern, starting with basics of testing, test process and risk leading to people issues in software testing. I began reading the book in this way but soon found I wanted to jump to 'favourite' topics and discovered that you can &quot;dip&quot; into chapters without loosing any of the context, which suits my style of reading.I liked the fact that each chapter is written by a different author. This allows variety as well as expertise to flow from the book. Some people feel that you loose continuity when you have so many authors. However because of the individual self-contained chapters, this was not the case with this book. Having different authors, in my opinion, enhances the book.Why we decided to use this book for the Practitioner CourseWe wanted to provide an additional resource to the students attending our ISEB Practitioner Course. The book closely follows the ISEB Practitioner Syllabus and although it doesn't have everything specified in the syllabus and will not be sufficient for those wanting to delve deeper into certain topics, we felt that it gave our students extra study material to complement our own courseware. I feel that this book will not only be beneficial to those wanting to take the ISEB Practitioner Exam, but will be useful to all testing practitioners.Lloyd RodenGrove ConsultantsAugust 2003"},{"Title":"The Testing Practitioner","review":"Most books on testing are from some professional with 10+ years of experience in the field, who one day decides to write a book based on his experiences. What I love about this book is that the personal experiences of the authors are augmented by scientific research. The topics covered in this book are also covered in other books e.g. risk based testing, how to test different quality attributes, testing techniques and the testing process. However where possible ideas are presented with references to scientific research and international standards. This gives the content more credibility as it's not some professional giving his opinion, but more representative of the international testing community. Some of the proposed approaches to tackle a problem (like implementing a new test tool) seem too formal to be practical, especially nowadays when more and more companies are adopting an Agile approach to testing. I still consider this book a must read because it tries to bridge the gap between academics and industry, which makes it one of a kind."},{"Title":"The Testing Practitioner","review":"I was expecting a very authoritative volume.

This book is a quick read and helped me learn how to tell the differnece between a healing crisis and a disease crisis. Over the past 3 yers I have been learing how healing works, what it takes and realize there will probably be unpleasant symptoms while I heal. Read this book for a kick in the direction of healing and not treating symptoms."},{"Title":"The Healing Crisis","review":"It is true that the information in this book is available for free online to some extent, but this book is still a little gem. However you get this information, learning about how feeling worse does NOT always mean that you should stop doing what you are doing with your nutritional healing or detoxification program is absolutely vital if you are trying to improve a serious disease.This is some information on healing reactions that I wrote in a recent article on the topic:-----The idea that you would try a lot of different treatments one by one, discarding those that make you feel more ill and continuing with those which decrease symptoms or disability, seems like a 'no brainer.'Unfortunately, due to something known as a 'healing reaction' the problem is not at all that simple.Many different nutrients and therapies can cause problematic symptoms and side effects which are an indication that the treatment is not a good fit for you and should be discontinued. However, some supplements and therapies may also provoke symptoms which are not merely annoying side-effects but instead healing reactions that are a very good indication that the nutrient or therapy is working and doing what it is supposed to.It may seem counter-intuitive but this means that feeling somewhat worse after starting a new treatment is not always a bad sign. Sometimes, it is a very good sign and even an essential sign that deep healing is occurring.In his must-read (free) online article 'Deep Healing Versus Symptom Removal' Dr Lawrence Wilson writes,'Deep healing is quite different from symptom removal. Symptom removal is the type of doctoring offered by the medical profession and by most holistic doctors as well. Symptoms are the focus, by and large, and the goal is to make them go away. The problem is that symptoms often point to deeper imbalances that are not usually not addressed. Deep healing is a much more profound process. It has to do with restoring the body to its former state of health. This means restoring its energy production system, its oxidation rate, its minerals ratios and much more. Symptom removal occurs as a \\"side effect\\" of these programs. Healing therefore usually takes longer and involves lifestyle changes as well. It is more work for both the client and the practitioner. Lifestyle, in fact, is always central and this is a good way to tell if your doctor is focused on symptoms or on deeper healing. In the long run, however, it saves time and lots of money, and may save your life as well.'It is important that the symptoms from healing reactions remain at a level that the patient can handle however. Very intense healing reactions can be more than your body can cope with and can even be dangerous and potentially fatal in some cases. Patients with diseases such as M.E. patients in particular must go very slowly when it comes to treatments causing healing reactions. Slow and steady progress is the goal.Healing reactions can be caused by treatments which boost antioxidant status, promote detoxification, the clearing of infections or which allow various enzyme reactions to take place which were not possible before or by anything that helps the body to function better and so to heal.This includes high-dose vitamin C, iodine, magnesium, FIR sauna use, garlic (and other strongly antiviral substances), the anti-Candida diet, lymphatic drainage massage, probiotics, a vegetable juice regime and the supplementation of any important or essential nutrient that was previously at a very low level.The symptoms of healing reactions can include muscle cramps and spasms, aches and pains, rashes, strange odours and tastes, heart palpitations and blood pressure changes, tiredness, gastrointestinal or bowel changes, foggy thinking, headache and nausea, or a worsening of the illness generally.There are 3 basic principles in this type of medicine:1. Get the good stuff in. Give your body the fuel and tools it needs to work at an optimum level. Good food, nutrients and all the proper vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Make sure you aren't deficient in anything important as the different nutrients all work together.2. Get the bad stuff out. Make sure your body can detoxify out all the toxic substances and toxic by-products of bodily processes properly. Stop as many toxins from getting in in the first place, and do a detoxification program to get rid of the ones you have. Stop doing or eating the things which cause inflammation and have a pro-oxidant effect, and so on.3. Reduce your body's total load. The total load concept is that lessening the body's overall burden/work and stress level in one area, will improve health generally and improve the body's ability to heal because the body's total load (or burden) is lessened. Fixing one problem frees up bodily resources that can be then be used to help other parts of the body function getter or to heal.As Andrew Saul PhD explains,'Good nutrition and vitamins do not directly cure disease, the body does. You provide the raw materials and the inborn wisdom of your body makes the repairs. Someday healthcare without megavitamin therapy will be seen as we today see childbirth without sanitation or surgery without anaesthetic.'It is a myth that orthomolecular, holistic and environmental medicine rejects science, is not backed up by evidence and research and is not scientific. Orthomolecular expert Abram Hoffer MD explains that it is in fact mainstream medicine, as it is most often practiced, that is not scientific. He writes,'Modern medicine is not scientific, it is full of prejudice, illogic and susceptible to advertising. Doctors are not taught to reason, they are programmed to believe in whatever their medical schools teach them and the leading doctors tell them. Over the past 20 years the drug companies, with their enormous wealth, have taken medicine over and now control its research, what is taught and the information released to the public.'In Detoxify or Die, Dr Sherry Rogers writes,'I have to laugh when people ask me if I do alternative, herbal, acupuncture or holistic medicine. 'No,' I reply. 'We do state-of-the-art medicine. In other words, we find the biochemical, nutritional and environmental causes and cures rather than blindly drugging everything. Sure, herbs are gentler, safer and more physiologic than drugs and holistic medicine attempts to incorporate many diverse modalities, etc. But there is no substitute for finding the underlying biochemical causes and cures. This is real medicine. This is where medicine should and would have been decades ago, if it had not been abducted by the pharmaceutical industry.'Drugs are essential for turning off certain bodily systems in emergencies, pain medications are essential for some patients, but they don't actually fix anything. They don't get to the cause. This type of medicine is well suited to emergency use to a large extent, but the same approach just isn't appropriate for chronic health problems and disease prevention.To use a car analogy, all drugs do is turn off the 'no petrol/gas' light (the symptom) they do nothing whatsoever to actually GET more petrol etc. (the cause of the problem). As Dr Sherry Rogers writes,'Drugs do not cure anything, they merely turn off poisoned and malfunctioning pathways. That is why their classifications are anti-inflammatory, ant-acid, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin inhibitors or ACE inhibitors, HMG COA a reductase inhibitors (cholesterol-lowering drugs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRI, etc. And by not fixing the underlying problem, they allow it to worsen as the innocent patient accumulates side effects from the drug as well.'The best news about this type of medicine is that much of the treatment is not disease specific, so you don't necessarily need to have doctors expert in your disease to help you make real progress with it.-----It is important to note that what this book does not do is provide information on how to heal disease and how to get your healing reactions going. It really is just attempting to explain why healing reactions are an essential part of healing, how to cope with them, and why it is important not to suppress the symptoms of a healing reaction, and so on.Fife does have a book on detoxification out and it is helpful to some extent, but I found it nowhere near as detailed and thorough as the books and websites listed below. It was good in parts but nowhere near the best book available on this topic, in my opinion.To get good information on healing reactions for free online, check out the website of Dr Lawrence Wilson. To read books on this topic see books by Dr Lawrence Wilson, Dr Sherry Rogers and also books on the Gerson dietary plan for cancer and other diseases.While it is true this book contains little new information than that contained in the above listed books and articles, having the information in a handy short book format seems very helpful - especially for patients that are are unwilling or unable to read large amounts of text. Understanding the basic principles of healing reactions is so important if you are very ill and as this book makes doing that just a little bit easier, I think it is a little gem!Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

It has a few too many testimonials but a very good read and easy to understand his writing."},{"Title":"The Healing Crisis","review":"I have now read 2 of Bruce Fife's books (Oil Pulling and Healing Crisis) and I have to say they are expensive considering the content and amount of useful information contained in the books.I have found that most if not all of the information contained in both books can be readily found online for free.Following years of unhealthy eating I recently changed my diet completely. I am relatively healthy with no major illnesses, so my diet change decision was preventation of disease more than anything else.I researched online extensively and cut out caffeine,sugar,salt,junk food and have mimimised as much as I can preservatives and additives in my diet.I eat mainly steamed,grilled and raw food that encompasses a wide range of foods from fruit, fish, vegetables, grains, pulses etc.. I have seen some fantastic results and marked improvement in my overall health along with about 12 kilos of weight loss, and I have had healing crises that lasted a couple of days when I started eating differently. I have had a few other little outbreaks(cold sores, hayfever etc..) that I took to mean the body was dealing with getting rid of toxins and took no medication to hamper the process.Although it's too soon to tell if this means that I have got rid of my cold sores and hayfever for sure, but I do know my hayfever is near enough none existent.When I recently had one of my fillings fall off from a crown I went to the dentist and was told there was an infection in the crown next to the filling-less tooth. I was then told I had to take antibiotics to clear the infection.I was baffled as I had sensitivity in the tooth but no pain so I assumed it was because of the tooth that needed to have a filling replaced. I was very depressed about taking the antibiotics as I didn't want to take medicine to hamper the body's retracing process. I tried Olive Leaf Extract for several days hoping that would clear the infection instead of having to take the antibiotics. I contacted Bruce Fife as I had bought the book in the hope that I could more find out whether what I was experiencing warranted taking the antibiotics or whether I would have to leave my body to do it's work without taking the antibiotics. It had been about a week since I had started the olive leaf extract and now I was experiencing flu like symptoms. Bruce Fife responded by saying I should absolutely take the antibiotics as mouth related infections were very dangerous. This left me really baffled. Fife says again and again in his book not to hamper the healing process by taking antibiotics, yet he had just recommended doing exactly what he says in the book not to do.According to the book, I have just delayed the whole healing process and I am back to square one again. According to his theories in the book I will encounter this problem again if I continue on my health kick as antibiotics don't really cure anything they just suppress the symptoms: it is the immune system that cures the problem.So I am curious to see whether his theory about this has any basis.I absolutely believe that changing one's diet to healthy, whole food has a profound effect in curing alot of illnesses that was caused by eating unhealthily in the first place, but I am not 100% convinced that diet is the answer to all ailments and diseases out there.Autoimmune Diseases are certainly an area not covered (In other words, the body actually attacks its own cells)which is relevant to the subject.Dietary changes are not always enough to tackle autoimmune diseases, which clearly means there is alot more to the immune system than meets the eye!I have now taken the antibiotics because I have a feeling that the amount of time my symptoms have been ongoing means there is a serious infection that needs to be taken care of. I have made the decision to see a nutritionist to make sure the food I am eating is balanced and to ensure that I am not deficient in anything as that could be the case as my immune system doesn't seem to be doing to well in fighting off the infection.While 90 pages of information might be interesting for someone who doesn't know about Hering's Law, or has never heard of Herxheimer's Effect or a healing crisis, for me this book and Bruce Fife's advise was contradictory to what this book and theory was all about and therefore does not hold much credibility for me until I can experiment and see if the results work for me. I will continue to eat as I have healthily, however since this book is not very clear in determining a disease (or a health problem that needs to be addressed) and a healing crisis, I will suggest to anyone who reads this book to consult a nutritionist or someone qualified to give advise on the subject(and not just an author who is just interested in selling books)if like me you are looking for information regarding a health issue and are unsure what to do.I certainly won't be spending my hard earned money on buying Mr.Fife's books.

I assume this is the same book as \\"Orientalism in Art\\". Christine Peltre is a French academic who has written a cursory introduction to the theme of Orientalism in Western Art. Peltre's chapters present different themes in Orientalism which she illustrates with a representative pictures. These themes include such topics as \\"The Invention of the Meditteranean\\",\\"From Decoration to Collection\\" and \\"Serving Colonialism\\". The topics are interesting but she only covers them briefly.\\"Orientalism\\" the paperback, can be purchased for around twenty dollars and is a good value. The pictures are well reproduced and the writing is decent. I would have given it five stars but there is a better value out there for the money. For someone new to Orientalism, I would first recommend \\"The Orient in Western Art\\" by Gerard Georges Lemaire. It costs about the same as Peltre's \\"Orientalism\\" and is a much larger book with more paintings and better written chapters.

Christine Peltre has written a fine history of the 'discovery' of Oriental art in the 19th century by traveling artists and artists who observed the influx of Oriental or Eastern objets d'art. She weaves a fine story, much like a novel, explaining the influences on various artists and how they incorporated the Oriental feeling into their work.Peltre includes among the artists well known for their use of Orientalsim - Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;rme, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Jacques-Louis David, and Eug&egrave;ne Fromentin, Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix - along with other artists whose names may not be as well known, eg the Scottish painter David Roberts, and British painter John Frederick Lewis. The emphasis in this book is on the French School, but Peltre goes on to include more contemporary-style painters such as Kandinsky, Klee, Matisse and August Macke. Her commentary is rich in information and she offers fine references for additional information about this flow of Orientalism into art. The reproductions are generous and of very high quality. Very worthwhile resource book.

As this is a subject exhaustively covered, researched and analyzed for over sixty years it is unrealistic to expect many new facts here. New insights may arise even generations later, however and this slim volume has enough to make the reader stop frequently to ponder and say \\"Now, why didn't I think of that?\\" or take issue. Prof. Lukacs' fresh look at the term \\"isolationism\\" is by itself worth the priceAs to taking issue, Prof. Lukacs is not shy about criticizing the work of other historians or biographers--even quite eminent ones and even in a cranky tone. He is a one-man school of historiography, neither right-wing nor left, European oriented or wholly American, ideological nor determinist.This book is valuable."},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"It seems that a professional historian simply cannot do any worse.First comes complete lack of understanding of the environment he is dealing with. There are two glaring examples of this fatal deficiency:A. There is a claim that Stalin used German word (stahl) as a basis of hist adopted name because of his admiration of Germany. Apparently the author believes that (1) Russia did produce so little steel in 1910 that there was no widely used Russian word to designate this rare material, (2) Georgian I.Dzhugashvili was selecting a pen name suitable for Russian-speaking audience and decided to derive it from an exotic foreign word. The former is simply not true, the latter is completely inconceivable.B. When describing Soviet reaction on the lack of German response on TASS communique of 6/13/1941. He wrote that Beria decided to perform mass deportations from Baltic states completely on his own, without consulting Stalin and may be even against his wishes. Everybody who knows the period even a tiny little bit understands that any \\"satrap\\" would not survive next 24 hours had he decided to do it on his own.Naturally, there are multiple less startling cases of the same lack of understanding.Second, there are numerous minor errors in basic facts. For example, in one place Mr.Lukacs writes that the half of Soviet Air Force was destroyed on the airfields in the first day of war, and in another place he writes that 1200 aircraft was destroyed (which is a lot, but it is less than 15% of the total). When Stavka was fromed 6/23/1941 it was Timoshenko (not Stalin) who became its first chairman. We can only guess about the reasons, but Stalin appointed himself the Stavka chairman only 7/10/1941.And the most important is that the central idea of this book is nothing but silly. The author believes that (1) for the most of his adult life Stalin was nothing but a timid \\"Caucasian chieftain\\" who was killing common folk by millions and his own followers by 100s thousand and all of it without any particular reason, just because he simply did not know any better and (2) at the age of 63 he suddenly emerged as a statesman, a formidable leader and even a \\"giant\\". (IMHO, he was neither chieftain nor statesman, he was just the smartest one among the bona fide communist revolutionaries).And now the horror part: this junk was recommended for history students of a (in all other aspects) respectable private university.Also, I could not find anything in this book that I did not already read in other books (and way better books like D.E.Murphy. The Enigma of Barbarossa) and considering the results it seems that author's trips to Moscow did not amount to anything beyond vodka tasting."},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"There is no new-history stuff about \\"the war from the point of view of the front-line soldiers\\" here, or the sort of analysis of broad econometric trends one might get from Paul Kennedy. No -- there are the two megalomaniacs in his subtitle, each portrayed on the dust jacket staring into the middle distance. One has to accept that focus to benefit from the book.The style of this book is the use of accumulated pointed anecdotes. One of Lukacs' incidental observations -- one made while he works on setting the stage, before he reaches June 1941 -- will give a sense of this style. He tells us that November 1940 was \\"the first time that an American presidential election played a role in the great affairs of the world.\\" Stalin told his foreign minister, Molotov, to delay a planned trip to Berlin until after the US election. It isn't clear from the reference whether Stalin thought such a trip would help Roosevelt or Willkie, but evidently it was thought unwise to remind the US public of the Nazi's alliance with the USSR.Anyway, Molotov arrived in Berlin on November 12. He tried to get Hitler to agree that Finland and Bulgaria were within Russia's sphere of influence. Hitler tried to get him to look at a bigger picture -- how the four of \\"us\\" (Germany, the USSR, Japan, and Italy) can divide the globe. Molotov wasn't a big-picture guy, and Lukacs portrays him as \\"a wooden and unimaginative dolt\\" who kept \\"pecking and pecking away at Bulgaria and finland like a shortsighted woodpecker.\\"When we do get to June 1941, one of Lukacs' main concerns is to rebut the myth, put forward by David Irving and others among Hitlers apologists, that Germany's attack on its ally that month was preventative -- that Hitler had learned that Stalin was about to launch such an attack and simply acted first. Indeed, Stalin was almost pathetically eager to remain true to their alliance right to the end, and although Russian Ambassadors and ministers in capital cities around the world were increasingly privy to the fact that this attitude was hardly reciprocated, that a German attack on Russia was ever more likely, they knew their bos well enough not to communicate these facts to him.\\"Almost without exception,\\" Lukacs writes, these officials \\"were reluctant -- or, more precisely, afraid -- to tell Stalin what he, more and more obviously, did not wish to hear.\\""},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"An informative book covering a pivotal time in World War II.

The most obvious of these attempts:it seems (in Lukacs view) that Hitler invaded Russia only to force an agreement from a position of force with England. But then there are a number of indications leading to the \\"classic\\" interpretation: that Hitler always respected England, and wanted Lebensraum, despised the slaves etc.Additionalliy, all over the text there are scattered alusions to historians who -different from the author- seem not no have grasped what whas really going on. Only Lukacs seems to see the whole picture."},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"On page 51, after having said that he considered Stalin more \\"statesman\\" than Hitler, Mr. Lukacs discovers the startling \\"fact\\" that one of the main reasons for the contacts between Stalin and Hitler was the former's \\"admiration for Germany\\".This is utter nonsense, as the reasons were quite complex and especially pragmatism by Stalin, who knew that the USSR was not ready for war, and that he could not fully trust the Western Powers. (Remember Munich ?)But then Mr. Lukacs \\"supports\\" this \\"assertion\\" with an amazing little footnote saying that Stalin \\"took his adopted name from the Russian transliteration of the German word (Stahl) for steel\\"!!I beg your pardon?Any elemtary dictionary would confirm that \\"steel\\" in Russian is \\"stal'\\" and it is like many technical terms of German origin, but surely no transliteration and no backup for such nonsense.In addition to bias and ignorance, this also betrays an ignorance of the Russian language and culture.

This may not be the definitive resource for the researcher, but for the general public this is an excellent summary of the cogent events and personality dances that resulted in Hitler attacking Russia.Wisely, Lukacs keeps his writing style in the narrative, almost 'novel' manner, a technique that allows the reader to follow an enormous amount of information with complete ease. The focus he has chosen is to describe the events and the effects of those events on both Stalin and Hitler that began as a possible union for world domination but ultimately resulted in fierce hatred and battle between the two countries. Those surrounding the two men (Ribbentrop and Molotov being key players) are examined and their part in the erroneous decision toward war is carefully described. It is a story of power play: Hitler feared England and the United States; Stalin saw the urgency to protect his greed for domination of Europe by siding with Japan. When attempts were miscalculated and the various countries in Europe re-aligned, the Germans invaded Russia with dire consequences.One of the more satisfying portions of this short book is Lukacs' depiction of how Hitler fell from power while Stalin grew in statesmanship, becoming the awesome force he was at the conclusion of WW II. In his discussion Lukacs unravels the mysteries around the power of Communism in the face of seemingly insurmountable foes. It is alarming food for thought.For those who wish to understand the steps that lead to WW II this immensely readable book is most helpful. It is a starting point in probing deeper into the sources of megalomaniacal evil that disrupted the globe and nearly decimated Europe. Grady Harp, August 06"},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"In his book \\"The Duel : The Eighty-Day Struggle Between Churchill and Hitler\\", historian John Lukacs compared the actions of Adolf Hitler to Winston Churchill during the 80 day period from the ascension of Winston Churchill to the office of Prime Minister on May 10, 1940 until July 30,1940. \\"The Duel\\" ends with the decision by Hitler to cease planning for a cross-channel invasion. Instead, Hitler began planning for an invasion of the Soviet Union. Lukacs' new book, \\"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin\\" is a rather brief study of the relationship between Stalin and Hitler in the month in which those plans, Operation Barbarossa, achieved fruition.\\"June 1941\\" is not a monumental piece of writing, nor was it meant to be. Rather, as Lukacs notes, it is \\"less than a monograph but more than a narrative\\". Lukacs provides the reader with a coherent, concise summary of the events of that month. Lukacs does not inundate the reader with minutiae about the battle plans or the invasion itself. I think it fair to say that Lukacs is more concerned with fleshing out the attitudes of both Stalin and Hitler to the other than to the order of battle. In this, I believe he has done a good job.In \\"The Duel\\" Lukacs indicated that by July, 1940 Hitler felt that a cross-channel invasion was not feasible. Hitler felt that if he could invade and defeat the USSR in a lightning strike that England would be compelled to negotiate an end to the war on terms favorable to Germany. In essence, \\"June 1941\\" takes up where \\"The Duel\\" left off. Lukacs makes some interesting statements about the nature of Hitler and Stalin's personalities throughout the book. The include Lukacs' belief that Stalin's personality was not that of a dogmatic Marxist but that of a Caucasian chieftain. As such, Stalin had a respect for Hitler's brutal real-politik and this respect colored his thinking and his seemingly irrational belief that Hitler would live up to his promsises.I did note some direct criticism of other historians that seemed a bit jarring to me, all the more so because they were not really fleshed out but, rather, just left hanging in the air. He describes Alan Bullock's \\"Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives\\" as useless and Constantin Pleshakov's \\"Stalin's Folly\\" as being \\"inaccurate throughout\\". I have read both books and although I am willing to believe that their accounts are subject to dispute as are all historical accounts, I am not sure that unexplained and unexamined criticism such as this is fully warranted.Depsite the seemingingly unecessary criticism I found \\"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin\\" to be a worthy addition to the wealth of material available for people with an interest in this era. Lukacs is an entertaining writer with a solid knowledge of his subject matter. The ability to communicate that knowledge in clear and precise tone is a gift and I have no hesitation in recommending \\"June 1941\\" to anyone with an interest in the beginning of one of the most brutal wars the world has ever seen."},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"This is an odd book that promises much more than it delivers, if one believes the editorial comments of such notables as Henry Kissenger, Strobe Talbott or Simon Sebag Montefiore. Despite high praise from those three individuals, \\"June 1941 Hitler and Stalin\\" never quite lives up to expectations.I was somewhat confused as what exactly the author sought to convey to the reader that was new. Yes, Lukacs is a talented and experienced writer and historian. \\"June 1941\\" is well written and a good read for those who know little about Hitler, Stalin and events leading to the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. If this is the intended audience, the book is a useful, though somewhat shallow, primer. Those with a bit more historical knowledge, however, will find very little that is new or truly insightful in this book.Others will find a great deal that is confusing and contradictory. For example, in the main body Lukacs suggests that, had Stalin not overstepped himself in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, Hitler might not have turned against Russia. Yet at the end of the book, Lukacs notes that an attack by Hitler on the Soviet Union had always been the German leader's intention. There can be little doubt, based on Hitler's own writings in \\"Mein Kampf\\" that the latter is true.Finally, there is the matter of the length of this work. According to Lukacs, \\"June 1941\\" is less than a monograph and more than a narrative summary. Indeed, the book is only 145 pages long, not counting appendices and end notes. Perhaps a longer work would have allowed Lukacs to focus more on his very interesting analysis of the relationship between Hitler and Stalin. This would have made the book a much more compelling and historically important work."},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"John Lukacs has quite a reputation in some quarters. On my first exposure to him, I don't understand why.\\"June 1941\\" purportedly covers the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, Hitler and Stalin in June, 1941. Lukacs' writing style is difficult: English written by someone who has taken it up in life as a second language. And English written by someone given to asides and parentheticals. Some sentences require several readings before meaning can be teased from them.The content is also troublesome. This very slim volume adds nothing substantively new to our understanding of why Hitler invaded Stalin's Soviet Union. Lukacs' attempt at explaining the situation beyond the known falls flat on its face: Lukacs can force nothing new from what is known. He introduces specious arguments about long-discredited \\"secret\\" correspondence betwen Hitler and Stalin.What is most bothersome is Lukacs' frequent carping and potshots at other historians. Alan Bullock's classic \\"Hitler and Stalin\\" is dismissed as \\"useless,\\" for example.As noted, Lukacs has a following, but I question what they are following. Lukacs strikes me as a strutting martinet who long ago passed his prime.Jerry"},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"June 1941 is a succinct essay on Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. The format is similar to his work \\"Duel: Churchill vs Hitler\\" dealing with the beginning of World War II in the West. The book is a good introduction to the motivations and men who monstrously led the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.Lukacs' posits his belief that Hitler attacked his erstwhile ally Soviet Russia in order to bolster the war against England. He thought that by destroying the Soviet Union the British would have no ally on the fringe of Europe to assist them in their battle against Fascism.Hitler's army of over three million troops failed to seize Moscow and Stalin proved triumphant in the bloodbath that became war on the Eastern Front. Stalin was too trusting of Hitler, says Lukacs, refusing to believe that the German dictator was planning a massive invasion of the Soviet Union. When the German hordes assaulted Mother Russia the Soviets were unprepared. Stalin, however, and his leadership recovered and this brutal and evil man became a statesman who led his land to a costly victory. It was only after World War II that the alliance the Soviets had made with the West was broken by Cold War politics.Lukacs is a fine historian who writes with elegance and grace. He is not afraid of stating his opinion. This book is short but would be a good book to assign in a college course on World War II. Lukacs sometimes says more in 100 pages than other academic historians whose books are much longer in length. This little book is worth your time."},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"This is a very disappointing book, especially given some of Lukacs' earlier works.The author has not consulted the latest available material about Stalin's offensive war preparations against Hitler. His treatment of the Stalin-speech to the Politburo on August 19, 1939 is also wrong. Lukacs claims that the speech is a forgery, but in fact it's contents have been confirmed by the diary-entry of Comintern-Leader G. Dimitroff (see his long entry on Sept. 7, 1939) and the instructions to the Communist Parties about how to jusitfy the Pact with Hitler.The book suffers from Lukacs' inability to read Russian books and his shallow overview of available material in English and/or German laguage.Not recommended!"},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"As one of the previous reviewers have already stated, this book promises more than it delivers. However, it does cover in detail what happened in June, 1941. Stalin was deceived by Hitler and the Germans even though it was well known that those 185 divisions sitting on the Russian border were not there for the climate. The information was so well known that at least a dozen sources issued the alarm before the invasion actually occurred. The author does a good job detailing the state of Stalin's mind and why he was deceived. Both Stalin and Hitler had a healthy respect for each other.This is an OK read about a fascinating event. The German invasion could have turned the pages of history, but other events (Japanese actions) actually sealed Hitler's fate. The author is a respected historian and offers some new insight on some minor details."},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"Imagine a noted historian sitting down one day with you to help you understand one of the great political/military questions of the last hundred years---Why did Hitler invade the USSR in June of 1941?

This is not a tale of specific military movements but one of the deadly political motivations and purposes of two powerful world leaders.The prose is clear, with opinions sharp and cutting."},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"There is not a great deal that is new in this - but the focus on the German invasion of the Soviet Union is definitely an enthralling topic. Mr. Lukacs does well to emphasize the two main protagonists; this should come as no surprise as Mr.Lukacs believes that history is predominantly the making of individuals, not movements or causes. He also emphasizes the center points of Moscow, Berlin, London and Washington (and Tokyo as the Germans had spies there). He examines how these points shifted over the course of time leading up to the attack and how this affected the power structures that evolved after these momentous events."},{"Title":"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin","review":"I found this short book enlightening and a fascinating glimpse into the minds and characters of two of histories greatest villains, responsible for the deaths of tens of millions.

Fascinating read."},{"Title":"Knickerbocker's History of New York,","review":"Washington Irving's A Knickerbocker's History of New York is the single funniest book in American literature. Despite a weak and too-lengthy opening segment on the origin of life and other awkward philosophical questions (the merits of this section are addressed by Irving/Knickerbocker in volume two), once the Dutch colonize the ancient island of Manhattoes (present-day Manhattan), Irving hits a rollicking gallop, going full stride at full speed and doesn't stop until the dubious William the Testy is vanquished at the first volume's end.\\"Diedrich Knickerbocker\\" was arguably the greatest of the several personae Irving adopted during the course of his long writing career. 'Diedrich' penned 'The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow' and 'Rip Van Winkle,' as well as short stories 'Wolfert Weber,' 'The Devil And Tom Walker,' 'Kidd The Pirate,' and 'Dolph Heyliger.' Irving achieved magic whenever he wrote, but when he steps into Knickerbocker's antique Dutch shoes, the combination of humor, history and folklore that results is unique, sweeping, and highly entertaining.Few writers could or would dare to write the kind of poetic sentances Irving/Knickerbocker could, such as \\"the inhabitants were of primitive stock, and had itermarried and bred in and in, never swarming far from the parent hive.\\"All lovers of American literature and history, and of Americana generally, should know this delightful, warm and amusing book. Too often today, when addressing the origins of American literature and our early writers, we turn to names like Hawthorne and Poe, forgetting that Irving came first and was in fact the first American writer ever to be taken seriously by Europeans. (It was Hawthorne and Poe that paid lip service to Irving, who was born a full 21 years before Hawthorne and 26 years before Poe.) Some historians and critics go so far as to credit Irving with the creation of the short story as a literary form; he was also the U.S. ambassador to Spain, a world traveler, a biographer of George Washington, and at one time requested to run for mayor of New York City (an invitation he kindly declined). Thanks largely to Irving, the New York City and Hudson River Valley areas have a thriving plethora of myth and folklore all their own. As Americans, we owe the dynamic, magnanimous and prolific Irving a great debt, which decade after decade we neglect to pay or acknowledge.Knickerbocker's History of New York is not difficult reading, though it is too advanced for children and most teenagers. However, any young adult or adult with a love of American history, particularly with an interest in the founding of our country or the American Revolution specifically, will find it fascinating. Humorists will find it a page-turning delight, and send their volumes of Twain back to the library post-haste...."},{"Title":"Knickerbocker's History of New York,","review":"In 1809 Washington Irving published \\"A History of New York,\\" the work that make him instantly famous. Conceived as a parody of Samuel L. Mitchill's guidebook \\"The Picture of New York\\" (1807), Irving's \\"History\\" purports to be written by the fictitious Diedrich Knickerbocker. It was, perhaps, the first American book to be embargoed by the publisher--that is, it was published in Philadelphia to keep its contents secret from the press in New York. Before the book was published, Irving and his friends even coordinated a hoax through the local papers, publishing a series of notices advertising Knickerbocker's inexplicable disappearance: \\"there are some reasons for believing he is not in his right mind,\\" and \\"a very curious kind of written book has been found in his room.\\"The book was such a success that Irving revised it repeatedly during his lifetime, and readers should note which edition they are purchasing. Most recent editions reprint either the original text or the last revision, which are so different that they may as well be considered different works. By the time of the Author's Revised Edition of Irving's collected works, published in 1848, Irving had completely rewritten over a tenth of the book, added about 7,000 words of new material, softened the sarcasm, eliminated the mocking references to Jefferson's presidential administration, removed many risque passages and double entendres, and polished the overall style. The barbs are more personal in the earlier edition; Irving aimed his parody more broadly forty years later. In sum, while the earlier edition was considered more scandalous--even \\"naughty\\"--and cheekier in its wit and tone, the last edition is certainly more polished and \\"mature\\"--and might be considered by many as noticeably easier to read. (The remainder of this review focuses on the 1809 edition.)The book's conceit is that the fictitious Knickerbocker, a Dutch descendant, nostalgically mourns the passing of Dutch hegemony on the island of \\"Manna-hata, Manhattoes, or as it is vulgarly called Manhattan,\\" and he offers a rousing defense (read: mock hagiography) of the Dutch governors. But Irving's satire is aimed not simply at the long-dead colonists of New York; his depictions of various Dutch leaders evoke many of his contemporaries. Thus, Wilhelmus Kleft seems an awful lot like Thomas Jefferson, and Jacobus von Poffenburgh recalls General James Wilkinson (who was caught up in Aaron Burr's allegedly treasonous schemes against Jefferson's government). The \\"hero\\" of the book, however, is Peter Stuyvesant, whose glorious qualities are manifold--even if his rule was considered authoritarian and his last act as governor was to rebel against his own king, who had ceded Manhattan to his brother, the duke of York.Irving, as Knickerbocker, also mocks the pretensions of historical scholarship. He offers philosophical justifications for the obesities of city leaders (\\"Who ever heard of fat men heading a riot?\\") and praises the well-honed Dutch civil defense against Yankee encroachments (\\"Never was a more comprehensive, a more expeditious, or, what is still better, a more economical measure devised, than this of defeating the Yankees by proclamation.\\"). He interrupts his narrative several times with admonishments to the reader or faux biographical meanderings, and, near the end of the book, he acknowledges that his tone has changed from that of a \\"crabbed cynical, impertinent little son of a Dutchman\\" to a \\"most social, companionable regard.\\" Of the many readers that began his book, \\"some dropped down dead (asleep) on the field; others threw down my book in the middle of the first chapter, took to their heels and never ceased scampering until they had fairly run it out of sight . . . Every page thinned my ranks more and more.\\"This last self-deprecatory joke is certainly the case for modern would-be readers: Irving's archaic prose can be a slog, and his historical and literary references will perplex even the most arduous. But not all the humor is dated, and quite often patient readers will be rewarded by a comment or pun that may even cause them to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Knickerbocker's History of New York,","review":"Perhaps 100 years ago, readers considered this to be a great book.

The book left me tormented; I couldn't wait for the next chapter to come out.Since I was separated and suffering through an unfair and unwanted divorce, I had so many questions why the justice system I loved and believed in seemed to act so irresponsibly. I couldn't understand why the unfaithful were coddled while the faithful were brutalized, robbed of possessions, robbed of child custody. I could not comprehend why children were given over to unfit parents with documented mental illnesses and abusive behavior. I needed answers. I knew how things were supposed to work, but I wanted to know how they really worked. And, I wanted to know why.Stolen Vows turned on the lights. Things became clear fast.Divorce is a multi-billion dollar industry. Judges, attornies, and others in the divorce industry have a personal financial interest in the destruction of your marriage and mine.Stolen Vows shows how current no-fault divorce laws were sold to Californians and how they spread rapidly poisening marriages and families throughout the U.S. Judy wrote this book from the perspective of an insider--a divorce mediator who discovered how her job and others and the unjustice of the court system were hurting families.Some will hate this book. Some will try to silence or hide it. Those who earn wealth from the destruction of little children's families will not appreciate Judy's professional and well-researched exposition of corruption and the harm in current no-fault divorce laws.This is written from the perspective of an insider--a woman who was once a divorce mediator who became aware of how her job was hurting marriages. She became aware of so much unjustice in the divorce system and its harmful effect on children and families, and soon after, she found her office door locked.Read this book and pass it on, or buy copies for your friends and family.

The studies make for painful reading. Children raised by single parents end up poorer, more poorly educated, frequently emotionally damaged, and frequently unable to form emotional bonds with other people. They are at many times greater risk for drug abuse and sexual problems than children from intact homes. Some studies have shown that 80-90% of those who end up in prison came from single parent households. That's a pretty staggering statistic.For the sake of these children, changes to the divorce laws are urgently needed.\\"Stolen Vows\\" points out another fault in no fault divorce. It means, essentially, there is no marriage contract. You cannot break a contract you agreed to about your house or your car. But when it comes to marriage if one person wants out, that's it, the contract is void. The man or woman who wants out is in control and can force a divorce upon an unwilling spouse.Yet, \\"Lawyers and other profressionals with whom I worked often minimized the pain of divorce. They characterized divorce clients as just 'emotionally out of control'\\" (P 93)instead of seeing that the grinding legal process could be the cause of problems.Anyone who reads this book will certainly want to read Maggie Gallagher's seminal work on divorce, \\"The Abolition of Marriage\\"."},{"Title":"Stolen Vows: The Illusion of No-Fault Divorce and the Rise of the American Divorce Industry","review":"This is a brilliant and insightful book which is very readable. A few books deal with the travesty of unilateral no-fault divorce, but this one is the best that I've read. It focuses clearly on the main issue of the laws which allow this. Also, it answers questions which I had when I first learned about no-fault divorce: How could any sane person possibly think that this is a good idea? How could this idea not only have gotten started, but even spread through the country to become the law in most states.Compared to Stephen Baskerville's TAKEN INTO CUSTODY which covers some of the same ground about injustices of \\"family law\\", this is a much smaller book and much more conversational, not so filled with footnotes. But also it focuses on the main issue and avoids mixing in other controversial matters such as gender bias and VAWA and right-wing political views. Few people who read STOLEN VOWS with an open mind will come away unconvinced.Just a couple of very minor things could make this book even better:1. I don't agree with the author's statement in the last chapter that reform must be at a national level because changes in state laws will just send people over the borders to other states with easier divorces. To the contrary, I think that reforms of state laws will be a big help, that this is a more realistic goal than national reform, and that most people can't easily cross state borders to get a divorce without the consent of both spouses.2. Also, the author perhaps doesn't make sufficiently clear that elimination of unilateral no-fault divorce is not necessarily forcing people to stay in unwanted marriages. Divorce is not the same as walking out of a marriage, it is a lawsuit. Anybody can walk out the door at any time. The question is whether or not the plaintiff should have a chance to force the defendant out of his/her home and take his or her money and children even though the defendant did nothing wrong.Unfortunately, this book seems to be out of print now. Used copies are available but sell for quite a lot more than the original price. I got a very beat-up copy of this 180 page paperback for $[...], though it was worth every penny.

Most of the essays are considered and well researched, and the occasional good idea does creep in. Tagged throughout with Christian outlook, this rarely oppresses a reader not sharing that view, though the book might level better by adding input from other great faiths (many ayaat from the Qur'an make pertinent connections to Trek for example).One problem I've found infecting similar attempts is a detectable bias of the author. Taken as a whole the work does not suffer this, although a few exceptions do greet the reader like a coffee table on the shins. (The title of my review reveals several such bruises; the original series is maligned repeatedly, with misquoted, selective evidence, as anti-theistic.) And this book does suffer from a plenitude of sloppy editorial errors, including a bibliographical howler - it *must* be a joke, right? - in misspelling Phil Farrand's name.All in all though, this book remains an impressive achievement and a credit to the contributors.

His masterful creation serves as a roadmap for anyone who wishes to trace the true influence of Catholicism upon the formation of the modern world.From the stalwart simplicity of Peter and the prosaic acclaimations of the goodness of God penned by Clement I, down to the more recent and politically volatile legacies of Paul XI and Pius the XII, Mr. Craughwell artfully crafts an enthralling, intriguing, and inspiring legacy of the Pontiffs that will undoubtedly become a standard household reference for all Catholic families."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of the Popes: A Collection of Statements of the Popes Since Peter on a Variety of Religious and Social Issues","review":"If Mr. Craughwell had just given a collection of statements from the popes over the last 2000 years this book would be great. If one is looking for a collection of statements by the popes then buy this book. The problem that I have with the book is the introduction/commentary that Mr. Craughwell offers at the start of many of the chapters, especially the commentary at start of the chapter on the Mass. In the prior chapters he showed how the popes have always helped the Church understand in a new way the truths that have been revealed to the Church since the begining. But in the chapter on the Mass he how the post Vatican II Mass has been a mistake by Paul VI and has led to a decline in the Church. I personally don't think he is right but that is another matter.

Eli didn't do so and died with his daughter naimg a son to show the glory of God had departed Israel. Saul gave up on God and paid the price in insanity and in God replacing him as leader. David's lapse from the presence of God caused him endless family and kingdom problems in his later life.David was, by and large, a man of God. His dance before God shows this.

What is shown in great clarity, through powerful stories of people who experienced it, are the psychic hardships faced by colonial and postcolonial Africans who are essentially without culture, as well as how strong culture shock was for white missionaries in the late colonial period. Turnbull also does much to give the reader an appreciation of old traditions including initiations and secret societies.A reader who is not already an expert on the subject will come away from this text with a far better understanding of both postcolonial Africa and the human condition.

If you were to strike up a conversation with any person 90 years ago I would think their speech would shock modern sensibilities on the race issue. In Menckin's case, I encourage you to read about his actions in the race issue - the fact that as an editor he published African-American authors when no other mainstream publications would do so. That he opposed segregation and had many friends he actively and publicly supported that were of a diverse nature religiously and racially.If you want a good weekend read with bookends from the beginning and the end of the twentieth century, pick up \\"The Vintage Mencken\\" and \\"Eat the Rich\\" or \\"Parliament of Whores\\" from P.J.

L. Mencken. H. L. Mencken (1880 - 1956) was a journalist and writer who was born and lived in Baltimore for most of his life. Mencken is perhaps best known as one of the founders of _The American Mercury_. Mencken's commentary on American life and politics in the early Twentieth Century is often bitter, sarcastic, cynical, and abrasive, but the intent is almost always humorous. Mencken is also well-known for being brazenly politically incorrect and has been criticized extensively for his alleged \\"racism\\" and \\"anti-Semitism\\" by the usual suspects. However, like all Mencken's opinions, his views remain highly idiosyncratic and difficult to define, and Mencken frequently rails against \\"Ku Kluxry\\", though whether he is being intentionally ironic is difficult to determine. However, while Mencken's challenge to the political correctness of his day is to be applauded, in certain respects he can become infuriating. Among other things, Mencken takes on Prohibition, religion, \\"puritanism\\", racial equality, the plutocracy, American militarism and World Wars I and II, Presidents Wilson and Roosevelt, feminism, Anglo-Saxon superiority, the South and rural people, populism, \\"quackery\\" in medicine, fundamentalism, and anti-Darwinism. Philosophically, Mencken appears to have been influenced by the caustic style of both Mark Twain and Nietzsche. Mencken's political views have been described as libertarian (and he even at times uses the very word \\"libertarian\\" to describe the general gist of his viewpoint); however, they differ in certain respects from modern libertarianism. Mencken also retains an elitist attitude, frequently looking down at rural people and the middle classes (what he ironically calls \\"the American booboisie\\"). Mencken also is believed to have been an ardent Social Darwinist and was a defender of Darwinism against religion. He also had very idiosyncratic views on race and frequently made deprecating remarks about blacks and Jews (though privately he had many friends of both races), which has led some to claim that he was a racialist. However, his views on race are complicated (as he also attacks Anglo-Saxons and certain points about segregation towards the end of his life) and thus may be seen as despising all races. In terms of religion, Mencken is frequently considered a \\"free thinker\\" and possibly an agnostic or atheist and he frequently refers to himself as a \\"heathen\\" and \\"infidel\\". However, like all things concerning Mencken it is difficult to discern exactly where he stands on any issue, partly because he is frequently contradictory and takes contrary positions merely to be contrary and partly because his intent is frequently humor and thus one can never be certain how serious he is.This book begins with essays by Mencken featuring comments on his early life in Baltimore. Mencken describes the brutal surroundings in which he grew up as well as youthful experiences at the Y.M.C.A. (before he became fed up with their preaching and abandoned it). Mencken would retain a lifelong distrust of religion which frequently bubbled over into hatred. His hatred seems to be particularly directed against various American versions of Protestantism (Baptists and Methodists) as well as \\"puritanism\\" and may have been in part caused by the excessive efforts of religious to prohibit alcohol at the time. (Even G. K. Chesterton was to praise Mencken's efforts against \\"puritanism\\" and Prohibition while at the same time castigating him for his irreligion.) Included also is an essay by Mencken on cops which details Mencken's generally positive experiences and view of them. Mencken sees cops as largely honorable people (he frequently distinguishes between \\"honorable\\" and \\"moral\\", of which he is cynical) and defends them from charges of graft and corruption. Mencken also defends the sort of folk wisdom of the Baltimore policemen, arguing against the intrusion into their domain of more book-learned individuals. Another essay of Mencken's deals with the novelist Theodore Dreiser, a man whom Mencken admires. In a separate essay, Mencken tells the story of his involvement in the Cuban revolution as a reporter. Mencken also has much to say about George Washington (who he admires), Abraham Lincoln (who he also appears to somewhat admire though he maintains that in contrast to his popular image Lincoln did not intend to free the slaves and that Lincoln may have been a non-believer), and the commonplace of lying as well as the universal public hatred of truth-tellers. Mencken also expresses his distrust of democracy (which he sees rooted in envy in the same way as he sees \\"puritanism\\") and the need for a genuine aristocracy (as opposed to the plutocracy). Mencken next goes on about the failure of American letters, he comments again on the failure of democracy and the need for an aristocracy as against the plutocracy, and he also notes the silliness of the obsession with the \\"Reds\\" that existed at the time. Perhaps one of Mencken's best essays is his essay \\"Star-Spangled Men\\" - a highly sarcastic commentary on America's military culture, patriotism, and the absurdity of World War I (Mencken also states that he maintains the same feelings towards World War II). Mencken also exposes the silliness of various fraternal organizations such as the freemasons as well as expresses his hatred for Woodrow Wilson (the arch-puritan). Mencken's commentary on women and the relationship between the sexes is profound (although sure to displease any politically correct feminist). Mencken's views however are not anti-woman, but merely realistic. He shows the differences between the sexes and appears to put woman on a pedestal though noting certain other deceptive aspects of her nature. In an ironical essay on the Anglo-Saxon, Mencken argues against Anglo-Saxon supremacy, maintaining that while the Anglo-Saxon is prone to braggadocio he is largely a coward and a failure. Mencken notes that many in America have Celtic blood and thus are not true Anglo-Saxons. He also appears to praise other European races instead. Some have maintained that this essay on the Anglo-Saxons is an argument for Germanic racial superiority (Mencken was partly Anglo-Saxon himself but mostly German) and thus an expression of disgust at the Anglo-American involvement in the world wars. In other essays, Mencken comments on Holy Writ, music, Prohibition (Mencken is an ardent promoter of alcohol), and religion and Darwinism. Mencken mocks rural people, the religious, anti-Darwinians, chiropractors, Freudians, and much else. In a particularly disgusting essay, Mencken engages in a tirade against populist hero William Jennings Bryan. Mencken also has much to say about F. D. R., Coolidge, the presidency, the Supreme Court (and its horrendous attempts to destroy the rights of Americans), segregation, death, and several other topics.I certainly applaud much of what Mencken says in his efforts to lift up the veil of the political correctness of his day. However, there are certain aspects of Mencken that I find particularly disgusting. For example, in his early essays, Mencken revels in his youthful abuse of animals (something intolerably sickening). Mencken also is a vehement critic of religion and rural people. While Mencken is largely correct about much of American Protestantism, his complete denigration of religion is uncalled for and would make any latter-day elitist liberal proud. (Ironically, Mencken appears to have had some admiration for the Roman Church and may have even predicted the disasters that befell it with the advent of Vatican II. Mencken notes for example that someday they will \\"translate the liturgy into American\\" and thus ruin the Roman mass.) Mencken's comments on rural people are equally disgusting. But, perhaps most disgusting is his assault on the populist Bryan who adamantly opposed Darwinism.Today, Mencken is read by all sorts. Liberals, secularists, and \\"rationalist skeptics\\" frequently express admiration for his comments on religion and rural people; however, they then try to excuse or downplay his racialism, hatred for democracy, hatred for F. D. R., and opposition to World War II. For example, the arch-liberal S. T. Joshi has quoted Mencken on religion while at the same time castigating him for his hatred of Roosevelt. Liberals and genuine conservatives alike have also found an ally in him in their opposition to the \\"neoconservatives\\". On the other hand, Mencken has also found supporters among those who maintain an idolatry of the free market, while they ignore his comments on the \\"plutocracy\\". All such attempts to co-opt him for various modern causes are pretty disgusting overall. In many ways, Mencken himself was a disgusting man who was too arrogant to believe in a personal God and looked down upon rural people. However, in terms of his opposition to World Wars I and II and his hatred of Roosevelt, Mencken is refreshingly correct. Roosevelt is today worshipped by all kinds from leftists to neoconservatives, but his disgusting policies put into effect have utterly decimated the underpinnings of the United States. I am certain that Mencken himself would be horrified were he to witness the world of today.For a modern day iconoclast in the spirit of Mencken, one should consult the works of the late Australian philosopher David Stove. Also, for a book which features Mencken's views as well as those of other political alternatives consult Willis Carto's _Profiles in Populism_."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"Some classic Mencken here.

Mencken was born in Baltimore in 1880 and for his developmental years was a &quot;bookworm.&quot; He resolved to pursue a more active life as he grew and discovered his niche in journalism. In 1899 he went to work for the Baltimore Morning Herald and found the going difficult at first, but as he persisted he discovered that was where he was most suited and kept the title &quot;newspaperman&quot; the rest of his life. He remained in his home town and continued to live in the home his family had lived in rather than seeking career advancement in larger markets. One of the first essays in this collection is one he wrote about his hometown, &quot;The Baltimore of the Eighties.&quot; Another early one describes the local YMCA. His piece on Theodore Dreiser contains a segment on the art of communicating via the written word. A tribute to William Jennings Bryan which was published in the American Mercury in 1925 is included in this collection. Other pieces are on the people, times, circumstances, and issues of the era in which he made his observations. While I do not agree with him on many topics, his work demonstrates the efforts of a skilled writer."},{"Title":"Look-Alikes","review":"We found this book to be fascinating.

(Buildings made of fig newtons; thumbtack glassware at the soda fountain; an upside-down iron as a boat.)However the actual children were a bit blown away. They looked at it and were interested, however many of the objects used were things they'd simply never seen and so couldn't pick out. What 4-year-old can tell that a bunch of tulips is really pistachios on sticks? Even the 11-year-old had never seen a flour sifter and therefore wasn't impressed by the sifter/water tower.On the other hand, their mother (age 34) and my boyfriend (age 33) spent as many hours as I did on this book and are still delighted with it.I personally collect beautiful children's books as a cost-effective alternative to coffee-table books.

I've had this book for a year now (we keep it in our bathroom) and I've still not found everything!Each photograph is magnificent, and well taken, while the collages - for want of a better name - are really ingenious. Some objects take forever to find - the peanut pony tail, the mushroom car tires, and some are perfectly obvious, though you'd never have considered that a disposable razor could look like a vacuum cleaner. It's beautiful to look at and fun to explore. If only Steiner had left it at that and not tried to write poetry to go with it. The rhymes are unbelievably inane and stilted and take away from rather than add to the book.This edition may actually be too difficult for children, as many adults seem to have trouble finding all the objects. \\"Look-Alikes Jr.\\" came out soon afterwards and is much simpler, though just as much fun; much more suited to the under 12's and the less patient!This book will last so long and provide so much enjoyment that it's well worth buying for the whole family."},{"Title":"Look-Alikes","review":"This is a book that has been entertaining to all family members from the age of 9 to 78 years of age.

Even without close scrutiny the immediate &quot;feel&quot; of the photos is that you are glimpsing into a moment of time long gone. There is an &quot;old world&quot; feel to the pictures. Upon closer review you are repeatedly amazed at how your eye first deceived you. Absolute creative genius is what makes this book one to purchase-for any age.

This self-taught artist employs everyday items--tea bags, Fig Newtons, miniature hair combs, matches, tissues, strips of licorice, graham crackers, torn-up sponges, pencils, and so much more--to create the most astonishingly lifelike scenes.You can see everything from a port city with boats arriving to a soda shop to a candy store to a classroom, each filled to brimming with trinkets and everyday articles of every kind, each employed as something other than what it really is (Fig Newtons as seat cushions, for example). The result is utterly fascinating. You will spend hours looking through the book--you may even, as I have, try to hide it from your kids so YOU can finish looking at it! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Look-Alikes","review":"All three of my children love this book.

You'll never look at ordinary items the same way again once you see how she creatively puts together her pictures. Children and adults alike will be fascinated by this book. If you want to give a child a book he or she will look at over and over again, this is a good choice."},{"Title":"Look-Alikes","review":"My kids love these books. My son checked one out at the school library. My husband and I were amazed at the detail these pictures have. It puts I spy to shame. My kids look at these books all the time. Great for the car, or restaurants, they keep my seven and four year old happy, and I also enjoy looking at all of the cool pictures. They use everyday items and combine them into ordinary things. For example a chair might be made up of pretzel sticks for the legs, a ritz cracker for the seat, and something else for the back. There are hundreds on each page! Amazing!"},{"Title":"Look-Alikes","review":"Joan Steiner is amazing.

The Barnard graduate author, a self-taught artist, created a deft and clever craft that enchants young and old alike. Each of her two-page spreads presents a quaint scene fashioned entirely from everyday objects. The result is one of the most original children's books I have ever seen.The book opens with a steam engine made from a coffeepot and four train cars made from a briefcase, cardboard box, pocketbook and six pack box. They ride on a track fashioned of screwdrivers and TV antenna. The decorative details prove equally delightful. The engine's wheels are made of cap guns, rolls of film, batteries, ballpoint pen tops, toy handcuffs and wristwatch and compass faces. The train chugs forward with cotton steam pouring from a thread spool smokestack, and its toy truck, harmonica and nail clipper cowcatcher at the fore.A train station (the next stop) is built of fever thermometers, disposable razors, paint brushes, measuring tape, tennis rackets, silverware holders, an egg slicer and a vegetable steamer. The other scenes include a city-scape, general store, park and zoo, amusement park, sweet shop, hotel and circus.You get the picture.For anyone who can't figure out what's what, the author includes a seven-page appendix describing the type and number of trinkets with which she filled each scene.This book provides endless fun.--- Alyssa A.

For example, a concession stand at a train station is made out of a funnel; the 40s retro lighting fixtures at an old style deli are actually white rubber drain plugs. The central activity is to locate and identify these visual tricks. There's a snippet of text on each page that list some of them for you to find - some easy and some devilishly hard.Beyond the \\"Where's Waldo\\" type gameplay, these images succeed on a several other levels as well. They are big and colorful and a visual feast of detail and happy narrative content. They are superb dioramas which fascinate the modeling monkey bone.

There is the wit and snappy dialogue, the profusion of quirky characters, the quick summing up of key points of the narrative, complete with names and motives in rapid succession and the use of violence at key moments to speed up the plot. If Carver created this narrative map, others then followed his trail. It is just too bad it is so well-trodden."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Disclaimer: I began reading THE BIG SLEEP knowing that Humphrey Bogart plays the story's narrator, detective Philip Marlowe, in the screen adaptation. However, I haven't seen the movie, nor read a single Chandler novel until this book.Nevertheless, I forgot Bogart about as quickly as a smile vanishes when an unasked-for bucket full of cold water is thrown at it. After all, what kind of hard-boiled macho knows interior design, alludes to Marcel Proust, or can resist the desperate advances of a naked woman?For example, here's how Marlowe describes Eddie Mars's place: \\"It was wainscoted in walnut and had a frieze of faded damask above the paneling.\\" Damask? Get outta here. Marlowe does this repeatedly, and by the mid-way point, I concluded that Marlowe is about as hard boiled as a three-minute egg.Regarding Chandler's style, it could be argued that he overuses the simile, because this device sometimes calls attention to itself. For example, \\"The plants filled the place, a forest of them, with nasty meaty leaves and stalks like the newly washed fingers of dead men\\" is the third of four such similes in a single long paragraph in chapter 2.Nevertheless, this book moves so rapidly, you'd better be wearing a seatbelt. A bigger mystery seems to loom behind every solved one leading to a surprising conclusion."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I picked up The Big Sleep after the author of one of my favorite new authors of last year, Richard K. Morgan, was compared left and right to Raymond Chandler. The comparison was apt, and Morgan should be flattered, because Chandler is a genius.This book is Chandler's first and it introduces his hero, Philip Marlowe, a smart-mouthed, hard-boiled private dick who is straight as an arrow. The mystery is a wonderful tale, but what makes this book great is the noir writing. The characters are all cynical and full of wonderful 1930's slang. The first person narrative is also laden with delicious similes: \\"I was as empty of life as a scarecrow's pockets.\\"Five stars for Chandler and this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Yes Marlowe has to deal with the usual seedy world his investigations take him to yet agian, as he deals with societies richest lowlifes.But this time around he has a pair of sisters complicating things for him, and in fact one of them could be his twin sister seperated at birth who gives it to him as good as he dishes it.Chandler's style paints a vivid picture of this world for us as we watch Marlowe get himself into and out of situations as he tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"No one living or dead can write like Raymond Chandler. The &quot;Big Sleep&quot; is one of is best. Through his use of similes, descriptions, analogies he transports you to another era. The detective he fashions is more than believable. I have read and continue to reread all of his books.It's like time travel for $7.95. Unfortunately, no movie adaption has ever done them justice, Bogie's version of the Big Sleep came close, but was too poorly edited. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler's &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; is a perfect starting place for people who want to get in the &quot;Private Eye&quot; world of books. With incredible, and often humerous descriptive powers, Raymond chandler creates a story setting that reads as if you are watching the old black and white films. You can't help but imagine at how any competent director would film this book. With the colors, fogs, the roads, the clothing and above all the carachters that make you want to scream out in frustration. The information you know they have but aren't saying makes you feel as if you are standing next to the detective Philip Marlowe as he meanders through this book picking up clues while not seeming to give one iota about the people around him.Philip Marlowe is one of the first Private Eyes and may be the best. He is drawn so clearly that by half way through the book you know before it happens how he will respond to certain situations, and if you're really smart, you'll solve the mystery before he does.The Big Sleep is worth every minute of your reading time. I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys this genre."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I thought I knew what detective fiction was like before I had even heard of Chandler. Having browsed most of Christies, Doyles and the what-nots, I was magnanimous enough to believe that I ,a minor scribe, could WRITE a whodunnit very well. The epistemological hurricane that redefined 'well' came with the Big Sleep. Chandler is slick, and I have just made the understatement of the century. I am writing this review twenty days after having turned the last page, enabling me to say so much. Of course, when I had turned that last page, only a four-letter expression of dumbfoundedness had escaped my lips. One of the sentences that kept reverberating in my mind -&quot; Dead men wigh heavier than broken hearts.&quot;This is not detective fiction. This is the kind of fiction whose description is beyond the scope of the English language."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"For pure entertainment value, I'd read The Big Sleep rather than The Maltese Falcon, even though the latter is a better crafted novel.The Big Sleep excels in providing a story through the eyes of Phillip Marlowe, private investigator. He is hardboiled and warned that he is too violent, but the toughness and fake toughness is required by his line of work. He is clever and his understanding evolves as in all good mysteries, but he questions how smart someone can be to face death for $25 a day and expenses. He is a student of men and women, but finds that sometimes his hunches are dead wrong. He is a man of principle who does not take advantage of clients or situations, but breaks the law and kills when required.The Big Sleep portays the tone of life as a private investigator, straddling the line between legal and illegal, bending rules, trading favors and working with the marginal characters and industries of a big city. The pace is frantic. The doublecrosses are layered. Night overshadows day. Everything is for sale, lease or trade. Law enforcement varies by officer or mood. The right interpretation of a statement or situation might save your life or end it.The audio version narrated by Elliot Gould is outstanding."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I finished my last Raymond Chandler novel sitting on a bus in Whittier, and the knowledge that I would never again get to read a new Chandler was one of the low moments in my life. Everything that can be said about Philip Marlowe and about his creator has already been said. Other than Dashell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon, Chandler has no peers."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This is the only novel by Chandler that I even like. I can't comprehend how his work before and after this book were so divergent from my taste when this one was so spot on.The Big Sleep has all the right elements: a noir landscape (well before \\"noir\\" was coined as a critical idiom in film - the phenomenon of \\"noir fiction\\" is more or less parasitic on film noir); an existential detective with a hardboiled code; an aesthetic vision worthy of T. S. Eliot; and all those elements, scattered throughout Dashiell Hammett's works, which I have come to call \\"the Hammettesque\\" (something which Chandler did not sufficiently achieve after the Sleep, in my opinion).The Big Sleep is ripe; I can never praise it enough."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I'm not into detective stories, and I had never read Chandler before this; neither have I seen the movie. So, I guess my opinion could be seen as quite objective. Did I like it? Why not - it had a certain sense of style, a certain fascination, present in every comment by every character. As it comes to dialogue, Chandler is a master. That's easy to admit.That much for the good sides; there were weak points too. Most of all Chandler's descriptions seemed to me somewhat pretentious and heavy. Maybe that's just time doing its tricks on us mortals. Also, the plot could've been more gripping. When I compare The Big Sleep to James Ellroy's great modern detective novels, also set in the old L.A., I must say that Ellroy's incredibly sophisticated plots always make me stay away till late night. The same can't be said of this book. But I'm pretty satisfied anyway, it is very rare that 'a classic' turns out to be even this good."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Except for his \\"Poodle Springs\\", Chandler's last [unfinished] novel, which Robert B. Parker completed for him, we're new to the exploits of Philip Marlowe. We're not sure we find him that likable a character, although he's a stereotypical \\"hard-boiled\\" private eye in the tradition of Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade. He is indeed a persistent cuss; and the ladies seem to all fall for him, disrobing at the slightest provocation, usually to their own frustration, as Marlowe seems to be more the looker than the doer!As most would aver, Chandler can turn beautiful phrases and is well known for outstandingly descriptive simile. We were really charmed by something on just page two: \\"Then she lowered her lashes until they almost cuddled her cheeks and slowly raised them again, like a theater curtain.\\" Nice, eh? Unfortunately, to us, the author's skill at plot development doesn't match his wordcraft.In \\"Sleep\\" (his first novel, published in 1939), Marlowe takes on a job to stop a wealthy ex-General's daughter from being blackmailed by a sleazy Los Angeles porno promoter. He takes care of that matter soon enough but eventually noses into the missing husband of the other daughter, the job everybody seems to think the General really wanted solved. As the story develops, a quagmire of underworld types, with some more murders and attempts on Marlowe himself thrown in for good measure, propel us toward a surprising conclusion. Having discovered the brutal truth, would a professional sleuth really turn his back on the police and the court system in favor of his own dispensation of \\"justice?\\" We doubt it.We'll admit this tale holds up well for being close to 70 years old! And there's plenty of enjoyable suspense as the book unfolds. We suspect if this book could be re-edited to clean up some of the confusing middle-book plot, it would be a top notch mystery. But as is, \\"Sleep\\" is certainly an entertaining novel - one that compels us to try at least one more Marlowe just for fun!"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"On its own, this may have been an excellent book, but I just finished reading a whole series of short stories by Raymond Chandler, and one of those had a significant amount of overlapping material with \\"The Big Sleep.\\" Some of the lines were almost virtually identical. I felt like I was just reading the long version of that short story, and as such, this novel held no tension for me. It just felt pointless. So I quickly gave up."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"HEAVY SPOILERS INCLUDEDIn his debut novel to introduce private eye Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler seems to have combined two different short story materials into one plot. The first case, which looks complicated on surface but turns out quite simple, is completely resolved within the first half of the novel. Then Marlowe starts getting himself involved in further search of missing Rusty Regan, partly because of curiosity and partly because of his occupational ethics. It develops into another fruitless adventure. At the abrupt ending, Marlowe intuitively discovers what has happened to Regan. From Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon, Chandler inherits the tradition of hardboiled detective story, a femme fatale being the one who has done it, which would be inherited to Mickey Spillane's I, the Jury.General Sternwood is blackmailed by Arthur Gwynn Geiger, who is a tenant of Eddie Mars, whose wife appears to have run away with Rusty Regan, who is a son-in-law of Sternwood. In a small circle everyone tries to take advantage of everyone else, while old General Sternwood is hopelessly dying; it is reminiscent of Shakespeare's King Lear.While Chandler's already-established signature similes entertain readers (e.g. \\"... using his strength as carefully as an out-of-work show-girl uses her last good pair of stockings,\\" \\"He had tight brilliant eyes that wanted to look hard, and looked as hard as oysters on the half shell,\\" \\"The purring voice was now as false as an usherette's eyelashes and as slippery as a watermelon seed,\\" and so on), the writing in general is raw, plain and dry, comparing to the more polished, sophisticated and sentimentalized one in his later works."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I was raised to believe Chandler was just this brilliant writer ... &amp; he was ... but perhaps it's become a knee-jerk, unquestioning thing to say how brilliant he was ... because revisiting &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; after lately reading Jim Thompson I was disappointed: the book doesn't win in a comparison with, say, &quot;The Killer Inside Me.&quot; Chandler has these moments of brilliance (especially the clever phrases that rightly won him immortality in dictionaries of quotations) but he's not all that. Sure, the atmosphere is wonderful &amp; Marlowe is a great character ... but the plot's confusing &amp; tiresome &amp; I'm not impressed by hearing that's because he wanted to achieve a certain impression.

I thought the exchanges between Marlowe and the kid (who killed the guy who killed his boyfriend) were great also, but immediately after that scene, I folded. It's probably my issue with private eye novels anyway, but aside from the wonderful dialogue, I had a hard time swallowing and ultimately couldn't/didn't finish The Big Sleep ... i became too anxious to read what was waiting in the bin (The Leopard).

I certainly felt the cigarette filled rooms smelling of booze and rumpled detectives, but the storyline was uneventful. I will rent the DVD to see what Hollywood made of the book.

There was so suspense, the characters were flat and undeveloped, and I couldn't get past the misogyny/racism/etc. The book was entirely devoid of any emotion at all. It provides an interesting historical look into that society, but other than that, I could not have enjoyed it less. I think part of the problem was that this theme has been improved upon so much over the years, it is hard to look back at the beginning and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Review of the book The Big Sleep by Raymond ChandlerWhat was the point, January 14, 2004Reviewer: Sleepy-head, from NowhereI know that the setting of this book was set way back in the 1920s, but why was this book so boring? Even literature back then was even at least somewhat interesting. I know that this book is a classic mystery novel, but there was really no riveting mystery involved. At least there was a little mystery involved, though. To give it some credit, Chandler's uses of similes were great in some areas, but he used them way to often. This book was very boring in my opinion. There is nothing exciting about it. It really was a 'Big Sleep.'"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep is a first person narrative about private detective Philip Marlowe. The novel is considered a classic crime detective fiction story. Chandler perfectly builds the setting of the underworld of Los Angeles in the 1930s with memorable character, dialogue, and an interesting plot.Chandler builds this world with a sparse-style that is of the same mold as Ernest Hemingway and Raymond Carver. His writing is tight and crisp, which keeps the speed of the plot moving fluidly, and rapidly.The story begins when Marlowe is called on by a crippled millionaire, General Sternwood, to investigate Arthur Gwynn Geiger; the General wants to know more about the man with a blackmail attempt against one of his two 20-something year old daughters, Carmen Sternwood.Seems simple enough? Well, lets just say the plot is complicated. Geiger turns out to be running a pornography racket, ends up murdered in his house with a naked and drugged Carmen sitting next to him. The next morning the Sternwood's chauffeur turns up murdered.The pornography racket leads to Joe Brody, a two-bit hustler, who tries selling naked photographs of Carmen that were taking minutes before Geiger was murdered. But before Brody can get even more involved in the story, he gets murdered.If that isn't plenty, the plot gets further complicated when you toss in a casino owning gangster, a hit man, a few missing people, and another hustler with a lead to Silver Wig. Marlowe eventually solves the blackmail situation, but soon gets on the chase for a missing ex-husband, which leads to a wild grand finale - A murder mystery. The plot is so involved that Chandler forgets to mention who killed the chauffeur!Today, most readers would not even wince at the storyline. But, Chandler's novel must have been considered controversial to audiences when it was printed in 1939, especially because the story included themes such as pornography, homosexuality, and inter-racial relationships; even the 1946 film version starring Humphrey Bogart had to change some of the plot to make it suitable for the audience.But what makes the novel such a great read is the character Philip Marlowe, the wisecracking, heavy drinking, and chain-smoking private eye. The character, like the plot, is also complex. Marlowe acts tough throughout, but also has a heart. Instead of calling the cops on Carmen, which he could do for a number of reasons in the story, he just wants her to seek help; and he doesn't even take advantage of her when she's lying naked in his bed. He just throws her out. He also plays chess and likes poetry.Marlowe's quotes are also memorable. When the General asked him how he liked his brandy, Marlowe responds \\"In a glass.\\" But my favorite line was: \\"You know what he'll do when he comes back? Beat my teeth out, then kick me in the stomach for mumbling.\\" Wisecracks like these are constant throughout, which makes the story a fun read.If you appreciate them, you will also appreciate Chandler's metaphors with lines like \\"Dead men are heavier than broken hearts.\\" I recommend The Big Sleep; it's a classic. A definite must read."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"What a great read. I am a major fan of noir fiction and after reading \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\", I craved another novel to fulfill my addiction and this one popped up. Chandler was way ahead of his time (it was published in 1939) and as cliche as it sounds, I simply could not put this book down. This is a classic that should be read and savoured by any fan of noir fiction."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I'm not much into crime fiction, Bunker and Ellroy excepted but Chandler's prose - oft imitated but seldom bettered - still rates as some of the best in this (or any other) genre. So take the writing, add the drawl and empathy that Elliott Gould (see alsoThe Long Goodbye)brings to the proceedings and you have a classic recording. The packaging is tacky, the sound reflects the date it was recorded but the end result still delivers. Trust me - this is one to load up on your phone, iPod or good old fashioned cd player.Beach Bum - Cornwall UK"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"For a book read for class, this is by far one of the best I've had to read.

He first meets Carmen, the younger daughter who is a few cards short of a full deck. The General stays in his hothouse, looking like a near corpse. He tells Marlow about Rusty Regan, the older daughter's third husband, who suddenly disappeared last month. The real job is the gambling debts of Carmen. Before leaving, Marlowe meets Vivian, the spoiled and ruthless older daughter, who asks about his assignment. Chandler painted a picture of a powerful and corrupt family whose wealth far exceeds their judgment. Marlow represents the real people who must follow the whims of the ruling elite. Chandler used many words to describe the surroundings and background, more literary than Hammett or Gardner.Marlowe began to investigate the man who had Carmen's gambling chits. Geiger's store rents \\"rare books\\". Marlowe followed Geiger to his house, then waited and watched. When he heard shots Marlowe broke in. Carmen was seated, nude with pin-point pupils. Geiger lay dead on the floor. Marlowe rescued Carmen and drove back in her Packard. Marlowe walked back to Geiger's house (not taxi driver with a memory for him). He found Geiger's body has disappeared! Next the Sternwood's chauffeur is found dead in a car that went into the ocean; was it murder? Marlowe shadows Geiger's store again, and learns more. The journey towards the truth continues.Who killed Geiger? And Taylor the chauffeur? Gathering the facts allows the solution of the puzzle. Chapter 19 tells how the newspapers covered the stories. Chapter 25 has the news on a missing couple that Marlowe isn't looking for. Marlowe drives to this small town, locates the isolated house, and finds danger (Chapter 27). Marlowe explains his actions to General Sternwood, and gets another assignment (Chapter 30). The surprise ending occurs in Chapter 31. Little hints had been sprinkled throughout the book, but a reader would not pick them up. We see what we expect to see in most cases. The final chapter has the solution to Regan's disappearance. Marlowe orders the solution to the remaining problems and leaves, trusting his advice will be taken.The moral of this story reminds me of \\"Love Story\\" where someone poor falls in love with someone rich, and the poor person comes to a bad end. As Owen Taylor did. Do the rich get away with murder, literally? Do the wealthy spend their time with drink, drugs, gambling, sex, and other thrills? Would higher taxes on estates and trusts prevent this problem? Note how the super rich use the underworld to solve problems that can't be delegated to lawyers.For a faster paced style of murder mystery, read Erle Stanley Gardner."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"The first book of Chandler's Philip Marlowe series is an especially interesting read for those who've seen the classic film with Bogey and Bacall. The film is actually a fairly faithful adaptation of the book, with all references to pornography removed. This is odd, because the story is about blackmail and pornography. Cinemaphiles will read the book and at key points think \\"oh, that's what it was about.\\"Be warned: when you start reading Chandler, you're going to read two or three in a row."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Originally published in 1939, The Big Sleep is the first novel to feature fiction's legendary private eye, Philip Marlowe. The book starts off with Marlowe visiting the majestic estate of dying millionaire, General Guy Sternwood. As the General hires Marlowe to investigate a bookdealer who is extorting him for one thousand dollars, he happens to mention that he sorely misses the company of his son-in-law, an ex-bootlegger, who has inexplicably disappeared. A very fast paced and eventful search for the truth ensues, during which Marlowe encounters many colorful characters. Topping the list are the two wild Sternwood daughters, Carmen and Vivian.The Big Sleep contains subject matter considered racy by 1939 standards. Specifically, pornography and homosexuality both play key roles in advancing the story. Chandler's writing is no less than masterful. The dialogue snaps, the descriptive passages are vivid and the complex plot comes together at the end.There are really two main characters, Marlowe himself and the city of Los Angeles. Marlowe is a loner and if he is not an alcoholic, he could easily be mistaken for one. Always ready with withering put downs, he is a world class cynic who paradoxically adheres to a high minded code of honor. Los Angeles is portrayed as a dreary place, often rain soaked and in the throes of serious growing pains. The claustraphobic, shattered lives of many of its inhabitants made all the more grotesque by the coexisting wealth and glamor.The Big Sleep has earned its reputation as an American classic and definitely qualifies as a must read."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"In the world of noir literature Raymond Chandler is the undisputable king. With his novels starred by the private Detective Philip Marlowe he creates an unique world that set the patter for the novels -- and later the movies --called noir.Written in 1939, \`The Big Sleep' is his first novel featuring Marlowe. And it was so successful that became a franchise, but what's more important, it influenced almost every single writer who tackled detective fiction. The plot is not the most important thing in this novel. It is complicated and confusing, so leaving it aside, one can enjoy all the undertones that are part of Chandler's work.More than a single genre, Noir is a way of life --for a writer, at least. Everything matters in the book, that's why the narrative is so full of a vivid description of places and women mostly. It is hard to follow who is blackmailing who and why. But it is a joy to read the description of a cigarette being lit by a woman, or the way the smoke dissolves. These descriptions are what make the prose so full of texture and brilliant. Not to mention the Californian glamour that surrounds every single page of the book. Those rich people know how to live end have pleasure.Marlowe is one of the best --if not THE best-- detective created in the literature. Before him, they used to be a little boring and too nice. Marlowe is violent, visceral and he is not worried of being nice and gentle. In his trip into the darker side of the underworld he comes across every kind of criminal --which, by the way, are so alive that one starts wondering how Chandler knew so much.All in all, Chandler is one of the most important writers of detective thrillers ever, and influenced hundreds of other authors --in positive and negative ways --, but in case of doubt stick to the original."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Go read it.This book was actually created from a couple of short stories that Chandler had written earlier. I recently happened to read a collection of short stories which contained two of the main stories which it borrows from. The integration of characters and plots is really amazing. Hats off to the man."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I'm not into detective stories, and I had never read Chandler before this; neither have I seen the movie. Did I like it? Yes, why not - it had a certain sense of style, a certain attraction, present in every comment by every character. As it comes to dialogue, this book has it all. That's easy to admit.That much for the good sides, there were weak points too. Most of all Chandler's descriptions seemed to me somewhat showy and heavy. Also, the plot could've been more mesmerizing. Compared to other detective novels I have read in the past, this one might not do so well. Incredibly sophisticated plots always make me feel confused. Too much glamour in the plot seems like a desperate need to gain attention. But I'm pretty satisfied; it is very rare that 'a classic' turns out to this good."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Chandler is, bar none, the best writer of the so-called \\"hard boiled detective\\" genre, and this is his greatest work.In a labyrinthine plot featuring corrupt, orchid-growing millionaires, beautiful blondes, gray men with guns and the cynical, deeply romantic narrator-protagonsit Marlowe, we see Los Angeles of the 1940s as Marlowe looks for the truth about murder, pornography and, ultimately, loss.The sheer genius of Chandler's writing-- aside from the accompished plot twists-- is his deceptively simple language, which sparkles, and his narrator's deadpan wit. From the descriptions of women (\\"Inside was a blonde. A blonde! A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window.\\") to the caustic remarks in the face of death (\\"She would either shoot me, or she wouldn't.\\") to his existential comments (\\"I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun\\"), Marlowe is as entertainign to lsiten to as he is to watch.Chandler's achievement here goes beyond the action sequences, or the wit of his narrator, or the complexity of his plots. His narrator, the tough-as-nails Marlowe, appeals because he is profoundly romantic at heart, but doomed, like Hamlet, to be disappointed. Like Hamlet-- who writes a play to discover the origins of his misery-- Marlowe too is a storyteller, whose stories lead to one kind of understanding, where actions and sequences finally cohere. But Marlowe's dilemmas are Hamlet's, in that although he can tell the story, his sense of what it all means at the end is far from complete.Chandler's stories are really about people who are lost. Marlowe's quest to find the body and re-tell the story-- although always successful-- is always undermined by his elliptical and understated awareness that, for all our ingenuity and striving, it all ultimately comes down, as it does for Hamlet and for all of us, to the big sleep."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Yup. Any modern American crime novel worth it's salt can trace it's genetic lineage back to this book.To be initiated into the world of Raymond Chandler without formal introduction was an exhilarating experience. Yes, it's hard to not use the term \\"hard-boiled\\", as his work is often simplistically described, but it was so much more than that. Oh so much more. Or is it that most other hard-boiled writers offer so much less...?First of all, I laughed. A lot. Do you know how difficult it is to write comedy? To write something that causes someone to laugh out loud? The dialogue here is to die for. To. Die. For.I agree with others who compare Chandler's Los Angeles to Dickens' London. After reading those authors, it becomes second nature to imagine life there. You can see what exists beyond the page. Another exceedingly difficult feat to perform, but Chandler here makes it look effortless.Most important, we see the creation of a character as indelible as Holmes in Phillip Marlowe. Chandler was lucky to have had Bogart play him in the film; it's a perfect match. You see his face, deliver these lines with that voice, while you're reading this book. It's crime novel nirvana.With his first novel, Chandler vaulted into the pantheon of great crime novelists. I think time has proven he's also a great American novelist.His other six novels sit on my shelf, beckoning me as I type this...I gotta go now..."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler's THE BIG SLEEP was the first of his novels featuring private detective Philip Marlowe. In creating this tough-as-nails, chain-smoking, heavy boozing investigator, Chandler was one of the first writers of the ''hardboiled\\" mystery genre. While its style has become a tradition over 60 years since it was first published, it is important to understand how original THE BIG SLEEP was. Literature had only seen before gentleman detectives such as Sherlock Holmes solving the mysteries of the genteel classes. THE BIG SLEEP, on the other hand, involves the seedy Los Angeles underbelly, with a cast of gamblers, con-men, and perverts.The book opens with the visit of Philip Marlowe to the estate of old, dying General Sternwood. The general's two daughters constantly vex him by getting into all sorts of trouble. One's a infantile neurotic, the other's mired in gambling debts and has already been thrice married. Sternwood hires Marlowe to resolve the blackmail of one of his daughters by a shady bookseller. Once bodies start to drop, however, it becomes apparent that Marlowe is in for more than he bargained for.In his Philip Marlowe novels, Chandler was more concerned with creating characters of various degrees of depravity, dialogue, and narrative style than with plot. In fact, only in the last three pages does he put all the pieces in place, in such a fashion that resolving the mystery seems like an afterthought. Nonetheless, the reader enjoys the ride. Marlowe's thoughts, which we get from the first-person narrative, and the witty dialogue is entertaining enough.THE BIG SLEEP is also a window on a period of American history much different from the present. Nearly every scene has the characters lighting up, whether pipes, cigarettes, or cigars. In one scene, the police harass a homosexual boy with glee. In few other books do we see there sorts of details which show how Los Angeles of 1939 was not like it is today.All in all, I'd recommend THE BIG SLEEP. Even if this doesn't seem like your genre, it has an important place in American literature."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"You may have wondered where the booming mystery book market in the USA started. There were a few key writers who got it off the ground in the 1930s and 1940s. Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain are two of the writers everyone remembers. Chandler's detective was Phillip Marlowe and rather than the mystery's taking center stage, Marlowe took it with his observations of the human condition and how the best and worst of people could be brought out. There's always murder, greed, money and sex and this novel is steeped in all of those ingredients. There are two sisters, daughters of a wealthy man in the heyday of Los Angeles, back when it was small. It is this family who Marlowe will investigate and penetrate. Humphrey Bogart played Marlowe on the screen very well and Robert Mitchum, later in life, also did a heck of a job. I like reading about (novel) and seeing (movies) in its authentic setting of 1940s LA. It doesn't seem dated to me at all. It seems like a historical piece and totally works. The Big Sleep itself is death, what else?"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"&quot;The Big Sleep&quot; opens with private eye Philip Marlowe being summoned to the expansive estate of the aged and wealthy General Sternwood. Sternwood hires Marlowe to investigate a blackmailer who has been involving Sternwood's wildly misbehaving younger daughter in some embarrassing indiscretions. Marlowe's trail leads him through a labyrinth of murder and deceit, and it is impossible for the reader to guess the real story behind Sternwood's daughter's trouble until Marlowe analyzes and reveals the scheme at the end of the book.As he explains in his essay &quot;The Simple Art of Murder,&quot; Raymond Chandler disdained the linear &quot;whodunit&quot; style of mystery and set about to turn the genre upside down with this, his first Marlowe novel. Chandler's style of designing a complex plot and inserting the detective somewhere in the middle to put the pieces together was to be a big influence on many crime writers to follow and particularly on a TV show like &quot;The Rockford Files.&quot; (Jim Rockford was not unlike a '70s version of Marlowe, and many of the episodes featured similarly complex plot structures.) While some of Chandler's dialogue, situations, and props may seem a bit dated, his mindbending plot concept seems as fresh and exciting today as it must have sixty years ago."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"What more can or needs to be said about Raymond Chandler and The Big Sleep? Not much. The Big Sleep was his first novel, introduced Philip Marlowe, and is often considered his best work. The Big Sleep is a good whodunit, but Chandler shines when he examines the corruption that bubble up from the underworld of pornography, drugs, and illegal gambling. Chandler also takes the reader on a tour of a now-long gone Los Angeles.Is Chandler's work \`literature'? Chandler thought so. Here's how Chandler defined literature: \\"When a book, any sort of book, reaches a certain intensity of artistic performance it becomes literature. That intensity may be a matter of style, situation, character, emotional tone, or idea, or half a dozen other things. It may also be a perfection of control over the movement of a story similar to the control a great pitcher has over the ball.\\"If you've ever enjoyed a detective story, a crime story, any kind of noir fiction, then you owe it to yourself to read Chandler and there's no better place to start than here at the beginning. The book is only about 150-230 pages long, depending on the edition, so trying it out for yourself will not long detain you. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"A vivid use of simile compounded by a strong story line - all surrounding the just-arriving urbanization of Los Angeles - makes this one of the great American classic crime novels.Chandler's writing is short and quick. Occasionally, he may drop a unique word upon the reader, but more often his reader receives a simile or description which does not mirror or even compare to the British writers of the same generation. One example: \\"he felt as empty as a scarecrow's pocket.\\"And, Chandler is not trying to deliver a hidden meaning within the story. There is no hidden symbolism. It is merely a story. Well told. Extremely well told. All by an extremely talented writer.Chandler's debut book (first published in 1939) with similarly intriguing novels by contemporaries James Cain, Dashiell Hammett and others helped mold many subsequent great crime writers (Micky Spillane, John MacDonald, and James Ellroy among so many others) to create a uniquely American literary venue. This book may have inspired all of the before-mentioned writers. This book, almost 70 years after initial publication, still reads well and most probably will inspire many more writers.This is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler's first novel, The Big Sleep, is the best mystery/crime novel I've ever read and even one of the best novels I've ever read.

By learning more about 1939, I was able to reflect on today and look at current events with a better perspective. I feel that I now understand current times better because I know what &quot;it used to be&quot; like.I recommend this book not only to mystery lovers, but also to anyone who wants to read a good, well-written book. If you've not read a good book in a while and would like to, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Though I'm not much of a detective fiction fan, I was drawn to try this one because I'd heard the names of Raymond Chandler, and Philip Marlowe, his creation, since I was a boy. A short, moody and convoluted tale of a tough-guy detective with a brain and real moxie, this one lives up to its hard boiled reputation.Marlowe shows up at the Sternwood estate to undertake a quickie investigation into an apparent blackmail attempt (and, hopefully, to suppress the matter) at the behest of a dying old man who is clinging to life even as he angles to protect the two miscreant daughters of his twilight years. Both daughters are wild and careless of others, and prone to fall in with bad company . . . and to do even worse things. But Marlowe soon learns that the trail to the putative blackmailer he must follow leads inevitably from murder to murder, while the one person who means the most to old man Sternwood still hovers, missing, in the background. What happened to ex-bootlegger Rusty Regan and why did he take a powder when he had everything going for him including the beautiful elder daughter, and all the money she stood to inherit, of General Sternwood?As Marlowe follows one trail into another, the deaths get messier, the cops get angrier and Marlowe approaches his own brush with mortality at the hands of a deadly gangland enforcer. The dark and decadent ambience of mid-twentieth century L.A. hangs like a sullen rain cloud over this entire tale as Marlowe fumbles about, trying to figure the real mystery behind the series of apparently coincidental killings he is faced with until, in the end, he confronts the big sleep that awaits us all.This tale seemed rambling and almost accidental in its construction, just like real life, albeit with a tad more style. And it kept me hooked and satisfied, like a good drag on a newly lit cigarette in a noirish Bogart flick, right through to the end. I'm ready for another.SWM"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Chandler, as a writer, wrote the best novels about L.A. There have been a few, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Day of the Locust. But his four books written between 1939 to 1943 are the best. What makes his books so good? The answer is contain in a single word: style. Chandler's prose has what he said Dashiel Hammett's lacks---overtones, echoes, images. It is also a perfection of control over the movement of a story similar to the control of a great pitcher has over the ball. Chandler wrote with classical dispassion of a romantic and violent society. He had the gift of tongue; he was a poet. Metaphors flowered from him in language utterly suited to the exotic people and places. The inhabitants are all there to life---garage men, room clerks, carhops, grifters, grafters, and house dicks. Marlowe's world cannot be touch by time."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"THE BIG SLEEP is unmistakably a Raymond Chandler novel, since it features bitter solitary drinking, lyrical metaphors, dishonest cops, rich and reckless dames, high-placed crooks that flout the law, and the relentless Philip Marlow, who has stubborn and bootless integrity. But in TBS, Chandler's first novel, all of these elements have a slightly subdued quality. As a result, I'd say that this novel shows what Ray was able to produce when he first reached beyond the pulps, which published his short stories. While TBS is tightly plotted, it's Ray's subsequent books that actually extend the boundaries of what's possible in the PI genre and create literature.In TBS, Ray has Philip Marlowe answers two questions: What happened to the pornographer and his business? What happened to Rusty Regan? In answering these questions, Marlowe moves through 32 chapters, each of these a scene in which Marlowe pushes the story forward while interacting with only one other character. TBS demonstrates why Chandler soon captured the attention of Hollywood, since this novel is, essentially, 32 taut and well-wrought scenes, ready for conversion to the movies.TBS has many terrific moments. My favorites include Marlowe's second meeting with Captain Gregory, who says: \\"Brother, I sit here all day on my fanny and I don't look as if I had a brain in my head. But you'd be surprised what I hear.\\" Another favorite is Marlowe's meeting with the lowly grifter Harry Jones, who he calls \\"a small man in a big man's world.\\" Nonetheless, I must say that Chandler's plot ultimately depends on improbabilities, such as Marlowe hearing the sneaky Canino commit murder or Agnes calling the office of her boyfriend, where Marlowe picks up the phone. Even so, a person makes his own luck, I guess.Recommended to Ray's fans."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler is a 20th century American classic.

It's one of those books that I read when I'm feeling down, or that maybe I don't want to be a writer, or when I have a fedora, a cigarette, some whiskey and no case to occupy my time.[...]"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this \\"greatest and archetypal noir detective thriller,\\" as one reviewer called it. I had heard other mystery writers compared (favorably or unfavorably) to Raymond Chandler, and now realize why...he was one of the first to write in this style (this book published 1939). I kept thinking throughout that Philip Marlowe sounded like a Humphrey Bogart character...only to find out from reading the reviews that indeed he WAS played by Humphrey Bogart in a movie with Lauren Bacall. Cool to read the book that is credited with starting the genre.The protagonist, Private Investigator Philip Marlowe, is the character who dominates the book...his personality, his thinking, his dialogue. He's cool, he's suave, and he's clever. Often he's humorous or insanely inappropriate (especially by today's politically correct standards), but that's part of his charm. I highlighted a few lines that I enjoyed or admired:\\"The General spoke again, slowly, using his strength as carefully as an out-of-work show-girl uses her last good pair of stockings.\\"\\"Under the thinning fog the surf curled and creamed, almost without sound, like a thought trying to form itself on the edge of consciousness.\\"\\"You can have a hangover from other things than alcohol. I had one from women. Women made me sick.\\"\\"It seemed a little too pat. It had the austere simplicity of fiction rather than the tangled woof of fact.\\"\\"She'd make a jazzy weekend, but she'd be wearing for a steady diet.\\"I agree with other reviewers who admit that while the plot is somewhat convoluted, the characters and dialogue make the read totally worthwhile.There's nothing modern about this great mystery, but it deserves its classic status."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I listened to this version which was narrated by Elliot Gould. I could not ask for a better narrator. His reading of the book gave the perfect voice for Philip Marlowe. The story centers around the Sternwood family - an aging and ailing father and his two adult daughters, one is being blackmailed. The body count mounts as Marlowe follows the clues. Sometimes the murder happens in Marlowe's presence. As rough as Marlowe seems to be, he does have integrity to the very end."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"A dying millionaire hires Private Detective Philip Marlowe to take care of a situation involving his youngest of two daughters. It seems that she has either been losing a bit too much in an illegal casino or is the victim of blackmail. Either way, Marlowe's job is to make the trouble go away. But this doesn't even scratch the surface of what's waiting for him as he begins to investigate. Before long, the same daughter is present at the scene of a murder, a pornography ring is part of the puzzle, as well as the usual collection of cutthroats and tough guys. Meanwhile, the older daughter's husband, a former gun-runner, has run off and absolutely everyone assumes Marlowe was hired to find him.The Big Sleep, written in 1939, introduced Philip Marlowe to the world and has been entertaining readers ever since. When writing the snappy patter associated with this type of detective fiction, it's a tricky balancing act to make it funny and colorful without degenerating into a self-parody. Chandler not only accomplishes this, he makes it look easy. The dialog and narration deliver plenty of chuckles and offer many a well turned phrase, but are also polished to silky smooth perfection. The plot is a bit convoluted, but this is a detective story after all. The story has to have layers for the hero to keep peeling back and the main thing is that they're all interesting enough to keep the reader wanting to see what happens next.While I don't think anyone would call this novel one of the great character studies in American literature, it's still safe to say that this is not a cast of two dimensional cardboard cutouts either. Marlowe, in particular, is both well developed and likeable. Lesser characters are obviously not developed as thoroughly, but most get enough nuance in how they speak and carry themselves that you don't feel that they're generic in any way.For those who have seen the movie, I should caution that the book is quite different in many ways. A lot of the original story goes into territory that was strictly off limits in the Hollywood of that era. Also, while Bogart was very entertaining, he's fairly different from what you'd picture reading the book. A young James Garner would probably be closer to the character I picture while reading the novel (I know that Garner would have been too young to be in the movie, that's not the point). The main thing to remember is that however much you might have liked the film, reading the book will be a different experience and you'll need to accept that going in.The Big Sleep is my first experience reading Raymond Chandler. I found it a true page turner and completed it in one day. I'll definitely buy more of his work and consider this one of the best books I've read in some time. This is a very easy book to recommend to anyone who is either curious about trying Chandler's work or a fan who hasn't gotten around to this installment just yet."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"The Big SleepRaymond Chandler\\"I went to bed full of whiskey and frustration and dreamed about a man in a bloody Chinese coat who chased a naked girl with long jade earrings while I ran after them and tried to take a photograph with an empty camera.\\"Only Raymond Chandler could write a sentence like that. He's easy to parody, but impossible to improve on. In \\"The Big Sleep\\" (1939) he leads us through a sleazy LA world of hookers, pimps, pornographers, blackmailers, gambling junkies, and floozies too many to mention.Their indiscretions lead Philip Marlowe from one red herring to another. Marlowe manages to keep his head high and his standards out of the gutter that surrounds him.It's easy to see how much Chandler influenced everyone who followed him, consciously or not-- Mickey Spillane, James Ellroy, Sue Grafton, Elmore Leonard and so on.Some of his work is dated: Greater Los Angeles was still surrounded by Orange and Avocado groves, gang-bangers didn't rule neighborhoods, and the Papparazzi hadn't taken over Sunset Boulevard. Men still wore hats and dressed for dinner, and people went out to Clubs in the evening. There is male chauvinism, political incorrectness, racism, and homophobia, but those were part of the times.Chandler's work was a natural for the movies, and for radio. His ear for dialogue was matchless. Written by Chandler and director Billy Wilder, the screenplay of James M. Cain's \\"Double Indemnity\\" became a classic with Fred MacMurry, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. His later works, \\"T he Long Goodbye: and \\"The Lady in the Lake\\" show a bit more maturity and cohesiveness.

The author immediatly thrusts the reader into the story without wasting any time on introductions or setting up characters. It's refreshing to read an author who gets straight to the point without wasting any words. The story begins with Marlowe being hired by a wealthy old man to discover the source of an extortion attempt, but the story quickly expands to include murder, pornography, and a few missing people. Marlowe is very methodical and impartial in his investigations, creating a stark contrast to the seedy and unpredictable cast of characters. Chandler does a wonderful job of portraying Los Angeles in the 1930's as it really was with its hidden dark side behind the beautiful exterior of fancy houses and dapper suits. Although Chandler's style is a little dry, he still creates a thoroughly readable story without any unnecessary descriptions to slow it down. It's a shame that Chandler didn't start on his writing career until the age of 39. Even so, he was still able to write some other outstanding Marlowe novels to carry on his legacy."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"The first Philip Marlowe book and one of the best.There's only so many different ways one can talk about Chandler being one of the greatest crime writers ever but this book also has a very good plot, which some of the others fall down on.

Chandler's remarkable combination of tough detective story with noirish overtones, set in the dark underside of sunny California, set a standard still followed by writers of popular fiction.Philip Marlowe is hired by General Sternwood, a wealthy but dying man, to protect his family from blackmail. Marlowe's investigation is complicated by the repeated interventions of the older of Sternwood's two daughters and by the misadventures of the younger daughter. The deeper Marlowe digs, the more complex, and more dangerous, a simple matter of blackmail becomes. It will be up to Marlowe to wrestle some kind of justice out of a case involving pornography, blackmail, gambling, murder, and a missing bootlegger.This story sets the essentials of Philip Marlowe: a tough, cynical investigator with an eye for the ladies, his own standards of integrity, and a surprising amount of compassion behind a hard shell. \\"The Big Sleep\\" also highlights Chandler's superbly entertaining writing style: spare, direct, and sardonic in the voice of his principal character. The plot of \\"The BIg Sleep\\" becomes a challenge to follow, but perhaps this contributes to the air of life-like mystery that is not entirely dispelled by story's end. This book is highly recommended to fans of Raymond Chandler and of noir detective fiction."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler virtually invented the private eye novel as we think of it today. Phillip Marlowe is an honest, world weary and compassionate tough guy who is as quick with his mouth as his is with his gun. Chandler is a master at creating quirky charcters, memorable villians and is as good with a metaphor as any writer has ever been. That said, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; set in then-contemporary Los Angeles (circa 1939), reads like a cultural artifact. Life and investigative work was a lot different back then. It was a time when a daughter of a wealthy man posing for nude photographs WAS in fact shocking enough to be a potential for blackmail. Today, no one would think twice about it.Nevrtheless, if you want to see how modern detective fiction as well as modern noir got its start, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; is for you."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Perhaps the textbook from which all other modern thrillers are based, THE BIG SLEEP surprised me by being much more than just another tale of murder and deceit.

But it was Raymond Chandler's clever and distinct use of the language that kept me engrossed and interested.The book is heavy in description and dialogue while being fairly light on introspection. But then, Philip Marlowe doesn't hang around thinking too much about his character, because that would cut into the time where he could be killin' an' drinkin' an' wise crackin'. The characters aren't especially deep, but they're certainly worth reading about. Chandler creates people who make up for in sheer griminess what they may lack in absolute realism. They're intriguing and thoroughly enjoyable.I found it much more fun to read about the people themselves rather than concentrating on the exact minutiae of their actions, and it seems that Chandler took the same approach to writing. The plot is a little bit shaky at times and not everything quite adds up at the end of the book. But as an effective mood piece, such details are mere trivialities. The individual sequences are what make this a worthwhile piece of writing. The characters, the slick prose and the swagger all combine to make this a memorable work."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This was Chandler's first novel, written when he was 51-years-old, although he had published a number of hard-boiled pulp fiction stories in the six years previous. The title refers to his hero, Philip Marlowe's idea of death. Not very original, but apt enough.I read this to compare it to the famous Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall film directed by Howard Hawks released in 1946. The structure of the book and the movie are very similar, but there's a subtle difference in the characterizations that gives the movie and the novel an entirely different feel.The movie is a romantic mystery with something like a happy ending. The novel is an existential slice of one man's life as a worldly wise straight-shooter in a corrupted world of thieves, murders, predatory females, and assorted grifters. In the movie the part of Vivian Regan, General Sternwood's older daughter, is prettied up and expanded for Lauren Bacall so that she and Bogey can work on the romantic chemistry. In the book romance takes a third tier seat to manliness, cynicism, and loyalty to the client. Indeed, Marlowe prefers Mona Mars, whom he calls \\"Silver-Wig,\\" to Vivian. But what he prefers even more than any of the women who are constantly throwing themselves at him is hard liquor and nicotine. He drinks morning, noon and night, always hard stuff, whiskey, rye, brandy. He spends a lot of time lighting and smoking tobacco and describing others doing the same. He even smokes a pipe, as did Chandler himself. With prohibition just a bad memory, and lung cancer something ugly that happened to coal miners and old people, the mass American mind thought it sexy and oh so sophisticated to toss back a few and indulge in the ritual of the cigarette, a ritual for tough guys that included striking the stick match with a thumbnail, dangling the cigarette out of one side of the mouth while talking out of the other, or pausing to eye the babe before flipping open the Zippo. Such an innocent world it was then.Chandler wrote the novel in a white heat from chapter one to #30 at the end of the text on the last page in about three months. He had intended to make a few bucks, this being just a longer short story, but a funny thing happened. His unconscious took over and Chandler ended up projecting not only a hauntingly atmospheric Los Angeles during the thirties and a reflection of the entire culture, but a nearly heroic notion about right and wrong personified in his alter ego, the shamus Philip Marlowe. Note above all that Marlowe is a highly moral person who doesn't take advantage of women, refuses money that doesn't belong to him, and is something close to fearless in the face of personal danger. In a short Introduction to the Modern Library Edition of this book, it is noted that when Chandler himself fell on hard times in 1912, he borrowed money from an uncle and made a badge of paying it back, \\"Every penny...with six percent interest.\\" Chandler never imagined at the time that he was writing \\"literature.\\" Indeed he would have scoffed at such a notion and pretended not to know what it is, just as Marlowe pretends not to have heard of Proust.So perhaps the secret of Marlowe's appeal is that Marlowe is the man Chandler would be on his best days, an essentially honest man, a very worldly man, a courageous straight-shooter, loved by women and admired by men, a man who is true to himself and his code. The average reader and moviegoer could easily identify with such a man, and his character became a formula for success in the private eye genre for another four or five decades. One reviewer insightfully recalled the Harrison Ford character from Blade Runner (1982). I am thinking of James Garner's \\"Jim Rockford\\" in the long running--it's still running, actually, in between infomercials on channels with numbers in the fifties--\\"The Rockford Files,\\" whose character bears more than a token resemblance to Chandler's creation.Besides this creation of an existential hero, the other striking feature of Chandler's novel is the sharply observed first person narrative spun out by Marlowe, and his quick, hard-boiled wit. He was not only brave, but had an eagle's eye for detail and more street smarts than an alley cat, and a nasty habit of speaking his mind in a way that penetrated. He describes the characters with precision, right down to their tie pins, and the scenery with enough verisimilitude to spring it to life. ... His running analysis of the motives of others and his observations about himself are immediate and to the point.There are of course contrivances. Marlowe does indeed seem to observe more than his fair share of action, and he seems to be where he should be nearly all the time. The scene (not in the movie) at the oil sump with Carmen near the end could never have been anticipated, not even by Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Chan working in tandem, and yet Marlowe did anticipate it, and was able to recreate an unlikely sequence of events to unravel the last mystery.The Big Sleep is pulp fiction at the apex, a novel squarely between a fancy Bel Air hotel and a skid row flophouse, eagerly read by the clientele of both establishments."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"As a mystery author with my first novel in its initial release, I make frequent appearances at mystery conventions to promote my debut title. At one recent convention, I was sitting on an author panel discussing &quot;The Private Eye.&quot; Following our presentation, a reader in the audience asked us to trace the development of the modern private eye. I fielded that question and explained that Raymond Chandler's THE BIG SLEEP is one of the crucial developmental steps along the way to the private eyes contemporary authors write about today. In THE BIG SLEEP, Chandler started with a pulp magazine character-type and transformed that character-type into a Romantic hero--the modern urban knight-errant. He took Hammett's tough guy, kept him tough yet gave him heart. THE BIG SLEEP tells a complicated tale in a complicated fashion. William Faulkner, when he was scripting the classic Bogart film, claimed he couldn't comprehend the plot. I've always assumed Faulkner was joking. The story can be comprehended by even small minds, like mine. The story involves murder, blackmail, gambling, a family of great wealth, self-destructiveness, and other standard plot fixtures of detective fiction. Most importantly, this book marks the debut of Philip Marlowe. Without Chandler's Marlowe the mystery genre would not be what it is today."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"\\"The Big Sleep\\" was my introduction to the work of Raymond Chandler, and I enjoyed it. Chandler's prose, which has been described to me as \\"inimitable\\", manages to be subtle and expressive, while remaining more direct and terse than most authors. Some writers try too hard to be brilliant--Chandler's writing is brilliant with natural, unstudied ease.The plot moves almost too quickly to follow--murder after coincidental murder, all in the space of a few days. But the twists are certainly original--at least, they would have been at the time this was written. I didn't predict what was coming, even if I wasn't incredibly surprised when it came.Marlowe, the narrator, is tough and fazed by nothing. Also a little sarcastic, and unapologetic for human nature, he was a good character but I did not feel much connected to him as a person. I didn't know who he was or what he wanted. Maybe that was intentional on Chandler's part. He is certainly a far cry from armchair detectives like Hercule Poirot, or even Sherlock Holmes. While he does use his brain, he seems to mostly follow where the action leads."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler's prose was nothing short of brilliant, yet his writing was primarily pulp fiction. In 1939, his novel \\"The Big Sleep\\" was published, one of his best, although all of them are good. There weren't many of them. Chandler was not a young man when he began writing. By the time he died in 1959, he'd published possibly 8 novels and 2 volumes of short stories.But what he did write is incredibly good. His prose is masterful. His turns of phrase are frequently original and quite entertaining. His grammar, syntax, vocabulary, metaphors and similes are all so perfectly tuned to his story that the writing style alone would keep the pages turning.In \\"The Big Sleep,\\" Chandler spins a yarn that is not only engaging, but one of the most exciting whodunits ever written. I've never read any author who could create images in my mind the way Chandler does -- it is as though I'm touring greater Los Angeles in 1939 when I read this book. (In fact, when I read Chandler, I've never had sharper or more gratifying mental images of what's transpiring in a book -- and when I put the book down I feel as though I'd been dreaming lucidly and vividly.Not only is the plot of \\"The Big Sleep\\" intriguing, it's masterfully convoluted -- you can't see around Chandler's many unexpected corners and the twists and turns are thrilling.Philip Marlowe, 6'1\\" tall, 180 pounds, handsome, driven by integrity, loved by the ladies, is one of the most memorable detective protagonists in the genre. In this story, he is engaged to deal with the wealthy, profligate Sternwood sisters by their dying father, General Sternwood, and as a result Marlowe finds himself involved in blackmail and murder. It amazes me that this story was written in 1939 -- it also involves pornography and homosexuality. (Don't worry -- no pornographic detail is described, but one of the bad guys markets porn, and one of them is gay.)You have to pay close attention to this novel to stay on top of the plot as it wends its tortuous way from start to end -- but, in its final pages, the many unexplained questions resolve beautifully.Once you've read a Chandler novel, I think you'll want to read more of them and soon. It's sad there aren't very many. His short stories are wonderful too, and one of the collections contains his very interesting essay on the genre of the mystery novel, again written masterfully and engagingly.A footnote: \\"The Big Sleep\\" made for classic film noir starring Bogart and Bacall, made toward the end of World War II and released in 1945. The film is great, but enough is left out of the plot thanks in part to the Hays Commission that the convoluted story can be hard to follow at times and a few loose ends remain untied at the finish. The movie is one of the best I've seen, but reading the novel fills in the lacunae in the movie's plot. Neither 1939 novel nor 1945 film is to be missed."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler's highly acclaimed detective classic, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, (1939) may not live up to his later works, especially &quot;The Little Sister&quot; and &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;. Though the plot is no less convoluted and diffuse, it seems to lack the panache and self-parodying irony that have made Chandler one of the greatest names in the history of detective fiction. Nevertheless, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; is perhaps one of the most representative example of the &quot;hard-boiled&quot; American school of the detective novel. The hero, a tough-speaking, cynical private detective, Philip Marlowe, has been immortalised by Hollywood in the guise of the chain-smoking, trenchcoat-wearing Humphrey Bogart. Admittedly, Marlowe is cast in a different vein than his predecessor, Sherlock Holmes, though he is no less personable and distinctive. In the British detective novel, which Chandler despised, the hero is portrayed as a representative of a relatively stable moral world, who merely corrects the misdemeanours that occur in it. However, Marlowe, whose personality combines toughness with sentimentality, is a citizen of a totally amoral world and, as he progresses down the &quot;mean streets&quot; of L.A., he can only rely on his conscience as the repository of his private moral code. Moreover, Chandler is an extremely clever stylist in his own right (indeed, so many subsequent detective writers are indebted to him) and the caustic dialogue and compelling soliloquies of his hero approximate a highly original form of lyrical beauty. The atmosphere of Chandler's novel is redolent of sex, danger and gunsmoke and I would recommend this novel to anyone who appreciates great detective fiction."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This is a book with problems, but it really is a good read, and when you consider how seminal a work of American fiction it is, I can recommend it to anyone with no qualms.Raymond Chandler was the first author to marry American noir fiction with the hard-boiled detective genre that Dashiell Hammett created in The Maltese Falcon. He didn't even start writing until he was 45, and with this, his first novel, he changed the American cultural landscape to this day.The Big Sleep follows detective Phillip Marlowe (played by a drunk-as-hell Humphrey Bogart in the movies) as he solves a case involving crazy chicks, bisexual pornographers, crooked(?) cops, and more crazy chicks. Marlowe is an incorruptible PI in Los Angeles in the late 1930s, and he's hired by a rich old man to sort out some problems with his two crazy daughters. Along the way he encounters a number of well-fleshed out supporting characters, some hanging plot-lines, a lot of historically contextual sexism, and some pretty racy stuff for 1939.As I said, there are some problems. The aforementioned hanging plot-line, some stumbling writing, etc., but overall this book is quite good. It's a fast read, a well-paced book, and it really feels like you're in seedy Hollywood, circa 1939.Recommended for:*People who like hard-boiled detectives*People who like to drink*People who like dames"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"\\"The Big Sleep\\" was the first of Raymond Chandler's classic mystery novels featuring the character of Philip Marlowe, the clever detective portrayed by Humphrey Bogart in the 1946 film adaptation and Robert Mitchum in the 1978 adaptation. In this novel, Marlowe is hired by the old, crippled, and rich General Sternwood to find out who has blackmailed him. To Marlowe it seems simple enough - at first. Then he meets the General's two daughters: troublesome, cute little sister Carmen, and Vivian, the watchful big sister with a gambling problem. From there, things get messy.The novel is, at times, a little confusing - as was the '46 movie. There is at least one murder which is never resolved - in fact, it's dropped completely. But flaws like these didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book. Instead, they made me enjoy it more. It makes it all the more mysterious and bizarre. All is resolved in the end, though.One of the high points of the book is the snappy, witty dialogue, most of which comes from Marlowe. I had the same though reading this that I did when I read \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" recently: it's amazing how much the English language has changed in a period of about seventy years.Throughout the novel, you get a fine sense of how Raymond Chandler saw Los Angeles in 1939. It's a dark, sprawling city filled with criminals and crime to the point where the cops don't even care anymore. In a way, I was reminded of the city depicted in Robert Rodriguez's \\"Sin City\\". The last true hero in the city is Marlowe, an unconventional hero to be sure. And that's because he's a human hero. A hero from the real world. He's not perfect, but he tries hard to do what's right.\\"The Big Sleep\\" is a marvelous book, a true masterpiece of detective fiction. I would most definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This review was written for the movie version of the Big Sleep but the key points apply here.I admit to being a film noir fan of long standing. Maybe it was the fact of growing up in the time of black and white television and watching all those late night movies which were freely available at the time. Maybe it was that tight, if improbable, dialogue, the relatively simple plots and the dramatic effect of the shadows of black and white photography on mood. In any case, the Big Sleep fits nicely into that mix. The plot line is fairly simple- Out in pre-World War II California an old rich man with two young wild daughters mixed up in who knows what is looking for his old drinking companion who is missing- enter Phillip Marlowe, gumshoe extraordinaire, who will go through hell and high water to find him dodging bullets, blackjacks, gangsters, crooked cops and meaningful glances from the daughters in order to satisfy his client's wishes. Intrepid, this Marlowe. Of course, as always the real guilty parties will have to face justice, some kind of justice. That is Marlowe's way, as well.In any case one should read Raymond Chandler's book by the same name, that this movie is based on, to get a better feel for the language, his original plot, and better insight into the motivations of the parties. This movie was remade in color in the 1980's and is probably truer to Chandler's designs but this is the definitive Big Sleep."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Although the film noir genre may now be gone it is not hard to understand why it was once such a popular past time.Raymond Chandler created one of the genre's most famous anti-heroes in Phillip Marlowe; a tough talking, wise cracking alchoholic, private detective.His first case is depicted in this novel and he immediately becomes a likeable character.From introducing himself to general Sternwood's daughter as \\"Doghouse Reily\\" to cracking wise with the butler by claiming he has having fun working out what his duties are.Chandler uses Marlowe to narrate his way through this complex mystery of blackmail, pornography and even murder with aplomb.By the last few chapters the reader will be scratching their heads, a habbit quashed in the finale when Chandler masterfully ties up all the loose ends.Chandler and Marlowe defined the genre and The Big Sleep is proof of why."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Marlowe was 33 in THE BIG SLEEP, not 38. Trivial, I know, but let's get it straight for the sake of accuracy. In THE LONG GOODBYE he was 42, so Chandler aged him as the series developed. Having said that, I'd rate THE BIG SLEEP as one terrific first novel--but THE LONG GOODBYE was Chandler's masterwork."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This book is from the era of the golden age of the detective movie. It's a black and white world full of deceit and double crosses. And if you just watch the movies from that time, there is a lot of passion, but no sex.Now if you read books, like this excellent one, you can see that people were just as nasty and sensous when it comes to sex and we are now. And maybe they did it with a little more style, too.The novel covers a case that involves pornography, so I guess they had that in those days, too. It covers a pair of rich young women who are as loose as one can imagine. People don't take their clothes off in the movies from that time, but they sure do in the book.Ok, there's more to it than the above. If you read this book for the first time, and didn't know that much about the background, you might think it a bit cliched'. You have the wisecracking detective who has a smart line even when a gun it pointed at him. Heard this a lot of times before, right? Well, this is one of the original that had this style. And even if I've heard the type before, reading this book for the first time made me appreciate Raymond Chandler's style. Not only has it been copied countless times, but it stands up as a better work than many of it's imitators."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Why is it that books that are labeled as \\"classics\\" often seem to disappoint? That's a question that has a longer answer than I'd care to write about here, but that thought did occur to me several times while reading The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler. I'm sure high expectations have something to do with it, and the story did seem to be a winner. Philip Marlowe, a private dick from L.A. is on a black mailing case involving a millionaire and his two insane daughters.Here we find excellent prose, but a plot that is so hard to follow, I gave up about three quarters of the way through. I would have been able to keep up if I kept a notebook of all the characters (of which there are too many), and a history of what had happened thus far (too much too soon). Someone reading this for a college class may have a highlighter or two handy, and get more out of this book. However, the casual reader will find this novel tough going."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I've read a slew of contemporary hardboiled tales (or what passes for them these days) and found nothing comparable to Chandler's \\"The Big Sleep.\\" This is a novel on par with Hammett's own Maltese Falcon.

Friends, classics are deemed \\"classic\\" for a reason. Read this novel. You will not be disappointed. If anything, it will make you disappointed with every contemporary crime novel you read hereafter. If you have even a smidgen of interest in crime, hardboiled fiction, or straight-up compelling mysteries, you'll want to check this out."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Every now and then I get the urge to pull down a \\"classic\\" and re-read it. After several of the mysteries I've read recently I got that urge. This may be the fifth or sixth time I've read The Big Sleep and once again I was not disappointed.Chandler and his books have been credited with giving birth to a new genre of fiction - hard-boiled PI (private investigator) mysteries. Dashiell Hammett, (The Maltese Falcon & The Thin Man), is usually also mentioned in the same breath. I don't disagree with that opinion, but I think the comparison between the two authors and their stories - mysteries set during the same time period - is no more than superficial. But that's a discussion for another time.The Big Sleep introduces Philip Marlowe, the quintessential PI - tough, smart, cynical but uncorruptable - who is hired by an ancient and ailing General Sternwood to get to the bottom of a blackmail plot targeting one of his young, spoiled, temperamental daughters. 200+ pages later at the conclusion of the book this \\"mystery\\" isn't the point anymore, in fact it was just the tip of the iceberg. And that's the magic of Chandler's books. It's not the whodunit that keeps one reading - but rather the characters, the story, and the world that Marlowe journeys through while solving his case. The mystery is just the vehicle.This is simply great writing which makes for great reading."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This is where noir starts. The book captures Los Angeles and a genre better than almost anything since Chandler penned it. The feelings of unease that a reader will experience make this a novel to remember."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I'm not into detective stories, and I had never read Chandler before this; neither have I seen the movie. Did I like it? Yes, why not - it had a certain sense of style, a certain attraction, present in every comment by every character. As it comes to dialogue, this book has it all. That's easy to admit.That much for the good sides, there were weak points too. Most of all Chandler's descriptions seemed to me somewhat showy and heavy. Also, the plot could've been more mesmerizing. Compared to other detective novels I have read in the past, this one might not do so well. Incredibly sophisticated plots always make me feel confused. Too much glamour in the plot seems like a desperate need to gain attention. But I'm pretty satisfied; it is very rare that 'a classic' turns out to this good."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"chandlers ideas of the way peoples minds work onlong with the inocence of the 50's make a good book. the description to the thoughts in which people think . the character of the young daughter will hypnotise you with her lying and cheating to hurt her fathe"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This book starts with a bang and ends with boom, and the middle is full of explosions as well.

As the virtual inventor of the modern detective novel, his achievement and influence is undeniable. When reading TBS, I could see private dick Philip Marlowe in every 40s film noir ever made, gravelly voice, smoked up sexiness, tipped hat, aggressive banter and slang, hard assed yet sensitive, too cool for school.Mr. Chandler's writing is razor sharp and vivid when he is recreating the seedy underbelly of LA. I loved his language. The dialogue was so very quick and witty and full of fabulous 30's and 40's slang, and his descriptions border on poetry at times, gunshot grim and gorgeous.My one complaint: I found TBS a bit of a \`boy' book: too much mafia and manly men, women all beautiful and wasted, and a plot so convoluted that I couldn't keep up. This last I found to be the most distracting of all. Marlowe was always a step ahead of the game, in the right place at the right time, knew what to say and when not to say it, page after damned page. Halfway through, I gave up trying to understand what was going on and just read for the mayhem and fun of it (and this wasn't difficult at all)."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"The Big Sleep is one of those books that is so good that you don't want to it to end. You savor each sentence like a spoonful of ice cream. The dialog and atmosphere time travel you back to 1930's L.A. Chandler had a gift for writing sharp little ironic phrases that stick in your mind. There's an unforgettable line in \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\": &quot;It was a blond. A blond to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window.&quot; The Big Sleep has some improbable moments but it more than made up for by the whole. There is no need to worry that some plot turns are inexplicable; the book is more about atmosphere and snappy dialogue than the details of Marlowe's detective case.What struck me more than anything was how much better it is than detective classics written at the same time. Hammett's \\"The Thin Man\\" is unreadable by comparison. The over-repeated quote about Chandler writing like a slumming angel is apt; the next book you read after The Big Sleep will be a tedious chore to by comparison. The Bogart movie is in some ways unusually faithful to the text of the book, some dialog is repeated word for word. The ending of the movie is perhaps better than the novel, as others have pointed out. The book has no concluding confrontation with Eddie Mars but does explain the fate of Sean Regan."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"A paralyzed millionaire, General Sternwood, hires Los Angeles private eye Philip Marlowe to have a talk with a blackmailer with his hooks in his daughter. But what does his daughter's missing husband, Rusty Regan, have to do with it? Marlowe's case will get him entangled in a web of pornography and gambling from which he may never escape...For the last few years, me and noir detective fiction have gone together as well as strippers and c-section scars so I figured it was time for a re-read. I'd forgotten most of the book in the past ten years so it was like a completely new one. One of the things that grabbed me right away was how poetic Raymond Chandler's prose seems at times. I'd intended on writing down some of the more clever bits but I quickly dropped that idea in favor of letting myself get taken along for the ride.For a lot of today's readers, the plot and Philip Marlowe himself might not seem that original. That's because people have been ripping off Raymond Chandler for decades! Marlowe is the real deal. Now that I've read a few hundred more detective books since my original reading, I can appreciate how influential Marlowe is as a character.The plot is a lot more complex than it originally seemed. I almost wish I didn't know the plot of the Big Leibowski was partly lifted from the Big Sleep. I kept picturing characters from the movie while I was reading. Hell, the plot is almost inconsequential. The atmosphere and language are the real stars of the show.Five stars.

I normally read \\"serious\\" literature (english major). But this is as well-written as about anything I've read. The dialog and narrative are sharp and smart and funny. Chandler's characterizations are excellent, esp his descriptions of physiognomy. The book brims with 1930s Hollywood style and nostalgia, and while the plot gets a little confusing at times, it's just a pleasure to read.After suffering thru a bloated and overblown Salman Rushdie novel, Big Sleep was a treat. So well-crafted."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"A must-read if you like the 1946 film. An even bigger must-read if, like me, you had no idea what was going on throughout the whole thing!There are some important differences between the book and the wonderful movie, though. Large parts of the book are almost directly translated to screen, but because of the Production Code, the ending is completely changed (by Jules Furthman, who Warner Brothers hired to come in and write it when director-producer Howard Hawks was months behind schedule, over budget and without an ending) and some important details are left out (porn, nudity, homosexuality - but not violence!). Plus, Bacall's terrible reviews in 1945's \\"Confidential Agent\\" meant that there were some major re-shoots in 1946 that give the film an altogether lighter, flirtier tone, and revive the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall that America fell in love with in \\"To Have and Have Not\\". There's still some great banter in the book, but it's altogether darker. Chandler wrote detective novels not because he liked whodunits, but as a way to comment on corruption, tyranny and the dark sides of society. The novel's Philip Marlowe is no smirking Bogart, and most of the women in the novel (Carmen, Vivian and Agnes) are awful. That's something Faulkner and Brackett did incredibly in writing the screenplay: they made Carmen, Vivian and Agnes into full, rounded characters.Hawks famously cut about nine full minutes of explanation out of the final cut of the movie, but the novel is much, much more clear. So, if you want to know what exactly happened to the guy in the car that drove off the pier or who half of those characters even are, I completely recommend this book. It's a quick read with some wonderful dialogue and descriptions, even if it's not my usual cup of tea."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Although Modern Library skips over it, Time tucks 'The Big Sleep' snugly between the covers of its best English-Language novels list - though it seems reasonable to think it's included as a stand-in for Chandler's total oeuvre and for the book's impact on the genre rather than as an indication of its relative merits. That assumption is based on the opinion that Chandler got better as he went along, and also that, thanks to Bogey and Bacall, 'The Big Sleep' is probably his most recognizable title. Still, as far as first novels go, it's little short of amazing, and it's easy to see how it spawned a cottage industry of parody and imitation that is still vibrant today.Too often, when returning to the original source of such an iconic character or literary convention, the overwhelming amount of homage, tribute and copycat material can make the prototype look common. However, there are a few that, in their earliest incarnations, retain their unique attraction despite the odds against them (Sherlock Holmes, for example, and I think a case could also be made for Burrough's early Tarzan). To that short list, I'd add Phillip Marlowe, and his introduction in 'The Big Sleep'. How much more could it be - \\"I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it\\".One may as well try to summarize 'War and Peace' as 'The Big Sleep' - it hardly seems worth it. It's about a private detective as he solves a case - but really, that's just window dressing. Everyone knows it's about Marlowe - hang-dog Marlowe as he tries not to drink too much while running up against the dirty underside of humanity, mostly treating it as if it had a chance to be something better than it was, but still prepared when it wasn't. Tough guy but not really, honest, more of a knight-errant than mid-century America wanted or deserved. Those sort of guys get crucified now - probably would have then too, if he'd drawn too much attention to himself.Maybe Raymond Chandler's Los Angeles - the Petri dish from which he plucked Marlowe - resembled what the world would look like a few short years later, but Marlowe seems like one of the first modern men in print (which may also account for his longevity). He's a man who grapples with the rest of the world with no framework in place to guide his actions other than the one he's built himself. That's Marlowe's attraction - he's beholden to nothing other than his innate sense of right and wrong, which, for him, is a far stricter taskmaster than any abstraction. Regardless of his flaws, it ennobles him, and makes him a sort of moral guidepost - even though he knows holding to his beliefs is just as likely to bring him lumps as well as luck. Strangely enough - or maybe not so strange - Marlowe makes that appealing.For those who have never read Chandler's novels because they thought that the hard-boiled private eye genre was not for them may find themselves pleasantly surprised picking him up for the first time. It isn't necessary to start with 'The Big Sleep' -structurally it's messy and convoluted - but it functions as well as any of Chandler's other novels, in that it highlights his iconic private eye. Beyond the descriptive style and the snappy patter (another of Chandler's strengths), even beyond the particulars of any given storyline, Phillip Marlowe is recommended for his tired faith that it's still possible to hold your head up in this world."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Having readMaltese Falcon, a natural next step was to give the other \\"noir\\" master, Raymond Chandler a read. In many respects the two authors are similar: both wrote during the same time period, both protagonists are private detectives working in California, and (in broad terms) Sam Spade (Hammet) and Philip Marlowe (Chandler) are similar characters: hard-drinking single men, street-smart, smart-alecks who crack wise to the police and often find themselves in situations that require quick thinking or quick fists to get out of. Yet I liked Marlowe better. Chandler is less the mysogynist than Hammet (even making allowances for the time in which they wrote, Chandler's women are less objectified and two dimensional), which is important to me. (With this said, women are far from the independent, strong persons of contemporary fiction.)In Marlowe's debut, he is given a case of blackmail by a wealthy LA invalid who wants to know who is extorting him: both his daughters have a tendency to get into trouble. An ancillary case is what happened to his son-in-law. Marlowe quickly finds things far from simple blackmail, as a series of murders result, exposing a seedy, vulgar side of the lives LA's wealthy and powerful. True to the genre, all the loose ends aren't tied together until literarlly the final few pages, with a typically bitter-sweet conclusion. But what really gave me a kick was the dialogue - vintage noir:\\"All I want is to find out is she dummying up on you, kid. If that's the way you say it is, everything is jakeloo. You can put the bite on the peeper and be on your way.\\"\\"I was as empty of life as a scarcrows' pockets. I went out to the kitchenette and drank two cups of black coffee. You can have a hangover from other things than alcohol. I had one from women. Women made me sick.\\"\\"It might have annoyed him, but business was business, and you have to hold your teeth clamped around Hollywood to keep from chewing on stray blondes.\\"The conclusion - and the motive - was convoluted and complicated, overly so, I think. This reservation aside, it was a whole lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"THE BIG SLEEP is one of the great books of American Literature, not merely of hardboiled fiction. It is far from a perfect book. There are passages that are so over-the-top that they border on self-parody. The scenes in which women can't help themselves in the presence of Philip Marlowe are generally appalling. But the book's virtues are difficult to overstate. The prose frequently veers into the realm of genius. The characters -- even minor characters -- are brilliantly and unforgettably sketched. The L.A. of the late 1930s captures the time and place as perfectly as Berenice Abbott's photos of thirties New York. For many individuals, Raymond Chandler in this and subsequent novels created the L.A. that haunted film noir in the next two decades.Chandler's prose both thrills and infuriates me. His brilliance at negotiating English sentences makes me about as mad as when I read the first page of Nabokov's LOLITA. In both cases I read sentences that I know I could not emulate if given a lifetime to ape. In both instances the words go far beyond brilliance to something ineffable. What is amazing is that Chandler, though born in Chicago, was raised in Ireland and educated in English public (i.e., private) schools. He did move to the U.S. as an adult and resubmerged himself in the country of his birth, but just as no one wrote English prose better than the Russian born and raised Nabokov, no one wrote more cutting and hard-edged in the American vein than did the Anglicized Chandler.THE BIG SLEEP is famous for its convoluted plot, but I have to say that even in my first reading I did not have this experience. Certainly it makes more sense than the famous movie version with Humphrey Bogart, which was hampered by extensive censorship (there are simply too many lines to read between to make grasping the plot an easy undertaking). But really, you don't read Chandler for plot. Of the big three hardboiled writers -- Hammett and Ross MacDonald being the other two -- only MacDonald can profitably be read for the story. You read Hammett and Chandler for the impossible to resist one-liners, the vivid ragged guys and treacherous woman who litter their stories, and for the way they evoke the San Francisco and Los Angeles that they write about. If you start getting hung up on plot, you've already missed the point.One thing that is striking is how closely the movie -- hampered as it is by censorship -- hews to the book. Most of the book's major scenes can be found more or less intact in the film. Most of the great lines are in both, though the famous horse racing conversation between Bogart and Lauren Bacall was unique to the film. The one huge difference is the ending. The movie scraps the last 15 or so pages of the book and ends with an exhilarating and violent confrontation between Marlowe and Eddie Mars. All in all I actually prefer the movie's ending, helped in part by the brilliant dialogue written by William Faulkner and Leigh Brackett. But the Chandler ending makes far more sense of the plot.This was Chandler's first full length novel. The most remarkable thing about that is that he was fifty years old when it was published. He wrote his first story when he was forty-five. There are few if any stories of such a brilliant writer getting started so late in life. And he did it despite an on and off very serious drinking problem, in which he drank not to be mildly inebriated, but drank to the point of getting DT's. But he illustrates better than anyone that it is never too late to start. He remains an inspiration of all of us aging potential authors."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"\\"It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars.\\"- Philip Marlowe in The Big SleepAnd thus began the criteria for what a private eye would look like and what his moral code would be. Raymond Chandler, author of the Philip Marlowe series of crime novels, set the bar high and generations would follow in his writing footsteps.Raymond Chandler is considered to be one of the most influential writers of crime fiction and his phenomenal creation of the detective Philip Marlowe has survived decades.Every time a modern reader discovers a new private eye who is facing some interesting and very tough times but is able to do it with integrity and a strict moral code alongwith a \\"soldier's eye\\"; you are meeting Raymond Chandler the writer all over again. And Philip Marlowe his creation is playing a pivotal role in the background.Raymond Chandler wrote seven detective novels but THE BIG SLEEP is probably his best. He was fifty years old when he wrote this novel yet this novel would become an American landmark in the hard-boiled detective genre and would really launch him into the icon that he is today.The reader will discover a unified theme with strong and fully developed characters with incredible imagery and metaphors. Chandler's literary style is distinctive and very crisp. You will love this book. If you are new to hard-boiled detective stories, this is the novel that I would start withYou will be introduced to the Sternwoods: General Sternwood, Vivian and Carmen and all three are interesting studies and all three as General Sternwood notes hasn't \\"any more moral sense than a cat.\\" General Sternwood is on his deathbed and hired Philip Marlowe to check out why he was being blackmailed by one Arthur Gwynn Geiger. His two daughters, Vivian and Carmen, are quite a handful but General Sternwood feels in part responsible for his plight. As he tells Marlow, \\"I need not add that a man who indulges in parenthood for the first time at the age of fifty-four deserves all he gets.\\" He describes his two daughters as being \\"spoiled, exacting, smart and ruthless with the younger girl as being the type who likes to pull wings off flies\\".Chandler's novels do highlight crooks and morally-corrupt characters and derelicts, but they are counter-balanced by Marlowe, Bernie Ohls, and General Sternwood--all of whom possess a strong sense of honor, a consideration of what is proper and are for the most part trying to live a life above board.There are numerous murders that take place and a tight interwoven plot which will keep you on the edge of your seat until you get to the last page.When THE BIG SLEEP was published in 1939 there was only an advance of 5,000 copies by Alfred A. Knopf. However, Knopf knew the power and the contribution that this novel would make. They actually took out an advertisement for this book on the front cover of the Publisher's Weekly which was most unusual for a novelist's first book.The dust jacket flaps read:\\"Not since Dashiell Hammett appeared has there been a murder mystery story with the power, pace, and terrifying atmosphere of this one. And like Hammett's this is more than a \\"murder mystery\\": it is a novel of crime and character, written with uncommon skill in a tight, tense style which is irresistible.\\"And so it was. I would highly recommend reading this crime novel and being introduced to Philip Marlowe. This novel was made into a movie starring Bogart and Bacall with the screen play being written by William Faulkner no less.Don't miss this one. I almost did.Rating: ABentley/October 2007The Big Sleep"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Good vintage/ classic detective novel. I haven't read any of Chandler's books before, so I started with this one, his first.I never read the classic detective novels because I knew that they took place in the forties and I thought that they would be really dated and old fashioned.Yet again, I was wrong. I don't know why I thought that it would be more innocent than it was. People are people and they murdered and gambled and drank and slept around just as well, if not better, than we do now.

With his tough has rocks exterior, his ability to take a punch and his penchant for falling for women, sometimes the wrong women, this is a character that you fall immediately in love with. Rich in vocabulary, with a plot that never stops twisting this is easily one of Chandler's best works. Written in a style that is gritty but yet compelling, you are able to visualize what's happening at each point in the book.The only unforunate thing for readers is that Chandler started writing so late in life and didn't leave us with nearly enough Marlowe material."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"In &quot;The Big Sleep,&quot; Raymond Chandler has given fans of pulp detective fiction a near-perfect example of the genre. The 1939 novel follows Chandler's hangdog detective, Phillip Marlowe, as he enters a winding maze of sinister characters, beautiful women, and dead bodies that turn up in all the wrong places. What begins as a simple blackmail case becomes a web of deceit and murder, as the nigh-unflappable Marlowe becomes mixed up with an elderly millionaire, his missing son-in-law, his two dangerous daughters, and a vicious killer in a brown suit.Marlowe is one of the great characters of twentieth century popular fiction, possessed of a surprising wit, world-weary persistence, and an unbending code of honor. His dreamlike Los Angeles is populated with characters who seem to have stepped out of a Edward Hopper painting: isolated, hardbitten souls who speak in rough-hewn poetry.Chandler plays fast and loose with the truth, keeping the reader guessing at every turn. Like Shakespeare, he has a knack for creating oddly simple metaphors whose beauty is startling: &quot;The light hit pencils of rain and made silver wires of them.&quot; &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; is a supremely entertaining read, a mystery that plumbs the dark and lonely corners of the human soul and emerges with no easy answers."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"'Nuff said. Raymond Chandler was at the top of his form (in my opinion) when he penned this tale. While the Phillip Marlowe tales that followed were wonderfully exquisite as well, they all paled in comparison to the original. Should be on the top 100 books to read in your lifetime."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Chandler brilliantly protrayed American slang and made himself a legend. His understanding and assimilation of 1930's American culture is astounding. Master of simile, lord of metaphor. Read this. You'll be a better person for it."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I have always felt that comparing Raymond Chandler to most mystery writers is like comparing The Beatles to The Monkeys. Chandler is an artist who had tremendous talent and skill and worked in a popular genre. Chandler was a tremendous writer. He chose to write in the p.i. genre because it suited him and his interests, but his novels are fine writing, and great reading. Lucky us, we also get to experience his great gift for writing compelling action sequences. The only recent noir novel that I have found that approximates Chandler in literary merit is the e-book novel \\"The Wounded Man.\\" In a slightly different genre, but with a noir aspect, \\"The Scent of Shadows\\" is very good. However, nobody does it like Chandler.Having enjoyed Chandler's literary accomplishments through years of occasionally re-reading his classic tales, I do want to correct one misconception. The plot in The Big Sleep is not frail. The strands of the story seem unconnected, but weave together well. Chandler drank quite a bit and said many things, some grumpy and some humble. His statements about plot were really to criticize the British mystery school such as Agatha Christie, who he disdained for lacking literary merit. Chandlers plots work. He took years on every book, and so he made sure they worked. In this one, without spoiling anything, there's one coincidence and that's about it. Then there's the famous question from Bogey and the director of the film version, about who killed the man who went off the pier, which prompted Chandler's iconic, \\"I don't know.\\" Chandler knew. I know. Everyone who really reads the book carefully knows. Chandler says it, but he's subtle about it. Hint - the theme song of the MASH movie and series is about it. Chandler just wouldn't answer such a question. He was a brilliant guy, and the world isn't brilliant. Also, based on the way he wrote that death, he may not have wanted to come right out and say.Raymond Chandler is better compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald and Hemingway than other mystery writers. Chandler wrote in the 1930s - 1950s, when opportunity was more defined by class. Even then, Marlowe was slumming, but then he was so good at it that we have to forgive him for it. I agree with the consensus that \\"The Big Sleep\\" and \\"The Long Goodbye\\" are Chandler's two greatest works. The Big Sleep contains compelling meditations on reality that put it in the same league as the big guns of American writing. Yet, it's a compelling mystery book at the same time. A whiff of the tragic surrounds Marlowe and the Sternwood clan throughout. Although Chandler sometimes humbly claimed that he couldn't write the novel behind the case, that's exactly what he does here. Marlowe's involvement with the Sternwoods is more a question of personal honor, background, and attraction, than of a case. I highly recommend this book both as an entertaining mystery, and as just one of the best American novels. This book should not be missed."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I'm no fan of mysteries, except perhaps the general mystery surrounding life, and I see crime enough in the every day without feeling the need to return to it for entertainment, and I'm not at all a fan of the hard-boiled detective with his hard-to-stomach arrogance (and what an apt adjective, this \\"hard-boiled,\\" the golden yolk turned gray and flavorless when held over the flame too long). But I'm always a fan of a well written book, no matter what the genre. And Chandler's book qualifies.It intrigued me to read this, one of the classic firsts, literary birthing grounds for the nearly, by now, cliche persona (Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade being perhaps the very first, followed closely by Chandler's Phillip Marlowe, then variations on a theme with Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer, and a long string of others, the most recent contemporary rendering of which I've come across being the character of Joe January in J. Conrad Guest's \\"January's Paradigm.\\"). Humphrey Bogart brought several of these to the silver screen, and the character, by whatever name, is now so well known that we can all imitate him at a drop of a fedora, cigarette hanging loose in the corner of our mouths, gal Friday awaiting our command.As usual, the persona is done arguably best by its inventors. And, as usual, the book has added linguistic pleasures surpassing the cheapened Hollywood screen versions (for example, I noted that the book version of Marlowe isn't nearly the womanizer that Bogart's film version is as he romances Lauren Bacall, a romance that never really happens on the written page, and in his literary version, he even exhibits ethics in the bedroom that any woman can cheer). We get the language -- hard, crisp, fresh, even today. Chandler's spare style might even at moments find comparison in Hemingway. His metaphors delight.\\"Dead men are heavier than broken hearts.\\"\\"The minutes passed on tiptoe... The light hit pencils of rain and made silver wires of them.\\"\\"He had tight brilliant eyes that wanted to look hard, and looked hard as oysters on the half shell.\\"\\"The gentle-eyed, horse-faced maid let me into the long gray and white upstairs sitting room with the ivory drapes tumbled extravagantly on the floor and the white carpet from wall to wall. A screen star's boudoir, a place of charm and seduction, artificial as a wooden leg.\\"Hey, now that's fine writing. It hits the mark with no side trips.

They were books to while away half an hour at a time. Nothing you could really engage with, due to a lack of depth on the part of the characters and the story, sometimes even the storytelling. But Chandler took this concept and farted on it.The Big Sleep concerns a believable, engaging character, a convoluted plot (which is incredibly hard to follow) and a sleazy underworld. Where Hercule Poirot was a virtuous do-gooder, where Sherlock Holmes was a mastermind gentlman, Phillip Marlowe is just about as seedy and bent as the villains he's following. Welcome to the father of modern crime fiction.Although the language might be a little hard to grasp for the younger generation, the slang sort of works itself out, very much a la Clockwork Orange. After the first few pages, you get into the swing of the language and the style.The cinematic Film Noir classic adaptation is definitely worth seeing after reading this weighty novel; although it removes some of the more nit-picky plot points, it's not for the worse. The Big Sleep is a landmark novel, and one worth reading if at least to say you've read it."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of Raymond Chandler's best mystery novels.

In the end, nobody but Philip Marlowe rises above the filth. This is probably the defining novel of the entire hard-boiled detective genre, often copied, but never equaled. Philip Marlowe is given a job by a dying old man to find out who is blackmailing one of his daughters. Marlowe becomes entangled in a web of lies as uncovering one mystery reveals another. This theme has by now been well worn and is almost certainly cliched, but Chandler is the master. His prose is terrific: \\"You know what Canino will do? Beat my teeth out and kick me in the stomach for mumbling.\\" If you're reading this review, you probably already know a fair bit about the genre, the author, and the connection to some of the great Bogie films. The best recommendation that I can give this novel is that it reads just like the film. That is, it has the same feel as the film \`The Big Sleep' and the other Bogie hard-boiled detective films. The dark, broding atmosphere, the dialogue, you just get transported back to pre-war LA. Reading this book I felt as if I was with Bogie trying to dodge lethal bullets and even deadlier women!

The era also called for the archetype private eye and, in Philip Marlowe, we certainly received it. Clipped, cocky, and matter-of-fact, Marlowe's staccato dialogue oozes tough guy on the trail of hoodlums and gangsters.Palm trees, broad boulevards, money, and corruption provide a perfect setting for Marlowe's profession and a vicarious thrill for readers who recognize Chandler's geographical references. It is with a nostalgic rush and a wry vernacular that one rips through The Big Sleep as the book caroms down its multiple plot twists.A millionaire, two uncommon daughters, and blackmail begin this story, but it becomes something entirely different in the end. There's no shortage of sordid characters and nefarious scheming. Chandler's fiction, put simply, is beguiling. It becomes a compulsion that is hard to put down. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I review this book for one reason, though it is enjoyable for several.

It already displays all the best of the hard-boiled genre, and Chandler's work in particular. The central character has enduring appeal: a reasonably honest private investigator among the rich and famous with cesspit morals. The little guy standing up against corrupt, moneyed powers, and beating them at their own game - I can't imagine that core plot ever going out of fashion.The timeless parts of the book keep the story popular today, but other parts seem frozen in time. The whole post-Prohibition sense dates the story, as do other the slang and other details. The slang, in particular, gets so thick that a modern reader might stumble more than once. I'm not complaining, though. Back then, it was very contemporary, even fashionable. Today, it comes across as period drama. As period drama it has the advantage of authenticity, instead of being a modern fiction writer's imaginings.The plot has a bit of roller-coaster character to it. It seems to wind up nicely, with only few loose ends to tie up, but with half the book yet to go. Then the loose ends unravel. The book restarts, the action gets faster, and the dirt gets dirtier. Maybe Chandler didn't invent the detective genre in which he wrote, but he certainly made it his own. Books like this clearly justify his position as a star of American popular fiction.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This was my first Raymond Chandler read and I liked it.

While Hammett's Sam Spade pre-dates Marlowe's 1939 debut here in \\"The Big Sleep\\", Chandler - through Marlowe - is arguably the standard by which all others are measured, the author who could credibly lay claim as the master of the irreverent maverick sleuth: the fast-fisted, impossibly clever, dame-magnet which so many have since sought to emulate. Less debatable is Chandler's mastery the style and the elegance of prose that he introduced to pulp fiction - sharp and lean as one would expect of the genre, but rich in simile and image and as readable today as it was nearly seven decades ago.In \\"The Big Sleep\\", in what looks like a routine case, Marlowe is summoned by a fatally ill millionaire to track down a blackmailer holding compromising pictures of one of his two wayward adult daughters. Chandler gets right to the point in spinning a tale of thugs and hit men trading in pornography and gambling, leading to more murders than a Mel Gibson movie and dalliances sleazy enough to make Bill Clinton blush. Still, while the violence and sex is quaint by today's no-holds-barred onslaught, it is no less effective - consider the terror of the shower screen in Hitchcock's brilliant \\"Psycho\\" - one of film's most disturbing moments, though the knife is never seen striking flesh.In fairness, \\"The Big Sleep\\" is not Chandler's finest moment. The initial transgression seems neatly wrapped up with nearly half of the book to go, and one wonders what Marlowe is doing as he aimlessly kicks around what seem to be meaningless loose ends in a rather muddled middle of the book. But Chandler's craft keeps the reader engaged, wrapping up with a few clever twists and enough (barely) of the irony these early masters of pulp fiction are so well noted for.If you're a fan of pop crime fiction and haven't gone back to read Chandler (or Thompson, Hammett, Block, Westlake, McBain...), you've got some real treats ahead of you.

If you've read TLS or TLG already, you might miss that cutting edge to his observances that makes you laugh out loud (I did)."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I found the book to be confusing at times because of all the characters. Other than that I definitly found the book to be an enjoyable four star read.I will read more of Raymond Chandler!"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I read this book while working the night shift at a psychiatric hospital in New Orleans (all of which you really don't need to know) and I found myself laughing out loud I enjoyed reading it so much. Like finding a friend whose humor you recognize as something special -- that's the appeal of Chandler's writing to me. As a mystery novel, it keeps you guessing, too (it helps that there's not really a solution). A lot of fun to read"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"For best of breed, Raymond Chandler's novels top the list.His character, Marlowe, seems to stumble and crash his waythrough the plot. By the end of the story, however,Marlowe's fantastic, witty one-liners and his abilityto actually solve his cases despite irritatingeveryone he meets leads the reader to think he may besmarter than he looks. Women falling hard for him left andright complete the male criteria for excellence. I had tobuy all of Chandler's books and papers after this one."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"If you're still looking for the butler in the library with the candlestick, you better wisen up and get this book. Chandler has filled his work with intrigue, scandal, and a wise-ass detective who won't take nothing from nobody. From a decaying general, to his rowdy youngest daughter in her &quot;terrible twenties&quot;, in this book a menagerie of the craziest characters the page has ever seen sit. All that can be added to the superbly twisting plot. So, you better make sure that your next move is Phillip Marlowe in the bedroom in The Big Sleep(maybe you should get a gun too in case some underworld criminal pops out of the page while you hit your big sleep)"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Although I understand the popularity of the genre, murder mysteries like The Big Sleep are not usually satisfying reading experiences for me. I frequently feel like I'm missing or overemphasizing clues: \\"Does that empty coffee cup mean something?\\" \\"Oh, his eyebrow went up! He must have done it!\\"With The Big Sleep, I still experienced that feeling a bit, but the characters and voice were so strong and compelling that they more than made up for the plot twists and angles. Raymond Chandler's sentences are artistic masterpieces and clear influences on many 20th Century literary and cinematic archetypes.Marlowe is a strong individual. The other Raymond Chandler characters are like Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, searching for meaning in all the wrong places."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"\\"The Big Sleep\\" is full of clipped, sparse language that is clever, dry and witty. His characters are all sorts of sleaze, from cops to pornographers to junkie, slumming blonde heiresses. The main character,Private Eye Phillip Marlowe, is no better. He moves through this underworld with just as much greed, lack of feeling and brokeness as any of the other characters, all the while throwing out a witty, cynical narrative.The story involves him being hired by an elderly millionaire to find out who is blackmailing him. I really wasn't into the story too much. I'm not a mystery fan and I don't really care who did what. For that reason, I found the story to be confusing and hard to follow at times. However, what kept me reading is rough, surly writing style.At the core, this book is about work. Marlowe has a job to do. He does it. To him everybody he meets is merely someone who is going to either get him closer to achieving that goal or stand in the way of it. He even seems apathetic when he's in a situation where he's about to be killed. Only one goal seems to motivate him, finishing his job and gettng paid. He has no faith in humanity, even his own. As a taxi driver,this aspect of the book appealed to me."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"After I started reading Cain, specifically Double Indemnity, I decided that I should brush up on good ole' American detective novels. Chandler, no doubt, is considered to amongst the Pantheon of American detective writers.The Big Sleep is the first novel by Cain. I admire the gritty Los Angeles of the 1930s that Cain presents. His main character, Marlowe, is a tough yet sarcastic detective whose off to solve a blackmail problem for a certain wealthy family. Marlowe then gets involved with Murder, more blackmail, organized crime, and more.There are quite a few good things about this novel. The way he describes Los Angeles is both pertinent to the novel, and fun to read by itself. The snappy one liners and tough guy attitude both presents a noir type image for Marlowe, while allowing for humor. The characters, though outlandish, are indeed interesting and add to depth of the novel.There were some problems that I just couldn't get past though. First and foremost is the lack of continuity and fluidity. Chandler places a lot of emphasis on descriptions of buildings and atmosphere. While adding to the novel in some aspects, it bogs down the reader in many other aspects. It's also a pretty hard to follow book for today's reader. I'm not sure if it's his unique writing style that hasn't quite been developed, if the reader expected something different in the 30s, the language and colloquialisms have changed, or a combination of all of the above. Often times I found myself re-reading a few paragraphs and still being a bit confused about the exact situation.Finally, the book just kind of gets out there. It goes from blackmail to some murder with pornographers, to nude photographs, and casinos and such. With the fluidity and difficulty in reading this book, it magnified the lack of realism and outlandishness that I wouldn't really expect from a realistic detective novel.All in all, I admire the book, but I can't really say I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Long on atmosphere and equally long on confusion. At his best Chandler is great, but the Big Sleep owes its fame more to the Humphrey Bogart movie than the writing. The book was cobbled together from several short stories, and once you know this it is fairly obvious--the books cuts from scene to scene and it is hard pressed to make a connection between them. While some consider this a sign of a daring new lack of convention and or a mirror of the confusion of modern society, in truth it is really more a case of laziness. Nonetheless the book has classic scenes and gives us Marlowe, which alone makes it worthy of reading. And that Noir atmosphere is delicious."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Phillip Marlowe is absolutely amazing. The book is brilliant.Thanks to Raymond Chandler for giving me the desire to read again.I must warn you, if you read The Big Sleep, you won't stop there, you'll want more Marlowe because this character created by Chandler is one of the best detectives you would ever read about."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"A referral from an associate in the DA's office garners private investigator Philip Marlowe a job with the very wealthy General Sternwood. The General is elderly and infirm, living in a huge house with a discreet butler and two daughters--both born late in his life, and both rather wild girls. Where Carmen is ditzy and prone to flirtatiousness, Vivian is more self-assured and wears an air of self-possession, despite the fact that her husband, Rusty Regan, has disappeared without a word. However, that is not why the General has summoned Marlowe. There seems to be a small matter of blackmail...General Sternwood has received some promissory notes purporting to have been signed by Carmen; a card with the name Arthur Geiger, purveyor of rare books, is enclosed. Marlowe suspects it's an attempt to claim blackmail money, especially after he learns that the general was hit up for hush money a few months previously by a guy named Joe Brody, who wanted it in order to stop seeing Carmen. Since the General won't ask Carmen directly, Marlowe agrees to check things out. Before he can even get out of the house, Vivian Regan requests his presence in her room, and attempts to grill him over what he's doing for her father. But Marlowe is keeping a tight lip; he's not one to spill the beans about his clients, even if she is the client's daughter.Affecting a cover as a man knowledgeable about rare books, Marlowe goes to Geiger's book store but apparently the worthy gentleman is not on the premises, and the gal he's hired to take care of things doesn't know as much about rare books as perhaps she should. When she hands a wrapped parcel to a mysterious visitor in exchange for an unspecified amount of cash, Marlowe suspects there is more here than meets the eye. So he takes his leave and follows the man, giving him a distinct case of the heebie-jeebies. The nervous Nate ditches the package, and Marlowe retrieves it.Having gotten a description of Geiger from a girl in a bookstore across the street, Marlowe cases Geiger's place until he appears, and tails him to his house on Laverne Terrace. Night slips in as Marlowe bides his time. A sudden flash from Geiger's home, followed by a scream and three shots, draws him in, where he discovers a naked Carmen Sternwood, and a dead Arthur Geiger. Being a discreet kind of guy, he returns the stoned heiress--properly dressed--to the bosom of her loving family, and returns to the scene of the crime, only to discover that the body is gone!A dead chauffeur, a lending library of pornography, gambling debts, scandal and more strew Marlowe's path as he seeks the answers to questions which only lead to more questions. Why does everyone think he's searching for Rusty Regan? Marlowe will stop at nothing to get at the truth, including putting his own life in peril.This is my first Raymond Chandler novel, his first Philip Marlowe, and it's a great introduction to the PI, as well as a wonderful addition to the genre. Although written a long time ago, it definitely withstands the test of time, and is just as fascinating for modern readers as any contemporary novel. Chandler has a definite way with descriptions that give you instant pictures of what he's talking about. For example, this description of the Sternwood home:Over the entrance doors, which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants, there was a broad stained-glass panel showing a knight in dark armor rescuing a lady who was tied to a tree and didn't have any clothes on but some very long and convenient hair.Marlowe is a cynical observer of the human condition, and he isn't afraid to tell it like it is. Or to take a chance, even if it means putting his life on the line or getting physical. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and am looking forward to reading the next one, Farewell My Lovely. I recently watched the film, The Big Sleep, which I shall review separately, and compare the book to the movie."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Considering the time this was written, any author who wanted to write a detective book tha could sell in the drug store was limited to certain paramenters. Today's detective novels either are descriptions of graphic sex, gory murder, torture, and/or both. Its odd that despite all these modern novels, political correctness seems to be a must, as part of the plot and characters.If someone watches the film based on this film, the viewer is confused by the lack of direct mention of homosexuality. The most we get out of the film is a sanitized version of the taboos that existed at the time for a main stream film.This book, and film represents the times that I knew. Men were the cops, detectives, the bad guys, and the women were kinder, gentler and backdrop characters. Carmen, represents the evil female, who has been around since Lady McBeth. She is a disurbed, hedonistic, spoiled brat. Contrary to the most critical review, she is far from an unbelivable character. In fact, in that era, that type of female character was a ground breaking character, who could sold witin a book that was above pulp fiction. Compared to some female characters of todays films and novels, she pales.For someone of my generation that grew up with Chandler, Spillane yes, Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Cristie, Daphe DeMaurea, I miss whodoneits that don't involve the total collapse of mankind involving heads of state, total disintergration of society, and all handled by a character, sometimes a minority, who shots 60 shot revolvers, has fantastic physical skills, and IQ's of 190. Those new films and novels are cartoons. Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade are ordinary men, who solve ordinary crimes. There exhagerations of being a privatge detective are the fact that that business involves men who often are failures involved in the grimy, poorly paid occupation, that usually involves cathing a spouse in an act that used in a divorce case. Making that fact of life interesting makes Chandlers works, including The Big Sleep worth reading, or my cse listning on an MP3."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This is my first read of Raymond Chandler and, although the plot got a little confusing at parts, I was quite impressed over all. The Big Sleep initially involves Phillip Marlowe attempting to handle a blackmailing case for an elderly gentleman named Sherwood. However, while investigating the purported blackmailer Geiger, Marlowe becomes involved with a much more complex puzzle, filled with murder, extortion, bribery, two-timers, mind games, twist and turns, and plenty of types you wouldn't bring home to show off to family dinner. Marlowe has his work cut out for him.The Big Sleep is an edgy noir, not afraid to be uncomfortable, rough, and controversial. It's no wonder when we are seeing the world from the perspective of Philip Marlowe, a brash, tough private investigator who doesn't mind speaking his mind with a little twisted smirk. He also doesn't mind having a few drinks while on the job and using plenty of verbal jabs to make you despise him--- or admire him. (Gotta admit, though, the guy can think on his feet and solve cases). He's got the street smarts and instincts to deal with double-crossers, backstabbers, and women as wild as Lindsey Lohan, Paris Hilton and the Kardashian sisters combined. If something doesn't smell right, it probably isn't, reasons Marlowe. Chandler has such a command of getting into Marlowe's head. When you read The Big Sleep, you forget that Raymond Chandler is the mastermind behind all this because you become so invested in Marlowe's narrative point of view. Marlowe has a cynicism and wit, but also the instinctive skills to match with the best of the noir detectives.A great read, and I look forward to reading the next in the series, Farewell, My Lovely."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This was the spark that fueled the entire film noir / hard boiled private detective genre.

And the fact that the Big Lebowski is loosely based on this is a huge plus."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler was born on July 23 1888 at Chicago Illinois. In 1896 he attended Dulwich College in London. Between 1905 and 1912 he spent a year in France and Germany, then after passing his Civil Service examinations he worked for the British Admiralty for six months while living in Bloomsbury, becoming a freelance journalist for a while before returning to the U.S. At the outbreak of war he enlisted with the Canadian Gordan Highlanders, served in France before joining the Royal Flying Corps, and was demobilised in England in 1919. After the death of his mother, five years after returning to California, he married. After various kinds of jobs, the first of a number of his stories were published in Black Mask Magazine, between 1933 and 1936, then in Detective Monthly in 1937/38. His first full-length novel, The Big Sleep, was published in 1939.We are introduced to Phillip Marlowe, a cynical, world weary private eye who describes himself as 'neat, clean, shaved and sober - everything a well-dressed private detective ought to be' as he is about to enter the Sternwood residence, with 'entrance doors, which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants'. On the way is confronted by 'trouble' in the form of a young woman with expressionless eyes and predatory teeth. He introduces himself as 'Doghouse Reilly - a sleuth'. 'You're cute', she giggles.He is taken by the butler-chauffer to a greenhouse filled with plants: 'a forest of them, with nasty meaty leaves and stalks like the newly washed fingers of dead men'. He meets an old and obviously dying man (General Sternwood) sitting in a wheel chair. It appears a certain Arthur Gwynne Geiger is attempting to collect gambling debts owed by the General's daughter Carmen - whom we have already met.From that stage onward the plot thickens and the pace never slackens. Chandler's superb eye for detail and laconic dialogue remain as fresh and amusing today as when originally written.The Learning Process: Some Creative Impressions"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Book arrived in perfect condition--was easy to read--and yet a classic.

It's as if he just needed a vessel for his immense talent for turning a phrase that would sell and make money. Hey! Detective novels. That's it! If you want something to obscess about for a few weeks, if you like to say &quot;Wow, look at that sentence&quot;, get into Raymond Chandler novels. He only wrote seven. And save your Blockbuster money, no movie could ever do this stuff justice."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Great book! If you like detective fiction, then you will love this book."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"THE BIG SLEEP functions on several levels, and appeals to a wide variety of readers for this reason. On the surface, it's a vintage (1939) whodunnit with a wealthy geriatric patriarch, a missing Irish ex-bootlegger, a beautiful but shallow blonde with some unsavory connections to a purveyor of smut, a long-legged raven-haired beauty who seems surprisingly unconcerned about her missing Irish husband, and a series of corpses that keep littering the path to a resolution of matters.The convoluted plot may strain credibility like a politician's campaign promises, but never mind that. The book is not about plot. It's about the details of death, the emotions of danger and the smell of fear, the corruption of power, and the power of corruption. It's about hedges trimmed as tidy as poodle-dogs, stained-glass knights in shining armor, damsels more dangerous than any alleged distress that might serve to lure a chivalrous private eye into their web of deceit. It's about a Don Quixote of the mean streets waging a private war between his own base desires and his own impossible standards. It's a guided tour of the small triumphs and victories of decency and honor and human conscience in the face of the overwhelming flood of depravity, dishonesty and degradation.It's a fun and easy read, and while some of the slang may be dated, the symmetry of syntax and the graphic power of simile never gets stale, read after read after read. A watershed work that has inspired generations of mystery writers from Ross Macdonald to Michael Connelly, and echoes in the works and words of countless of wordsmiths of the macabre persuasion."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Witty, poetic and and superbly paced, The Big Sleep is the best book I have ever come across in the crime-fiction genre.

Beautifully written with razor sharp dialogue, a strong central character (Philip Marlowe, Private Investigator) and atmospheric description. The story's infamously labyrinthine plot with it's twists and turns is challenging but doesn't come close to being impenetrable. My only real complaint is that the book to me seems more like an exercise in style and there really isn't too much substance. All in all, an excellent read if you're looking for something well written but light. Recommended."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Good book...story well told in the old writing style of dectective stories, very much the classical style...Shows its age, but stands the test of time...Reading it one can almost visualize,hear and feel Bogart reading the lines...from a historical standpoint, and a literary standpoint, well worth the read, just to see how much the genre has changed....good story with classical characters, good guys, bad guys and one or two fringe guys. And dolls...lots of dolls.

I found the action entertaining, yet difficult to tie together. Only at the very end do we get the benefit of Marlowe's revelation. Even so, one of the deaths was never addressed. Between bodies falling, this book features more shady characters than even Los Angeles could have supported. Most of them die, of course. With the exception of the General, only Marlowe seems to have a clear conscience in this saga into the gutter of morality. I did enjoy Chandler's use of language in characterizing so much of the story with subtlety. It is hard to believe Marlowe would risk so much because of his duty to his client."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"And old codger who lives his last days in a hot-house calls in Marlow to help him. It seems he has received a blackmail threat from a person whom he has never met! Before Marlowe can hit the pavement, the codger's sexy young daughter has dragged Marlowe upstairs for a quick conference. The trail leads to a rather disreputable bookstore on Hollywood Boulevard and the trail keeps twisting as marlowe opens a can of malignant worms that he never imagined. As usual (okay, always!) with me, the plot is confusing and difficlut to follow. In fact, I admit to occasionally being bugged by Chandler's stylish techniqye of letting the reader guess who is talking, but the words Chandler uses are above reproach. I loved this book, and admired Chandler's ability to absorb the reader in the dark world of his imaginings."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Dames. Dames, and their witty comebacks.The Big Sleep, a hard-boiled detective yarn, was much too confusing. You think you are learning the myriad of main and peripheral characters, and then you drift for a minute because of a piece of stray lint on your sleeve and are out to sea and asking \\"Who is that?\\" You think you are following the long plot arc, but then you take a sip of your chocolate milk, check your text messages, and have no idea why there are gun shots being fired. I enjoyed this film, but it makes you work hard. Some of the mystery is intentional and a puzzle, while other aspects of the scattered story are just the result of poor construction. I like a challenge, but when you layer in lots of repartee and characters that seem to drift in and out and then inexplicably reappear, viewers get lost. Nice try, but you lost me.Humphrey Bogart plays Philip Marlowe, a private eye with a knack for getting into trouble and reeling off snappy remarks. In particular, he is skilled at making clever small talk with attractive women. And they all seem to want him. One, in particular, played by Bogart's way-too-young-for-him real life wife, Lauren Bacall, seems to be nothing more than a prop used to create some cheesy romantic tension and to manufacture a throwaway kissing sequence. (I also did not understand the musical number with Bacall. Totally unnecessary; must be a 1940s thing.) The dialogue between Bogart and Bacall is good. Maybe a little too good and too sharp for reality. In The Big Sleep's reality, everyone is witty.I never figured out why it was called The Big Sleep, either. Maybe that is a figure of speech that is new to me?There is an abundance of smoking and drinking in this movie. Wow. Really, who carries around a bottle of rye in his pocket and then whips it out for a sniff when he is stuck inside a book store with an attractive brunette because of a torrential downpour? From the opening sequence with lit cigarettes to Bogart's constant drinking and smoking, it is no wonder this guy died young. Although I am not a big classic film guy, I cannot imagine that these vices were as prevalent in other films from the era. The over-indulgence of tobacco and alcohol throughout this picture gives you the impression that the characters are living hard, taking chances, telling lies, covering up, and easing their pain with booze and smokes. Effective.Another interesting aspect is the careful treatment of drug use and pornography. When Bogart happens upon a woman stoned out of her gourd in a chair, we never really know exactly what she was doing to get in that beleaguered state. Likewise, it is only hinted at that she was posing for nudie pictures and that a dead man found near her was a seedy pornographer. There are subtle pointers, but the movie never jumps out and smacks you across the face with what would likely be explicit in today's movies. The beating around the bush makes watching this movie a little frustrating, but also satisfying when you get to fill in the blanks on your own. It is a bit like a choose your own adventure book.I would not place The Big Sleep on a list of my favorite detective movies, but it has some merit. You will enjoy the dialogue. The star power of the leads is bright. But the plot twists too much and leaves you scratching your head."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I figured I might as well start with the master, and boy, was this a fun ride! There are some issues with the prose on occasion (wordiness, lack of clarity) but as a whole it's a tightly-paced thriller with believable plot elements and an interesting cast of characters. It was especially interesting to read as a 21st century girl, with so many things that would be politically incorrect or offensive today. I will definitely continue to read Chandler in the future. I've heard his style grew as he wrote, so I'm curious to read his later books."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"After watching the TV Show Castle, I became infatuated with mystery novels.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"The Big Sleep, first published in 1939, introduced the world to Philip Marlowe, private detective, a character who would go on to become synonymous with the concept of \\"hard-boiled\\" crime fiction. I've long been a fan of film noir, notable for its fast-talking, world-weary detectives, glamorous femme fatales, and striking use of shadow and light to illustrate the seamier side of life on-screen. Considering how much I love classic examples of the film noir genre such as The Big Sleep or The Maltese Falcon, it is all the more shocking that it has taken me this long to read the literary equivalent of those films. Chandler turned to writing in his mid-forties after losing his job with an oil company due to the Depression, and his writing reflects a hard-won maturity and cynicism. He began writing short stories for pulp magazines, and The Big Sleep was based on two of them -- \\"Killer in the Rain\\" (1935) and \\"The Curtain\\" (1936).When Philip Marlowe is called to the home of the wealthy Sternwood family, he's hired by the elderly patriarch to make bookseller Arthur Geiger's attempt to blackmail his wild youngest daughter Carmen disappear. The General has a second daughter, Vivian, married to an ex-bootlegger named Rusty Regan who recently disappeared and may or may not be involved in the younger daughter's current trouble. At first blush what appears to be a fairly straightforward commission -- remove the thorn in the elderly General's side -- is anything but, as Marlowe quickly discovers that the Sternwood daughters have secrets to keep -- secrets that some may be willing to kill in order to keep quiet. Over the course of his investigation, Marlowe finds himself swept up in a seedy world of illegal pornographers and secret gambling establishments -- and the deeper Marlowe digs, the more bodies start to accumulate. And the answer to one question -- where is Rusty Regan? -- threatens to destroy the Sternwood reputation and silence Marlowe forever.Like the classic 1946 film adaptation that featured Bogart as Marlowe, the movie's source material twists and turns through the seamy side of a Los Angeles on the brink of exploding into the metropolis it would become in the 1940s during Hollywood's Golden Age. But Chandler is less concerned with Tinseltown's sheen and more with letting us accompany Marlowe as he navigates through the moral and ethical corruptions fostered by the excesses of L.A.'s position as an entertainment capital of the world. One criticism of the film and novel is the twisty, confusing nature of the plot. While this isn't a perfectly plotted novel, it isn't the mechanics of the investigation that captivated me -- it was witnessing Marlowe's responses to the characters and situations he encounters. Chandler's dialogue and prose are razor-sharp (\\"I don't mind if you don't like my manners. They're pretty bad. I grieve over them during the long winter nights.\\"), an absolute joy to read -- this is a book I savored.Rich in atmosphere and character, The Big Sleep is an unforgettable introduction to Chandler's work. Marlowe is something like a shopworn knight -- world-weary, sarcastic and cynical, but clinging to a deeply rooted sense of honor and set of principles, he is a uniquely American literary hero. I'll definitely be reading his further adventures."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"A Knife in the HeartImitators may have tried to turn Chandler into a cliche but the real thing still crackles off the page with energy."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"The Big Sleep, by Raymond ChandlerMarlowe is summoned for a job at General Sternwood's opulent mansion. He first meets Carmen, the younger daughter who is a few cards short of a full deck. The General stays in his hothouse, looking like a near corpse. He tells Marlow about Rusty Regan, the older daughter's third husband, who suddenly disappeared last month. The real job is the gambling debts of Carmen. Before leaving, Marlowe meets Vivian, the spoiled and ruthless older daughter, who asks about his assignment. Chandler painted a picture of a powerful and corrupt family whose wealth far exceeds their judgment. Marlow represents the real people who must follow the whims of the ruling elite. Chandler used many words to describe the surroundings and background, more literary than Hammett or Gardner.Marlowe began to investigate the man who had Carmen's gambling chits. Geiger's store rents \\"rare books\\". Marlowe followed Geiger to his house, then waited and watched. When he heard shots Marlowe broke in. Carmen was seated, nude with pin-point pupils. Geiger lay dead on the floor. Marlowe rescued Carmen and drove back in her Packard. Marlowe walked back to Geiger's house (not taxi driver with a memory for him). He found Geiger's body has disappeared! Next the Sternwood's chauffeur is found dead in a car that went into the ocean; was it murder? Marlowe shadows Geiger's store again, and learns more. The journey towards the truth continues.Who killed Geiger? And Taylor the chauffeur? Gathering the facts allows the solution of the puzzle. Chapter 19 tells how the newspapers covered the stories. Chapter 25 has the news on a missing couple that Marlowe isn't looking for. Marlowe drives to this small town, locates the isolated house, and finds danger (Chapter 27). Marlowe explains his actions to General Sternwood, and gets another assignment (Chapter 30). The surprise ending occurs in Chapter 31. Little hints had been sprinkled throughout the book, but a reader would not pick them up. We see what we expect to see in most cases. The final chapter has the solution to Regan's disappearance. Marlowe orders the solution to the remaining problems and leaves, trusting his advice will be taken.The moral of this story reminds me of \\"Love Story\\" where someone poor falls in love with someone rich, and the poor person comes to a bad end. As Owen Taylor did. Do the rich get away with murder, literally? Do the wealthy spend their time with drink, drugs, gambling, sex, and other thrills? Would higher taxes on estates and trusts prevent this problem? Note how the super rich use the underworld to solve problems that can't be delegated to lawyers."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This is the place to start if you like noir writing. If you like Parker, MacDonald, Connelly, or Burke, this is the book will be for you. Warning that it is a little hard to read, and may take awhile to get into it. The story will confuse and befuddle, but it is ultimately rewarding. The great thing about it is not only do you enjoy reading a great story, but you get a glimpse into a Los Angles of the past and a different cultural era. The darkside of the glamour city. Must read and the place to start for a study of noir mystery."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep should not be sold in this fine art deco-style cover in pristine condition. It should be sold dog-eared with the cover torn and with pages falling out. After all, that will be the condition of your copy after you've read it and reread it and reread it again. Chandler's startling first novel is a lot of fun. His innovative style rings true today, never to be matched. Philip Marlowe, tough, unrepentant, loyal, yet acting above the law, is a remarkable character. His encounters with crime figures and loose ladies stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"The Big Sleep, one of those many tough guy sleuth detective stories which reminds one of Perry Mason, The Thin Man, and Colombo (..if he was placed in 1930s Los Angeles), is one of Raymond Chandler's better stories. Some of his Philipe Marlowe detective stories have very convoluted plots which make the stories almost incoherent. Fortunately this isn't the case with The Big Sleep.Here our story is of a elderly, disabled rich man with wild and dangerous daughters. Philip Marlowe is hired to sort out a blackmail situation, but then finds himself pulled into the twisted lives of the two daughters, their boyfriends, and the criminal underworld. The story does hang together, and is generally plausible. Next to The Lady in the Lake, The Big Sleep is my favorite Philipe Marlowe novel.Bottom line: an above par Philipe Marlowe story. Recommended."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"After seeing a revival of the film based on this book, I was so impressed I decided to check out the original. Not quite sure what to expect, I began reading one rainy Sunday afternoon, and had finished the book entirely by Wednesday. For me, that's a record. The novel is such a page-turner! It's rare for a story told in the first person to not seem slightly sticky (speaking personally) but this is an exception. But then this is an exceptional read. How Chandler manages to avoid being hackneyed and trite while being both cynical and knowing I can only marvel at.Despite it's noir sensibilities, at it's (and, I think, Chandler's) core is a recognition of the power in basic human spirit, and that while we are all struggling to make our way in a much-less than perfect world, we are all trying to evolve ourselves into something better. But it's not laid on with a trowel and it's never preached. The reader is invited to bring something of his or her strength, hope and experiences to the narrative. If you are world-weary and pessimistic, Marlowe shows than beneath the dross, there's a little (a very little) decency out there. If you are an incurable Pollyanna, then the evil that men (and women) do in their misguided exploitation of others (an the reasons for it) are there for you to see. Remarkable."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Chandler's stories aren't mysteries by any normal definition of the genre. Finding out whodunnit rarely drives the plot and we are not presented with clues along the way to build suspense as the sleuth uses his cleverness to right an injustice. Chandler himself ridiculed this type of story brilliantly in an essay for the Atlantic Monthly called \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\", which is easy to find online.Chandler's stories are something else entirely. They are an examination of human morality as observed by a friendless gumshoe, who assuages his deep despair about his dead-end life and the world around him with wisecracks and whiskey.Phillip Marlowe's Los Angeles of the thirties is a place where greed, vice and corruption blot out any of life's bright sunshine. There are a few virtuous women, but they haven't been there long. There are a few honest cops, but you wonder why they bother to be. Everybody carries a gun because everybody needs one. People are rarely surprised to have a gun pulled on them. That's the way Los Angeles is.Nothing tethers Marlowe to Los Angeles; after all, he could drink whiskey and play chess with himself anywhere. But people aren't much better anywhere else, and tall, dangerous blondes of the show biz type provide desperately needed excitement to his melancholy trudge through life.Marlowe is unique in Chandler's Los Angeles. He has a code. He'll deceive the cops to protect his client's interest, even when he's not sure his client is levelling with him. He lives in dignified poverty, completely familiar with more lucrative ways to practice his profession. He is a brave fool, because to to die with valor is a romantic notion and to live longer is of no particular interest to him or anybody else.The writing is breathtaking in its economy. He tells you everything you need to know and nothing you don't--leading some critics to charge that the women are cardboard cutouts. Marlowe's not interested in the details. About all he needs to know about a blonde broad with a gun is that she has a gun; he doesn't care how she got there.Chandler's low-born work is some of the very best American prose. As a stylist of sentences he can stand beside Hemingway and as a crafter of one-liners he can stand right behind Shakespeare. Really.Everything you'll read elsewhere about the muddled plots is true. It's pretty clear that writing tight, galloping plots bored him. His stories are paintings, not movies. Don't worry about it and don't get bogged down by it. Read it the first time to appreciate the sentences, the scenes, and the observations about humanity. If you are a lover of fine writing, at some point you'll read it again when you can enjoy focusing on the plot. Although you probably won't be able to remember it for more than an hour after you finish the book, the plot turns out to be artful in its own way.Still not convinced? Read the excerpt above, in which Phillip Marlowe introduces himself to the world."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"What more can be said about Raymond Chandler's first novel, published in 1939? Dashiell Hammett may have preceded Chandler with Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon, but Chandler's style, as well as protagonist Phillip Marlowe, stand on their own.Both Hammett and Chandler can be credited with creating this genre, from which the work the likes of Mickey Spillane, Erle Stanley Gardner and Elmore Leonard spawned. While none can perhaps be considered literary art, they are nonetheless art within their genre. Chandler's first person narrative sparkles with Marlowe's dry wit:I went back to my office and sat in my swivel chair and tried to catch up on my foot-dangling.And:Then she lowered her lashes until they almost cuddled her cheeks and slowly raised them again, like a theater curtain. I was to get to know that trick. That was supposed to make me roll over on my back with all four paws in the air.The story, too, is perhaps ahead of its time, dealing in part with L.A.'s infant pornography business, something at which, in the movie version starring Bogart and Bacall, didn't really even hint.Chandler has been praised as a star of the first magnitude and knocked as a world class drunk, but William Faulkner, no stranger to drink himself, wrote the screenplay from a novel he scarce understood. Faulkner had to ask Chandler who killed the Sternwood chauffeur, to which Chandler replied, rather sarcastically, \\"I don't know.\\" Truly, the movie version was more a vehicle for Bogart and Bacall than for Chandler's genius.This noir may not appeal to everyone, but I got a kick out of reading a period piece, a fun read and one that holds a solid place in American noir literature.Recommended."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"If you enjoyed the indispensable Bogey & Bacall classic movie by the same name, you will undoubtedly enjoy this masterfully pinned classic novel. What makes this novel worth reading even after having seen the flick are the both subtle and striking divergences amongst the two art forms.For starters, the book is infinitely more juicier than the movie in terms of sheer debauchery and scathing wisecracks. Secondly, Carmen is much more central in the book than in the movie -- not to mention the conspicuous absence of Eddie Mars' wife in the movie. As a bonus, you get to hear \\"You're cute\\" uttered by the temptress many more times in the book. Moreover, a pivotal scene at the end is omitted at the end of the movie that will irretrievably change your outlook on the movie's conclusion.Vivian: Why did you have to go on?Marlowe: Too many people told me to stop."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I know this is a famous novel of the hard-boiled private eye Phil Marlowe genre, so I worry about giving it 3 stars. But it just didn't seem that good.The pace seemed slow throughout, and slower in more than a few places.Although Marlowe's character seemed well developed, other characters seemed superficial, and (even the antagonists) without clear goals or motivations. Marlowe seemed to go from event to event (deaths in most of them), for the most part without participating in them. Even the events themselves, and the characters in them, didn't seem to be based on any sort of continuous plot that hung together.Oh well, I bought it for escapist reading, and even though it was easy to put down and harder to pick up again, I got through it. A bit too much exposition and description in it for my taste, since it slowed down what action there was.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, other than as a famous (first?) book of the hard-boiled private eye genre."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond ChandlerThe Big SleepVintage, Paperback, [1992].8vo. 231 pp.First published, 1939.============================================I thought it was high time to read this novel. It was a shame, really, that I had seen the1946 moviewith Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall some five times already, yet had never read Chandler's classic novel. Detective fiction is not exactly my cup of tea, but, then again, neither is any other specific genre: as long as something is well written and exciting, I would read just about anything. As far as Chandler (and, for that matter, Hammett) is concerned, Somerset Maugham's admiration for his colleagues, as amply expressed in his vastly entertaining essay ''The Decline and Fall of the Detective Story'' (in the collection \\"The Vagrant Mood\\", 1952), doubtless additionally stimulated my interest. Before going any further, here is the usual warning.Please be aware that, if you haven't read the book or seen the movie, I am going to spoil both for you. Plot details and memorable lines abound below and it's certainly better to experience them for the first time in the original versions. The book is my primary objective here, but the movie will be discussed in some detail as well.On the whole, though \\"The Big Sleep\\" was not quite as exciting and entertaining as I had expected, it was a fascinating read of considerable merit. The story is complex and complicated - racket, blackmail, no fewer than five dead bodies, some of them ''behind the scenes'', some not - yet it is expertly paced and subtly told, keeping you well on the edge until the last few pages. There are several twists and, though I was well prepared for them by the movie, they were hardly less unexpected on paper. The generally superb dialogue is, in my opinion, the best feature of the novel. It conveys dramatic situations with great vividness and even greater suspense. I don't know if the pen is mightier than the sword, but here spoken words certainly seem to be mightier than the gun, no doubt because use of the latter is mightily stimulated by the careless handling of the former. That the conversation is occasionally a little too slangy to be easily understood is most probably due to my insufficient knowledge of the language, not to Chandler's handling of it. ''See if this bird is wearing any iron'' or \\"Let's dip the bill\\" are quite clear from the context, but some other gems like ''put the bite on the peeper'' or ''pitch dimes against the wall'' are not. Never mind. It's a very effective and often amusing dialogue; check this example that found its way into the movie more or less verbatim:''Yes. How come that you had a key?''''Is that any of your business, soldier?''''I could make it my business.''He smiled tightly and pushed his hat back on his gray hair.''And I could make your business my business.''''You wouldn't like it. The pay's too small.''Similar fast exchanges of pointed remarks, in combination with very accurate descriptions of faces and reactions, make for superb dramatic scenes in which you never quite know who's hiding what and why. The verisimilitude is indeed cinematographic: you see and hear the guys as if you were watching a movie. Marlowe's marvellous sense of humour does enliven both the narrative and the dialogue. It is a welcome relief from the generally gloomy atmosphere. Favourite examples include unforgettable description of Agnes \\"as limp as a fresh-killed rabbit\\" or Carmen's raising her eyebrows \\"like a theatre curtain\\", one of her favourite tricks which was supposed to make \\"me roll over on my back with all four paws in the air\\". I can certainly see why Raymond Chandler is generally regarded as a fine prose stylist. Unfortunately, his pen is not uniformly that good.My major disappointment with the book is the narrative. It is Marlowe himself who tells the whole story in the first person singular, but his short, abrupt sentences, with much too many repetitions of personal pronouns, often sound like slaps in my face. Despite the fact that such writing suits the subject rather well and despite Marlowe's refreshing jokes now and then, there are a number of places where the writing detracts more than it adds. The action scenes in particular - tail jobs, gun fights, etc. - come off rather tedious and unconvincing. It wasn't until the middle of the book that it turned into a page-turner and I became really involved in the subtleties of the story - and in the character of the story-teller. Also, in the early chapters in particular, there are many unduly extended descriptions of surroundings. Of course this is essential - some sleuth if he is not observant! - but it does tend to become boring. Last but not least, there is one point in the dialogue where it falls short of its generally high quality. Surprisingly or not, these are Marlowe's conversations with the female characters, most notably the Sternwood sisters.So the book does, or at least in my case it did, require a considerable amount of pages to become really absorbing. But after that there was no stopping until the end. Apart from the intricacies of the plot, the most compelling thing about The Big Sleep is, of course, Marlowe himself. In addition to a lively sense of humour that sometimes produces similes one wouldn't expect a ''private dick on a case'' to have in his vocabulary - ''the sunshine was as empty as a headwaiter's smile'' - Marlowe has a professional integrity that's difficult not to arouse admiration. He is unscrupulously honest and loyal. For ''25 bucks and expenses'' a day he risks constantly his profession and his neck, often getting in trouble with the police in order to protect his clients. Perhaps what impresses me most in Marlowe is his astonishing indifference to the gentle sex. \\"I was nauseated by women\\", as he himself put it colourfully at one place. I am not sure I would kick out of my bed the stark naked Carmen but he certainly did. (This is why Chandler should have omitted the lame flirt with the Silver-Wig, aka Mrs Eddie Mars, in the end; it is unconvincing and irrelevant.) One doesn't read detective fiction for characterisation of course, but it is just wonderful to have at least a main character who is smart, sympathetic, amusing and, above all, plausibly and convincingly drawn.The movie and the book make a most interesting comparison. The novel is much bolder, much more noir than the version for the screen. You wouldn't expect to find Carmen in Geiger's house wearing only her earrings, would you? But that's how you find her on the pages; it's rather more effective than the gorgeous dress in the movie. Another example is the relationship between Marlowe and Bernie Ohls, the D.A.'s chief investigator. It is friendly and full of lighthearted chaff in the movie, quite unlike the strained and often sinister conversations in the book. On the whole, however, the screenplay is pretty close to the novel and makes a fine use of some of Marlowe's most memorable lines, such as those about guns:\\"My, my, my! Such a lot of guns around town and so few brains!\\"[Disarming yet another bad guy:]\\"Somebody's always giving me guns.\\"The book also has the advantage of providing much better understanding of the plot and a much fuller picture of what it is to be a private detective. Take for example the remarkable Chapter 18 - entirely missing in the movie - where Marlowe is hard pressed between the hammer and the anvil, that is between the police and the D.A. This was the first time when it dawned on me how tricky a business being a ''shamus'' must be. On the one hand, you are running a serious danger of being filled with lead by a number of shady subjects with itchy fingers into whose lucrative affairs your meddling is not exactly welcome. On the other hand, you are in the almost equally serious danger of being arrested for interfering with police business - for example by not reporting a murder, something Marlowe actually did and frankly admitted would do again - in order to protect the interests of your client. Then the least that can happen to you is to lose your license. As for the plot, it is somewhat confused and rushed in the movie, nor is the changed ending that adds another corpse any improvement over the original. In the latter, everything is perfectly clear and Marlowe is given several long speeches that would sound gorgeous on the stage.The most notable difference between both versions is the greatly enlarged relationship between Marlowe and Vivian in the movie, no doubt designed as a vehicle for Bogie and Bacall. Chandler didn't take part in the writing of the screenplay, but no fewer that three people (William Faulkner among them) did a splendid job. In this respect, the interaction between the sleuth and the elder of the Sternwood sisters, the movie is indeed greatly superior to the novel. It contains one of the coolest romances ever put on the screen - \\"I guess I'm in love with you\\" - and though something like that does exist in the novel as well, it is infinitely better handled in the script. And there are, of course, the unforgettable last lines of the screenplay, again entirely missing from the novel:Vivian: You've forgotten one thing - me.Marlowe: What's wrong with you?Vivian: Nothing you can't fix.Considering my well-known passion for horses, I cannot but quote the legendary conversation that heaps one double entendre over another. It's an unforgettable scene, especially with Lauren Bacall's sultry looks and husky voice, not to mention the hilarious prelude:Marlowe: How'd you happen to pick out this place?Vivian: Maybe I wanted to hold your hand.Marlowe: Oh, that can be arranged.[He gives her his hand and she gives him - one of her gloves. A little later, sipping their drinks:]Vivian: Speaking of horses, I like to play them myself. But I like to see them workout a little first, see if they're front runners or come from behind, find out what their whole card is, what makes them run.Marlowe: Find out mine?Vivian: I think so.Marlowe: Go ahead.Vivian: I'd say you don't like to be rated. You like to get out in front, open up a little lead, take a little breather in the backstretch, and then come home free.Marlowe: You don't like to be rated yourself.Vivian: I haven't met anyone yet that can do it. Any suggestions?Marlowe: Well, I can't tell till I've seen you over a distance of ground. You've got a touch of class, but I don't know how far you can go.Vivian: A lot depends on who's in the saddle.The screenplay also makes much more fun of the scenes between Marlowe and Vivian, and these, too, are magnificently played by Bogie and Lauren. These moments, regrettably, are either omitted completely from the novel or changed out of recognition:Vivian: You go too far, Marlowe.Marlowe: Those are harsh words to throw at a man, especially when he's walking out of your bedroom.Vivian: I don't like your manners.Marlowe: And I'm not crazy about yours. I didn't ask to see you. I don't mind if you don't like my manners, I don't like them myself. They are pretty bad. I grieve over them on long winter evenings. I don't mind your ritzing me drinking your lunch out of a bottle. But don't waste your time trying to cross-examine me.Last but not least, indeed perhaps most important of all, the romance between Marlowe and Vivian gives a very plausible motive of the former's rather illogical behaviour. For why does the private dick continue with the case when Geiger's dead and he's been paid off? The book does address the issue, by Marlowe reflecting that leaving the case is the smart thing to do - then the does the opposite for no good reason and entirely out of character. The movie improves greatly on that, for there Marlowe continues the rather dangerous game for Vivian's sake, having shrewdly perceived that Eddie Mars \\"got something on her\\" and she is in deep trouble.What is both amusing and annoying in the movie, but entirely missing in the book, is that Marlowe is constantly surrounded by swooning females everywhere he goes: the book store, the taxi, the snack bar, the library. Occasionally these scenes have some charm, too. My favourite is the gorgeous taxi driver.Taxi Driver: If you can use me again sometime, call this number.Marlowe: Day and night?Taxi Driver: Uh, night's better. I work during the day.Finally, to finish with the dialogue, it should be said that the screenplay also improves many of Marlowe's conversations with other female characters. In the book these are often verbose and protracted; and sometimes the choice of words is not the most effective. For example Marlowe's last words to Agnes - ''Like hell you did'' - have a better alternative in the movie. Small wonder that she couldn't think of any retort:Agnes: Well, so long, copper. Wish me luck. I got a raw deal.Marlowe: Your kind always does.Marlowe's troublesome relationship, or lack of such, with the seriously disturbed and hopelessly nymphomaniac Carmen is much more amusing on the screen than Chandler's awkward treatment in the novel. Here are two cute answers to Carmen's profound statements and questions which, as far I can remember, do not occur in the book:Carmen: You're cute.Marlowe: I'm getting cuter every minute.[Few seconds later:]Carmen: Is he as cute as you are?Marlowe: Nobody is.All in all, a great movie and a great book, although both could have been done better. The many differences work in both directions - some are improvements, some are not - and make for many rather fascinating comparisons. The movie, for me, still remains worth seeing mostly because of the scenes between Bogie and Lauren, a subplot either badly neglected or badly executed in the novel. All of these scenes - in Vivian's bedroom, in Marlowe's ''boudoir'', in the car, in the bar - are tremendous examples of sexual innuendo suggesting a steamy affair. (Incidentally, Chandler once paid one of the best compliments to Bogie by saying that he could be a tough guy without a gun.) On the other hand, the major plot is much more effective in the book. The no-nonsense male-to-male conversations, the relentless grimness of the characters, and the subtle shades of the story are significantly superior to anything in the movie. I understand most of Raymond Chandler's other works also include Philip Marlowe. It is probably safe to say that he has earned my future reading attention and that's just about the greatest compliment I can pay him. \\"The Big Sleep\\" being his first novel, I am curious if he later improved on it."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"The grandaddy of hardboiled detective fiction. Chandler could write, though it does seem a little slow by today's standards. Also, it's hard not to be imagining Bogart instead of the writer's Marlowe. Still, worth a read after all this time."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"\\"The Big Sleep,\\" written in 1939, was Raymond Chandler's first Philip Marlowe novel. Chandler went on to write several other classic noir novels, like \\"Farewell, My Lovely,\\" \\"The High Window,\\" and \\"The Long Goodbye.\\" Chandler did not start writing his classic works until the age of forty-five, when he began submitting short stories to pulp magazines like Mask. Sadly, Chandler died in 1959, effectively depriving us of more classic Marlowe novels and stories. The shame of the whole thing is Chandler did not start writing until late in his life, although seeing how some great authors decline over the course of their careers perhaps it is best we only have a few novels from Raymond Chandler.\\"The Big Sleep\\" finds Marlowe in the employ of General Sternwood, a wealthy but dying oil tycoon. Sternwood wants Marlowe to track down a blackmailer who is trying to bleed some money out of the old general. The problem is Sternwood's two daughters, Carmen and Vivian. Both women have major problems; Carmen is just plain weird, suffering from seizures and a penchant for sleeping around with scum of the earth types. Vivian is not much better; she is a heavy gambler who dates (and marries) mob types. In the course of working the case, Marlowe uncovers underground pornography shops, blackmailers, gambling dens, a couple of murders, and other seedy events in the growing town of Los Angeles. Like other Chandler novels, what we initially see is hardly the whole enchilada. While working the case, Marlowe stumbles on deeper and deeper mysteries involving a missing mobster and his abducted wife.While \\"The Big Sleep\\" is Chandler's best known work, it is not his best novel. It seems that Chandler is still working out the style and form later expressed so gallantly in \\"The Long Goodbye.\\" \\"The Big Sleep\\" is classic Chandler; there is plenty of the gritty atmosphere, amusing wordplay and slang, and despicable characters found in Chandler's later novels. The problem with \\"The Big Sleep\\" is that the story does not hold together well. Far too often, I found myself wondering why things happened the way they did, or I had trouble following the twists and turns of the case.Even a somewhat confusing story line does not cause much damage to the entertainment value of \\"The Big Sleep.\\" You still get the classic snappy dialogue between Marlowe and everyone he encounters, and that is always fun to read. Even more exciting is the realization that you are reading the first book length effort from a master of noir fiction. You can see how he develops his technique by comparing this book with his later novels.What is also amusing is seeing how Chandler paints L.A. at the end of the 1930's. By that time, Los Angeles had yet experienced the enormous growth of the post World War II era. At one point, one of the characters in the book states that L.A. is still a growing town. You have to chuckle over Marlowe's discovery of a pornography shop operating with police protection-this in what is today the home of the pornography industry!Any fans of Chandler will want to read \\"The Big Sleep\\" eventually, although I recommend starting with some of his later novels first. Nearly forty-five years after Chandler's death, there is still no one who can touch the master. That fact alone should convince anyone interested in crime novels to read everything Chandler ever wrote."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"There isn't any question about where American noir fiction began: all fingers point to James M. Cain's THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE. Likewise, there isn't any question about where the tough California P.I. novel started: the credit goes to Dashiell Hammett's THE MALTESE FALCON. But in 1939, a pulp magazine writer fused the two concepts, and the result is a style--street-smart, tough, witty, and compellingly direct--that belongs to one writer only: Raymond Chandler. And his first novel, THE BIG SLEEP, made him a household name.In some respects THE BIG SLEEP is a problematic novel. The plot concerns detective Philip Marlowe's efforts to protect the wealthy Sternwood family from blackmail--but from this starting point it spins out into several complicated directions. Chandler manages this myriad of elements very well through the first half of the novel, but at mid-point the plot breaks apart into a series of loose ends and improbabilities from which it doesn't recover until the last fifty pages--and then only just. But that is almost beside the point. Thanks to Chandler's unique style, you simply can't put the book down long enough to criticize it.THE BIG SLEEP reads with tremendous speed and power, creating a portrait of a seamy world ruled by bisexual pornographers, purring hitmen, cheap hoods, and enameled dames determined to have their way no matter what--a fascinating collection of everything small and mean and gutter common. At the same time, it also presents a surprising degree of integrity in the midst of the corruption: Marlowe won't sell out, no matter what the bribe, and behind their various masks the hardbitten Vivien Sternwood, mysterious Mona Mars, and small-time Harry Jones have enough courage, loyalty, and unexpected integrity to win your respect.THE BIG SLEEP is not the perfect novel. But it is extremely, extremely readable, and with it Chandler paves the way for everything from Sue Grafton's popular mystery series to television crime drama. Chandler's voice here is often imitated, but it has been seldom equalled and never really bested, and both his style and THE BIG SLEEP remain as potent today as they were when the novel was first published. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"It's often been said that Raymond Chandler is the quintessential writer about Los Angeles in the 1940's in the way that Faulkner fictionalized the American South. The Big Sleep is the best example of Chandler's affinity for the city, particularly in the light of it's unique blend of pre-fabricated history associated with the film industry and the pre-Hollywood era. That being said, it's a bit ironic that we tend to think of Philip Marlowe as personified by Humphrey Bogart, even though he's been played by several actors over the years and the film of The Big Sleep is markedly different from the book.&quot;Chandleresque&quot; suggests a certain style of writing and of using metaphors and language that can't really be described to anyone unfamiliar with his work without lapsing into stereotype. For any other mystery writer, that would be a negative, but since Chandler is the man who, with The Big Sleep, more or less invented the detective novel as we know it today it's astonishing to read and realize what kind of impact it might have had on those who read the first printing.The Big Sleep introduces Philip Marlowe as the private eye who is both uncorruptable and one step ahead of his antagonists. His characterization is what drives the story, which as mysteries go is not the most suspensful or even all that mysterious. Indeed, the &quot;mystery&quot; such as it is is barely given notice by Chandler, short of the necessities. While there are some good plot twists, they seem to come together in a generally haphazard manner. None of that matters, because the main interest is in what Marlowe will do next and how he will react. Chandler creates some interesting supporting characters as well, but they float in and out of the story overwhelmed by the protagonist.The Big Sleep is an excellent starting point for getting re-acquainted with classic detective fiction and exploring the development of the genre. It's a relatively quick read as well, which helps the suspense build and leaves you wanting more. It's also a classic vessel for channeling the aura of Los Angeles as it was in what we consider to be its heyday, and what Chandler considered to be something else altogether."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"A work so complex that even the author didn't know exactly who did what to whom and why may sound confusing to your average reader of mystery stories--especially one who wants the plot resolved neatly and tidily. Yet Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep pulls it off remarkably. A lesser writer never would have succeeded, however, Chandler's prose is so captivating, and Philip Marlowe is such a an endearing scoundrel, that it is easy to over-look such trivialities as plot. Although he was an obsessive, Chandler never was one for neat and tidy plots. In fact, as he even admitted, he wasn't much for plots at all. In this book, considered by many to be his finest, he achieves his highest unity of dialogue, plot and characterization. Philip Marlowe seems to skulk across the page in a glancing fashion (and if that makes sense to you, you HAVE been reading too much Chandler). Wry, self-depracating, witty, and unfathomably intelligent, he becomes the shop worn galahad, the original noir detective. If at times the lines seem a bit cliched, the film noir quality painted on a bit thick, the reader must keep in mind, this is where it came from first. Without Raymond Chandler, there would have been no Blade Runner. As both a linguist and a writer, I am infinitely in love with both Chandler's work and Philip Marlowe. There is an intelligence in this prose that is rarely found anywhere, let alone detective fiction. And his similes and metaphors are simply the best anyone has ever written. I read my first Chandler while working on an honors research project as an undergrad and was so captivated I read all of his stuff straight through. If you only have time to read one or two of his works, start here and then read Farewell My lovely, but I gaurantee, anyone who loves words and the American Language won't be able to stop there."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler's very first attempt at a detective novel was a clear winner. The Big Sleep features a complex plot and a fantastic character - Philip Marlowe.Chandler set his story in the gritty streets of Los Angeles, with a detective who was known for doing the right thing rather than what he was told to do. Philip Marlowe became an instant icon not only amongst mystery and detective fans, but among readers everywhere. When this became a movie in 1945 with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, even though the movie cut out a lot of the plot complexities, the characters affected the lives of millions.Chandler's writing style is simply phenomonal. He describes the ins and outs of the city and its suburbs, giving you vivid impressions of that world. He moves from lush mansions to dingy bars, with each character having strong motivations, backgrounds, reasons for being.In a time when minorities were discounted as meaningless and women were considered the &quot;lesser sex&quot;, Marlowe plows right in with a fair eye for all. He takes on work with blacks that others disdain. He treats women as being intelligent while others discount them. The stories talk about homosexuality and porn and other topics as a &quot;part of life&quot;. It's interesting how much of the books had to be 'white washed' to be made into movies.If you read this story and then read many of today's detective stories, you can see clear traces of what Chandler began in the works of others. His style, his incredible humor, his honor and justice. His desire to do what was right even when others around him pushed him to do the &quot;easy thing&quot;. A Big Sleep is a must read for any mystery fan, to see where it all began."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep is a great example of a seminal novel that is not actually a very good one. It helped establish numerous tropes of the hardboiled mystery subgenre, but the plot is a stitched-together, unsatisfying mess and the psychology is risible. About halfway though the novel, the plot--never very mentally stimulating--runs out of steam. Chandler throws in a naked girl in the hero's bed, some beatings and some shootings before reaching his finish, which predictably turns on the hardboiled keystone credo, \\"dames are bad news.\\"Chandler's main purpose in this book seems to be to convey his conception of masculine dignity and honor withstanding the temptations offered by rich, decadent, beautiful young women. This is a valid enough idea for a novel and the opening image of the knight in stained glass in a truly arresting one, but Chandler's \\"psychology\\" is blundering and heavyhanded. He was quite daring for his day in his presentation of blatantly loose women and \\"degenerate\\" homosexuals, but these depictions are not only insulting and offputting now but I would argue quite shallow (thumb-sucking, loose-bladdered, nymphomaniac Carmen has to be one of the most cartoonish and misogynistic creations in the genre by a serious writer). The characters with whom Chandler sympathizes are his ego-projection detective, Philip Marlowe, and Marlowe's original client, old, dying General Sternwood; tellingly, these are the only characters in the book who get anything beyond surface treatment.In The Big Sleep Chandler achieves some of his patented, pithy bon mots, but his writing would get better in his next book, Farewell, My Lovely, as would his plotting. Chandler is a great figure in the genre and he produced some great detective novels, but The Big Sleep is not one of them."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"\\"Where there is mystery, it is generally suspected there must also be evil.\\"Lord ByronThe novel takes place during the 1930's and is set in the seedy world of Los Angeles, a place Jack Kerouac once described as 'a jungle'. The story is told to us through the eyes of the main protagonist - private investigator Phillip Marlowe. To me, Marlowe is a fusion of Dirty Harry, Howard Rourke and Jim Rockford all rolled into one. He's got that machismo, loner thing going on and you know how we Americans love that type of character (i.e. see above). He's also an extremely honest and straight-shooting sleuth, absolutely no BS in the guy. He's your true-blue American hero, married to his job, battling endlessly with the hypocrisy of the powers-to-be and not afraid of anyone or anything.The story begins when a dying millionaire hires Marlowe to find the blackmailer of one his daughters. The old man, like Balzac's Old Goriot, has two spoiled, self-absorbed party girls as daughters - Carmen and Vivian - and they are always seemingly getting into trouble. However, this time one of them is in BIG trouble and it's up to our hero Marlowe to save the day. This imaginative, hardboiled work of fiction got really convoluted about midway through the novel for me, but I still plowed on until it's very end, and never did my enthusiasm ebb. It's the type of story I couldn't wait to finish in order to unravel the mystery.Raymond Chandler was some kind of writer - acerbic, satirical, brutally honest and candid, yet his prose also contains a certain magnetism and simple elegance that makes this author, at least in this reviewer's opinion, a joy to read. I am looking forward to not only reading his other works, but also catching \\"The Big Sleep\\" on film, the classic by Howard Hawks starring Bogie and Bacall. A film that I have abstained from because I wanted to read the book first; and now I'm off to rent me a film folks...A great story!"},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"Another book in my quest to read the classics - A great addition to the list! I am a big fan of mystery books such as Sue Grafton's alphabet series...now I see how the genre began. Raymond Chandler sets the bar for other PI novels to follow.THE BIG SLEEP introduces us to Phillip Marlowe - a sarcastic PI with a unique perspective on things. Marlowe is hired by an aging rich man to find out who is blackmailing one of his daughters. Marlowe finds out the blackmailing is only the beginning of a tangled web of intrigue. There are two murders that seem unrelated at first, however as the book progresses Chandler does a wonderful job of weaving them together.Chandler's writing style is pure joy to read....each scene is described in great detail, you feel like you are there. I love Marlowe's dialogue - tough, sarcastic and to the point. The BIG SLEEP is a classic mystery any fan of mystery novels should read."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"I don't think that it is an exaggeration to call The Big Sleep one of the best American novels ever written. It is the novel that introduces Phillip Marlowe to the world - as well as the inimitable literary styling of Raymond Chandler. No one knew how to work a simile quite the way Chandler could. It has been parodied, but never duplicated.The plot of the novel is almost impossible to follow, but who cares. Phillip Marlowe is hired by General Sternwood because he is being blackmailed. Soon after, people keep turning up dead. \\"So many guns in this town and so little brains,\\" Marlowe observed. There is the famous story: when Howard Hawks was filming the movie, he couldn't figure out who killed the chauffer. He sent a letter to Chandler - who couldn't figure it out either.Just enjoy the book. It not only bears reading but re-reading. It is truly classic literature."},{"Title":"Big Sleep","review":"This is the best of the best when it comes to Raymond Chandler. I am a long time fan of the detective novel and this one ranks top on my list. I read The Big Sleep along with David Lehman's reissue of &quot;The Perfect Murder: A Study in Detection&quot; and found the two books perfect companions for anyone who loves the classic WHODUNIT."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It tells the story of the Civil War through the eyes of a young southern man living on a plantation. Unlike many books, it tells the story of the war from a southern standpoint, but not so much of a southern standpoint to be a turnoff to anyone at all. It's a tale that you will want to read over and over."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"I really enjoyed this particular one.

One of my very favorites included with &#34;Wulf the Sxon&#34; and &#34;The Young Carthaginian&#34;."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"A great young boy's story. I gave to the grandchildren for Christmas. Hope they read it."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"This book was not exciting, nor is it realistic of antebellum life in Virginia. From the title, you would think that the book would be about the War Between the States and about Robert E. Lee. It is neither. It is what an Englishman thinks it might have been like to be in the South before the war begins, but he doesn't know. The research, if there was any research, was not done well. Because most of the book takes place away from any battles, it is a very tedious, boring, and painful book to read. There are much better books to describe life as it was in the war, such as Across Five Aprils or The Red Badge of Courage. If you want good books from a Southern perspective, I recommend Iron Scouts of the Confederacy (for historical fiction) or The History of the Confederate States. I asked my kids to read this book for history, and when they complained, I read it myself. I'm sorry that I ever put them through this, and I will check more carefully the next time I think about asking them to read a book by G.A. Henty."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"I am amazed that Amazon has posted a \\"review\\" from the right-wing reactionary racist publication entitled \\"Southern Partisan\\". It is small surprise that the reviewer presents a vapid, laudatory review of Mr. Henty's work. Henty was a hobbyist who read had no formal education and whose \\"research\\" was non-existent. Henty's works are pure fiction, based on a racist perspective from the 19th century. Homeschoolers and others who promote his works as \\"history\\" are doing their children a grave disservice."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"I really loved this book written from a rare Confederate view point. The author beautifully portrayed virtues such as honor and courage in the young hero, Vincent. They say these books are written for teenage boys, but I'm a twelve year old girl and I couldn't put down the book for three days. It is probably won of the most exciting books I've ever read."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"This book is definitely one of Mr. Henty's masterpieces. It gives a clear view of the South's situation and why the Civil War was fought. I highly enjoyed this book, both for its content and the way history is mingled with a gripping plot. I can't tell you too much because I might spoil it, but it is about a young Southern man who joins the Confederate army and distinguises himself through his many adventures."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"An extra bonus in this Henty book is that it includes both the English preface and the American one, which Henty wrote to the \`lads' who would read this book. In With Lee in Virginia Vincent Wingfield is the main character, one who lives on a plantation run by slaves, but who is strongly against being cruel to slaves. When he clashes with the overseer over Pearson having whipped a slave, Vincent never imagines it will cause such trouble. Soon, though, Vincent gets involved in the fate of the slave he saved, Tony. Will Vincent be able to help the man escape from the wicked Jackson? What about Tony's wife, who Jackson is selling for revenge? This book draws you right in plantation life in the 18hundreds, you will feel happy with the knowledge that \`your' slaves are safe, and will never even consider that you are doing wrong by keeping slaves. Vincent enlists as a volunteer after Virginia secedes and accomplishes many deeds of bravery. This is just another in a long line of thrilling books writing by George Alfred Henty, don't miss reading a single one!!!"},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"I have read many G.A. Henty books and enjoyed them. This story was no exception. However, it was painful to read the account published by Timeless Classic Books. This 2010 edition was apparently not proofread and had over 100 spelling errors. I have never read a book that was so poorly edited. Anyone with a spell checker could have done better. I have tried to contact the publisher, but their website is down.I'd recommend the book, but please purchase from a different publisher."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"This may have been written at the time for young readers (I am 43!), but for anyone interested in the Civil War it is a treasure trove of background to the war, and the men of the South (primarily) that fought it. The descriptions of the battles (complete with maps) fought in Virginia are gripping without being overly-narrated. My 12-year old is reading it soon, and I am sure he won't be able to put it down either."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"Ugh! This book is a good one about the Civil War, but sadly, it is poorly published. The lines of text are too long, the margins too narrow. It reads like a manuscript, not a book to curl up with and enjoy. There are tons of errors too. My girls are frustrated because they feel like they are editors, not students while reading the book. If you can find one in a different format, buy it instead."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"Though not all of the history in this book is completely accurate, it is filled with historical characters and events and is very informative. The characters are interesting, the story well-written, and the worldview is Christian. Though I didn't agree with all of Vincent's beliefs, Henty did present Vincent's viewpoint well, and Vincent had a fairly good view of slavery considering his upbringing. The individual slaves are portrayed well, though some readers may find it difficult to understand their speech. I recommend With Lee in Virginia to highschoolers who enjoy adventure stories and history."},{"Title":"With Lee in Virginia: A story of the American civil war","review":"The book was very interesting and kept me hooked throughout the story. But the inaccuracy nearly ended it for me.

Although it gives definitions, it does not provide specific references to the ancient texts like the Oxford Latin Dictionary, Lewis-Short Latin Dictionary, and Cassell's Latin Dictionary does. Its primary strength lies in that it does provide a huge amount of the Latin idioms used with each word.

Some of the spelling conventions take some time to get used to (most notably, there are many entries under 'j' that I would have expected to find under 'i'), but after using it for awhile I have become accustomed to its quirks.

Though it covers most basic words, some common words like the verb 'minor' are curiously absent. Those seeking the meanings of hapax legomena, many post-classical and technical words, any but the commonest proper names, or etymologies, must resort to a comprehensive reference like Lewis and Short or the Oxford Latin Dictionary. The most telling flaw of this dictionary is that it does not mark hidden quantity: this is irrelevant for scansion, certainly, but is important for correct accentuation and pronunciation of vowel lengths, for those of us who actually care about speaking Latin properly. Plus, the text is riddled with typos (including one in a page header).

I think that Robert Louis Stevenson just took the story of Robin Hood and added more things to it. Robert Louis Stevenson had a good idea about it. the story had more depht to it than Robin Hood. the way he describe the one chariter makes him look like Robin Hood, because of the way he is dressed. I thought that the book was prety good. The book could have been better."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"The main thing that made me rate this 1 star is that there are no /good/ characters, for whom I could really cheer.There are a few characters who are completely bad and are shown as such, but there are other characters who are the \\"good guys\\" yet their whole focus is revenge, so that they murder some people and steal from others. Richard deceives people so that he can steal their ship and seems to be confused on such matters as loyalty and truth. He does choose not to kill his arch enemy (despite that person's many wicked deeds), but at other times he kills people merely because they seem to be a danger to him. Once it is called into question whether this is right or not, but the characters are distracted and turn to other matters. Richard does repent of some of the things he has done, when he realizes that it can not be remedied (that was my favorite part of the book).Therefore, while this tale is interesting and makes a few good points, the careless killing, poorly written romance and poor ideals made me strongly dislike it.However, it is very interesting, particularly because of the older English used, so if you don't mind betrayal, violence, and lack of morals, it could be a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"The book, The Black Arrow, by Robert Louis Stevenson, did not grab my attention. Although it had some exciting events in the story, for the most part I was unable to appreciate them because i didn't know what was happening or what anything was about. The book had some confusing twists and turns which were hard to follow. So, I would not recommend this book to most people , because, to me, it was hard to follow and because of that, boring. this book is about a young man named Richard Shelton. He was born loyal to the House of Lancaster but found himself torn between his loyalty to his master and joining a band of outlaws called the Black Arrow, led by a dashing young man named Ellis Duckworth. Shelton goes through many adventures with many partners and friends. The problem is he doesn't know who he can trust. He has been betrayed and swindled, but he doesn't stop putting his faith in people who he thinks he can trust. One person he knows he can trust is Joanna Sedley. She was a lost love in his life which he later encountered. Throughout the book he is chasing, tracking and looking for her. There is certain types of people that would enjoy this book. If they can keep their attention and comprehend very well I think they might like this book very much. Because if you can follow the plot I'm sure it will be very exciting. So, if you fall into that category I would recommend this book to you. But if you are like me and you need a book that is full of adventure from the get go, and have some trouble following books, I would not recommend the Black Arrow."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"This book is one of the best I've read. It is what every book about the middle ages should be and more, with suspense, action, disguises, escapes, and of course, the occasional love scene. Robert Louis Stevenson lived in the mid-1800s, and is renowned for his many works, includingTreasure Island, Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, andKidnapped. The Black Arrow, written originally for a magazine, was written after a serious illness in Stevenson, and was published right after Treasure Island.Dick Shelton, a boy of sixteen, is quickly thrust into the conflict of the War of the Roses. He battles against almost any kind of evil - bloodthirsty pirates, a murderous priest, and even his own legal gaurdian - Sir Daniel Brackley.

I find it hard to believe that The Black Arrow is probably the least well know of his great adventure novels (the others being, of course, Treasure Island and Kidnapped), as it is certainly the best as far as I am concerned. As far as the story goes, it is one of the most entertaining plots that I have ever encountered. It is filled with more twists and turns than I would have thought possible, but remains very clear and fast paced. The characters are wonderful, as is the description and the writing itself. Granted, some of the language is a bit archaic, but I feel that this adds a lot to the authenticity of the story.The Black Arrow is not a very easy read at first, but once you get into it it really flies by.

Within this story we encounter knights, and a band of outlaws (ala Robin Hood). We have disguises, archery, battles, betrayal, revenge, friendship, honor, and love. What more could you ask for in an adventure?Though it was a fun story, it didn't have the depth of plot or character that I look for in my reading. Instead we follow Richard on what seems an aimless journey of one adventure after another. Richard often finds himself in tight situations and just when he escapes he finds himself in another. Written like a serial (probably was), Richard seems to hardly have time to take a breath before something new and exciting is happening again. Although this type of writing is great for a serial, leaving the reader with a cliff hanger at the end of each section, it doesn't lead to a unified feeling within the work. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the story and have fun reading it along the way; it is just that to me it seemed just a fun adventure story. It was fun to read, but didn't leave me with a lasting impression or emotion."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"Set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses, The Black Arrow is an intriguing look at the life of young Richard Shelton.

Although the characters are well-developed and the plot is fascinating, this book is not for the squeemish or lazy reader. The description is not only vivid, it is often gorey.

The only cloud on Sir Daniel's horizon is the mysterious order of the \\"Black Arrow\\", a band of outlaws who have previously been injured by Sir Daniel and who have now sworn themselves to his death and the death of his supporters. Although initially Sir Daniel's loyal ally, Dick eventually becomes aware that Sir Daniel may in fact be responsible for his fathers death. Forced to flee from Sir Daniel's house (and his true love in the form of Joanna another ward of Sir Daniel's), Richard joins the order of the black arrow and swear vengeance for his fathers death. What follows is a series of adventures with espionage, fencing, shipwrecks and many deaths, culminating in Dick joining forces with the Yorkist forces lead by Richard of Gloucester at the battle of Shoresby, where they confront the forces of Lancaster including Sir Daniel.So why do I say that this is not quite what I expected? Well I was expecting in Dick, a hero from your standard boys own adventure, you know the type brave to a fault, a strong fighter, smart and wise beyond his years and completely moral. Instead Stevenson defied my expectation by presenting Dick as brave and strong and honorable, but not terribly smart, capable of making very bad decisions which have a terrible affect upon the lives of those around him, someone whose lack of experience means that he is regularly trumped by his opponents. And although in the end, Richard is knight and married to his love, he is judged by Richard of Gloucester as a man who I will go no further a man who has reached his natural level of advancement a judgment which I found myself agreeing with."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"In this book you can read about knights, soldiers, action, treachery, and other things from the middle ages. I thought that it was a pretty good book, but I only got into it after a while. I had to read it for school, so I couldn't give up, but I was wary of the lack of \\"interesting-ness\\" when I first started. I would reccomend this book to you, but you should beware that you may not be interested for a while. If you are a person who doesn't like a book that takes a while, I would not reccomend this to you. But if you don't mind having to read something a while, I would reccomend this to you. (Sorry if I keep repeating myself.)"},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"With the War of the Roses as its backdrop, The Black Arrow blends the romance of young love and the excitement of its hero's initiation into war and politics. The theme of loyalty runs throughout--loyalty to parents, guardians, leaders, followers, lovers, and oneself.England's loyalties are divided between Lancaster and York, although the distinction makes little difference to the country's more practical citizens. \\"It is the ruin of this kind land,\\" a woman said. \\"If the barons live at war, ploughfolk must eat roots.\\" When the naive young hero, Richard Shelton, reassures her that men \\"cannot better die than for their natural lord,\\" another man points out, \\"No natural lord of mine . . . I followed the Walsinghams . . . And now I must side with Brackley! It was the law that did it; call ye that natural?\\"Despite young Dick's idealism, which makes him faithful to his guardian and to the men with whom he has served, and despite many disturbing rumors, it soon becomes apparent that most men are loyal primarily to their self-interests, whether they seek power like Richard Crookback or favor and riches like Dick's guardian, Sir Daniel Brackley. Even the mysterious \\"Jon Amend-All\\" of the black arrow, whose objective is to revenge himself and his friends on Brackley, is found collecting rents from Brackley's cottagers, acknowledging that they will suffer the hardship of having to pay twice. The man behind \\"Jon Amend-All\\" is no beneficent Robin Hood, but as cold and crafty a political operative as Brackley himself.Brackley's loyalties are soon explained. \\"I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war, and then ride to join me with the conqueror . . . Tosspot and Shuttle-wit run in, but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o' one side, waiting.\\" As Clipsby says, \\"For, indeed, he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York.\\"Fleeing from one danger into another, Dick finally understands that he cannot trust Brackley simply because he is Dick's guardian, or even Ellis Duckworth as his savior and protector. The only person upon whom he can rely is the girl he loves, who, ironically, was intended to be his wife in one of Brackley's financial maneuvers. The black arrow flies from Tunstall Forest to Kettley, then through wetlands back through Tunstall to the Moat House and on to Shoreby, with treachery and the threat of war hanging over all.With every adventure, Dick's loyalty turns more inward on himself and his heart's desire. He is loyal to York because Ellis Duckworth is and Daniel Brackley isn't. When he finds himself rapidly in and out of Richard Crookback's favor, he is \\"neither glad nor sorry.\\" Danger and treachery transform Dick into a more mature man who recognizes that loyalty is neither won nor lost so easily or quickly. In one of the novel's strangest and weakest scenes, he proves his loyalty to his bride-to-be by rejecting the advances of her best friend, peculiar as they are.The series of events that makes Dick a man is his theft of the Good Hope, its subsequent destruction, and the death of the captain's man, Tom. \\"Dick's heart smote him at what he heard. Until that moment he had not perhaps thought twice of the poor skipper who had been ruined by the loss of the Good Hope; so careless, in those days, were men who wore arms of the goods and interests of their inferiors . . .\\" Dick achieves his aims, but at the cost of many lives and the prosperity of the innocent Arblaster, who mourns \\"my man Tom\\" until the end of his days.As a protagonist, Dick is refreshingly and painfully human, at least outside battle. While brave, he lacks the ability to pick up on clues that are obvious to his less-sheltered acquaintances, including those about the true nature of Jack Matcham. He suffers remorse for what he has done and begins to ask others like Ellis Duckworth to reconsider their course. He has the mercy that Richard Crookback and Brackley lack.Whatever its historical flaws (some of which Stevenson points out in footnotes), The Black Arrow is beautifully written, with well-drawn characters, a plot that rarely stalls, realistically bloody battle scenes, and dialogue that is often poetic without being jarring. While not Stevenson's greatest effort, The Black Arrow is exciting and fun for anyone of any age who loves a solid historical drama."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"The black arrow is a typical adventure book, where romance and action are mixed.

The tale is solid, but unfortunately there are a few issues prevent it from delivering on its promise.The Black Arrow, first published as a serial in 1883 and as a novel in 1888, follows the adventures of Dick Shelton as he discovers that his guardian may be responsible for the death of his father and seeks justice, attempts to rescue his betrothed from the clutches of said guardian, and gets swept up in the tumult of the War of the Roses.Shelton comes across throughout the book as mostly naive and occasionally cruel and self-centered, and he seems to blunder from one encounter to the next. In short, it's hard to really root for him or care about him, as he has few redeeming qualities, but he's also just not that interesting, either. I've read other books where the main characters aren't exactly heroes (such as George R.R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series), but in those cases, the main characters were at least plotting and scheming and being actively devious, which is entertaining. Shelton shows a bit of character growth at the end of the novel, showing regret about some of the dubious actions he took while trying to rescue his betrothed, but it isn't enough to redeem him as an interesting character.Another downside to the book is the disjointed nature of it. It feels very episodic, as if Stevenson approached each chapter thinking, \\"Okay, what trouble can Dick Shelton get into next?\\" This precludes any sort of build-up of tension, and also results in a limit to how much each episode is affected by those that came earlier. When I started reading the book, I was not aware that it had first been serialized, but by the time I finished it, I guessed it had, as it read like a collection of episodes, and I'm aware it was common practice at the time (Stevenson's Treasure Island was first published serially in the same magazine as The Black Arrow, and even Charles Dickens released his work that way).The old fashioned language was a difficulty in getting into the book. I was reminded of watching a Shakespearean play, where it takes you a scene or two to really get into the old language and follow along relatively clearly. I had no trouble with the similarly jargon-laden and old fashioned Treasure Island. Maybe I just speak pirate better than I do knight.The best parts of the book are the action scenes. These are strong, and helps redeem some of the other shortcomings of the novel. There are chases through forests, spying and sneaking, one on one combats, and large battles.I think I'm probably being harder on this book than it might deserve because I'm holding up against Stevenson's other work. It's okay, it just lacks the life and energy of Treasure Island or the creepy tension of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and isn't the same sort of genre-defining work as those two stories.I listened to the audio version read by Shelly Frasier. Frasier doesn't stand out with this book, though she isn't inherently bad, either, and I wouldn't avoid her in other productions. I didn't especially care for her reading this book, though, primarily because 95% of the characters are male, and having to decipher her narrow range of fake male voices to track who was speaking on top of following along with the difficult language wasn't an ideal combination.The Black Arrow is a solid book that has the misfortune to have been written by an author with other fantastic books that outshine it. If you like medieval stories, you'll probably enjoy The Black Arrow, but I can't recommend it to the general reader like I can Treasure Island or Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.If you're interested, check out my reviews Stevenson's Treasure Island and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde here on Amazon for more of my thoughts on those works."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"A little bit hard to get into but worth the read!!!A great page-turner, the begining's a little unclear untill you've read it, so I would suggest re-reading the first chapter or two after you finnish it!!!"},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"I'm usually rather picky with what I read, so I was almost struck when I found myself getting into this book.

After the &quot;Winetou&quot; that was the best book."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"This is a good book but not the best of Stevenson's adventure novels. Intended to be a bildungsroman a la Kidnapped, it is set in Medieval England during the Wars of the Roses. The character development is not as good as several of Stevenson's other novels and the plot seems more schematic. In terms of creating a historically vivid setting. Stevenson did better with 18th century Scotland than with this period of English history."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"Book review-Black arrowThe Black arrow starts off very, very slow. It picks up at the end, thankfully. The book is a long one, at first it's very hard to follow. The plot also gets better as you get deeper into the book. It's a good book if you want to read something over a long period of time. The story takes place in at the time of the War of the Roses and follows the book's hero Dick. This book is clearly an action book. The main character, Dick is likeable enough. In this book, Dick encounters the Black arrow, a battle, a castle and more. This isn't one of Robert Louis Stevenson's best books, but yet is respectable. The original book was written in French and translated so it's got some weird words. Maybe some people would rank it higher, I'm a young guy so I may think it's hard to follow. For me, it's just too long and difficult to follow to be a really good book. Stevenson though has got some good books out there,though, including: Treasure Island, Kidnapped and more."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"The Black Arrow seems to me to be one of the most underrated books I have ever seen. It is one of the very few works Of Stevenson and probably one of the best. It is an excellent mix of romance, drama and action, and is guaranteed to hold your interest. It is Stevensons only work in the field of Romance/Drama and is a work to rival such classics as The Three Musketeers and The Man in the Iron Mask. The language has a slight archaic ring to it which is, after reading the foreword by Stevenson, realized to be quite deliberate. A must read."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"While &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Kidnapped&quot; are more famous and beloved by the adventurous boys and girls of america, I think this book is underrated. &quot;The Black Arrow&quot; combines the best of the adventure of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and the swasbuckling intrigues of &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. However, it adds the elements of a young and romantic pair of lovers. I would reccomend this book both for the adolescent who has progressed beyond Stevenson's more famous books as well as those of us who are still romantics at heart and miss the days of King Arthur or the Code of Chivalry. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"&quot;The Black Arrow&quot; is R. L. Stevenson at his best.

I can count two. The first is the dialogue, which is a little too self-consciously archaic, and the second is the fact that the second half of the book isn't quite as good as the first.Other than that? This book has it all. Fencing! Fighting! True love! Revenge! Beautiful ladies!The book starts off pretty quickly. After a few introductory scenes, we get into the first and best part of the book, which sees the hero and um, a friend, running for their lives through the forest. Stevenson's genius is evident here as he mixes action, suspense, character development, and mystery seamlessly together.After this, the action slows down slightly, but the plot twists, surprises, battles, and excitement keep coming. The hero is human and relatable, the heroine fills her Spirited Heroine quota with as much gusto as the Damsel In Distress requirements. The Drunken Ex-Monk Sidekick is lovable and shrewd; the Greenwood Outlaw is magnificently protrayed; and there are special cameos by Richard of Gloucester and the heroine's talkative best friend.This book has everything. Swordfights? Forced marches? Lurking in the undergrowth? A damsel in distress? A girl disguised as a boy? A storm at sea? An interrupted wedding? Outlaws? Spies? Treacherous uncles? Escaping from a castle window? Secret passages?

Who says the classics are dreary?"},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"The Black Arrow was an enjoyable, fast-paced adventure novel. The protagonist was flawed in a way that made him believable and likable. Best of all, his flaws serve the reader as subtle cautionary tales against haste and violence while still providing a very entertaining read.Written for adolescents, I expect that the novel's period-style language would be somewhat difficult for younger readers today although I do think that the lessons are valuable enough that young people should be encouraged to at least attempt what is otherwise a not very challenging read. The ending, the change in the protagonist's goals and his realizations about his own actions were very satisfying.Additionally, I found the free Kindle edition to be adequate and free from distracting format errors or other issues."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"This copy of Stevenson's excellent historical fiction piece is particularly attractive from the photo on the front cover, but the size is unusually wide and thin. No big deal really, except that there is no title or any mark at all on the book's spine. Sitting on my shelf among hundreds of books, I tend to like to see the title. Worst of all, the print is unusually small. I'm by no means far-sighted and the print is still too small. Enough to make eyes sore small.Recommend the story and dissapointed at this copy. It's bound more like a workbook or handbook, and is hardly the right book for a coffee table book. Sort of thoughtless choices."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"A fun, fast-moving adventure story, set in England in the 1400s, at the time of the Wars of the Roses. One thing I like about it is that the hero makes lots of mistakes. He sort of bumbles through the book, barely escaping with this life, and making a hash of most things...much more realistic than most heroes."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"I read this book after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The White Company\\" and \\"Sir Nigel\\", and after \\"The Black Arrow\\", I went on to read \\"Agincourt\\" by Bernard Cornwell. I did enjoy Black Arrow, but I found it to be the least enjoyable of these four medieval-themed novels. All three others exceeded Black Arrow in these respects:- Level and accuracy of historical detail. The other works really immerse you in the period and allow you to experience the history. In contrast, Black Arrow merely uses the history as the backdrop, and even plays loose with facts.- Compelling characters and captivating story. I just didn't find Black Arrow's characters or story quite as riveting as the others.Overall: I enjoyed this work and I'm glad I read it. If you're looking for a historical novel from the medieval period, there are better ones out there. If instead you're simply looking for a good adventure, you'll definitely enjoy this. By the way, having read Treasure Island, I definitely think Black Arrow is not the author's best work."},{"Title":"The black arrow;: A tale of the two Roses","review":"The book I chose to read for my book report was the Black Arrow.

The following paragraph will give you a short summary of the book I read.The story is about a knight named Dick who goes on an epic quest to find and destroy the group, the Black Arrows.

This encompasses both the relationship between the military and society, and the inside view of the social structure of the military institution itself. The book is a series of articles written by specialists in military sociology from around the world. Authors are from the US, Germany, England, Canada, Slovenia, the Netherlands, Russia and France.Many different aspects of military life are addressed from the changes in communications with family at home (i.e. the impact of e-mail), to veterans affairs, the demands of a low (or zero) casualty rate, and more."},{"Title":"New Directions in Military Sociology","review":"New approach, excellent analyses, good to use in education system"},{"Title":"Jazz Keyboard Harmony","review":"I was in a Phil DeGreg workshop about 10 years ago at a Jamie Aebersold jazz camp. As a result of the Phil DeGreg workshop, I bought this Jazz Keyboard Harmony book. This book fills a very important role in the jazz pianist's repetoire of instructional books. The book methodically presents the hows and whys of how a piano fits into a jazz combo and how to create good chords and voice leading to fill in those critical middle voices that the piano is called upon to provide. The book starts of simply enough (which, for someone who is just getting used to jazz harmonies, is hardly simple), and then advances quickly enough challenge even the veteran jazz pianist.What is nice about this book is that it's all about the harmonies and piano comping.The book does not address jazz improvisation or soloing, or even particularly modes. However, many other jazz books spend lots of time on these subjects, so it's not necessary to repeat these topics here.But, for jazz harmony and voicings, this book has surprizing \\"staying power\\". By this I mean that even 10 years later (which admittedly wasn't all devoted to jazz), I still take the book off the shelf occasionally to find out how Phil DeGreg would have handled a certain harmonic progression.For those willing to put the time into learning what Phil has to teach in this book, you won't be disappointed with your results."},{"Title":"Jazz Keyboard Harmony","review":"The first jazz book I picked up was the classic Levine \\"Jazz Piano Book\\". Levine's book contains a lot of theory but is quite terse and not particularly practical. I picked up DeGreg's book on a recommendation from my teacher and have found it to be wonderfully complementary. There is definitely some theory in DeGreg's book but the genius of the book is that is is *practical*. The focus is on \\"getting your hands around\\" some of the ideas presented in Levine and doing it in way that shows how all the variations are just that - variations on a few core movements. For example the first thing introduced is LH shell voicings which are pretty easy to pick up. From there those same shell voicings are used over and over with various different RH voicings starting with simple stuff and ultimate moving into quartal-based harmony. The exercises are set up to really help you see which finger is playing which scale degree at any given moment and to help you get a feel for how \\"standard\\" jazz progressions are voiced.I don't think a student would be well served using this as the *only* text but as a companion to a more traditional (theoretical) text it's great.

After ripping open the box I settled into my favorite chair and opened the book. I was not disappointed.I scanned the Table of Contents for a moment, and then said to heck with it. I went for the color pictures, which are a nice addition to the book. After thumbing through them (several times... wonderful Michael Shanks photos), I moved on to the episode guide, which is for Seasons 1 through 8.Each episode contains a one to two line blurb describing the episode, and then continues with a discussion regarding a particular scene in the movie, select story lines, and sometimes the philosophy of the episode. Following the discussion is \\"Gods & Scientists,\\" \\"Interesting Fact\\", \\"Why We're Space Monkeys,\\" and \\"Parlez-vous Gate?\\" All of this wonderful information is packed into 2 to 2.5 pages, a few just a little longer.Starting with Season 1, I found I could not just read the book through in order; there was too much information for one sitting (not that I'm complaining). I started with the \\"Parlez-vous Gate?\\" section, reveling in some of my favorite lines from the show. The author did a great job picking specific lines to represent the episode. I have no idea how she managed, considering how many zingers appear within just one episode.Once finished with \\"Parlez-vous Gate?\\" I then flipped back and forth through the seasons, reading the \\"Gods & Scientists\\" and \\"Interesting Fact\\" sections, both of which imparted the myths behind the series as well as facts regarding the filming of the shows or of the characters/actors themselves.The \\"Why We're Space Monkeys\\" section contains interesting tidbits of information about the specific episode, which could be about the cast, characters, crew and so on. The author even adds a few quips on occasion, noting where SG-1 may have messed up or even caused a mess beyond their control.Beside the episode guide, where I seem to lose myself every time I sit down with it, you will also find wonderful articles that include:- Approaching the Possible: The World of Stargate SG-1- Making Myth: The Story of Stargate SG-1- The Cast of Stargate SG-1- Everybody CanCon- Coding the Wormhole- Out of the Blue... and my favorite...- No Red ShirtsWithin the resources section you will find addresses to Stargate related websites, several of which I've already visited and enjoyed.Although the book does lack an index, I find it to be a minor inconvenience; after all, I don't mind thumbing through the book to look for a given piece of information. I tend to run across other interesting pieces of trivia that I've missed through prior viewings.This is, by far, the best book on the market and I look forward to any additional Stargate books published by the author.Hey Jo! Hint, hint!"},{"Title":"Approaching the Possible: The World of Stargate SG-1","review":"I bought this book because it's the most comprehensive one of its kind on the SG-1 market, and it's worth every cent (it's over 500 pages, too - although Amazon has it at 300). Not only does it include a fascinating entry into the show (how it developed from the movie, the main differences in terms of atmosphere, characters, plots, mythologies), but I also discovered a lot of information about the actors, the fandom, the online scene, and how the series fits into the CanCon tradition. Really interesting surrounding material that adds many layers when you're looking at the episode themselves. Great selection of quotes from the cast, crew, and fans, too!As other people have mentioned, the episode guide in and of itself is wonderful. Unlike other books out there, it doesn't just give a summary of the episode, it delves into each one, looking at various aspects of the show including science, underlying mythologies and philosophies, character arcs, and large thematic issues. Funny (or sometimes achingly hard) quotes from each episode bring out the flavour of the show, which is one of the reasons I watch it.My favourite part of the episode guide is definitely the \`gods and scientists' - it gave additional insight into episodes and characters, giving a textured and layered look at the show. I found out a lot about the different mythologies, scientific theories, theologies, and philosophies behind each episode - the author clearly did a lot of research, and didn't restrict herself to one mythological or religious influence.This book is worth getting for the sheer volume of information alone - not to mention that it's well written, and has a ton of photographic material (I'd never seen quite a few of the beautiful colour inserts before). The author obviously loves SG-1, and it shows; the book isn't doting, but it reads like a critical analysis of, and homage to, Stargate."},{"Title":"Approaching the Possible: The World of Stargate SG-1","review":"While there's an attempt to include other material (brief bios of the lead actors, chapters on Stargate's fan following, etc), essentially this is an episode guide covering seasons 1 to 8 of Stargate SG1.The unauthorised nature of the book is evidenced by the lack of any photos other than publicity stills of the main actors and candid shots taken at conventions. As a result, the illustrations are not a strong point. The text, however, is extensive and rather meatier than is the case in many \\"episode guide\\" publications. First and foremost, each episode receives a short critical essay, almost all of which are interesting, germane and erudite. As well as teasing out the themes, the author critiques whatever features of that particular episode have caught her eye; be it the acting, the scriptwriting, the direction, character development, the sociology, the contribution to the Stargate mythology, pop culture references, or even the actors' appearance (hairstyles get a consistent mention!). She's not afraid to slam weaknesses, or to give praise when it's warranted - and she's not above letting her tongue hang out over any notable eye-candy! I didn't always agree with her opinions, but she certainly prompted me to think again about some episodes, plot points and characters that I'd previously taken at face value.In addition to the essay, each entry includes notes on any myths that inform the episode; interesting facts; the absolute pick of that episode's dialogue; and comment on what marks each episode out from \`run of the mill' science fiction television. Although the original US airdate and writing and directing credits are given for each episode, this book doesn't try to give all the \`vital statistics' that many other episode guides thrive on. For the most part this doesn't detract, though the extreme brevity of the plot summaries (one or two sentences at most) is not always helpful.One major niggle; the lack of an index. Storm frequently references other episodes in her critical essays, but only by title. Readers without an absolutely encyclopaedic knowledge of every Stargate episode are going to want to flip back and check out \\"exactly what episode is that one she's referring to here\\", but the lack of an index (or even just the inclusion of an episode number with such references) makes this an exercise in extreme frustration.All in all though, this is a satisfying and entertaining read (though perhaps for dipping into as you watch and rewatch episodes, rather than for reading cover to cover). The author has clearly put considerable thought into her analysis, and the breadth of her research is impressive, yet the style remains accessible."},{"Title":"Approaching the Possible: The World of Stargate SG-1","review":"\\"Approaching the Possible\\" is a nice enough episode guide with some detailed, thoughtfully written extra features on the actors, the mythology and the fandom of Stargate. Yet I found myself in constant disagreement with the author's opinions. Episodes that seem to be generally well-received by the fans (such as season three's \\"Legacy\\"), she pans, yet episodes that even the most diehard fans scorned (such as season five's \\"The Tomb\\"), she praises. The author also makes some unusual selections when picking memorable quotes from each episode, often snubbing funnier, deeper or just plain more familiar lines for less interesting ones. While all the actors are praised at different times, Ms. Storm seems to have a particular fondness for Amanda Tapping; it seems that hardly a review goes by without Storm gushing over a line delivery or facial expression of Ms. Tapping's. The Sam worship gets a little nauseating in its excessiveness. Finally, while the candid color photos in the center of the book are lovely, the small black and white ones scattered throughout the book, almost exclusively taken at conventions, are a bit boring and repetitious.Knowing now that this will be the last season of Stargate, I'm wishing I'd waited a year or more and purchased an episode guide featuring all ten seasons of Stargate."},{"Title":"Approaching the Possible: The World of Stargate SG-1","review":"This book was written by an academic, and it shows. It's about as much fun reading as a college textbook. Even the title's pretentious. Most of the book is composed of short essays on each episode through season 8. I agreed with only half of the author's opinions. She was particularly harsh with \\"Birthright\\" and \\"Sacrifices\\" because they didn't sufficiently promote a feminist agenda. The denseness of some of the essays is just exhausting. After criticizing most aspects of a particular episode, the author concludes: \\"A Hundred Days is built on moments; like a string of pearls, each follows another, each with a different sheen but forming a whole. Ellipsis is a huge factor in the episode--not only in time, but in what remains unsaid. Each moment has significance, and it's on these increments that a story is constructed.\\" Well, OK, then. The author also snarked on Keith Topping's fun \\"Beyond the Gate\\" (another unofficial SG-1 episode guide), which was unnecessary. There's an inadequate table of contents and no index, so it's difficult look up a specific episode. After slogging through descriptions rife with terms like \\"binary opposition,\\" \\"tropes,\\" \\"didactic,\\" and \\"metonymy,\\" I felt the same frustration Jack does when Sam starts to explain her science--just get to the point already."},{"Title":"Approaching the Possible: The World of Stargate SG-1","review":"This is a GREAT book! My only beef with it is the following. Pure and simple, it has no index. It just sort of drops off in the last pages. Now when you are looking for a book on a fave tv show to order, sometimes you don't think of everything, but when you use these books like I do, as a companion while you are watching the episodes, you need to sort of be able to look up the episode being aired. As it is,unless he has a photographic, volumnous memory, which many SG-1 viewers apparently seem to have, the reader is left having to page through page by page, title by title, until he finds the episode he wants. One gets the impression Ms. Storm, exhausted by her Herculean labor of love, just sort of dropped dead of exhaustion after compleating her research and interviews which comprise this very good volume.A fan could make a few bucks by going through the book and arranging the titles in alphabetial order, instead of in order by season as Ms. Storm has done it and selling it at a convention or over the internet. Also, along with an alphabetical episode list, other tv guides for popular shows, such as the Twilight Zone, and Law and Order have included in their indexes actors names, etc...which fans might also want to look up.All in all though, a wonderfully written and conceived work which differs from other tv show guides in that it doesn't give an episode description, which could ruin it for someone who hasn't yet seen the show, but instead a philosophical and artistic commentary."},{"Title":"Approaching the Possible: The World of Stargate SG-1","review":"This was a pretty good synopsis of the show. It included some info about the characters and the stars of the show. The synopsis of each show was pretty good. It included interesting information and facts along with some of the memorable dialogue. Granted I think a whole book could be published with just the interesting and humorous dialogue alone.The author like most of us Stargate Fans has her favorite episodes and I agree for the most part about the episodes she says are not that great. All in all it is a good resource. I am giving it four stars for that.One thing I wish it had was more information about the names of the peoples and places the team visit. Everything named in the Stargate univiverse has a reference either to mythology or the ancient world.

I have been a fan of SG1 from the very first season and, by reading the book, I was surprised at how much I didn't know about the show.The book also gives you background info about the mythology and science involved in making one of the longest, most successful running shows on television and how the show has inspired from regular viewers to real-life scientists.Exclusive interviews with various cast and crew also gives you a feeling of what goes on behind the scenes of SG1, and each gives their unique take on the show.In short, everything you ever wanted to know about anything of Stargate SG1 is thrown into a wonderful mix and bound together in a book that is a must-have for anyone who considers themselves part of the Stargate SG1 'fanchise'."},{"Title":"Approaching the Possible: The World of Stargate SG-1","review":"My *only* gripe is that it doesn't cover all 10 seasons, but it was complete at the time of publishing.

It completely took me away and put me on a higher spiritual level that lasted a long time. Kazantzakis somehow captured the essence of what St. Francis was all about...St. Francis was a man who truly tried to do what Jesus said to do, sell everything you have, give it to the poor, pick up His cross daily and follow Him. The feeling I get when I read the book was one of actually being with St. Francis and understanding why so many followed him and liked him. I am in the middle of reading it again (another Spring break!), and I see why I loved it so much the first time. It's a great novel, even if you aren't a Christian, because the characters and the writing are so good, but being a Christian adds a spiritual level that makes me want to read this book over and over, even though I think I am so far from where St. Francis was! It makes one think about what Jesus really said and what it would be like to TRULY do what He said! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Saint Francis,: A novel","review":"Saint Francis is a passionate and highly personal vision of the life of Francis of Assisi, the poor man of God, by the late Nikos Kazantzakis, author of The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel (1958), The Last Temptation of Christ (1960), Zorba the Greek (1953), The Greek Passion (1954) and Freedom or Death (1956). (Note: dates are those of the first American editions.)Nikos Kazantzakis' books transcend the usual limitations of the novel: they go beyond the mere telling of an exciting story and enter the sublime world of the spirit. Their themes are powerful and heroic, for above all they are concerned with the struggle between good and evil in man's soul, and with the ability of ordinary men, at all times in history, to leave behind their daily occupations and their pleasures and to dedicate themselves to a noble ideal, often at the cost of their lives.In Freedom or Death, Kazantzakis wrote of the mortal combat between Greek and Turk on his native island of Crete; in the THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, he wrote of the Saviour's spiritual passion and agony as He prepares His own martyrdom. In SAINT FRANCIS, Kazantzakis has re-created the story of Christianity's best-known, most human, and most beloved saint -- Francis of Assisi.It is a historical novel, and the reader will grasp in it all the miseries and glory of medieval Italy. But Kazantzakis has not limited himself to the retelling of this well-known story. He has tried to show us Saint Francis as a person, tempted by the life that is offered to him and the comforts of his home, but driven by his own restless spirit to rise above the level of his fellow men and to assert his belief in goodness and submission. Kazantzakis' Francis is not the calm and undisturbed saint of legend, preaching to the animals. His is a man, tempted, weary, but searching for spiritual peace in a world of evil and war.Kazantzakis has made his narrator, Saint Francis' companion, a cheerful monk, happy with wine and good food, weak in the ways of the flesh, but faithful to the master he cannot fully understand. Through his eyes we see the endless strife between the flesh and the spirit, the bitter wanderings over Europe and the Holy Land, the struggle against complacent and entrenched men in the Church that finally led to the founding of the Franciscan order.This is the story of Saint Francis as only Nikos Kazantzakis could tell it.It is a book that cannot fail to move everyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Saint Francis,: A novel","review":"I am pleased to find that a number of reviewers find this book life-changing. It presents the entire anguish of human being, and it is the book that describes one of the highest concerns of Kazantzakis, an issue that he deals on several other books, but never with such fever: the desire of the human being to talk with God, and the depths that the human mind has to go in believing and disbelieving, in facing irrationality and hearing the voice of God.You do not have to be religious in the strict christian sense. If that is the case, then this book might be offending, as it presents the passions of man that tries to reach God in an 'uncoventional' way, that does not abide by the doctrine of the church.Still, I was deeply affected and deeply shaken by this book, more than any other book of Kazantazakis that I have read. Reading it was a 'passion' in itself. I had to reach the same depths, and I felt some of the anguish of St. Francis, as presented by Kazantakis. A lst remark. Do not compare the book with a biography. St. Francis is a tragic hero, an embodiment of mans religious passions, an example of faith."},{"Title":"Saint Francis,: A novel","review":"In 1972, I read The Last Temptation of Christ by Nikos Kazantzakis. I will always consider it one of the greatest books ever written. I found it an incredibly faith-affirming book and it changed my life as it changed my outlook on Jesus Christ. Thirty-five years later, I decided to read Saint Francis.I was very disappointed. Not because it is a bad book, but because it fell way short of what I expected. Over the last three decades, I would say to anyone, \\"Open The Last Temptation of Christ to any page, and read. The words flow from each page like poetry.\\" Such was not the case with Saint Francis.I had a similar experience recently with Par Lagerkvist. I read Barabbas 40 years ago and then read The Sybil last year. I'll remember Mr. Lagerkvist for Barabbas, not for the disappointing Sybil. Similarly, I will remember Mr. Kazantzakis for the Last Temptation, not for Saint Francis. I truly believe that my failure to connect with these books recently is because of the translation, not because the author's work was of less value.Saint Francis is a dark book of personal sacrifice. I continually saw visions of the Opus Dei sect as I read the book. Francis clearly led a life of personal sacrifice dedicated to the glory of God, but the translation left me empty and not inspired. I'll not refute any of the superlative reviews that this book has earned, but from this man's point of view, I'll be cautious in the future when selecting translated material regardless of the author."},{"Title":"Saint Francis,: A novel","review":"Kazantzakis' \\"Saint Francis\\" captures the \\"madness\\" of the Poverello of Assisi like no other book. Francis was truly a revolutionary character, but often biographies have a tendency to neuter him into a quaint, slightly eccentric character from a fairy tale. But Kazantzakis does not fall into this trap - he displays Francis in his full devotion to God and desire to imitate Christ completely. This can make one uncomfortable, as Francis appears unbalanced at times, but it drives home the point that the Saint of Assisi cared for nothing other than embracing Christ in poverty and love.The book is written from the perspective of Francis' closest follower, Brother Leo. Kazantzakis' depiction of Leo as a simple, struggling, but devoted follower of Francis helps to enlighten his portrait of Francis by contrasting the two in their travels and struggles. At times, Kazantzakis is harsh in his depiction of others in Francis' life, especially Brother Elias, and even St. Dominic, but this all works to allow the reader to focus on the specific charism of Francis to preach - and live - Poverty, Chastity, Obedience, and Love.Anyone with a devotion to St. Francis will be rewarded by reading this book - it has the power to force you to reevaluate your own life in the light of the life of the poor friar from Assisi."},{"Title":"Saint Francis,: A novel","review":"Saint Francis of Assisi by Nikos Kazantzakis is a book about a man who becomes a Saint. Born to an Italian family in Assisi, Francis grows up in affluence and loves serenading young women. He joins the military hoping to earn knighthood and prestige. But he is not successful. One day he meets a man whom he calls mockingly Lion because he is covered with hair. Thus begins the story of Saint Francis by Brother Leo. Kazantzakis is the master story teller here and Brother Leo is narrating it. This book is a soulful story based upon the real life. Francis sets off in search of God and Brother Leo is his helper who accompanies him through the hardships on this path. They travel widely and preach \\"Poverty, Peace and Love\\", only to be mocked, thrashed and stoned by people calling them mad. But as Francis undertakes long lonely sessions to talk to God he hears voices. He is not sure if it is God or the Devil impersonating God. This is the epic struggle which Francis faces throughout. He disowns his father, mother, lover, all for seeking God. He constantly feels that Devil is trying to ensnare humans by taking different forms and sweet temptations. One cannot help seeing that perhaps Kazantzakis sees the similarity between Christianity now and the ensnare of the Devil. It is heart rending to see a man so possessed about God,love poverty, peace and all life including animals, birds. This book will bring tears to your eyes and if it does not then perhaps like Francis believes the devil has got to you. To read that such a person existed and was a Christian begs the mind that if Christianity to-day is the same of Jesus Christ of love? One cannot shake off the thoughts that later Christians dropped atomic bomb, napalm carpeting, drone attacks on civilians, burning of heretics, women, holocaust and still continue to believe they are the followers of Jesus Christ. If it was not tragic for Christianity that Europeans tribes snatched it from Middle East (Asia). They certainly were not ready for the spirituality of Jesus Christ. Saints like Francis re-affirm our faith in Christianity. I was so moved to know that there was a man of this enlightenment that I read it back to back. Overall a great loving book worth reading.

In my reading, St. Francis comes across as profoundly unlikeable, a wildly misogynistic and selfish attention-getter. Kazantzakis does capture St. Francis' affinity with the animal world well, but I found his St. Francis to be less than saintly throughout most of the book. I think it's still worth reading, as an individual's modern hagiography, but it pales in comparison to the genius of Last Temptation."},{"Title":"Saint Francis,: A novel","review":"I have read a lot of books on St. Francis of Assisi, and viewed several films. Kazantzakis presents a &quot;fictional re-creation&quot; St. Francis as an aescetic who travels a journey that few of us would want to take. An aescetic with a disgust for anything having to do with &quot;the flesh&quot; Francis suffers throughout most of the novel from malnutrition, dehydration, and a collection of maladies brought on by the neglect and abuse of his own body, the &quot;temple of the Holy Spirit.&quot; This form of mortification of the body has thankfully been abandoned, but was considered a path to salvation coming out of the Dark Ages. His fear/avoidance and mysognistic view of women was unfortunate, and I think this perhaps was a bit overblown and not well researched by Kazantzakis, for I have not found this pathological view in any other writings about St. Francis.For a deeper understanding of St. Francis of Assisi, and the wide attraction of this most famous saint, please read G.K. Chesterton's biography of St. Francis. Don't get me wrong, I admire and love St. Francis and the revolution he began in Christianity, but I disliked his portrayal by Kazantzakis."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"A very readable, comprehensive, yet compact study of the war in Europe. Wilmot covers all of the war in Europe, including Dunkirk, Dieppe, Battle of/Invasion of Britain,etc but is especially in his element post D-Day. He puts a lot of things in context- e.g. land force successes are related to the strategic ability of Germany to wage war following the strategic bombing of German factories etc., which in turn is put into the context of an air war, and other factors pertaining to output. Yes, German output of materi&eacute;l was increasing at the end of the war...For me, the best thing is that Chester WIlmot was, I believe, a New Zealander. He is therefore a lot more objective in his work than you find in many of the distorted and jignoistic books on the topic, where you expect John Wayne to arrive at any minute and nothing goes wrong. The Allies DID make mistakes. It wasnt all glorious, and he reflects this, whilst giving credit where it is due and putting reverses into proper context. For example, his analysis of Omaha beach and the inadequacies of US higher command that led to it is very moving; and he pulls no punches with e.g. Operation Market Garden either. Further, the political struggles within the allies are as well represented as the struggle against Nazi Germany itself: Finally, after reading Wilmot, you are left in no doubt that the fighting in Western Europe after D-Day was every bit as bitter and devastating as the fighting in the first world war, and with equally horrific casualties.A must have book. I have been trying to track one down for years. I eventually found a well-used 1950s copy in a second hand book shop, and I would love another hard back version, but will settle for a paperback in the interim.BUY THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"Chester Wilmot was uniquely qualified to write this exhaustive history. He was a war correspondent who made the jump on June 6, so in some ways his narrative of D-Day's opening is a memoir, a trained historian and an exhaustive researcher. This book occupied him for six years and even though it was published in 1952, it was and still is, a remarkably objective history of the war in Europe.First, the flaws. It's not complete. There's no account on the fall of France or Poland or Norway for that matter. It opens when the Germans have the BEF trapped in the channel ports in May 1940. But this is understandable. Wilmot's assertion that Hitler's letting the BEF get away sowed the the seeds for it's eventual return to the continent. Second, the Russian Front (which actually WON the war in Europe by the way) is dealt with only summarily and the Pacific is only discussed in terms of overall Grand Strategy. He also only mentions the war in the Mediterranean in passing. His Cold War conclusions were off as well, but this is said of course with hindsight. But considering when this was published (1952 originally), it's understandable for Wilmot for feeling that way.The strengths of this book is that if you want a first rate narrative of the whats, the hows and the whys on how the War in Western Europe was fought, then this is the book.Wilmot covers every possible aspect of the Western European campaign. From grand strategy, to desperate battles to blunders committed on both sides.American readers might be peeved the way Wilmot praises Montgomery and not enough flattering comments are given Eisenhower and Patton (though both do receive their share). Frankly, I think it's high time Monty gets some good recognition over here. You don't become a Field Marshal in any Army by being incompetent. He was a good general, maybe even a great one. He gave the British Army its first real victory over the Germans, something no other British general had yet to do.Wilmot also discusses the political machinations of both sides. The Allies were far superior to Hitler when it came to this. Also he discusses the economics of the war; something few if any military historians did at the time. Today, it's a common practice, but in 1952, it was a radical new approach.John Keegan's recommendation of this in his history of the Second World War got me to purchasing a copy. He still believes it's unsurpassed in many ways. I have to agree.I don't agree with everything Wilmot said, but I think that's what makes a good history book. You have points to debate and discuss. After all, history is always interpretive."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"When Chester Wilmot, an Oxbridge graduate and a reporter for an English newspaper, was sifting through the war records at Nuremburg during the war trials, it donned on him that all the material the Allies needed to determine whether their D-Day strategy worked was in his hands. When he became a don at Oxford (I believe), he did just that. He poured over signal records captured from the Germans, historical data from the Allies, and produced a marvelous account of what the Allies did on D-Day and why it worked. The fact that Wilmot was on foot as a correspondent with the first British landing parties on D-Day only adds to the vision and understanding in, and the reader's appreciation of, this story. You'll end up wanting more. My wife and I visited Normandy on an excursion in the Summer of 1994, one week to the day after the 50th D-Day anniversary stuff ended. The crowds were gone but all the sites and history were still there. We stayed in a chateaux in a village called Audrieu and, in preparation for the trip, wanted to read a D-Day history. I'd read the Longest Day and seen the movie, but wanted something more and different. A colleague merely remarked, flatly, &quot;it's the *best* book ever written on the subject.&quot; Wilmot didn't fail me. His ability to describe the macro troop movements and supply considerations, while at the same time describing in some cases every turn in the road, every hiding spot, and every skirmish, proved to me his ability as a great story-teller and historian. Even my wife, who was on the trip only because it was to France, and who originally had little interest in the region or D-Day, was smitten by the descriptions. She picked up the book while I was swimming in the Chateaux's pool early one morning, and it couldn't be pried loose until she was done. My wife was struck by the uncanny ability of Wilmot to describe a location or a battle or a situation from a hilltop, or vista point - along with a reference to a mile marker or other memorial so today's reader may find the same view, and witness what it is Wilmot is talking about. When one does this, as we did frequently, the book comes alive in the reader's hands more than any other first person history I have read. Wilmot's book is a masterpiece. Americans will read it and enjoy it because of its slightly skewed view for all of us - it's written from the British perspective most decidedly - and is unyielding in its frank comparisons of fresh but unskilled American troops, compared with their experienced, weary British colleagues. The book will stand out as an icon of its genre to anyone who reads it - and to those who accompany the tome to Normandy, it will make for a lifelong memory. Its ability to enhance a journey to Normandy cannot be overstated.

None of them were as engrossing and well written as Chestor Wilmonts Struggle for Europe. This has been on my bookshelf for many years and I have read it twice. A terrific expose of the second world war in Europe. Chester draws you into the war as if you were there on D Day, and turns what could have been a very boring strategic overview of the war into an indepth study which keeps you wanting to read more."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"In this dense book the military history of the European theater of world war two is scrutinized with intricate detail. The history begins with the battle of Britain. The fall of Austria, Czechkoslovakia, Poland and France are all omitted. Germany's invasion plans, Operation: Sealion are what the reader is introduced with. The history continues with a detail scrutiny of the political, diplomatic and military moves (with an emphasis on the latter) that made up the struggle for Europe. The book ends with a history of the blunders at the Yalta conference and hints at the continuing tension that would mark post-war Europe.Why You Should Read This Book:Wilmot, in my humble opinion, gave an objective account of the war. He was not afraid to point out some of the blunders that the allies made in the course of the war. Some critics, Americans especially might disagree because he was highly critical of Patton and Eisenhower, while Montgomery was praised as a military genius. Indeed there might be some error by Wilmot in not giving an account of Chamberlain and his policy of appeasement. However this omission does not detract from the power of this history. This book gives the details to arguably the greatest conflict of mankind. With the generation that fought that war slowly dying away, it is important to revisit this war and not forget the lessons that history has taught us.What you should expect to see in this book:Expect a very detailed and at often times dry account of military plans, logistics, etc. The maps in here are of great use in understanding the war.What you should not expect to see in this book:This book is mainly a military history, so don't expect to read about the holocaust or about the Nazi philosophy. There are many good books on those subjects, but this is not one of them (I would highly suggest The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich by Shirer if you want to learn about the Nazis). Also, do not expect a lot of history before the battle of Britain. In addition this book was written at a time when information about the Eastern front mainly came from Nazi archives and not the Soviets. If you're looking for a book on Stalingrad or Kursk, this is probably not it (the author does cover these battles in detail, but modern books have been able to access more resources in describing them).I gave this book 4 stars because I only give 5 stars to masterpieces. This book is certainly a thumbs up."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"I remember first reading this book was I was 13. Fantastic. I've read it numerous times. It never ceases to amazeThe first third of the magnificent work deals with the rise of Adolf and the conquest of Western Europe.The remainder deals with the build up to overload, including Deippe landing. It is from June 6th that this book really shines and shows the war in the west in a farily fine-grained manner.Wilmot, being an Australian, was somewhat baised and favorable in his treatment of MOnty. This aside, he does present an impartial treatment of the war in the west. As he was actually there (I believe), he had access to primary sources that make this a highly valuable and valid work. He doesn't glorify war or the allied efforts and the closing remark about the cost of war and hoping it never happens again is quite good. Here is a cosnidered effort that is a 'serious' history, including allied failings and shortcomings, not revisionist or exaggerated.Thumbs up.Only complaint: The title is misleading."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"I remember a colleague some 20 years ago raving about this book. I picked it up at a second-hand book fair and noticed the publication date, 1951, which for an unnatural reason bothered me. But I finally got around to reading it and was engrossed from the first chapter. It's a dry book but from the point of view of the battles and command structures it has probably got to be one of the best books on war that I've read. It's the sort of book that War Colleges would recommend for professional military students to study - professional, logical and perfectly representative of command, control and communications in major war. There are no personal vignettes, no rhetorical and ethical questioning of the meaning of war etc. The account of D-Day to the end of the war in the West is in itself a sobering exercise. However, if I could quibble it would be to point out that it should be entitled &quot;The Struggle for Western Europe&quot; and that on the land. The Eastern Front is almost entirely neglected, as is Italy, the sea war, the air war which were all contemporaneous with the land battle in the west. But this is a small failing with the grinding industrial quality which is the unfortunate fact of modern war. It doesn't stop to mourn the dead (that comes later) and nor does Chester Wilmot. This book more than holds its own against any of the C. Ryan, M. Middlebook, J. Keegan, S. Ambrose books which came later."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"This book is superb, full of amazing information, and easy to read. It sat on my shelf for about 2 years before I finally picked it up to read and I was disappointed that I hadn't done so earlier.The book basically covers the entire war in one volume: starting off covering in brief, what took place between 1939-1944 and is crammed full of amazing information. Wilmot then turns to the main focus of the book, the fighting between 1944 and 1945. During the main portion of the book he covers both the Western and Eastern Fronts providing an excellent general narrative of the fighting backed up by dozens of maps to illustrate the text. Furthermore, the author actually took part in Operation Overlord and provides his own first-hand account of his landing into Normandy alongside the 6th Airborne Division."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"I first read this book in 1953. I was then only twenty years old and a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Of all the books about the second world war I read since, this work fulfil the thirst for knowledge I have regarding many aspects of that war, like logistic, war materiel production, and the effects of scientific discoveries on the outcome. The author writing is very fluid, not repetive in its description and straight forward. He doesnt hesitate to lay blames where due, and praises when warranted, neutral as he should be. I very much appreciate the battle situations maps, being in color they are easier to read and visualize the operation at hand. Appendix B: The High Commands is most useful when it comes to evaluate the reasons behind some of the crucial decisions that were taken. On the other hand, I find the author cursory writing about such momentous events as the North African and Italian campaings somewhat disconcerting, being much too short and lacking in depth, given the impact those campaings had on the german ressources. Seems obvious that the author was not prepared to go in more details, having probably not researched those two campaings to his satisfaction in order to elaborate further. One must remember, this book was first printed in 1952, not such a long time after the war. I am very pleased of my acquisition, and shall use it as yardstick in my further readings on the second world war. The book is in very good condition and was received on the date promised. I will be back."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"This book is essential for any serious student of the war(s) to read and have in his/her library.

Never learned so much about the behind the scenes tactics and politics. highly recommend this book for overall knowledge of World War II."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"Some others have been criticising the author in a way that to me seems unfair. It seems a little harsh to criticise the book, the author set out to give an account of battles post D-day for the western allies. Why one manoeuvre was adopted over another. How that was perceived by the enemy and how they reacted. To do this he sets out the strategic history, he puts perspective on the book by writ ting about how the eastern front was affecting the war in the west. The criticism levelled is like saying a history of China doesn't say enough about Japan; it simply didn't intend to.The book does what it intended to. It sets out how the western allies fought, why they fought the way they did, why they fought where they did and explains the reasons the Germans did the same on the western front. It places all this in a strategic context but the tactical context is purely a western front issue. It does this very well too. I have a new understanding of the war in Normandy, as some have said he was certainly pro-Montgomery; however if the documents exist to support this case the Normandy campaign should be remembered as a master class in generalship.The author has a wide ranging and in depth view of what was happening. He at times is able to describe in great detail how the actions of small units effected the out come of important battles, particularly on D-day. But at the same time he sees and makes easy to understand how the movement of large bodies of men effected the outcome of events too. He was in contact with senior staff from both sides and was able to get access to many documents referenced giving me the feeling of a comprehensive understanding of the conflict that I have not got from other books I have read.All in all very good."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"I've been slogging through it and appreciate Wimot's writing style and humor sprinkled throughout, although I'm sure I miss some of it because I'm not British.He does a good job of explaining what happened without getting bogged down in details like a Battle of the Bulge book I just read.If you're interested in WW2, get this book."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"The value of this book lies in the chance to see how one Australian journalist told the story of the war, just after the war itself. Wilmot unwittingly reveals his own prejudices, and gives a contemporary reader a strong sense of how he and his colleagues perceived the Anglo-American aspect of the war against Hitler. His perspective is personal and immediate, and is impossible to find in today's more measured historiography of the war. He also brings in economic analysis (industrial production and labour force), a careful reconstruction of the July plot against Hitler, and a fresh reading of political machinations determining military choices on both sides.Wilmot was present in western France and then on the road to Holland, and his accounts of the individual bravery of Allied troops are first-person and convinced. Based on the skirmishes he witnessed, he also has enormous respect for the Germans as fighters. Wilmot also has no hostility towards the Germans, whom he admires as superior fighters, and on some pages almost seems to regret that their crackpot dictator doomed their excellent army to defeat.Wilmot's thesis is essentially that the German loss was not due to Allied strategic brilliance but in the superior industrial production of the allied effort, against which the Germans could not possibly have won. He also subscribes to the idea that the Germans would have surrendered earlier had Morgenthau not announced that the victors would partition and demilitarize Germany. A modern reader may be surprised that his book on the European war mentions Jews only in this context, but Wilmot's distaste for Jews is representative of some of his background and position. His war, close-up, was quite another.Where Wilmot's vision is more useful is when he deflates the idea of an even battle between the Allies and the Germans. Allied bombing had eliminated the mobility of German forces in Western France: there was not enough fuel for their tanks, which relied on rail transport to arrive at battles. German troop levels and home-front labour force resources were low, supplies were limited, and the entire German command structure was split in half between regular Army and SS units, with practically no co-ordination. Hitler's mystical belief in the power of the SS units led to him starving other units of resources and his failure to withdraw them.The Allies in Wilmot's book bicker and bumble, and overcome superior German forces largely through numbers and massive preparation. They protract the war by splitting resources between Patton and Montgomery, what Wilmot considers a political decision. He claims that Montgomery's force, if properly supplied, would have circled the Ruhr and brought the war to an early end. This may be because Wilmot was embedded with Montgomery's forces on their drive north. Still, the scenes of miscommunication he describes (ten-mile traffic jams as the troops erroneously believe the shoulders are mined) suggest that incompetence in that army was also rife.In short, the book can be uncomfortable reading for those accustomed to heroics and morality plays. By washing the Nazis of their murderous ideology, Wilmot makes them almost pitiable in their doomed defense of occupied Europe. He even parrots Goebbels' canard that Morgenthau (=Jews) protracted the war by steeling German resolve. Still, Wilmot himself, who died prematurely in an air crash and may have changed his own views had he lived, is a window on how the war was understood in its immediate aftermath by the victors and not the victims."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"When I purchased this book I was searching for a comprehensive, though not intensively detail, account of the war in Europe (1939-1945). This book was not it. I did enjoy reading the book but it continually showed its age while I was making my way through it. As some reviewers have noted, it has many gaps. Particularly, the early German biltzkrieg in Poland and the low countries, as well as Norway. The North Africa campaign, Italy, as well as the Russian front were only intermittently discussed. A more appropriate title for the book would be the war on the western front (1941-1945).The another obvious point that came to mind while reading the book was that it definitely was dated. No discussions regarding Allied and German intelligence breakthroughs were mentioned. Some of the Allied deceptions to pin the 15th Army in the Pas de Calais was mentioned and how it help the Allies during the first month of the D day invasion.Overall, some interesting reading about the western Allies and a good account of the Allied war in the west from 1944-1945. If one is interested in a more completed look, and more modern account, of the european war, this is not it."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"If you really want know about the conquest of Western Europe from D-Day onwards, go no further than reading this book."},{"Title":"The struggle for Europe","review":"I had to do a rare book search for this book and when it came I couldn't wait to dive in. But my enthusiasm quickly subsided into utter boredom. Maybe the author was there and maybe some consider this a WW2 classic but I found it very dry reading and very easy to put down. Besides that fact, it is very biased for Montgomery and when there was blame to place it usually and many times unfairly went to the Americans. For a good history of the War in Normandy try Keegans' 'six armies' or one of the individual's histories like 'roll me over' or 'if you survive' and leave this book where it belongs...in a rare book store."},{"Title":"America en Bicicleta: del Plata a la Habana (Linea de Sombra) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Andres:Acabo de terminar tu libro, y la verdad me parecio muy bueno.

She stuffs it all within her pages- the damsel in distress, the dastardly villian, the orphan- but ultimately achieves a surprisingly feminist ideology. Her heroine, Capitola, is self reliant, creative, and genuinely heroic. She romps through Southworth's pages comically overturning many of the 19th century's most concretized stereotypes about femininity. All told, it is a marvelous read, deceptively subtle, surprisingly subversive, impossible to set aside once begun due to its breathless narrative rate. Well worth the investment."},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand","review":"My sister in law encouraged me to get the Kindle, and also to be sure to read Hidden Hand and its sequel.

This means it is probably more Christian than so called Christian fiction is today. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand","review":"The only thing that saves this novel from being ridiculous is the evident fun the authoress has in sharing the character of Capitola with her readers. The novel does not take itself too seriously either, which makes it seem as if the authoress is laughing along with the reader as she relates Capitola's adventures. The novel has its fair share of flaws. The other characters in the novel are rather one-dimensional and the authoress drifts into the fantastical plot twists to \\"redeem\\" some of the novels villains. But it is still an altogther fun novel to read, though by no means a classic."},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand","review":"As I had been told by many people that The Hidden Hand was their favorite Lamplighter book, if not indeed their favorite book altogether, I was very pleased to finally be able to read it. Overall, I agree that the story is the most gripping and amusing out of the twenty or so Lamplighters I have read, but it is lacking the heart that makes the others so special. What I love about books like Titus: A Comrade of the Cross, The Spanish Brothers, and Stepping Heavenward is that the heart of the books is God, and I come away from reading them with a desire to be closer to Him. While The Hidden Hand has Christianity, and a couple very good statements about God (for example: \\"I couldn't have survived were it not for my relationship with God\\" or something like that), the thrust of the story is more Capitola's madcap adventures than God's work in her life. Most of the characters start out with grievous faults, and their repentance and change is either incomplete or very subtle, and the credit is not given to God. Altogether, I found The Hidden Hand to have the potential to be a great book such as most found on Lamplighters shelves, but failed to bring it through, making it only an averagely good book."},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand","review":"It was a page-turner for me!

Lamplighter seeks old, clean books to reprint in handsome leather volumes for Christian audiences. So, mom gave this to my sister, and of course, I got to read it, too. I dropped it a third of the way in -- it was just too ridiculous. Might I add to all of you naysayers that I don't need to eat the whole fish to tell it's rotten?Sorry to disappoint, but this book was meant to die a long time ago. Giving it a pretty binding does not make it any more bearable. It typifies every single book ever written in this time period (perhaps sans strong, independent female lead, but that's not a good reason to read it). Now, if it focused on Capitola and her exploits, I might not mind it so much. But the problem is that it never lingers on Cap and keeps launching off into a painfully boring morality tale. A child could figure out how it's going to end by page 50. Look, if I wanted to be preached to, I'd go to church or read a devotional.The names deserve a category of their own. Old Hurricane and Wool I didn't mind. But the Author's pen-name? Marah (e.g., bitterness) Rocke and her son Traverse? Clare Day?! And how about Capitola? This is probably one of the worst names in literature, only bested by Kvothe from the Kingkiller Trilogy. I think they should get together and have terrifying children with equally terrifying names.It's not all bad. Old Hurricane is at least marginally enjoyable as a stock character. Capitola's exploits are enjoyable at times; there is a particularly simple and ingenious way she escapes from a nasty situation, which is the only satisfying part in the book. She's the only character I looked forward to reading about; everyone else was rather cookie-cutter.Another interesting part of the book is its historical setting -- this was published in 1859, just 2 years before the Civil War. It's a fascinating time capsule -- and I can't lie that it's wonderful and interesting to make a connection with a person from another time, place, and morality. Obviously, Old Hurricane owns slaves; the author is both very sympathetic to their plights and sometimes downright offensive (as with the appearance of Hat). Capitola often yearns to be on her own, and threatens to leave Old Hurricane -- behavior that astonished me, given the time period. And Capitola and Clare being considered for marriage at the age of 14 made me sick, but was also a real eye-opener. I'm so glad I'm safely ensconced in the present century!Now, if only there wasn't a ridiculous morality tale taking up 60% of this book. It's an agonizing read. I don't even know why it's necessary. Every time I saw \\"Widow Rocke\\" I wanted to cry from frustration. And as for pure stupidity, it's here in endless amounts. The leader of the robbers \\"falls in love\\" with Cap... and to read his dialogue with his stooges made me laugh and laugh and laugh. It was the final straw; I put the book down and gave it back. It's just too much. It's too simple, too idiotic, too preachy -- and boring, boring, boring!In conclusion: I don't mind simple books, books with morals, old books, or classics. In fact, I adore many such books. However, this book lacks what all those books had -- entertainment and/or excellent technical skill. There is nothing about this book worth saving. This was common fare then -- it's just trash now. Nothing about this book is well written; nothing about it is worth reading. Christian audiences are the dullest things alive if they find this entertaining."},{"Title":"The Floating Opera","review":"John Barth's first novel will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary of publication in 2006 (I read the 1967 revised edition, which Barth rewrote primarily, he says, to restore his original ending). Should this almost 50 year-old book, whose protagonist was born in 1900, still be read in the 21st century, by people who may not have even been alive when Barth wrote it? Emphatically, positively, yes!The Floating Opera serves as an excellent introduction to the body of work of one of the 20th century's greatest writers (time will tell), and also stands on its own as an engrossing, amusing, thought-provoking tale. It establishes many of Barth's common themes and settings: the flawed, cynical (yet also fun-loving) protagonist; impossible quests; the absurdities of society's structures and laws; philosophy and morality; coastal Maryland and boating on the Chesapeake. Barth's later works are longer and much more intricate, so TFO is very much like Beethoven's first symphony: a simpler work than his later masterpieces, but which still shows definite signs of genius, originality, and timelessness.The storyline, like Barth's other works, is quirky and highly original. It describes the lead-up to an event that, because of the way the book was written (in the first person), the reader knows cannot have taken place. Barth openly explains the disjointed nature of the book's structure (which is just one way that the floating opera of the title is important to the story), and everything holds together in the end.TFO's protagonist, Todd Andrews, is a lawyer who has developed a detached, cynical view of the world. His mentality is perfect for his profession, and he wins his cases by crafting intricate technical loopholes that reduce his cases to absurdities. Thirty-five years before the Johnnie Cochran's poetic words in the O.J. Simpson trial, Barth prophetically describes a similar situation of the \\"bon mot\\" winning out over the \\"mot juste\\". But this is just one of the amusing vignettes in TFO. Barth also describes the challenges of an open love triangle, different ways to approach old age and death, the drawbacks of various outlooks on life, and an intense father-son relationship. Comic relief is never too far away, especially when the various crusty old men in the book are speaking.How to rate TFO? On the Barth scale, it is not his greatest masterpiece, so you'd have to give it less than 5 stars. But on the scale of all works and all authors, it definitely deserves a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"The Floating Opera","review":"Barth has so many big huge enormous novels that his first two shorter works are perhaps unjustly overlooked in the shadows of their bulkier brethren. This novel coupled with The End of the Road established him as a new voice with a distinctly different point of view. No doubt readers were hardly ready to read the book and find out that it's about a man who one day decides that the most logical thing for him to do is commit suicide and so he spends the entire book discussing what exactly led him to this decision. Barth somehow turns this jarring premise into something both witty and often extremely funny. Told in the first person, like most of his best books, the constant barrage of mythological references that characterize most of his work haven't appeared yet and so the book remains mostly straightforward (though the copy on the front cover amusingly compares the book to famous literary personages) . . . or at least as straightforward as Barth gets. The narrator tells his story in a roundabout fashion, jumping all over the place in time, sometimes stopping the story for brief asides that occur to him along the way, always reminding the reader of the planned end result of all of this. Barth manages to keep his narrator witty and involving, his viewpoint is detached and often bordering on existential, yet the book isn't cold and sterile, in fact it's move very quickly and despite its subject matter is pretty enjoyable. It's not as dark as The End of the Road and even though it's about suicide it really isn't all that depressing. For some reason the original ending was changed at the request (more like demand) of the publisher, later versions have restored the original and I'm not sure what the fuss was all about, there's nothing really shocking about it. Different times I guess. Still, along The End of the Road, this remains one of the best ways to ease your way into Barth before tackling the more complicated, erudite stuff he would later accomplish. Everyone has to start somewhere. You might as well start here."},{"Title":"The Floating Opera","review":"Barth's first work out of the gate is a tremendous literary success. How did he know so much about the world as a young man of twenty-four? It boggles the mind. I first encountered the Floating Opera when I myself was in my early twenties, and identified deeply with its philosophical, questing hero. Revisiting the book more than a decade later, some of its philosophizing comes off as a touch sophomoric, but I still find it deeply satisfying. It's written with wit, charm, and extreme self-assurance, and the plot is beautifully paced, with many hilarious digressions along the way, weaving together to form a wonderful picture of life in small-town Maryland. Barth also had a nose for hot-button issues (his second Book, the End of the Road, took on abortion in the late '50s), and the ending of the Opera features an offhand suicide-bombing attempt that raises the hair on one's neck far more today than it would've a decade ago."},{"Title":"The Floating Opera","review":"In THE FLOATING OPERA, Todd Andrews, Barth's droll and articulate narrator, examines why he did not commit suicide on June 21st or 22nd, 1937. Poor Todd, wonderfully upbeat and funny in most of this narrative, is a damaged soul who has never overcome boyhood trauma, violence in battle, his aloof father's suicide, and his own physical disabilities, which Todd thinks rob him of a future. Todd, isolated emotionally by these experiences and conditions, maintains friendships only with the senescent occupants of his residential hotel and with Harrison and Jane Mack, a wanton pair who want Todd's friendship only if it is without demands. In the end, the pressures of this trauma and emotional aridity point Todd toward an act of shocking nihilism, which Barth's original editors suppressed. Artists get to choose and all that... but in light of recent events, I can see what they were thinking.This is my second reading of TFO. In general, my memories of any books read in 1975 are hazy. But I did remember the moment in his hotel when Todd Andrews snaps. This is certainly a tribute to Barth, who memorably communicates Todd's moment of sad and surprising meltdown.I had forgotten, however, about the amusement that the playful Todd Andrews, a partner in a small firm, finds in the cynical and frivolous combat between lawyers. Counselors, read TFO to enjoy the inspired legal maneuverings in Morton v. Butler and as well as the hilarious legal contest for the estate of Harrison Mack Senior, who left 17 wills.Recommended and rounded up to five stars."},{"Title":"The Floating Opera","review":"In his earliest novels (this was his first), Barth dealt with nihilism, but with a grin. This book is all about how a character named Todd chose a day in 1937 to commit suicide and then came to the conclusion, since life is so meaningless, so is death: might as well go on living. Barth writes in an interesting tone and style - not straight narrative. He also shows great authority, which is unusual in a first novel."},{"Title":"The Floating Opera","review":"This work of fiction is told from a sort of 3-D first person perspective. The main character/narrator tells his story while adressing you as the reader on such subjects as his writing skills (or lack there of) and his idea of how a good story should be told. The just of the story is that of how the &quot;author&quot; comes to the conclusion that he is going to commit suicide and tells you of the many events leading to that conclusion only then to have his mind changed by an extraordinary event one day. The autobiographical aspect of the author's life gives some serious food for philosophical thought that leads the reader with wit and humor."},{"Title":"Naughty Stories from A to Z, Volume 2","review":"This is an extremely hot collection of 27 stories, featuring themes like spanking, voyeurism, girls with girls, sex clubs, and more. My favorite pieces were N.T.

There are [great] stories by a medley of awesome authors, including Maxim Jakubowski, Thomas Roche, Sage Vivant, and M. Christian. The best part is that the stories are very different. All of the authors have their own unique voice. I especially liked Sage Vivant's erotic Volcano Vacation and Maxim Jakubowski's office-hour fantasy in which a boss daydreams about his female employees. Maybe the very best story is the \\"bonus\\" piece, which turns the book into a 27-story collection rather than 26...A very good, satisfying read!"},{"Title":"Naughty Stories from A to Z, Volume 2","review":"This book is pretty dull for something &quot;naughty&quot; - lots of old hat ideas, and nothing's risque in it.

And it helped me a lot"},{"Title":"Pencil Drawing Techniques","review":"Hi all. I draw as a hobby and have been drawing since I was a about 10. I took drawing classes before, but when I look at my previous artwork, they really don't have the &quot;realism&quot; that I wanted, i.e. they look too much like cartoons. I wandered around and tried looking for some books to teach me how to obtained that photo-realistic quality with a pencil.Flipping through this book, my jaw dropped in amazement at the examples in this book. Near the end, the illustrations of zoo animals (tigers, horses, etc) were so life-like! The artist really know how to shade. I instantly brought the book.Let me tell you, this book is very complex and loaded with information. There are lots of text for an art book. First, the book goes over the basics of shapes and different shades of pencil lead (from hard 6H to very soft 8B, the &quot;#2 pencil&quot; is near the middle). Then we go over shading. The book is primarily focusing on different shading and strokes techniques in order to get that &quot;life-like&quot; realism in your drawing. In my personal experience, trying to obtain that level takes many hours and many practice. If you are the type who gives up easily, then this book isn't for you. Nobody said drawing is easy. Or, if you are only interested in drawing nice line-arts (and letting a computer do the rest), then this book is NOT for you as well. However, if you want to draw to the highest realism with just a pencil, then this book is worth considering.I should also mention that a small chapter is devoted to color pencils (whereas the rest, or 90% of the book, is on graphite pencil), but I haven't bother with color yet."},{"Title":"Pencil Drawing Techniques","review":"My 19 year old Son and I are using this book and find it so easy to use in training ourselves to draw.

After all, I would recommend this book to beginners in pencil drawing."},{"Title":"Pencil Drawing Techniques","review":"I don't really understand why this book got so many good reviews.Personally, I wouldnt recommend it to a beginner, for the simple reason that it lacks step by step instructions, it only features 1 to 3 pictures per examples, which IMHO is insufficient for self learning shading techniques, the section on perspective is extremely brief and not very helpful.If you want to learn to draw, try instead the Betty Edwards workbook, and for shading techniques and creating texture, try the lifelike texture in pencil by Lee Hammond, which has more detailed instructions.Btw, if you don't believe my review, check this book out of the library, you'll see for yourself what I mean."},{"Title":"Pencil Drawing Techniques","review":"I am using PENCIL DRAWING TECHIQUES in a drawing class.

As I taught &quot;listening comprehension,&quot; which was the weakest area for Chinese students, I tried hard to finding as much relevant reference as possible. Unlike a lot of difficult/academic TESOL books, among the dozen reference books I got, Manual of American English Pronunciation proved to be the easiest to comprehend, most practical and most resourceful. This manual was organized in such a logical and easy-to-understand way that most English teachers and students alike would find it easy to absorb and put into daily use. As its title suggested, it should be used as a manual instead of a book.The best part that helped me most was &quot;Lesson 16, The Sandhi of Spoken English.&quot; In this chapter, the authors introduced the various forms of Sandhi-forms of English that were commonly seen, for example, reduction of unstressed function words, the disappearing of &quot;t&quot; and palatalization. I saw WOWs in most of my students' eyes when such knowledge was revealed to them. &quot;No wonder I simply couldn't understand spoken English, &quot; I guessed that was their feeling and I was glad to help them decode the mystery.I got on Amazon to see if there's an updated version I can buy. I look forward to its fifth edition."},{"Title":"Manual of American English Pronunciation","review":"The American accent is truly the very prerequisite of coolness these days: to &quot;nativize&quot; oneself in the rich American popular culture requires a considerable mastery of that peculiar pronunciation, and such mastery is not that easy to attain unless one is prepared to spend countless hours through immersion in movies and songs, or better yet, through a stay in the US.Aspiring for coolness might be one possible motivation, an addition to the repertoire of accents to impress friends and relatives might be another; the average student should find this book a required material whatever the drive for the endeavor. I actually used the book as a self-study, and I found it tremendously helpful especially after the jargon-laden introductory books on phonetics baffled me to no ends. There is something very pleasing to the analytical mind: logical explanations, instead of reliance on learning through repetition, are given in places they are warranted.The authors decided not to adopt the full IPA transcription for the sounds, a choice which at times bothered me, as it is hard to switch between one system of transcription to another when using another book. Schwa (mid central rounded) and carat (open-mid back unrounded) are not distinguished, probably on a wise consideration that such distinctions are not phonemic and only unnecessarily complicating."},{"Title":"Manual of American English Pronunciation","review":"This book arrived in very good condition but I haven't been able to read it yet.

You gotta be kidding me. $10 maybe.I owned this book a couple of years ago when I lived in Calgary Alberta, home of the notorious Calgary Stock Exchange, and coincidentally the city Alexander Tadich (the author) lived in and the exchange he was working at and writing about. (Before the Calgary Stock Exchange was merged with the slightly better Vancouver Stock Exchange, these two exchanges were infamous for the numerous penny-stock companies involved in oil and minerals that promoters would use to pump up, hype, then dump and thus fleece \\"investors\\" who bought into the hype. But the same thing is going on at all the exchanges.)Alexander Tadich was a broker on the Calgary Stock exchange, and met many of these shysters, whom he profiles as the \\"Rampaging Bulls\\" in this entertaining, comical book. If you are looking for hard facts, there are none here, but rather real insider's wisdom as Tadich profiles how these promoters work, pumping and then dumping \\"exciting\\" companies with no financial value.While regulators moved to partially clean up those particular two exchanges of their worst excesses (probably because of this book), in fact the game continues on everywhere (ie. the pink sheets of unlisted companies, or the penny stocks) and is no better because there's always money to be made off naive \\"investors\\". Don't think for a second that this doesn't go on at all the other stock exchanges which list penny stocks, too, even the big and respectable ones like the NYSE and NASDAQ, because it does and it's legal! (Rent the movie \\"Boiler Room\\" for another (illegal) example of how these operations work.) If you're interested in stock investing, you need to arm yourself with this book.In fact, today in my mailbox I received an expensive 20 page color broadsheet promoting a company with a \\"Medical Breakthrough\\" in Stem Cells. Lots of quotes promoting this company from doctors, even from Nobel Prize winners, etc. Impressive! I just smiled to myself, recognizing the exact same game Tadich describes, and checked the fine print. Sure enough, there in the fine print it noted that this was an advertisement, these doctors were compensated for their glowing endorsements in cash and stock (a clear conflict of interest) and this jewel: \\"Shares of this company are thinly traded and (Rampaging Bull's) disposing of the shares 'may' adversely affect market price.\\" But they wanted you to buy!The game remains the same. If you want an entertaining story of how the game is played, read this book! (But don't get fleeced for $40.)To save yourself getting fleeced in the stock market follow one simple rule I learned playing the penny stocks myself: NEVER BUY ANY COMPANY THAT IS LOSING MONEY. Most of these \\"hot\\" stocks have GREAT prospects, a diamond mine or the next cure for cancer (literally), and not a dollar in actual profits. Don't worry about \\"missing out\\" because a great company this year will continue to be a great company next year, and the year after, and ten years on, giving you plenty of buying opportunities.Good luck and good investing!"},{"Title":"Rampaging Bulls","review":"It could save you THOUSANDS !

But my kindergartener isn't interested in it, and now that he has actually started kindergarten, I can guess one possible reason why: the classroom shown in the book bears ZERO resemblance to his kindergarten room. Where we live, kindergarten in the public schools isn't about toys and art and dramatic play. It's about desks and workbooks. So the classroom in the book shows my son everything he misses from pre-K. In his shoes, I think I would hate this book for that reason.

Miss Bindergarten (a border collie) has 26 students (each a different animal), and their names start with the 26 letters of the alphabet. The action alternates between Miss B's vigorous efforts to get her classroom ready, and the attitudes of the 26 children as they prepare for their new experience. There are examples of every feeling - Danny Hess rushes to dress, Fran Lister kisses her sister, and Ian Lowe says \\"I won't go!\\" The story is warm and wonderful, the illustrations are gorgeous, and the book is so rich in amusing details that it will be read and re-read many times.

It really was a good book to read to a child."},{"Title":"Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for Kindergarten (Miss Bindergarten Books)","review":"I think this is a marvelous story....from a whole different perspective of the teacher getting ready for Kindergarten and the teacher preparing her classroom which started out quite dreary looking and uninviting. The pictures tell the story and my son giggled seeing the teacher getting ready. It was neat to have the story unfolding in real time as you see the animal kids getting ready for school too. To make the book go over the top for me, the 26 classmates all are named with the first letters of the alphabet so it was a creative alphabet book too and you see them introduced in order from A to Z. It is a perfect opportunity for parents and teachers to reinforce the alphabet and phonic sounds to get the kids to guess the animal while at the same time it shows all \\"different\\" types of kids and how they each prepare and arrive to school in different ways with differnt feelings. Then we see the time pass, check out the clock on the wall another teachable moment---2 hours have past and we see Miss Bindergarten's Kindergarten classroom that she has transformed! My son and I loved flipping back and forward to see the transformation. It is nice that book gave me an opportunity to talk to him about thinking of how Miss Bindergarten was also nervous and excited to meet her new friends and how much work that the teachers put into making the classroom cheery and fun. The illustrations are great. It humanizes the teacher and I like that I can sneak in a lesson of thinking about getting ready for Kindergarten from another perspective but still has plenty of implied perspective from the kids point of view too . The book truly has it all and if you are trying to figure out a few books to read before Kindergarten, I would say this has to be at the top of the list...I can't wait to get the other books in this series."},{"Title":"Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for Kindergarten (Miss Bindergarten Books)","review":"this book was recommended by my granddaughters mother when I requested a list of some gift ideas, and she said my granddaughter would love it.

He really enjoyed it and had us read it to him repeatedly. I think anything that helps dispel the mystery of what to expect in kindergarten is great, and the illustrations in this are cute."},{"Title":"Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for Kindergarten (Miss Bindergarten Books)","review":"My five-and-a-half year old daughter just began kindergarten two weeks ago and though she was in preschool prior to enrolling in kindergarten, she did experience a measure of anxiety about starting over as she had to make new friends and get used to a new and unfamiliar setting. Well, I came across this title at our local library and the cover and title convinced me this would be a great introduction to kindergarten.I was right! Miss Bindergarten is the teacher all parents wish for their child - a wonderful, caring, and enthusiastic teacher who plans ahead in setting up her classroom, filling it with educational materials appropriate for the grade level, and also creating a warm, safe, and secure learning environment - something that is truly essential in a classroom for young children (and all children). The characters in this book are animals but young children will easily identify with these characters as they represent the quirks, eccentricities, and mannerisms of young children.The book just gives one a warm and fuzzy feeling, and my daughter was totally enraptured by the book, and read it repeatedly. The classroom pictures at the end of the book reminds one of the school yearbook with the class photos, where all the children are beaming happily at the camera - now that's what I wish for my child, that she should have such a wonderful year ahead that she too will be beaming with happiness and pride at the end of the year!"},{"Title":"Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for Kindergarten (Miss Bindergarten Books)","review":"Buy Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for Kindergarten. I can not tell you about it. You have to read it. I can tell you it is an ABC book."},{"Title":"Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for Kindergarten (Miss Bindergarten Books)","review":"Looking at this book from the point of view of an adult, I didn't get it. The illustrations are decent, but nothing spectacular. The rhymes are not particularly inventive. And not much happens in the book, which simply shows a teacher getting her classroom ready for the first day of kindergarten, while students are getting ready in their own way - eating breakfast, saying good-bye (or clinging to mom), getting on the bus, and so forth. It's also an alphabet book. Each child in the class has a name that begins with a different letter of the alphabet. But there are hundreds of alphabet books on the market, I thought, and many of them are more clever or better illustrated than this one.Boy, was I wrong. I got this book out of the library the summer before my daughter started kindergarten. She was a little nervous about starting. She's the type of kid who wants to stand back and observe every situation before she plunges in. That made her the perfect kid for this book. While we had it out of the library, she asked me to read it several times every day. I ended up buying a copy of the book before returning the library copy, because it would have broken her heart to be without it.My daughter just finished kindergarten, and I have read this book literally hundreds of times. She still loves it, and I think I've finally figured out why it's so appealing. At the beginning of the book, you see a dark, empty, slightly scary looking classroom. For a child who's afraid of starting school, I think that's a pretty good image of her expectation. But a nice teacher comes in and adds blocks, play kitchen toys, mobiles, paint and brushes, posters, crayons and pencils, etc. and turns the classroom into a beautiful, inviting place. Little by little a child learns to see the classroom as a good place to be. Also, as the teacher adds each new thing, it gives the child a chance to see and talk about some of the new things she will discover when she gets there.This book has already become a classic. It was the first book my daughter's kindergarten teacher read to the class (from talking to other parents, I've discovered that's true in a LOT of classes). And hearing a familiar and adored book the first day of school added to my daughter's sense of comfort.If you have a child who has any apprehension about starting school, this book is probably the best tool available for helping him or her overcome it."},{"Title":"Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for Kindergarten (Miss Bindergarten Books)","review":"At first you read the premise of this, the first Miss Bindergarten picture book, and you find it a bit too much. Not only is this an alphabet book, not ONLY is this a getting-ready-for-school book, but this is also a learn your animals book. Not since Graham Base's, \\"Water Hole\\" has an author tried to do so much in a single item intended (after all) for the early reader set. And yet, remarkably, \\"Miss Bindergarten\\" is all these things and more. A rollicking raucous encapsulation of ALL the things a kindergarten teacher must do before a single one of her students has entered the room, the book's a pip. I mean, it's impossible to dislike this story. It's a fun read, a collection of truly charming illustrations, and a great way to introduce kids to the concept of school itself. For the child just beginning to learn away from home, this is an ideal gift or present.Our opening pages show a lovely border collie being woken at 6:00 in the morning by her peppy little cuckoo clock. With her pet cockatoo in tow we watch as Miss Bindergarten (for so she is) goes about her morning by washing her face, finding a lot pair of shoes and eating a bagel with the morning paper. Then she's off with a full trunk and a yawning cockatoo. In the meantime, various students in alphabetical order are getting ready for kindergarten in their own ways. \\"Adam Krupp wakes up. Brenda Heath brushes her teeth\\". Every once in a while we cut back to Miss Bindergarten who's tidying up a long abandoned schoolroom, frantically separating tinker toys, hanging mobiles, etc. As she does so it's difficult not to notice the post-it note stuck to her rear, and a forgotten price tag hanging from her blouse's collar. Time passes, more students come near, and in the end Miss Bindergarten's room is complete. \\"And - oh, oh, oh! - the fun's begun!\\". A helpful key at the end of the book shows that each student is an animal with the same first letter as his or her name. Therefore, reticent Ian is an iguana and cool Xavier is (believe it or not) a xenosaurus.Now author Joseph Slate has written a lovely story and I'm certainly inclined to give him kudos for that. But hats off, ladies and gentlemen, to illustrator Ashley Wolff. I've seen plenty of charming elementary school teachers in children's books (Mr. Slinger from \\"Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse\\", for example), but Miss Bindergarten has an air of authenticity about her that's hard to top. Sure, she's a border collie. But look at her corduroy jumper with the rainbow shirt beneath. Look at her Miss Frizzle-like crazy shoes and that necklace of bright wooden beads around her neck. Miss Bindergarten is so doggone (ho ho) realistic that I have a very difficult time not believing that she wasn't modeled on someone specific. Artist Wolff has crafted a sparkling series of unique illustrations, filled with important details and interesting sights. I mean, who can resist the picture that accompanies the line, \\"Fran Lister kisses her sister\\". Does Fran kiss a frog smaller to herself? No! She kisses a tadpole in a highchair wearing a bonnet. THAT is the mark of an illustrator who is paying careful attention to her characters, my friends. THAT is the mark of a wonderfully drawn book.Perhaps \\"Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready For Kindergarten\\"'s greatest accomplishment is that it really is a love letter to teachers everywhere. It shows just how hard they work, how much effort and joy goes into their jobs, and how much they care. Kids rarely get to see the behind-the-scenes toil and sweat that goes into their schooldays. \\"Miss Bindergarten\\" gives them that chance. It's a peppy wonderful book with great words and a rousing story. For a book that does so much, it's amazing that it's so little known. A class act through and through."},{"Title":"Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for Kindergarten (Miss Bindergarten Books)","review":"Miss Bindergarten, a dog wakes up and gets ready for her first day back to school. She packs her car and prepares to fix her gloomy classroom. Her pupils are getting ready for their first day of kindergarten. Each student (animals) has a rhyme to go with their activity: \\"Beaver Heath brushes her teeth\\" and \\"Ian Lowe says, \`I won't go' ''. Some are excited and some, such as Ian, are upset. Meanwhile, Miss Bindergarten has transformed her room into a bright rainbow of colors. Ashley Wolff does a wonderful job of illustrating this book. The illustrations are done in watercolor-and-gouache. Depicting the animals realistically, she captures excitement, dispear, and love in their facial expressions. Each animal looks incredibly life like, even though they are portrayed with some human characteristics. I think that it is important for children's books to illustrate animals realistically. If children look at books that show purple elephants and blue horses they will believe can be any color. This way the children will be better able to identify the animal when they see it again. The colors used in this book are very vibrant. Every page contains busy animals and curved text, they fill every available space."},{"Title":"Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for Kindergarten (Miss Bindergarten Books)","review":"My 4-year-old and I love this one, and it's also a painless alphabet lesson.

What follows is the typical Spenser plot: lots of funny dialogue, romantic interludes with Susan Silverman, and exciting action scenes with Hawk.PALE KINGS AND PRINCES isn't a great book, but it's very enjoyable and far better than the two Spenser novels that immediately preceded it (TAMING A SEA HORSE and A CATSKILL EAGLE). So if you enjoy Parker's writing style, I'm guessing you will find pleasure with this one.Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Pale Kings and Princes (A Spenser Novel)","review":"There's no use trying to use a Spenser novel to conjure or cajole the sandman. Similar to TAMING A SEA-HORSE (#13 Spenser); PALE KINGS AND PRINCES (# 14) kept me up a couple hours in the middle of the night, beyond a silly hope of returning to sleepiness through a short time of reading.PALE KINGS opened again with the standard realism of the detective doing his walk-alone-deal, accompanied by shiftless boredom and justifiable frustration. In this case, since the food in the rural community in which Spenser was detecting was so limp, and the clue extraction so dentally daunting, the private eye was able to drag/push himself through his solitary shuffles for only 1/4 of the plot before he called in Susan for a weekend visit of Salmon Loaf or Polish Platter at the Reservoir Court motel in Wheaton, Mass.I was intrigued with Parker's feature in this one of how an individual gets himself seen as such, as a person instead of a thing. His technique of having Spenser gradually thaw out Wheaton's finest citizenry seemed similar to me to his methods of drawing readers into Spenser's games. This time, those games were a town's economic rooting into Columbian Coca/Cocaine, and the class spits accompanying the resulting population stew in Wheaton. As usual, I was mesmerized with Spenser's repartee with criminal codgers, which in this case were the top-of-the-food-chain of Colombian Drug Lords. I was especially impressed with the way the P. I. humanized these guys into seeing him as a worthy person, actually more easily than he set the standard-of-his-humanity with Wheaton's police presence, barkeeps, waitresses, librarians, and regular Joe's.I wondered if that humanizing ability might be one of the mesmerizing character traits which has kept Spenser cozied within the reading hearts of so many faithful fans. Spenser dedicates himself to making everyone see him as a warm-bodied person, instead of as a bloodless character-stick in a plot of a novel.Especially in the first scene with Esteva, the Columbian King Pin, PALE KINGS solidified for me one of the main reasons for Spenser's appeal. He's real. Duh? He works on each person in his presence (including the reader), until that person sees him that way.I've noticed several times in this series (and more so in PALE KINGS), that exchanges between Spenser and his dialogue collections had him describing a person looking away, purposely not looking at him, until he wormed that person into his scene. Now I recall how often Spenser has noted the \\"covert looks\\" which Hawk draws out of people. Hawk, too, is real; his essence demands to be experienced as a person of potence as well as presence.Is this part of what charisma is, a person who sees himself as significant, and therefore causes others to see him that way; a person who won't quit radiating and/or badgering, focusing on others until they LOOK at HIM and SEE him? Maybe, charisma also involves a person like Spenser or Hawk actually SEEING everything they look at, which in turn causes the \\"objects\\" or persons of their observations to connect to them as human beings as well?Reading this novel began to congeal some of the illusive reasons I've searched for to explain my addiction to this detective novel series, especially since I've rarely been drawn, by natural preference (in the past), to read even the best examples of seriously authentic, male private eyes. Along with the mutual-personalization-syndrome noted above, and the mesmerizing ability of the literary style and perfectly-paced-plot drivers which keep me reading in the middle of the night; my addiction seems to involve the philosophical strands of golden threads which labyrinth through Spenser's sensual, sensitive, poetic soul. Each book I read brings up the question, \\"What key about life's purpose might I be surprised by in this one.\\"Yet, thankfully, the philosophical, psychological tapestries in the series do not diminish the dedicated dramatization of the basic detecting lifestyle, with its normal daily routines which are often uncomfortable, deprivation-intense, soul-leechingly boring, and inconvenient ... 90% of the time ... with the other 10% being \\"hairy\\" with high risk of deadly harm. In this case, the snow-challenged, dangerous denouement scenes in PALE KINGS were unusually complex and hairy, with Hawk, Susan, Caroline, Juanita, and Lundquist (a fantasticly heroic character) adding race, gender, color, Cause, and Creed to Spenser's righting of wrongs, during which we're privy to mesmerizing details of the process of a psychologist (Susan) doing a therapy catharsis.Another part of Spenser which I came to understand more precisely here (and which I usually welcome with a whoosh of relief) was Spenser's clean means of sidestepping any character's effort to draw him away from true issues in percolation, into potential-black-hole-passions of politically correct causes. As usual, he sidestepped abruptly and adeptly, without dismissing or undermining the actual values in those causes.Yeah, I suppose Spenser has it all, at least all that I require to continue following a pair of footsteps, in a process somewhat like a P.I. trailing a suspect or a clue.Sometimes, I do have one.Linda Shelnutt"},{"Title":"Pale Kings and Princes (A Spenser Novel)","review":"There are presently, as I write this review, two sellers listed for this item, and I am addressing the seller, superbooksdeal.

It is also a very fast read and there is never a lull in the action of the book.

Sometimes I found some of the events in this book to be a little farfetched but that is what I love about these books and the stories Parker brings to us. He is a great storyteller and if you have never read one of his books do so now.

Valdez's assignment was to get to the bottom of the cocaine trade in Wheaton, Massachusetts, but the town is owned by the Columbians, including the police force. So Spenser does what he does best. He parks himself in town and asks questions until he annoys enough people and something shakes loose.I read this book years ago and just re-read it. I think it stands up well. I've always liked the Spenser series because of it's dialog between Spenser and Hawk. Actually the dialog between Spenser and whoever he's talking to always crackles. I also like the fact that the story makes sense. Many mystery/crime novels today depend on the serial killer schtick but to me Parker's mysteries are always grounded on something believable. Cocaine trade in Wheaton, Massachusetts? Might seem ridiculous at first but after it's explained it makes perfect sense. It could happen that way and the story that follows also could have happened that way.Anyway, like all of the Spenser series I enjoyed it and recommend it.

When Spenser starts asking around, he finds that no one knows nothing and that the police seem to be spectacularly unhelpful - and they, especially, seem to want him gone. They insist that Valdez's murder was due to his sexual peccadilloes and nothing else, pointing to the bodily mutilation as proof.Of course, when people want Spenser gone - or when they want him to quit asking questions - that just makes him stick around and ask more questions.When first the sheriff and then the sheriff's son are murdered - after Spenser catches the son smuggling cocaine, apparently for the town's biggest produce warehouser, named Felipe Esteva - the action begins to really heat up.Was Eric Valdez killed because he was getting too close to the truth about the drug trade in Wheaton? Or because he was having an affair with the wrong woman? Why were the sheriff and his son killed?This was a multi-layered and very satisfying book.

The owner of the paper the reporter worked for hires Spenser to investigate the murder. He goes to Wheaton and gets nowhere at the start. Local police are obviously being bought off and when he asks questions the universal response is \\"nobody saw nothin.\\" It is obvious who the drug lord is, so in an attempt to move his investigation forward, Spenser hijacks a major cocaine shipment. The son of the police chief was driving the rig, so his actions are of interest to more than just the drug dealers. Spenser then goes to the kingpin and offers to sell the cocaine back to him.After the police chief and his son are both killed, Spenser befriends the grieving widow and enlists Susan to help her cope with her losses. Hawk is also recruited to help even the odds against Spenser. There is a final battle with Spenser, Hawk and an honest state trooper on one side and the drug dealers with their corrupted cops on the other. In an interesting twist, Hawk has a battle with a man (Cesar) that clearly was his physical superior, had he not held a small gun inside a mitten on his hand and shot first, Cesar would have killed him with his bare hands.Once again, Spenser wisecracks his way through danger and remains noble in the completion of his job. When the drug lord kills the son of the police chief after Spenser hijacks the cocaine shipment, Spenser personally confronts his mother and only Susan can console him. She makes him understand that it truly was not his fault that the boy was involved in trafficking drugs and she will do what she can to help the woman. In terms of action and intrigue, this book doesn't have as many exciting moments as other Spenser novels. However, the dialog is excellent as always, which is why it still deserves four stars."},{"Title":"Pale Kings and Princes (A Spenser Novel)","review":"I thought this book, like other Spenser books I have read or listened to was well worth the time. Parker has a definite knack for keeping you entertained. Admittedly I liked Playmates and Widening Gyre a little better, I would not pass on this book at all. Having read the other reviews I am anxious to get into more Spenser novels because if this one is middle of the road, then I can't wait for the others. The story centers around the murder of a journalist investigating a small town in Massachussetts that seems to be the cocaine depot of the northeast. Parker's storytelling and Spenser's keen wit make it a quick read."},{"Title":"Pale Kings and Princes (A Spenser Novel)","review":"This is not a spectacular book but a solid one. It took me over 2 decades(!!) to acquire a taste for Spenser but am now caught. Drug trafficking is almost a McGuffin in this book about drugs but also about dedication, honorability, pursuit of truth, corruption, and painful tragedy. Parker does not write easy books, but, as far as I have read him, does not write bad books, either. Solid and entertaining."},{"Title":"Pale Kings and Princes (A Spenser Novel)","review":"Requested by a newspaper to investigate the death of a reporter, Spenser heads to Wheaton, Massachusetts where he finds cocaine, police corruption, further deaths, and illicit behavior. Using his method of annoying people and investigating various hints of problems, Spenser unearths a level of criminal activity that is ultimately connected to local law enforcement. Eventually bringing in Hawk for some muscle, and Susan for psychological insights and therapy, Spenser is able to end the problems in the town and put a stop to the drug trafficking. Along the way we find an extramarital affair, a drug lord using local law enforcement, two more murders, and finally a level of violence not unlike the battle of the OK Corral.Robert Parker's smooth prose, terse dialog, and concise descriptions shine forth throughout the story, demonstrating his no nonsense approach to fiction. The style is gold without ornaments, and the architecture is functional, solid, without frivolity or unnecessary frills. This makes the story move quickly, giving the reader the facts and not cluttering up the purpose with excessive platitudes or sideline stories. Spenser's odd brand of moral values dictates the book's ending, and his own desire to protect the weak but destroy the powerful once again reigns victorious.Yet, in spite of the solid plot and carefully crafted story, the book has a predictable quality to it. We know the drug lord will be killed, we know Hawk will shoot some bad guys, we know the corrupt officers will receive their just deserts, and we know the widow will be given a chance deal with her grief and to start over. In addition, the book reads like a television episode with everything be resolved at the end. A good read, but not great, and a solid book for those interested in the detective genre."},{"Title":"Pale Kings and Princes (A Spenser Novel)","review":"I read all of PARKER'S books & enjoy them all. Ilove the short chapters & subtle humor. I knew Robert & his books remind me of him."},{"Title":"Pale Kings and Princes (A Spenser Novel)","review":"I am making my way through the entire Spenser series in order. It is great. I would reccomend them to anyone who loves the detective novels. They are wonderful."},{"Title":"Pale Kings and Princes (A Spenser Novel)","review":"I reccomend almost any Spenser novel to the uninitiated. Like goood wine, however, they can be habit forming! I'm addicted to the quick wit and sarcasam employed by Spenser. You will never learn much from a Spenser story but you will never get bored either and time, though short, will burn away rapidly.If you like Boston and environs geography, sharp repartee, clever wit, and enjoyable characters you will enjoy almost any Spenser story."},{"Title":"The Theory of Everything","review":"This book is an easy read and very addicting. The complaint I've received from people I've passed it too, is &quot; I got no sleep last night because I was up reading that book&quot; It's about a young physicist that completes his lifes work at 30 and doesn't know where to go from there. Then his mother (who abandoned him and his father at age 8 after winning the lottery, reappears in his life. She uses a young palm reader as a go between and gets him involved with alchemy. It's a somewhat different book but it leaves you actually looking for the meaning of life and the theroy of everything. Wonderful. Ms. Grunwald please write another one."},{"Title":"The Grammar of Fantasy: An Introduction to the Art of Inventing Stories","review":"This Italian classic is a marvelous exploration of the worlds of creativity and imagination. The author's profound understanding of the child's unspoiled imagination shines through these collected reflections on the art of inventing stories. The book includes dozens of exercises designed to inspire the creation of stories and, ultimately, to foster a love for language and storytelling. Rodari shows teachers how to stir young imaginations by building on simple words, phrases, and rhymes; juxtaposing seemingly unrelated words and images; creating &quot;what if&quot; scenarios; rewriting popular folk tales; speculating on &quot;what happens next&quot;; using toys and puppets as props; drawing comic books; and so on. Analyzing the essential nature of stories, jokes, riddles, and poetry, Rodari delves deep into the mysterious heart of the creative process and vividly illuminates it for the reader. This book is a must-read for teachers of literature and for anyone who has ever marveled at the art of the storyteller."},{"Title":"The Grammar of Fantasy: An Introduction to the Art of Inventing Stories","review":"I wish every teacher would try to exercise their imagination and art of fantasy. This book is a nice example of very talented storyteller sharing his fantastic craft."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This book is just as informative as it seemed from the other reviews.

It only now occur to me what is Andrew Loomis was trying to do. Only now I see the brilliant in this master of drawing.

He says he has picked up some nice shading techniques and tricks from this book"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This is my most treasured drawing book and hands down the best on figure drawing there is. I've dropped plenty of coin on online figure drawing courses and anatomy books, but I'd trade every bit of it for this one book. Andrew Loomis is the master and an excellent instructor. Just reading the first few pages you will be inspired to improve and stick with it.I've had a poor-quality PDF of the original printing for several years, but it's SO much better now having a hardcover. For one, it's oversized, which is much easier to read and study Loomis's sketches. Two, having full spreads of the pages is much easier to absorb and work from.I also have Loomis'sDrawing the Head and Hands, which is equally good, but this one is the essential."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This book is wonderful! Loomis takes the time to explain and reveal the techniques that are important to understanding how to draw and create a realistic rendering of the human body.

At 70 years plus, I'm still going to school to increase my knowledge.This book has helped me in my figure drawing class which in turn is helping me prepare for my next semesters class on sculpting thehuman figure in clay.Great reference book and well worth the price."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"Length:: 1:21 MinsI never thought I would be able to see or own an actual copy of this book, ever.Thanks to Titan Books, this book is finally getting reprinted. The wait is over.The production quality of the book is excellent. It's a 208-page hardcover that's slightly larger than A4 size. The drawings are reproduced very clearly. If you've seen the PDF copies that are floating on the internet, this is exactly that except in physical copy, right down to the number of words per line.I love the text of the book. The tone is very encouraging and the instructions are always clear. The examples are beautifully illustrated. It's easy to follow along and learn.This is a highly recommended book on figure drawing, a classic that gets mentioned frequently."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"I wish there were 10 stars.Having stood the test of time, it was first published in the 30's, this book teaches you all that is there to figure drawing.Andrew Loomis is one of those rare, gifted artists who can articulate as clearly and truthfully using words as he could with lines.Using very simple tools to define the structure of the human body, essentially the skeleton as the foundation, he teaches how fantastically easy it is to draw the human body from any angle, in any action, and of any type.This is not one of those 'feel good' books that teaches you to do 'yet another thing'. This is a grand text. absolutely dedicated work, you can see the earnestness in Loomis' anxious words about getting across the details to the reader.Kimon's 'Natural Way to Draw' is a classic in a different way, where he asks us to discover almost everything. Loomis gives us the crutches. I think a combination of these two approaches can be terrific. thats what I am finding out.It has been very fullfilling , since I can pick up the artifacts of drawing the figure, and infact drawing anything for that matter, Loomis will lead you to explore and expand, the techniques are amazingly simple, yet absolutely powerful.He reiterates to see the structure beneath anything, the skeleton, and how it aids us in construction.Note: the book is out of print, but several online versions are scattered across the Net."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This book left me speechless. There's not enough stars in the ratings for me to express to you just how great this book is. And the strange thing is, no matter in which branch of art you work, you'll feel as though Andrew Loomis wrote this book just for you.If you're serious about your art, be you illustrator, comic book artist, animator, fashion designer, or even a games designer, you need to have this book in your library. The text and illustration work together to take you on an odyssey of discovery, a thousand and one techniques that will make your life easier, and your art so much better.The original was printed in 1943 and has come to be recognised as the bible of figure artists. Although it's out of print now, you can still find a number of great condition reprints. Get one! Keep it by the drawing board and you'll never again be stuck on how to draw a figure, work with horizon lines, and place figures in space so that they relate perfectly to each other and their surroundings.Ignore the price and get one ASAP. Don't eat for a couple of weeks if needs be, but acquire a copy of this book as soon as you find one.I'm off to read mine now. You guys don't know what you're missing!"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"As probably many others who purchased this book I was working off of the PDFs that are readily available online. When I saw they were reproducing this book I immediately pre-ordered and was anticipating the date it would ship. When it arrived I was blown away by the quality and how good it felt in my hands. I am not one to buy a book just to display, but this is one beautifully crafted book. As others mentioned it is worth every penny and so much more, especially to those of us who have never actually seen the original and are working off of scrapped together PDFs."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"Andrew Loomis books are highly recommended by so many professional artists, and now we have one of his most famous books back in print! The book is large enough to give excellent full page spreads of Loomis' beautiful artwork and very helpful writings, yet it's not too big that it's uncomfortable to sit down and read through. I highly recommend this to any mature aspiring artist and even if you're already a pro, this is still a necessary book for your collection."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"Everybody that does or aspires to draw the human figure from imagination, not particularly from live study, should run, not walk, to get this book. A long time secret classic for people working with cartoons, concept art, character design and so forth. If you think you are covered because you got Burne Hogarth's books on the human figure, think again. Not to dis Hogarth, but this one is the real thing."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"I have copies that instructor's have given me and I've downloaded the PDFs. But nothing beats this book. The quality of the book is great. This book is a classic. I'm glad they've reprinted it."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This is possibly the best illustrator reference book I've found for drawing the figure from multiple camera angles. There aren't that many books out there covering bird's eye and worm's eye planar vantage points with human examples, but finally this classic explores this area with excellence. Be aware that Loomis's book is an illustration book and not so much an anatomy book, although the drawings and muscles definition are top notch. This book should be absolute core reference material for all aspiring comic book artists. It's huge book, with tons of great drawings, classic models and quality information."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"One of the finest books ever produced on the subject of figure drawing. This book should be in every artists library. Mr. Loomis covers areas of study that many drawing books fail at. His easy to understand writing and diagrams are exceptional. Just the chapter on figure perspective is worth the price. For the artist knowledge and application is the key to a successful creative career. Wisdom has become hard to find in our schools today and accrued knowledge seems to be fading fast. This book has a vast amount of information that will, with application, help any artist to develop their skills to a degree that would otherwise take years of searching fruitlessly. Buy this book, read it thoroughly several times and then draw every diagram until you fully understand the concepts and you will improve. Two more of this great teachers books are going to be reprinted soon and they are just as helpful to artistic development. Mr. Loomis is a master artist and teacher. His contributions to the art world should be in every school library. These are great books and they should never again be ignored. Keep them in print."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"What a great book. I read somewhere this book is the ultimate authority on figure drawing. I was intrigued so I bought it, since I need to learn how to draw people.When I got the package, I was already expecting \\"the ultimate authority\\" in terms of content. I was definitely not disappointed, but more so, the book blew me away! Andrew Loomis was absolutely amazing! The book teaches you everything you need to draw people, including skeletal structure and muscles! Well written, too.The only thing this book does not focus on enough is the face and hands, but there's another book devoted to that by Loomis. I'm still waiting for that one to be released... somewhere in October 2011, if I remember correctly.Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"Even after over 60 years, no one has fashioned a better book on figure drawing for the illustrator than this one. The methods are practical and easy to follow, and even though it was written generations ago, most of the advice to aspiring and working professionals is as useful today as it was then. You simply can't go wrong with this book!"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"Best reference book I have ever come across, definitely worth the money. It's beautifully put together and I've found it to be very helpful!"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"At first glance you may chuckle at the 1940's hair styles and nude women in pumps. However, Andrew Loomis's books give easy to follow steps for drawing the human figure on it's own or in an environment with perspective. The illustrations are very good and easy to read. I use his examples as handouts in my figure drawing classes."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This Classic was published back in the Golden Age of drawing. When sketching was an art form approached like painting, and all commercial art was hand-drafted with mechanical, photo-realistic precision; this book a guide made to help young artists climb their way into that elevated world.Andrew Loomis had a heavy hand influencing art in the second half of the 20th Century. In this book you will see the seeds that influenced both Frank Frazetta (perhaps the most significant American fantasy painter), and Alex Ross (without question the most noted Comic Book Art painter). The style is incredibly distinctive, you can't help but notice it. When you read this book, you'll look at a posture, or a manner of shading, and say to yourself, \\"So THAT'S where that \\"look\\" came from.\\" The purchase is worth it for that alone.Art students and hobbyists have been after used editions of this book for years, until they have all but vanished from the market. Copies in good condition were hoarded like gold bars and gently examined before tucking away in a safe place -probably for posterity.This faithful reprint is an artist's dream. I can't wait for mine to arrive."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This is a wonderful new edition of Loomis's classic work. It's a very high quality book and it seems (as far as I can tell) to exactly match the original. I can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"I have a 1947 vintage edition of this book that used to be my mother's (she was a talented commercial illustrator who died from cancer when I was a teenager). So I've had this book for 40yrs, and in all that time of adding to my library of artistic books, I've never found a better general reference for learning to draw figures (though Willy Pogany's 'Drawing Lessons' book of 1946 comes pretty close). It has excellent sections on the basics of perspective, light and shade, anatomy, proportion and composition, and the examples of Loomis's pencil craft and penmanship are superb.Now granted, this is an old book, entirely in black and white, stylistically mannered and from the point of view of a realist illustrator of a bygone era, rather than a of a fine artist (for whom the drawings might lack some degree of artistic expressionism or abstraction), but it is nevertheless, one of the finest books available on the subject of figurative drawing; even after all this time.I value it so highly, I've just bought a second copy so that when I eventually disappear, my two artistically oriented kids won't have to fight over this particular part of my library."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"So I purchased this book after reading Mythology: The DC Comics Arts of Alex Ross in which i discovered that Alex Ross studied Andrew Loomis' book in order to improve both his shading and anatomy. The book arrived on time. I've never purchased an art book before but I was surprised to find out just how easy it was to follow. From learning about shading and how it applies to the human figure to creating form and learning how to apply it on a live model this book was truly a guide into anatomy drawing. I am currently in my first anatomy class and to my surprise my teacher uses a lot of the measurements and technique that Loomis set for the reader. The book was written in the era of commercial art so Loomis refers to it a lot in the book but regardless it helps to understand how he came up with the ideas that he shares and wants to the reader to apply to his own art style. Loomis does a great job in guiding the reader instead of commanding him/ her about techniques or tips. I would recommend this book to anybody who is starting to get into figure drawing or who wants to improve their art, overall."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"Really, anyone that is in the art and drawing market knows that Andrew Loomis is just the master. I'd recommend this book to anyone that is struggling with figure drawing, or starting out drawing. He's kind of easy to follow, but he's not so easy that more advanced artists will get bored working with this book and other Andrew Loomis teachings as well. Sometimes I find it gets a little complicated, especially when it comes to learning planes, and such, but if you want to get good at drawing, Loomis is one of the teachers to study."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"great book. highly would recommend for anyone interested in art. just what i needed for my class. condition great too!"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"Andrew Loomis has a great heart and spirit when it comes to art and life.

I gave it as a gift, it's a full size hardback reprint. My son, the artist, loved it. These reprints are the best ones I've ever seen."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"A friend of mine at work swears by this, and we've been working with this book together for several weeks now, giving ourselves homework assignments and copying the drawings.Andrew Loomis was truly a master of figure drawing, but more importantly, he was a fantastic teacher. I've bought many books on drawing, from many talented artists, but as it turns out, that's not all that it takes to be a good teacher. Mr. Loomis is clear and concise with his language. His step-by-step approach is simple, easy to understand, and well-illustrated.I am an advanced artist in many respects, but reading this book is refreshing, and has proven very helpful in re-structuring and rebuilding my figure-drawing fundamentals. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"very useful for this non artist trying to learn figure drawing basics.

Loomis has a style that may seem dated, but that's irrelevant. What's important is the information Loomis gives. If you wish to learn the figure, couple this with Bridgman, Bammes, and Vanderpoel and maybe a good anatomy book and that's all you need. This is information that has been lost to art education for a very long time. I'm excited to see them reprint all of Loomis' books."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This book is more of a high intermediate to advanced level book in which Loomis shows you a somewhat elaborate construction process to building the figure primarily from life. He really misses the gesture + building form portions which are the most important, with the exception of passively mentioning in a couple sentences that its important you 'feel' it.All the Loomis books I feel are purely mechanical in nature with the exception of Fun With a Pencil. If you really need to refine your mechanics AFTER you've acquired the natural element to drawing this text is very valuable. Examples of beginner texts include the Vilppu Drawing Manual, Nicolaides' Natural Way to Draw, and Edwards' Drawing on The Right Side of the Brain. In order to do drawing you need core elements like a scaling element, feeling/ building form element, etc. which all the above mentioned texts are best in giving."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"I aquired mine thru an exboyfriends great aunt that was an artist. (7th printing Jan. 1945)The sections on basic construction all the way thru shading, perspective, muscle structure, are all great!

I highly recommend it, if you can find reprints, I suggest getting one!"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This is one of the finest books on drawing I have ever read. It is a shame it is out of print. The section on how to construct a human figure without a model alone is worth the price of the book. Loomis is a past master (but the females do wear heels for some odd reason. It was the fifties, go figure!) Get a copy if at all possible."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This is an old book; the figures often wear outmoded hairstyles, the female nudes often are decked out in t-strap heels (who knows why?). Forget that, you won't care. This is arguably the best all-encompassing handbook on how to draw people ever!! It covers scale of figures, perspective, the figure in almost any position, anatomy, children, separate sections on hands and faces, and even the effects of clothing on the figure. Written with a practical but light hand and occasional humour, there is simply nothing like this book. If you could only have one book on how to draw ANYTHING, never mind the human figure, this would be the book to buy"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"If you are a beginner, like myself, who wants to be able to draw humans from scratch without reference (or tracing) this is the book. Its much more then just figure drawing, it deals a great deal with how work should be approached, right attitude, and sets you in a right direction. Section on perspective is simply the best i have seen. As far as i hear every comic book pro recommends it as a must. Its worth every single penny."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"I know Peter, Bjorn and John don't care about the young folks, but I am exceedingly (superlative worthy!) glad that Loomis books are available once again. I had previously printed the PDF's floating around out there and put them in a binder.I have read reviews complaining about Loomis' style (which is great), saying it catered to a specific ideal. To that I say: BAH! Any aesthetic ideal can be used in conjunction with the principles Loomis teaches. His style is not only wonderful, but also meaningless. This isn't a book about how to draw like Loomis. It is a book containing powerful illustrative methods that can be utilized in illustrating a wide variety of figures.I love this book."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"This is a great book on several different levels. As a guide to drawing the human figure, it is unsurpassed and contains formulas, tricks and theories that would help anyone who wants to learn how to draw people. As a piece of nostalgia, the text is interesting because this book was written in the 1940s for commercial artists. In particular, the \\"ad layout man\\" who had to know how to draw people for comp work.As for myself, I bought the book to help in the life drawing class I'm taking. If you're involved in figure drawing, this book is a must have."},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"I wish I would have had this book back in college when I took figure drawing. The lessons that Loomis teaches here are timeless and invaluable. I have owned and read a LOT of books on the figure, but once this arrived and I began reading it, I gave all my other books away the next day. The only other books on the figure that are worth owning are by Michael Hampton and George Bridgman. But, if you could only buy one book on the figure, this is it!"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"I had only recently heard of this book or author before I decided to purchase it. I am on the verge of anger that none of my art teachers in the past seemed to know of it. This would have been a life changing book for me as an art student since it took me decades to find stacks of books covering this material. Here it has been for half a century in one volume!All art students should have a copy of this in their libraries.My one cricizism is the use of the 5'8\\" female as an ideal. In the 1950's 5'8\\" was considered tall for a woman. Today it is still above average. The reason for the objection is that the proportion for this height is different than for average height.If you are studying art, get this book!"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"For artists, this is the single best figure drawing book ever produced. We had to use bootleg photocopied versions of it when I was back in art school in the early 90s, so I am VERY glad to see that it is now back in print. This is an excellent resource for comic book artists, illustrators, concept artists, storyboard artists and anyone else with the word \\"artist\\" in their title. Buy it now. DO IT!"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"...and it's an intermediate-level classic! As I understand it, this book went out of print sometime during the 1980's- which was before my time in art school and before the Internet came into popular use. A number of my art instructors had recommended this book, yet at that time I couldn't get my hands on a copy. Now that the Internet is up and running (thanks!), word has spread pretty quickly, and you'd think it wouldn't be hard to keep this thing in print. Many professionals *today* cite this book as being an inspiration in their work. It's 9\\" x 12\\" and 204 pages- which is very different looking than his slim & tall Walter Foster collections. Its content is similar to Willy Pogany's The Art of Drawing, and Jack Hamm's excellent Drawing the Head and Figure- very much a classic, mid-20th century style. In any case, this is an *intermediate-level effort* on drawing figures from memory & life, geared towards people aspiring to a career in professional illustration. Included within is his famous *ball/sphere-based* method of head construction, but it's in an abbreviated form here- His Heads collection for Walter Foster really does a *much* better, in-depth job of covering this particular area. Still, Loomis here shows how all figures can be constructed using simplified forms & shapes- He constantly emphasizes how these figures can be placed in perspective, and then rendered to a professional degree. He's very three dimensional in his approach, yet his drawings are mainly realistic looking. This is in great contrast to Burne Hogarth's excellent style, which is also very three dimensional- yet the drawings in Dynamic Figure Drawing are highly stylized in exaggerated 3-D, for exceedingly precise understanding of foreshortening. Loomis' work is *far* more natural & direct; it's especially great for life drawing and commercial illustration- definitely worth considering! P.S.

That's a HUGE step from the sketch to the detailed drawing!!! Many so-called figure drawing instructional books are simply portfolios of the author's artwork with very little instruction. Tsk.Loomis is different. He goes through all the intermediate steps you need to draw a figure. You learn to draw \\"manikins\\" from your imagination, with body parts in the proper proportions, and in all kinds of poses. He also teaches you how to draw the figure in perspective. Once you master that, he covers all the anatomy you need to know in order to create realistic figures. Finally with all that mastered, he covers clothing & shading the figure (value) along with how to draw some of the more complex body parts like heads, hands, and feet.As a professor I can state confidently that the step-by-step teaching approach in this book is the best that you can find, outside of maybe taking a class. But even most figure drawing classes don't cover the material in this book!To summarize you learn the fundamentals of drawing figures: proportion, anatomy, perspective, values, color, and knowledge of mediums and materials. The only drawback for today's students (who I find mainly want to draw Manga and Anime-style characters) is that the drawing style is dated. But if you master the fundamentals in this book you can easily adapt them to other genres.- Professor F., past-Director of UNM's Interdisciplinary Film & Digital Media Program"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","review":"Andrew Loomis is the last word in figure drawing.

The alphabetization of phrases is particularly helpful, as it made it very easy to quickly look up the phrase I needed, rather than scouring through the \\"categories\\" system that many phrasebooks seem to utilize. The first section of the book provides a very basic little grammar primer and also a section on other language basics, like numbers, months, times, dates, and the most basic phrases (hello, excuse me, I didn't understand, etc.). At the end you'll find a list of colloquialisms, a \\"reverse-lookup\\" section from romanized Japanese to English for phrases you might hear, and a second reverse-lookup from kanji to English for common signs/words you might encounter in your travels (train station, entrance, ticket office). Finally, the book ends with a reverse-lookup *food* section from kanji to English, for reading menus.Phrases are provided not just with romanized pronunciation but also in kanji, which is *tremendously* helpful -- as you can point out the phrase to a Japanese speaker if the two of you are having difficulty understanding each other. The book is definitely geared towards tourists and travellers, but offered a broader range of phrases and vocabulary than I expected (the word for \\"suntanned\\"? phrases for getting a haircut?). Sprinkled throughout are various minor cultural & travel notes, such as typical bank hours, notes on major holidays, descriptions of the different kinds of payphones you might encounter, drinking etiquette, etc.All this, and it can be tucked into your back pocket! Crazy! The book is compact, but I personally found the layout & type-size quite easy to read -- particularly as the translations next to each phrase are printed in green ink, so they stand out from the word you're looking up. I did find that while the mini dialogue boxes were helpful in familiarizing myself with particular basic conversation constructions, they were often placed in not necessarily instinctive spots in the glossary (for instance, a dialogue about whether a hotel has a single room for the night & how much it costs was in the \\"n\\" section -- presumably for \\"night\\").It's not going to make you fluent by any means (and if you think a mini phrasebook can do that for you, more power to you!), but it is a marvelous little tool for getting around, particularly with a little studying behind you. I took a few basic phrases gained from beginning Pimsleur lessons and this little phrasebook with me on a three-week trip to Japan, and was able to communicate the necessities throughout -- often with hilarious results, as my conversational partner and I came to an understanding through trading one or two word exchanges and clumsily constructed sentences in each other's language. Highly recommended, and well worth the $6 or so it will run you."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Japanese Dictionary Phrasebook 2 (Rough Guide Phrasebooks) (Japanese and English Edition)","review":"I took this to an immersion camp having had absolutely no Japanese before arrival, and found it more useful than my dictionary. As Japanese sentence structure is not so intuitive (to native English-speakers), the included phrases are a must to understand how words and particles fit into sentences.

The grammar section and culture notes are also helpful. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who has never studied Japanese before, and needs a dictionary that will help you make sentences."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Let me first say that there is much to love here. Truly! The first fifty or so pages felt interminable, but once past that point the book becomes a veritable page turner.Eliot crafts a fascinating, first-rate historical fiction plot based in Florence, Italy, from the death of Lorenzo de' Medici (in 1492), through the time of Savonarola's influence, and culminating in an epilogue placed in 1509. In the midst of this tumultuous social situation is placed our heroine, Romola. The daughter of a scholar, Romola herself is very well educated for a woman of her time. This novel follows Romola through six complex post-de'Medici years of Florentine politics, further inflamed by the preachings of Savonarola, a Dominican friar. As the plot swells in complexity, the gentle woman transitions from being her father's daughter, to her husband's wife, to a woman meeting life head on with a dignity of her own merit. Possessed of a fast moving, labyrinthine plot, this novel, despite its length of just over 600 pages, keeps up a taut pace until the very end.As might be expected in a novel named after a character, this one, despite the enticing plot, is very rooted in its performers. Romola is a central figure, but by no means the only one. Eliot pulls some of her players direct from the history books and some from her imagination, but each and every one of them feels so genuine that it is difficult to know which really lived and breathed and which only ever lived within her pages. This is the type of book that has you googling purely imaginative personages-because they are portrayed with such authenticity.Florence of the late fifteenth century is very well depicted: the pageantry of her holidays (including a fantastic description of Savonarola's Bonfire of the Vanities); the dress, habits, and occupations of her various classes; and the architectural details of her stone edifices. As you wander the streets with the novel's inhabitants you are drawn into her neighborhoods, with their chaos, aromas, and idiosyncrasies.So why a relatively low three star rating? Because the prose is so dense that it left me wallowing somewhere between philosophy text and nineteenth century history tome. For some reason, I had to work exceptionally hard to remain focused on reading the words themselves and concentrate with that little bit of extra grey matter to wrap my mind around what exactly was being expressed. Was it worth it? Well, yes, as my clear admiration for the book's merits shows; however, I can not say that I \\"really liked\\" (four stars) or \\"loved\\" (five stars) a book which required so much effort. So, three stars, a simple \\"liked\\" verdict, it is for this work. This is definitely not a book for someone unused to literature of the Victorian era, as, in my opinion, this novel is some of the least accessible writing from that time frame."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"&#34;Romola&#34; is a good novel by a great and supremely intelligent novelist. The Renaissance Italy background is fascinating. Though not Eliot's greatest novel - that would be &#34;Middlemarch&#34; - &#34;Romola&#34; is extremely rewarding."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was engrossing and, of course, very well-written. I'm even inspired to find out more about a historical period that's not really one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was published in \\"The Cornhill\\" magazine in 14 parts from July 1862 to August 1863. It is George Eliot's foray into the realm of historical fiction made popular by the earlier novels of Sir Walter Scott. Eliot is a great English novelists known for such classics as Adam Bede; The Mill on the Floss; Felix Holt; Middlemarch (her masterpiece), Scenes of Clerical Life and Daniel Deronda. Romala is the only novel she wrote not set in the British Isles. It is her least popular and known work though she considered it her favorite. The book is lengthy and intricate in its recounting of the life of the title heroine Romola in fifteenth century Florence. The major players are:Romola Bardi: She is the idealistic daughter of a blind scholar Bardo de Bardi. She falls in love with the young and amoral Tito Melema a Greek who has arrived in Florence. Tito is the assistant to Bardo in the latter's classical studies. Tito sells the precious classical library of Bardo. Tito's selfish character is revealed to Romola who leaves Florence for a short time in utter despair. Savanarola persuades her to return to the city.Tito also betrays Bernado del Nero one of five men executed by the government. Bernado is the godfather of Romola and dies before her eyes in a gruesome beheading. Romola learns that Tito was instrumental in the arrest and death of del Nero. Romola becomes a supporter of Savanrola as she ministers to the poor. She also learns of his adultery.Tito Melema: Handsome husband of Romola who has a second family with the poor girl Tess. (she has two children by Tito). Tito is a schemer and adulterer who is ambitious for fame and fortune. He has stolen money and abandoned to slavery his stepfather Baldassarri. Baldassarri tracks down Tito with murder in his heart. Baldassari reveals the deep and sinful past of Tito to Romola.I do not agree that the characters in this novel are flat. Villains like Tito and Baldassarri are well drawn as is Romala. Eliot was the first great psychological novelist in English influencing such writers as Henry James.Savanorola is the real life religious reformer who seeks to clean up decadent Florence. He is famous for the bonfire of vanities in which Florentines threw away many luxury items in an effort to become more faithful to God. The reformer was burned at the stake in 1498.The City of Florence is a character during these turbulent times. Pietro de Medic the ruler of Florence has died and the French army under Charles VIII has become an occupying power. The League of Venice declares war on the French and Florentines. Hunger and plague run rampant through the streets of Florence on the Arno River. The political machinations are hard to follow. Machiavelli the real life author of \\"The Prince\\": appears in the book.The novel concludes with the death of Savanarola and Tito. Romola has taken Tessa and her two children under her wing. Romola, like George Eliot, is a kind woman who learns the secret to life is helping others as a good samaritan. She has emerged from her personal tragedies to become a wonderful woman. The Penguin edition contains a definition of many Italian words and phrases used in Romola, textual emendations made to the manuscript and an incisive and helpful introduction. Penguins are the best paperbacks for classics!George Eliot and her lover George Henry Lewes did a great deal of on site research in Florence; read deeply in the politics of the Renaissance era and put that knowledge to work in Romola. The book is a classic which tells a fascinating story. Like all of George Eliot's works it is a gem in the literary crown of the author. Romola is hard reading but the story is compellinig and it is worth your time and effort."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola is constantly called Eliot's weakest novel, with even serious critics reluctant to praise it. However, it was seen in the 19th century as Eliot's masterpiece. Some of the blame for the novel going out of fashion must rest with F.R. Leavis who said that &quot;few will want to read Romola a second time, and few can ever have got through it once without some groans.&quot; If Leavis, viewed as one of the great literary minds, thinks this, then more average readers like us are bound to be put off.True, the start of Romola is bogged down in detail, but it is introduced by a wonderful, stirring and majestic 'Proem' which sees the Angel of the Dawn sweeping across the Earth and loftily states how humanity is the same now as it was when Romola is set. After this, the notes are best ignored - consult them separately, and concentrate on getting into the book. It is a stirring and sometimes hard read, and moves one with awe at what Eliot has created - you really feel you are experiencing Florence in the 15th century. There is one scene that stands out for me - the haunting and almost surreal episode where Romola drifts by boat to an apparent coastal haven. Images of peace and life are reversed disturbingly.So ignore Leavis and the dissenters. If you've read another Eliot, you'll like it. If you haven't, maybe start with something else, but come back, for it's a rewarding read"},{"Title":"Romola","review":"George Eliot spent two years preparing &quot;Romola&quot;, and the result is a rich, densely detailed &quot;Tale of the Renaissance&quot;. Never a facile writer, here she is concerned with one of the most intellectually challenging (not to mention politically complicated) periods in history; and she paints the panoply and power struggles as a background for the personal tragedy which is the novel's crux. While not an &quot;easy read&quot; in the Sir Walter Scott sense, &quot;Romola&quot; presents in sumptous detail the banquets, the festivities, and the famous bonfire of vanities that one associates with late 15th Century Florence.But from a purely literary viewpoint, the most important thing about the book is its delineation of Tito Melema, the young man who in the opening chapters is the story's hero, but slowly, irrevocably becomes its villain. Neither Sir Walter nor Charles Dickens has psychological insight (in the modern sense) as sharp as George Eliot's, and this study of a fictional character's downfall is one of the most stunning depictions of corruption in English literature. That he is the husband of the heroine, a sensitive, finely sensual woman, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. Scenes involving historical characters (including Savonarola and Machiavelli) tend to be a little stiff in costume movie style. Oh, and because the story takes place in the 1490's, one must imagine the Piazza della Signoria without Michelangelo and Cellini. This must really have frustrated a connoisseur like George Eliot."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Given the majority of Eliot readers begin with Middlemarch, I found myself in the unique position of not only beginning with Romola, but also on a subject that I find most interesting. That of Renaissance Italy. Beginning at the death of the great Lorenzo di Medici in '92 I read this great novel twice. Once quickly as any other Twenty-First century paperback; the second, slowly, with more respect for the intellectual scope within the pages.After the first attempt I was mildly disappointed. I came away with no true sense of the whole that is fifteenth century Florence and a bewilderment at the inconsistent central characterisation of Tito Melema and his golden-haired wife, Romola. The supporting actors were brilliant, from Fra Girolama's fantatical Catholicism to Bratti's salesmanship. But I was left disappointed, believing in the superficality of Tito, the maddening naivety of Tessa, and the almost puritanical martyrdom of Romola.So I re-read it. Slowly.It is now extremely clear why this great work of english literature is, as Eliot herself puts it, a \\"book of mine which I more thoroughly feel that I swear by every sentence as having been written with my best blood\\".Each scene is mesmerically depicted, the infintesimal attention to details and Eliot's total control of her subject matter shines through.Renaissance Florence wasn't so well depicted by its contemporaries.From Tito's waking at the Loggia de' Cerchi to his final fall at the Ponte Vecchio his character moves through a full range as you would expect from a man in his early twenties. His child-like mesmerism coupled with his Greek tutorage gives rise to a cherubic man whom Florence loves. His fatal flaw is his desire for love and a single terrible lie he gives that, like Murphy's Law, evolves into a a stigma that alters his very persona. What is all the more damaging is that you truly believe he is unaware of the pain he causes. He is truly egocentric, in an almost blameless way. For Romola, you cold argue the opposite. Indeed she is potentially more culpable. Her fierce intellectualism is offset by a descent into a world of religious supersition, a world where religion is used as a political tool. Throughout she has the knowledge of where her actions will take her and a terrible sense of duty and restrains her. From the beginning, with the story we hear so often of Tito's escape from drowning, to his final near drowning at the hands of the mob, to his strangulation by his father there is a certain bitter justice until all that he leaves is his proud and world-scarred wife Romola and the innocence that he preserved with Tessa. Tito's move from innocent 'hero' to startled villain is an excerise in human failings. Yet it is not a sufficient single human tragedy, as Eliot says, \\"Florence was busy with greater affairs, and the preparation of a deeper tragedy\\".In many respects \`Romola' is Eliot's King Lear. The parallels are many, including Baldessare's depiction. There is no Edgar, nor Edmund but the Fool is here in many guises. In taking one of Shakespeare's finest themes, Eliot has given true life to fifteenth century Florence and it is, perhaps, best encapsulated by Romola's final statement to Tessa's son, Lillo:\\"There was a man to whom I was very near... who made almost everyone fond of him, for he ws young, and clever, and beautiful...I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds - such as make men infamous.\\"So, Eliot's \`Romola'. Read it, delight in it because it truly is, as the author can rightly claim, one of the finest works in english literature."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Yes, it bristles with Glossaries and Appendices and Notes like so much barbed wire. (And if you actually read the Penguin editor's introduction, it's a sure thing you'll never read the novel: she makes it sound like about as much fun as chewing rocks.) But don't let all that deter you. You may have some rough going at the beginning, mostly because Latin and Greek scholarship is so important to the plot. Use the notes and they'll enhance your enjoyment of the story, but ignore them and you're still in for a thrilling tale gorgeously told. Tito Melema is one of the great characters in fiction, and he's someone we all know: a thoroughly despicable human being who has no idea he's anything but a nice guy. Eliot has wrought a dreamy and hair-raising hybrid of fiction and history, infused with her own astonishing insight and complicated sympathy and delivered in her matchless prose. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was a difficult book to read. If I did not happen to be on a business trip that left me long hours on seemingly endless international flights, I doubt if I would have had the perseverance to stick with it. In writing this book, Eliot spent six months in exhaustive research on fifteenth century Florence, and she is going to give it all to you whether you like it or not. This made it difficult to enjoy because I was constantly going to the back of the book get the translation of Italian and Latin phrases, reference to obscure historical characters, and other minutia which would only be clear to someone with a doctorate in Italian history. I was frustrated by this throughout the book. Having said that, the book is worth the wade! As always Eliot's writing is a pure joy to read. Some of her description is so beautiful that I have to step back in wonder that someone can create narrative so rich and inviting. Her characters are complex, intriguing and well developed. First, Tito was the most original antihero I have run across in years: a man who avoids unpleasantness and discomfort to the point that he betrays anyone he has ever loved while intending only to take the easy way in all his dealings. Romola is a women deeply learned, but raised only by her aging father and the classics, is unprepared for what the fates have brought her: love, duplicity, and purpose. And lastly, Savonarola, Tito's opposite: a religious visionary who strives to lead Florence to a new order, and is willing to give up church, state---anything but his place in the order, to see his prophecy fulfilled. This is Eliot's favorite book. I can see why."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Funny how Eliot's least-loved novel today was the author's personal favorite and her best seller during her lifetime. How did it slide into relative obscurity? Partly because Eliot's acknowleged forte is her depiction of rural life in Victorian England, whereas this novel is set in a large Italian city (Florence) during the Renasaissance. Also, the novel does bog down a bit in its own scholarliness, as nearly every reviewer has mentioned. Still, the innumerable references to prominent Florentines can be glossed over without losing much. As for the urban setting, Eliot's Florence is every bit as vivid as Dickens' London, or Dostoevsky's St. Petersburg. And, of course, every page is filled with Eliot's trademark wisdom.For anyone who cares about great books, all seven of Eliot's novels are absolutely mandatory. So, by all means start with \\"Adam Bede\\" or \\"Middlemarch\\", but don't neglect \\"Romola.\\"A word about the Konneman edition: I love the compact format (It fits easily into a briefcase or purse), the lovely cover art and the high-quality cloth binding. Be advised, however, that it is loaded with typos, some of them hilarious. It's still a good buy, however."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"When one starts reading a Victorian novelist, one prepares before hand to face a certain amount of wooden, heavy-handed moralizing, as every great narrative of the epoch is fraught with the opposition between the calls of pleasure and the calls of duty, between seeking for one's private advantage and sticking to one's role, with the writer making the latter to win overwhelming. This novel is no different, in that it's the dutiful Romola that has the upper hand over her nice and debauched husband Tito Melena in the end. However, the novel being set in late Renaissance Italy- a country with which George Eliot had an enduring love affair - it captures the atmosphere of the time and place in such a beautiful way that this enormous, throughly reserched historical novel has such a flowing, luxurious style that takes an almost liquid quality, like a fresh, transparent scream flowing along a summer Mediterranean landscape. Also, in the person of Savonarola, Eliot menaged to introduce the figure of the idealist turned evil through his attachment to his call. In short: a gorgeous novel. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Romola","review":"I loved this book! Set in fifteenth century Florence, Romola explores the deep recesses of the soul. Renaissance Italy with its political/religious conflicts, intellectual, pursuits, artistry and pageantry are all beautifully protrayed throughout Eliot's magnificent love story. Deceit, greed and selfishness are artfully displayed against the purity of a nobel soul which knows no compromise. Romola, the book's main character is a study in virtue, while Tito her husband has but the veneer of goodness. Tito falls forever because of one lie. This is a book to read slowly and savor."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"A book with unforgettable characters - in Tito who demonstrates the degeneration of the soul in the pursuit of money and an ideal character in Romola who personifies duty. This book characterizes George Eliot's concept of truth. Truth according to her is not only what is real, but also, what should be. Another character who fascinates is Savonarola - we see him as a human being, with strengths and weaknesses. And Eliot teaches us to be like Romola - to appreciate the good in a human being instead of damming him completely. Along with true to life characters, ideal characters,historical characters, also a superb depiction of rennaisance Italy. Whatever critics say about 'Romola' being the least readable of all Eliot's books, it remains her most idealistic work which makes one feel deeply, and want to emulate the good. Hence, a great classic which is enjoyable and which sets you thinking about your own inadequacies."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola is a dense, compelling historical novel by the master of English fiction, George Eliot. Although this book is a bit slow going at first, the true-to-life characters and the towering themes make the reader's efforts more than worthwhile. Like the great film &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman,&quot; this novel deals with love, betrayal, parenthood, revenge, greed, spirituality, religion, and deceit, in ways that seem remarkably modern.

The behind the scene stories and what lead up to the show is fascinating, although every listed show doesn't have that much detail behind it.The book is usually updated with new editions, but currently is out-dated (doesn't include Lion King, The Producers, Jekyll & Hyde, Titanic, etc.) Reading about the earlier Broadway shows (first show \\"The Black Crook\\" [1866]) is interesting and contains information you probably won't find anywhere else, including some failed shows (less than 5 performances), last minute casting decisions or movies that were made based on the show. I wish the listed revival shows would have more information than a basic \\"ditto\\" that refers to the original performance. However, if it is really meant to be a reference book, then it succeeds in that business without really trying.The statistics given for how many performances a show had is nice, but can't be used to determine the success of that show today. The revival shows are learning that. With better access to New York (modern travel) -- numbers are increasing, but on the other hand, with more choices and a finicky audience that may be too PC for it's own good, some old shows don't work well now. If you're looking for tools to help you decide on choosing a musical, take a look at \\"Let's Put on a Musical\\" by Peter Filichia (1993) which is seven years newer besides."},{"Title":"Broadway Musicals - Show by Show","review":"overall a nice book covering the Bway Musicals.

I am sad that it only goes up the 1996 year, and have been awaiting a new version for a while now. But if you need a time frame, this book helps with giving you the year, directors, original cast, and a brief synopsis of the show itself.

Red Eve was \\"one of the greatest heiresses in East Anglia,\\" the daughter of Sir John, the Knight of Clavering. Hugh was only a merchant's son, but they were childhood sweethearts. Acour (Edmund of Noyon) was a Norman spy plotting against King Edward, and proof of this was discovered when his correspondence with King Philip of France was intercepted. Hugh rode to London to alert the King, and in the meantime Edmund Acour drugged Eve and forced her to marry him. The ceremony was interrupted by Hugh, and Acour escaped to France.Hugh de Cressi goes off to war and is knighted, and the English take Calais. Acour escapes him by switching his armor with another man at the battle at Crecy to avoid de Cressi's vengeance. Acour flees to Genoa, then Venice, and Hugh follows. When Hugh finally confronts his nemesis, there are supernatural rumblings and a mysterious plague--the beginning of the black plague.I won't spoil the ending by telling you if Hugh finally kills Edmund Acour and marries Red Eve.Haggard is known for his swashbuckling adventures and this one travels through Europe. However, if you don't like the old-fashioned writing style of Dumas or Hugo you won't like it."},{"Title":"Red Eve,","review":"The book is decent enough, and is sort of a count of Monte Cristo story, but luckily doesn't drag quite as much, but then again, nothing eye popping...

It's bad enough simply trying to translate to prose. Ms. Terry does an excellent job. I read Le Roman de Renart in French while I was studying in France. Years later, I came across this translation.It is fascinating the way the original storytellers portrayed Renart. He is a completely hateful creature. Yet reading about him is fun. It's similar to how I feel about stories of Loki or Coyote. Renart is closer to Loki than to Coyote, despite the canine ancestry. He is more than simply a trickster: he is malevolent.If you have an interest in ancient folktales, you mustn't miss the story of Renart. This translation is different from any other I've read. The introduction gives a good perspective on the times when the stories were hatched."},{"Title":"Renard the Fox: The Misadventures of an Epic Hero","review":"It is an absolute classic.

As given in the description it is a thorough, comprehensive handling of much of the theoretical information of constructing high-quality, top-performance speaker enclosures. This book does cover the advantages and disadvantages of several enclosure types and includes discussions on speaker drivers and crossover networks. After going through the chapters, (8), Speaker Enclosure discussions came first and then the drivers and how they are utilized in the enclosures, driver numbers and the matching of the enclosures. There is a good explanation concerning efficiencies of drivers, balance importance, multiple arrays of speakers and phasing of woofer, midrange and tweeters. Enclosure baffles is discussed in detail in Chapter three comparing three systems for explation of differnt uses. Bass Reflex or Phase Inversin Enclosures, Horn enclosures and the combination of enclosures follow in the next Three Chapters. There follows a thorough discussion of crossovers networks, picking the crossover frequencies, phase shifts, crossover rates, electronic crossovers, network configurations, equalizers and shelving. The final chapter discusses testing and materials of design, regidity, and speaker placement and phasing of stereo speakers is discussed in Summary. This is an older book on the design of Stereo systems, but the theory is still sound and can give a lot of good information to the reader to design and understand building of Speakers. I recommend this book. An easy read compared to those books from some of the newer authorities on the subject."},{"Title":"How to Build Speaker Enclosures","review":"this book was handy it told u what u need to know on how to build speaker cabinets i recommend buying this book it help me out alot."},{"Title":"a book of witches","review":"This volume is one of the earlier sets by the author.

A very charming children's version of a familiar parable. The pictures are absolutely adorable!"},{"Title":"The Little Lost Lamb (Kids Bestsellers)","review":"One of the most well-known and well-loved parables of Jesus is The Lost Sheep, which is found in Matthew 18 and Luke 15. In this parable, Jesus explains how one sheep wanders away and the shepherd leaves the other 99 sheep to find and rescue the lost one. It is a story of redemption and forgiveness that so many of us can relate to, which explains the popularity of all the artwork and imagery of Jesus as the Good Shepherd.Ms. Haines takes some personal liberties in her re-telling of this parable both in length, detail, and child-friendly language. None of these liberties are bad things, though, as it makes the story easier to understand and relate to for the younger reader. My favorite part of this book is how the lamb refuses to go home despite being in danger. Younger kids might not get this message on their own, but that is just like us in our fallen nature. We sin, try to hide it, and are too ashamed to go home for forgiveness, and it is a good lesson to teach your kids about God's love and your love for them. Even if they screw up, you still love them and will be there for them.I give this book 5 stars. It's very easy to see why this book is so popular and continues to be one of Pauline Books and Media's top sellers. Pick yourself up a copy. In fact, pick up two. You will probably end up reading this book to your children so many times that the cover will fall off."},{"Title":"The Law and Regulation of Telecommunications Carriers (Artech House Telecommunications Library)","review":"Considering that this textbook was intended primarily for law school students, it is equally applicable to telecommunications graduate programs.

I would not agree that this is a good law school text book. The text - for a legal scholarly work - is largely devoid of citations. Thus the book as a secondary source recounts history almost as hearsay without an ability to get to the primary history. In addition, the subject matter is superficial and insufficiently developed. The Kingsbury Commitment, a huge moment in telecommunications history, is given one paragraph. There is little new here that is not in other books. There is content that is missing.

I feel like I heard the story first hand over a margarita and a taco."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"The past generation has responded to the mounting pressures of overpopulation, global warming ('98 has been the hottest year in recorded history - radar images of satellite observations show glacier shrinking in Anartica), nuclear and biological catastrophe, pollution, and plant and animal extinction with a succession of hopeful and spirited movements that call for the reduction of carbon monoxide emissions and the saving of a number of endangerd species, ranging from whales, spotted owls, to trees and even crustaceans (yes, there is a Hollywood group committed to saving the lobster). During this same period, billions of dollars have been committed towards AIDS research.Regardless of the effectiveness of any number of theses strategies, one thing is certain: ulitmately, if humanity is to perputuate itself, it must one day leave this planet and colonize the galaxy. We must become extra-terrestrials. But we only have a limited window. Pessimists have concluded tha! t the earth has never been visited from outer space because no civilization has yet to survive its own technology. This could be our fate.However, through the creation of a multi-planet species, Robert Zubrin's plan to colonize Mars is the best chance mankind has right now to insure its perpetuity. The stakes are huge. Humans may be destined to know the farthest reaches of the universe and become something more than man, perhaps a kind of superman. Or we may simply become curious fossils for the next higher being to evolve from mud, slime, and the radiation resistant cockroach (try cooking one in the microwave).Given the precarious state of life on this planet, the technology we now possess (your home PC is about is powerful as the one that directed Apollo from Mission Control) and the proximity of a cool, Red Planet once capable of supporting life just three to six months away, I am at a loss to understand why Mars colonization is not at the top of the global agenda! ...except for its implausibility.Robert Zubrin's, The ! Case For Mars, is a practical guide and plan that makes truth sometimes, as the saying goes, stranger than fiction. Computational studies by NASA scientist Chris MaKay and Zubrin demonstrate that a small but sustained rise in temperature at the Martian south pole - 4 C - can intiate a runaway greenhouse effect that will melt the ice cap. The Red Planet would soon be awash with oceans and riverbeds.The Case For Mars is pregnant with possibilty. This book should be on the desk of every congressman, senator, CEO, and celebrity. --James Pruett"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"The fact that the Bible, and not a book such as this one ranks first among the most-read books is enough to render any rational person sad."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"In THE CASE FOR MARS, engineer Robert Zubrin lays out a bold plan to land astronauts on Mars within a decade of making the decision to go. Zubrin promotes an idea to manufacture air, water, and fuel mainly on Mars instead of on earth, so that billions of dollars could be saved in program costs. His Mars Direct plan has earned him a reputation as a leader in Mars exploration advocacy.The book owes its title and many of its concepts to the legendary Case for Mars conferences of the 1980s, which have influenced NASA's Mars planning ever since.While Zubrin's presentation generally makes sense, he also has a bad habit of tearing down ideas that don't mesh with his own. He treats differing opinions like enemies, and he frequently paints his targets (even former colleagues) with veiled insults, which I found increasingly disruptive. I wanted to have more confidence in his proposals, but his partisan style made it difficult to trust his judgment, since the opinions of others are so easily dismissed.Much of Zubrin's ire is directed at NASA's so-called \\"90-Day Report,\\" a preliminary report requested by the George H.W. Bush administration in 1989 after setting a goal of sending astronauts to Mars by 2019. While the report justly deserved criticism for its overreaching ambitions, Zubrin spends entirely too much effort ridiculing the report to support his arguments, and it eventually reads like a professional grudge. The report sank without a trace within NASA in 1990 anyway, and was followed by Daniel Goldin's \\"faster, better, cheaper\\" policy shortly thereafter. So by the time of the 1996 publishing date of this book, the author is flogging a horse that's been dead a long time.The book's other major concept, of taking the entire spacecraft to the surface (Mars Direct), is sound, but I felt Zubrin was too quick to dismiss the ideas of Mars orbit insertion and Mars orbit rendezvous, which are both valid ideas in their own right. I also wanted to see more detail on specific areas like mission planning, spacecraft construction, environment designs, and EVA suits, but Zubrin's approach is macro, not micro. Curiously, he also glosses over the human factors issue, which needs much more serious attention than he thinks it deserves.Robert Zubrin is a man who cares about spaceflight, and he wants to lead the charge in exploring the fourth planet. The book's main thesis, of manufacturing air, water, and fuel on-site, is indeed the most affordable and most achievable way to send humans to Mars. But he needs to lighten up on his \\"us against them\\" mentality, which really taints his arguments. I would hesitate to call him a visionary, as some others here have done generously, but there is no doubt that he is a prominent advocate for a manned Mars program. His efforts are commendable, and the book is recommended, albeit with some reservation."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"I just got done reading Mars A Cosmic Stepping Stone ( I rate it 5 stars) and Kevin Nolan recommended The Case for Mars.Glad I bought The Case for Mars and took his recommendation.Dr. Robert Zubrin one of the scientific leaders on Mars colonization and the author of The Case for Mars \\"Gets It\\" and does a great job describing the need to colonize Mars and how to get there.Some interesting illustrations and pictures of people interested in the Mars mission strategy. I strongly believe Robert's plan \\"Mars direct\\" to get 4 people to Mars and back is the most economical and safest way to go. Also it allows 1 1/2 years of on ground Mars crew exploration.Hey the heavy hitters, Buzz Aldrin,Carl Sagan and Arther C Clarke had great stuff to say about Dr. Zubrin leading the field and liked his book. See back cover dust jacket.This book is not super technical and you don't need a degree in astrophysics to enjoy it. Anyone interested in expansion of the human race and Mars colonization will enjoy this book. As a amateur astronomer for 40 years and someone wanting to see manned exploration of Mars, I give The Case for Mars my highest rating.

His proposal has great merit, and he illustrates its strengths well. But he definitely has a plan to sell, and one gets the feeling that surely there must be a tradeoff in this scheme SOMEWHERE! In short Zubrin's energy and optimism are contagious, and he carries himself along to positions that are almost certainly over-optimistic. Eventually the reader may even wonder if he's getting the whole story. The latter half of the book proposes methods for the colonization and eventual terraforming of mars. Necessarily, this involves speculations that at this point in time can only be very imaginative and rather wild. Still, the author has, I think, the right idea about the potential here, and makes a good case for at least the Mars Direct plan. In all, this is a very thought-provoking and stimulating book. It's not often that the gre! at events of history can be so clearly laid out ahead of time; even if things do not unfold as described in The Case For Mars, it lays out a marvelous vision worth the viewing."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Overall a very good book.

I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"This book is excellent if you want great detail in chemistry, geology and physics. It's definitely required reading if that's what you're after with respect to Mars. On a philosophical and human level it's less convincing, somewhat wishy-washy in fact, with an unapologetic pro-American bias. It's obviously a very important work if you're concerned with the specific considerations for an economical and successful human settlement of Mars. But gripping reading it isn't. I found it rather tedious and hard to finish. If you're interested in the human colonization of space on a more general level, and want a decent and readable overview, I'd definitely recommend the same author's \\"Entering Space\\" over this title."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"The timing for such a publication as this couldn't be better. This is one of the most important books of the last ten years. I'm not kidding. Bob Zubrin will turn out to be somewhat of an exploration prophet in decades to come. Because, although he had a lot of help, Zubrin is largely responsible for transforming the Humans To Mars concept from a 'Flags And Footprints' $450 billion dollar boondoggle into a $30 billion dollar largely do-able thing that will change humanity. While mankind fluffs around in low Earth orbit, suffering from budget-strangled mediocrity, Zubrin sounds the battlecry to combat the harsh unknowns of the final frontier. This book is almost relentlessly optimistic but doesn't downplay the difficulties involved in such expeditions too much. But there IS, for the right reasons, a slight tendency to gloss over the very real risks of solar and cosmic radiation to the health of the crew, and the reliability of spacecraft systems. Some of the greatest engineering challenges of this coming century will be to create closed-loop life support, power and fuel factory systems that will function virtually flawlessly for YEARS on end. The only challenges greater than making those essential things work will be to raise funding from ignorant lawmakers! Regardless, Zubrin does at least address the problems and any reader, as I did, will walk away from this book energised and just KNOWING that going to Mars is a possible and increasingly more necessary thing to do. Come on, Congress and Private Industry: I wanna see IMAX footage of Valles Marineris SOONER rather than later! More power to you, Bob Zubrin. My actual rating for this book is 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Mars is there to be climbed. Its not a matter of can we. The answer is an absolute YES! The question is, why should we? In 'The Case For Mars' Robert Zubrin makes a convincing argument. Does the lack of a mondern terrestrial frontier mean our evolved sense of independence and ability to innovate will atrophe? Mars may be the answer to reviving these qualities.Zubrin et al explain how a no frills plan to send humans to Mars was developed in response to the failed Space Exploration Initiative.

It was well researched and based on technical expertise.If asked, they could make this happen.Well worth reading for anyone interested in space exploration."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"The Case for Mars describes a way to send explorers and settlers to mars, an explanation of how colonization would work and an argument for why we should do both.Robert Zubrin is an Aeronautical engineer who has worked on space projects. The Case for Mars has sufficient technical detail to make his arguments persuasive. The technical topics are well explained with out being overwhelming or tedious for a non-technical audience, like myself. There are notes at the end of some chapters that go into greater detail.In the Case for Mars Zubrin explains his \\"Mars Direct\\" plan for piloted flights to Mars. Mars Direct was created in response to NASA's \\"90 day plan\\" for going to Mars. NASA's plan required building space stations and lots of research on novel engineering solutions. It would have been extremely expensive. The 90 day plan was the product of a bureaucracy that was trying to fund as many of its' existing projects as possible. Zubrin and his colleagues created the Mars Direct plan to use current technology to get astronauts to Mars safely, quickly and cheaply.The first part of The Case for Mars explains how the Mars Direct plan would work, and why it is feasible. This is the best part of the book. It is interesting and detailed, but readable and persuasive.Zubrin then goes on to explain how Mars would be colonized. The technical aspects of the explanation seem plausible to me. When he starts to describe how Mars colonies would be financially viable and independent he went off the tracks. The arguments involved a lot of hand waving and were no longer persuasive.The end of the book is a polemic about the importance of having a frontier to the health of society. The reader gets a capsule history that seeks to demonstrate that all societies rot if they do not have a frontier.I wish the space cadets would leave the business plans, sociology and political polemics to others. They should concentrate on topics they actually know something about.The Case for Mars offers a clear convincing argument in favor of the Mars Direct plan for exploring mars.

Dr. Zubrin describes how to get there, who should go, how to \\"live off the land\\" when on Mars, and why Mars is so special and different than any other planet.The first half of the book is a must read for any space enthusiast. The Space Shuttle, Space Station are earth orbits, non-exploration projects. We have not gone any further since Apollo 11 . Who gets excited about circulating around the Earth studying MicroGravity.There are bigger fishes. Dr. Zubrin explains why Mars and only Mars has potential to have harbored life and may in the far future offer a second home for mankind. Dr. Zubrin goes into technical details in book.However, Dr Zubrin like all smart scientist and engineers, they need to deal with lowly things like politics and economics. Economics is reason we are not going to Mars. The Cold War sent us to the moon because we did not want to sleep under a \\"Communist Moon\\" Dr. Zubrin, all space enthusiast out there, need an economics reason. The Cold War is over. Emotional arguments like, exploration, knowledge and curiosity does not cut it anymore.In the 21st. century we will only go to Mars for one simple reason: Economics. We need a economic way to go there. Estimates range from $500 billion to $30 Billion. Range is too wide. What the hell are we going to do there besides kicking rocks and taking pictures. Are there mineral deposits we can bring back. Dr Zubrin was on the radio recently. All the callers \\"Joe Six Pack\\" are asking \\"what for me\\". Fortunately or Unfortunately, if we are able to answer this question to the public: we will then have a Missions to Mars. Science is great for Einstein and fellow scientist. The man, woman, child on the street wants to know \\"whats for me\\". If Dr. Zubrin can answer this question, we will go to Mars."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"The polyanish attitude of Zubrin to dismissing real hurdles to a Mars mission makes this book more of a cheerleading manual than a science treatise. It's a good read if one leaves science at the door and flips the pages for an adventure story. He creates a cult following of those who enjoy Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. and don't have the ability to distinguish science and science fiction.The book deserves one star for Science but I'll add another star for enthusiasm. 'The Chariots of the Gods' reader will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"I'm a strong proponent of Mars travel, and the U.S. really needed a book like this one. The book is well written and brings the audience in. I could only dream of writing such a coherent book on this subject.But, here's a big issue that I have with the book. Many people have come to believe that Mr. Zubrin came up with these ideas for ISRU, and other Mars propulsion related topics. In actuality, these great ideas came from a series of conferences called \\"the case for Mars\\" ('80's) and published work prior to that ('70's); all of which came about without his input.All of the engineering and scientific ideas detailed within the book are not his by any means. He's simply an Engineer with charisma that voiced the ideas of others and tried to apply them. I thank Zubrin's predecessors for their ingenuity.On another note, I must mention my admiration for NASA. NASA ended up receiving harsh criticism from Zubrin, but they later supported his proposals because it was important to their overall goal. It's tough for any organization to do that, but NASA would never let it's mission be stopped by criticism. Go NASA!"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"It's easy to get caught up in Zubrin's excitement as he describes a way to send humans to Mars within 10 years, leapfrogging NASA projects and cutting NASA cost estimates by 90%. But then you start seeing the holes in his Mars Direct plan. The launch vehicle we would need (the Saturn V) hasn't existed for 30 years. Restarting production would be difficult and expensive. Alternatives are little more than conceptual art. If we were to get the first stage to Mars, it would have to land on its own (something we haven't had much luck with lately) and then set up an atmospheric distillery that would operate perfectly for months without any maintenance. While Zubrin has proven the distillery is technically possible, his model looks like something you would see at a high school science fair. If we get this far, we would send 4 astronauts on a 6-month journey in a tin can with space limitations so severe the inhabitants will envy maximum-security inmates. If the astronauts are able to land successfully, they have a 6-month stay ahead of them followed by a 6-month return journey. Zubrin doesn't want any doctors on the trip so these people will need to be perfectly healthy for 18 months in some of the most severe environments mankind has ever tested.But why go to Mars? Zubrin tries to tie going to Mars to man's need for exploration and future economic benefit. It's an intriguing argument, but it fails. The only real reason to go to Mars now is to determine if there is or has been life there. Actually, finding no life will make the most people happy. If no life is found in a particular spot, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist somewhere on the planet and another mission is justified. Not finding life also allows religions to still claim that life only exists on Earth. Actually finding past or present life would throw humanity into a quandary it probably isn't ready for.Latter chapters of the book deal with setting up colonies and terraforming the planet. Surprisingly, Zubrin doesn't address native life on Mars at all. If life is found, do we have the right to set up colonies or take steps that may wipe out Martian life only for our own good? Did we not learn anything from the American west and Native Americans? While it may not be Zubrin's place as a scientist to worry about such problems, if he can speculate on selling Martian land without anyone being on the planet he certainly has the responsibility to address issues related to actual Martians.When we do decide to go to Mars, let's make sure it's for the right reasons. Those reasons are lacking in this book."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Zubrin is a bit too self-congratulatory. The time he takes in each chapter to pat himself on the back drags down an otherwise interesting, if unrealistic, study of human space travel to Mars. All his assumptions leave little to no margin of error. Recent events have shown that accidents do happen to either expensive and/or tragic results. We're not yet to the point emotionally, economically or politically where we can be as cavalier as Zubrin's plan requires.On writing style, Zubrin manages to take an interesting subject and turn it into something dry and tedious to read. The pieces where he actually sticks to the science of Mars and of space travel, it's a quick and interesting read with informative graphics but these bits are hidden amongst long passages of minutiae relevant only to Zubrin."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"This book is really dated and somewhat overly technical.

Dr. Zubrin spends far too much time faulting NASA and trying to say why we should not do anything but go to Mars. He does make good points with his theme of \\"living off the land\\". I don't believe this book will convince anyone outside those who already want to go to Mars that we need to go. I think it will give ammunition to those who dislike NASA and the space program in general."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Zubrin has a very interesting plan, which appears to be sound both technically and philosophically. While he certainly presents a compelling case for *how* we should go to Mars, he fails to actually present a case for *why* we should want to go to Mars in the first place.Of all the places to go in the solar system, why Mars? What does Mars have to offer other than dust? What is on Mars that is not more easily accessible elsewhere in the solar system? These are important question to consider if one is going to invest resources and human lives in the conquest of space.To build a successful colony, one needs raw materials as well as abundant energy. Mars is lacking on both counts. Water? How much is really available in the ice caps and subsurface? Energy? The amount of geothermal energy is questionable, as Mars is mostly dead from a geological standpoint. Solar energy is less than 1/3 of that found on Earth, requiring large arrays that must support themselves against gravity as well as be protected from dust storms. What raw minerals are available other than iron oxide (rust)?No, all the necessary resources, and more, are available in the Asteroid Belt and the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Any additional energy expended in reaching them is far more than compensated for the fact that their wealth is not bound deep in a gravity well such as that of Mars. The reduced solar energy is not a limiting factor either, as collector arrays can be built as large as necessary when there are not constraints of gravity.Finally, the space radiation issue is better addressed, as the Belt colony can dig itself in to an asteroid as deeply as necessary to provide adequate shielding.Forget Mars, the Belt is where we need to go."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"This guy is full of hatered, he depicts nasa as an evil organisation on every page.For those that don't know, this is Robert Zubrin, the man behind the Mars society, who is very smart but also the resident space crazy dude.

Zubrin's plans for terraforming Mars into a near-earthlike climate are the part of the book that has gotten the most attention. But his political rationale for Mars settlement -- that ultimately, freedom requires a frontier and the values that a frontier cultivates -- are the most inspirational part of the book from my perspective.

Definitely was inspiring coming from an author that wishes to advance mankind technologically into the realm of space.. A view that I have concurred with ever since I was in grade school. The book was not just some bored rocket engineer's (or scientist's) science fiction memo, I found his plan extremely plausible and do-able. I especially liked the historical allusions he made throughout the account proving that the grand majority of the technologies used in Mars Direct have been done before in the past(and many for thousands of years). If they have done before, there is no reason why they can not be done again. I loved the clear explanation of his plan. He did not go into too much math , but he gave a clear picture in my mind the concepts involved. Zubrin is very knowledgable and while I was reading this book I knew that what he was saying was well-founded. A MUST READ for those interested in space exploration, astronomy, or aerospace engineering!"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"When I first saw the book, I was surprised by its size - it's so thick! It took me two weeks to finish the book, and I love it. I have read many books about space exploration, especially on human Mars exploration, but it is the one which I admire the most. Dr Zubrin is so creative for coming up with a plan called &quot;Mars Direct&quot;. This plan is very different from the NASA's &quot;90-Day Report&quot;, it involves no orbital assembly, no orbital infrastructure, no orbital rendezvous, and it doesn't need advanced propulsion or any other technology that we don't have, and basically what the approach takes is to explore Mars the way we explore the Earth, which is &quot;travel light, and live off the land&quot;. Dr Zubrin explains that we can use this technology by using the resources that can be found on Mars rather than entirely Earth-supplied. I believe &quot;Mars Direct&quot; is the only way to get to Mars, because not only it is the cheapest, but also it is easier to accomplish. Dr Zubrin also explains why a moon base is not needed before the human Mars mission, which many people believe it is a necessary first step toward Mars. I agree, in fact I think his answer is quite convincing.Later in the book Dr Zubrin explains that we will start colonizing Mars once a region is chosen. Things like carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen which are very useful for human colonization are very common on Mars. Also there are plenty of chemical substances in the soil of Mars which can be used to make metals, or even nuclear reactors for the energy supplies. Compare to the moon, Mars has more useful resources for human colonization, and that's one of the reason why we should go to Mars, not the moon.Finally Dr Zubrin said in the far future we may &quot;terraform&quot; Mars. He said we can do this by putting a gigantic mirror in the orbit round Mars. When it reflects the sunlight onto the polar cap, the polar cap will melt and release carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere, which will then warm the planet up. Or if we have a significant industrial capability on Mars we can produce artificial greenhouse gas like CFC. I don't think it is science fiction because I believe we can do this, and if we terraform Mars, it will become our second home.The reason why our technology gets better is because we have plenty of resources on Earth, but once it becomes insufficient the result will be war and extinction of human being. The only way to avoid this is to search for other resources by exploring space, and of course, Mars is going to be a perfect place."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Hmmm... this is a difficult one to review.This book is basically an advertisement for the author's &quot;Mars Direct&quot; scheme for manned mars missions.On the one hand I laud Zubrin for all the time and effort he has placed into thinking up his &quot;Mars Direct&quot; plan for manned mars missions. The idea is certainly appealing and contians much that had never been presented before. Most interesting is his idea to live off of the land to minimize the need for bringing unneeded supplies and fuel.On the other hand, it is apparent on first inspection that there are no shortage of technical shortcomings for the Mars Direct plan despite it's advantages. Much (if not all) of the hardware that would be required for Zubrin's plan does not exist today or exits in a format that is so far from practical application that for all intents and purposes it cannot yet be applied to this idea. Zubrin seems to assume that everything will work smoothly and that one mission will just flow smoothly into another. Both the US and Soviet space programs have clearly shown that hardware mishaps occur, usually with disastrous results. Zubrin's dependence on unmanned vehicles to go on ahead in advance and land safely as well as on target time after time is very unrealistic. If these unmanned vehicles malfunctioned or crashed everything is on hold for months or years until the problem can be fixed. The text does not even mention possible problems with the Mars Direct approach, a serious editorial oversight.I don't mean to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Zubrin means well, and if more of us gave this problem the amount of effort he has, we would have been on mars 20 years ago.

In a very well rounded, easy to read work, he lays out both the scientific and humanistic reasons for a trip to the Red Planet. While his science is excellent (he is a former Lockheed engineer), what is most compelling about this book is what Zubrin sees as the primary reason for Mars exploration: it is there. He correctly asserts that humans are at their most creative and productive when they pit themselves against a major challenge. He sees the exploration and colonization of Mars as a means of injecting the human race with fresh vitality and drive. After reading this excellent book, I'm inclined to agree."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"I was frustrated and burned out running a bookstore when I read through this book in less than two days. Right then and there I decided to change careers with the sole purpose of getting humanity to Mars. Now I work in technology and am learning whatever I can to help get us to Mars, not a flag-and-footprints mission like we did for the moon, but a permanent branch of humanity. NASA would have us go slow and leave it to the hands of the &quot;experts,&quot; where Zubrin argues that if experts were in charge of Earth colonization we would all still be feeding off each other in Europe.The science aspects interested me less than the Vision Thing, the idea that we are entering a Golden Age for the Earth at large, in which the problems are solved, the borders are thrown down, and we gradually withdraw into ourselves into decay. The same has happened to Rome and Greece and every other &quot;world&quot;-conquering nation. The day the last challenge was met was the beginning of the end.We need a Frontier!

This is one of those few books which can be understood by America's youth. Robert Zubrin gave me a goal in my life of science: to get to Mars. The ideas were presented clearly and carefully, always with a sense of the passion Zubrin has in this endeavor. Comparing the Solar System to the world makes me think that it IS possible to go beyond Earth, that it IS possible to reach Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and even other stars. The walls of physics are far, far away. The void between is immense. Zubrin explains how we can use exotic propulsion systems to get to Mars in weeks instead of months, Jupiter in months instead of years, and other stars in decades instead of centuries. The possibilities are endless. An eyeopener to me, I strongly recommend it to anybody with time to read."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Speaking as an aerospace engineer, my evaluation of this book is that it gives a comprehensive and accurate assessment of not just reaching Mars on a realistically limited budget and time frame, but actually colonizing the planet. Most material I have read about space travel is either very detailed technical coverage of some small aspect, or some dreamer's uninformed broad brush speculations. This book gives comprehensive coverage of a workable plan that includes enough detail to verify that the author and his associates have done their homework.The chief thing this book accomplishes is debunking the 'Battlestar Galactica' approach to going to Mars. It also presents a strong rationale for why it would be worthwhile to travel to Mars and to develop its resources for establishing a sustained presence. The atmospheric shielding for ultra-violet rays and the approximate 24 hour Martian day are key for planetary agriculture. Local resources can be processed for fuel and propellant. This practical handbook for colonists even includes a Martian calendar for reckoning its 669 day year.The author establishes the significance of exploration and settlement throughout history. It seems likely that his own contribution of compiling reference material into a persuasive public advocacy will come to be seen as historical."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Can we send people to Mars? Is it a good idea? Can we \\"terraform\\" Mars?The author, writing in 1996, says that for about 20 billion to 30 billion dollars, we could do it. For a project starting now, launch of the return vehicle would be in about ten years, launch of the astronauts a couple of years later, and astronaut return less than three years after that.What do I think of this? It's going to be expensive and risky. The statistics on unmanned Mars missions has not been completely encouraging. Manned missions are even trickier.Is it a good idea? Well, let's see what Zubrin has to say. \\"We are not sending a crew to Mars to set a new altitude record for the Aviation Almanac. We are going to Mars to explore a planet; to determine if it ever harbored life in the past and to survey its potential as a future home for a new branch of human civilization.\\"I think going to Mars is a very reasonable idea, and we'll need that attitude to get there. If enough people agree and if we're willing to commit to it, we ought to try it. I think exploration of the solar system is indeed our birthright, and we ought to do it whether or not we think there is (or was) life on Mars. I think \\"ad astra\\" (\\"to the stars\\") is a good motto. The meek will inherit the Earth. The rest of us will aim a little higher.Zubrin now explains his idea for an initial manned mission. He's proposed sending the return module there first. After Zubrin said this, I think most folks started to realize that it's a good idea. Now, what about the trajectory? A fast mission is better than a slow one. And the author explains that a \\"conjunction\\" mission is much better than an \\"opposition\\" mission. The former spends much more time on the Martian surface, is less expensive, and appears less risky.Zubrin discusses crew size, and concludes that a 4-person crew is probably best. And there is a nice chapter on \\"killing the dragons, avoiding the sirens.\\" The \\"dragons\\" include risks from radiation, zero-gravity, Martian weather, contamination of Mars, and back-contamination of the Earth. Yes, there are risks, but they can be handled. A \\"siren\\" is the belief that we need lunar bases before going to Mars. Zubrin explains that such bases are not necessary.The author discusses advanced propulsion technologies that might make it easier for us to go to Mars, although his plans can be implemented with present technologies. I think that we need to keep developing advanced technologies and that they'll help us. But I agree that even without them, we can still get to Mars.We can go to Mars if we make a serious commitment to do so. But what about the package deal? Can we terraform Mars, even if we are committed to do so? Would it take too long? Do we have the resources as a species to do such a thing? Zubrin delves into these questions. He asks, \\"Can we transform Mars to make it fully habitable?\\" On the, um, surface, \\"the idea appears to be utterly fantastical, simply science fiction.\\" But he points out that it hasn't been long since traveling to the Moon was science fiction.Zubrin shows that there is a possibility that Mars could be terraformed. The Martian regolith (the soil and rock near the surface) could indeed contain enough carbon dioxide to create an atmospheric surface pressure of 300 millibar were it all released. And we could trigger the process that would produce a \\"greenhouse effect.\\" Release of \\"greenhouse\\" gases would raise the temperature of the surface, increasing the release of more greenhouse gases. We might be able to achieve a pressure of 100 millibar in only a couple of centuries. That is something a committed civilization can actually do.Of course, to accomplish all this, we probably will need some of those advanced propulsion technologies that Zubrin discusses.Going to Mars is serious business. Here is a quote from the author:\\"I would say that failure to terraform Mars constitutes failure to live up to our human nature and a betrayal of our responsibility as members of the community of life itself.\\"I think that's a pretty clear statement. I agree with it."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"The kindle edition is not the new 2011 updated second edition - it is the older 1997 first edition.Buy the paperback instead !"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"The past generation has responded to the mounting pressures of overpopulation, global warming ('98 has been the hottest year in recorded history), nuclear and biological catastrophe, pollution, and plant and animal extinction with a succession of spirited movements that call for the reduction of carbon monoxide emissions, billions of dollars towards AIDS research, and saving a number of endangered species ranging from whales, spotted owls to crustaceans (yes, there is a Hollywood group committed to saving the lobster).Regardless of the effectiveness of any of these strategies, one thing remains certain: sooner or later, if humanity is to perpetuate itself, it must one day leave this planet and become extra-terrestrial. But we have only a limited window. Pessimists have concluded that the earth has never been visited from outer space because no civilization has yet to survive its own technology. This could be our fate.However, through the creation of a m! ulti-planet species, Robert Zubrin's plan to colonize Mars is the best chance humankind has right now to insure its perpetuity. The stakes are huge. Humans may be destined to know the farthest reaches of the universe and in the process become something more than man, perhaps a kind of superman. Or we may simply become curious fossils for the next higher being that manages to evolve from mud, slime, and radiation resistant cockroaches.Given the context of our current situation and the technology we now possess (your home PC is about as powerful as the ones that directed Apollo), and the proxiamity of a cool, Red Planet just three to six months away, I can't for the life of me understand why Mars colonization is not at the top of the global political agenda...except for its implausibility.Computational studies by Chris McKay and Zubrin demonstrate that a small but sustained rise in temperature at the Martian south pole - 4 C - can initiate a runaway greenho! use effect that will melt the ice cap.

The book is peppered with possible situations, plans and propositions for a manned mission and the writing is very comprehensive, in fact the mathmatics is rather confusing, though not necessary to understand the book. The author also gets his feet wet in the social and political issues of a manned mission to Mars, but not too much.The book goes on to explain possible methods for terraforming the planet and building a whole new civilization there, specifically one that will appeal to capitalist ventures (unlike the arctic circle). However, he is overly optimistic about earthly interest in Mars and the ability to raise even the smallest amount of money to build anything more than a very temporary base on Mars. Although all the theories are perfectly acceptable, money and interest may fall short except in the far future. Still I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Mars.A good ficitional accompaniment to this book is the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson (Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars). The Mars Trilogy focuses mainly on the political and social issues regarding the terraforming and settlement of Mars, there is a good amount of science in the trilogy, but money is less of an issue (reading about realistic modern economics and the political beaurocracy can be such a drag anyway).

The reader can't help but be excited by the idea of mankind reaching Mars soon after the turn of the century.Zubrin presents his argument in a clear style and at a fast moving pace. The book is intended for a scientifically literate, but not necessarily scientifically expert audience. A reader with a solid background in the space sciences may feel that the book is too easy, but most readers will be entertained without experiencing technological overload.Occasionally, Zubrin's writing shows a weakness common to self ordained prophets. Zubrin sometimes belittles opinions contrary to his own in a fashion that the reader wonders if he is receiving a fair presentation of the opposing side's viewpoint. Although Zubrin does present a convincing argument for the Mars Direct program, the program is still a paper engineering exercise without much of the detail and tradeoffs that are required in the real world."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Dr. Zubrin did a great job of bringing a lot of research about a variety of Mars related subjects into one place.His writing style is not sterile like a textbook might be, or how you would expect a 'rocket scientist' to write. Instead, he is able to present his ideas with facts, figures and calculations instead of glorious ideas of how to settle the stars. At times, the book even made me chuckle.I have read other books on this subject, and have seen documentaries regarding Mars exploration and Dr. Zubrin is arguably at the forefront of the effort to settle Mars.The book completely opened my eyes as to how easy (relatively speaking) it would be to actually settle Mars.HIGHLY recommended for anyone interested in the subject!"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Why on earth does the Kindle edition cost more than the paperback and hard cover versions?And paperback costs more than hard cover?This is either a typo, or someone trying to penalize ebooks."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"It has been two or three years since I read the book but I feel compelled to write a review.Robert Zubrin presents very convincing arguments that a manned mission to mars in the near future (before 2010) is feasable. Previously, estimates for a manned mission was in the range of $500 billion dollars. Zubrin argues that via a new approach, without any breakthroughs, such a mission would cost around one tenth that amount. With budget surplusses, hints of possible past life and recent water flows on mars, the possibility of a manned mission seems ever more compelling.Zubrin explains many technical details without delving into jargon. I found his description of fuel production on the surface to be particularly interesting.The author not only discusses a manned mission but a long term colonization of the planet.I especially recommend this to any engineering student interested in space."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"I'm saddened to say that in the 12 years since this book was published we are no further along to the vision set out here in these pages.We have turned our government into one which would rather micromanage our lives than set forth a vision for all of humanity.While the book is slightly technical in nature any amateur interested in space exploration can pick this book up and understand the implications...it would even be easy to skip some of the tech stuff and read the meat of the book.The authors lay out not only the benefit to society but the cost...in a detailed (nearly line-by-line) description of what a manned mission to Mars would cost if the government ran it and what it could cost on a shoestring budget.Simply a WOW factor. I'm sold."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"This grabbed my eye one day in a Boulder bookstore, I read a few pages and was immediately hooked. I've read like 15 Mars-related books since then and the end is not in sight. A stellar discourse on how feasible Martian exploration really is, A Case for Mars is well-researched and incredibly thorough. Perhaps its only drawback is how thorough it is at points. The ideas are truly fascinating to think about, but when he goes over the various chemical reactions and prices and energy requirements for various fuels and such, it starts getting a little confusing. For the most part, I imagine that this would be understandable even to those with a basic science background, but parts of it are pretty intense. This should be required reading for any space-related curriculum and I wish more people in Congress had read this, maybe we'd be working toward Mars now, rather than watching crystals grow in Earth orbit. Let's go to Mars!"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Zubrin is perhaps the von Braun of our generation, the visionary who will get us to Mars as von Braun got us to the moon. Unfortunately, Zubrin is not the insider that von Braun was, so it's going to be more of an uphill struggle.But this is the manifesto. It gets very technical, and spends most of the time explaining how his approach (involving generating fuel for the return trip on Mars) is technical feasible and in fact safer than most of the alternatives. It's only toward the end that he brings out Frederick Jackson Turner and espouses the frontier mentality that helped make America what it is. He proposes that Mars is the next frontier and that the colonists will be the great innovators and entrepreneurs of the future.I'm all in favor. Zubrin suggests that we could do it with 5 billion a year - a trifle, considering everything else the government spends its money on. Let's do it!"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"This book is an excellent read that goes into more than just establishing a Mars program. There are also hints as to what it takes to get any program going.Keep it cheap, keep it simple, don't get distractedThere's a lot of propaganda in Zubrin's book but that's of necessity. He's not just giving a plan, he's selling it. And it's a good buy!"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Written as if making a sales pitch (as another reviewer here has aptly stated), Zubrin paints a very convincing and realistic portrait that Mars can not only be visited by humans but colonized. Best of all, we aren't at the mercy of future development but are able to do this with present day technologies. The &quot;Challenge Approach&quot; of the government awarding large cash prizes to private entities for various accomplishments towards Mars colonization is unique, and probably the best method for accomplishing this heady but worthy challenge."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"The first half of &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; convincingly describes an economically viable, technically sound and scientifically relevant plan for a manned mission to Mars. Period.Unfortunately, there is also the other half of the book... In that part, Zubrin tries to proof why Mars is so much better than other venues (free-floating space settlements, lunar and asteroid colonies, etc) for space exploration and colonization. Nothing wrong with that, but the problem is that Zubrin is intellectually dishonest when building his arguments. They are clearly aimed at &quot;converting&quot; the uninformed general public, even though the price for that is keeping that public misinformed - and thrashing the scientifically sound work of other space researchers in the way. In that sense, Zubrin's arguments are much like those of pseudoscientific groups, like Creationists, for instance.And, of course, there is the last part of the book, when Zubrin tries to justify Mars colonization in economical terms. Well, that part is so outlandish that I would classify it as science fiction. (And perhaps not even *hard* science fiction.) There *are* books with compelling arguments about economically profitable exploration of the space (e.g., &quot;The High Frontier&quot; and &quot;Mining the Sky&quot;), but certainly &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; is not one of them."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"As many of reviewers have said, Robert Zubrin describes his plan for getting to Mars as effeciently as possible.Good points of the book are that his plan is very well thought out. He puts a lot of science in to the book, and explains it all in straightforward terms. He narrates the book in a friendly, conversational tone.A slightly negative point is that his book is mostly visionary and doesn't get into what progress has made towards the human exploration of Mars.My biggest problem with the book is that it's boring. I'm sorry to say that, but it is, at least for me. And I'm a 20-year old majoring in aerospace engineering who is actively interested in researching Mars. The thing is, the book is good at presenting the info, but not so good at providing motivation and interest needed to absorb all that info. It's written like an extended essay (thesis, reasons, supports). You know what I'm talking about. I will probably use this book more for reference than for fun reading.Maybe I'll change my opinion over time. For now, it gets 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"I have always had a fascination with astronomy. After reading this book, that fascination turned almost into an obsession with Mars. Zubrin lays out a plan that seems perfect to land the first man on Mars. This book is an interesting read, even for the non-scientist types, as Zubrin finds a healthy balance. Very interesting book and very intellect man. Not to be missed by anyone interested in space."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"This is a fascinating book -- like science fiction, only better, since it's actually do-able!

It is very readible and covers all aspects and how the exploration could be done cheaper and quicker than the NASA plans at the time."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"If 100 years from now Zubrin is known for nothing else, it will be for making the idea of exploring and settling the planet Mars seem feasible, almost inevitable. It is inevitable, it is just a matter of who will do it and whose values will become the basis of the new frontier of humanity. Mars has all the resources required to support a human population. Zubrin is an American and has lobbied NASA and the US political establishment only to fall on deaf ears time and time again (Americans can be counted on to do the right thing, but only after they have tried everything else).In this updated version of the book, the core of the Mars Direct plan remains more or less in place but he does update the book with new research and knowledge of the red planet. There is one \\"correction\\" that I want to make to a previous reviewer. The review was correct that the Kindle version of the book was the original version of the text, even though the 2011 update had been released. However, after contacting Amazon's fast and responsive Support group, they re-sent the 2011 version to my Kindle at no extra charge. So if you have problems with this please contact Support."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"I picked up this book, even though it was 15 years old, as I mourned the last flight of the Space Shuttle. I'm not old enough to remember Apollo 11, but I thought about how depressing it would be to be telling my grandkids that I remembered when we had a passenger plane that could fly at supersonic speeds across the Atlantic and when we used to have a Shuttle that could fly back and forth into space--and have them marvel that once humans had done such things.Well, if Robert Zubrin has his way, the future will have its own exciting conquests--as we extend our reach to Mars. In this book, he lays out a plan for how we could send humans to Mars within 10 years for $50 billion (in '96 dollars) and using mostly currently understood technology.I was very excited as I read through this and I found his argument for such an exploration compelling. He centered his argument on the idea of how the frontier has served as a forge for the American Spirit, and that with the closing of the frontier and the sense that scientific discovery has somewhat slowed, we need to attempt a challenge like this to reenergize our minds and spirits.Now, he admits he is an optimist, and some of what he projects is pretty rosy. For example, when discussing population growth in the colonization phase, he assumes 50/50 male/female colonists and a fertility rate of 3.5--both of those I would question.However, I liked his idea of a direct mission that is lean and self sustaining. I think that is the right heading. If you enjoy science fiction and ever dream of humans moving beyond our island home, you will enjoy this book. You may disagree with some of his ideas, but he definitely has given this a lot of thought.In his book Rocket Men, Craig Nelson reported that all three of modern rocketry's founders were inspired by Jules' Verne's From the Earth to the Moon. I find it very likely that future rocket scientists will cite The Case for Mars as their inspiration."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Dr Robert Zubrin is arguably the best qualified and strongest advocate for making Mars the destination of choice in a realistic and affordable program of regular Mars travel, exploration and settlement. Mars is our nearest neighbor planet in the solar system. It has the same area of land surface as Earth, one third the gravity, and as we now know, reclaimable water.At the heart of Zubrin's passion is a three-fold belief. First, Mars is the logical successor both to the Apollo moon landings, which ran out of steam by reason of disgraced President Nixon's slashing of that program, and to the concluded 30-years of space shuttles. Second, Mars is the new frontier not only in imagination but literally in the pioneering journeys which have characterized human history. Last, says the author here as well as in his tireless speaking to hundreds of groups (including the best minds in rocketry and other space science) we not only CAN think of leaving our home planet, we MUST develop the knowledge and skill to do so. One day the human race will be out among the stars, and - depending upon whether you are an optimist or a pessimist - it will be either because we resolutely expanded, or else barely escaped a ruined Earth.

This is not your parent's Mars.In this deep and enthralling book, Robert Zubrin lays out, point by point, his method of madness for traversing the intergalactic distances and heading to Mars. Using his Mars Direct plan, we seen a plausible situation in which we could take Mars within the next decade, and begin pushing our boundaries to the so called \\"final frontier.\\"Not only does he provide the means on a very achievable time table, he also makes arguments against the so called \\"dragons\\" on the way to Mars, namely the threats of solar radiation and other such impacts. Yet, the effect of these are so negligible on the overall mission, Zubrin has us believe that yes, Mars is attainable in our generation.After we get there, however, Zubrin takes another ambitious step towards the future: terraforming. He sees Mars as an ecological playground. one that we can change and make habitable for the expansion of earth.All in all, this book is the Mars Bible for the era. It shows us the most sound way to get across the vast distance, stay on the surface, and return safely, while maximizing our scientific payout for the mission. Hopefully, one day we can realize Robert Zubrin's dream and land on Mars within the next decade."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"This book was a real eye-opener. The plan developed by Zubrin (and others) is a great piece of engineering. Elegant, robust, cost-effective. It doesn't turn on technologies yet to be realized, and doesn't lobby for a pure research plan (and attendant budget) to be sent their way.Zubrin first lays out the basic plan, how shuttle-derived and/or Apollo launch vehicles can be used. Nuclear-thermal propulsion would be nice, but they're not necessary. With these vehicles, a steady stream of crew transport and earth-return vehicles can be sent to Mars with every 2-year launch window. This all can be done for a very reasonable percentage of NASA's budget, spread over time.Zubrin takes time to argue against potential objections, including radiation exposure and crew psychological effects. He makes the non-intuitive, but persuasive argument that a longer mission actually reduces overall exposure. And he argues forcefully and eloquently for using the resources of Mars, or In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) -- for return rocket propulsion, oxygen, water, among other necessities. ISRU is one of the best ideas of the plan, and really the main driver which makes many aspects practical.One problem I found with the book was in the chapters discussing far-term plans, such as terraforming. Given the elegance and detail of the chapters dealing with the main plan, I found the far-term stuff to be too vague and pie-in-the-sky. Perhaps better suited to a Scientific American article separate from the book. I also would have like more detailed plans of what the crews can accomplish on the surface of Mars. Zubrin's plan gives the crew a large amount of surface time to explore and develop, which is a great quality. I would have liked to hear more about what they'd be doing. This may be described more in Zubrin's follow-on book, \\"Mars on Earth.\\"Overall though, this book was very exciting, and had many great ideas. Given the fact that Michael Griffin was an early convert to Zubrin's way of thinking, and Griffin has just become NASA administrator, then who knows what the future may bring?"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Memories:Canaveral, freeze dried ice cream, liftoff thunder, Flash Gordon, model rockets, Star Trek, Battlestar Gallactica, Buck Rogers, Erwin Allen, telescope in the back yard, cold winter nights, shooting stars, &quot;Dad, can I be an astronaut?&quot; &quot;Sure son, you can be anything you want to be&quot;, Star Wars, 2001, black holes, worm holes, gateways to another univers, comets, &quot;Zur and the Kodan Armada&quot;, countless books, &quot;Hey, put the highbeams on, then the snow looks like Warp Speed!&quot;, Robotech, Star Blazers, &quot;It would be an awful wast of space...&quot;, Skylab, Apollo, Gemini, Mercury, &quot;one giant leap&quot;John F.

But he's not a short-term thinker; much of the book deals with his ideas of Mars colonization and the eventual terraformation of the planet. Although much of it may be overly optimistic, there are no proposals which seem impossible; everything Zubrin discusses in this could, in theory, be done. Some of the best writing within the book deals not with the technical aspects of sending a mission to Mars, but Zubrin's heartfelt reasons for WHY such a mission should be sent in the first place. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"THE CASE FOR MARS is one of the best books I have read this year. When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon in 1969, I remember sitting glued to our TV. It was one of the most memorable moments in my life. I had been fascinated with space and the possibility that any of us might soon be able to go there since I was 9 or 10.I was convinced that, by the time I was 25 or 30, I personally would have that chance. I'm now 48 and I've given up any hope that John Q. Citizen will make regular trips into space in my lifetime.Once we, as a nation, had &quot;won&quot; the space race, our government felt we could better spend our money on &quot;important&quot; things like the arms race.Our citizens, too, seemed to have lost the vision of new worlds to explore and, yes, new worlds to settle. Some even seemed to believe that it was somehow immoral to consider settling new worlds when we'd made such a mess of our own.For my part, I always believed that space exploration was one of the best purposes to which we could devote our collective efforts. Time and again, the space race had demonstrated that stretching into new frontiers requires new technologies, which in turn benefit everyday life. Furthermore, cooperative efforts between nations on so grand a scale could help to break down those barriers of distrust and prejudice which have plagued mankind since the beginning of time.By the 1980s and 90s, what was being done in the way of space exploration had turned into very large, very expensive projects and all too often, very expensive failures. The idea of going to and settling someplace like Mars, with this mindset, seemed prohibitively expensive.To my thinking, the International Space Station is typical of that type of shortsighted planning. Very expensive, very small advance, if any, from where we've already gone. Perhaps the only thing I see in its favor is that it is an international, cooperative effort.In THE CASE FOR MARS Robert Zubrin and Richard Wagner make a compelling argument that going to Mars, settling Mars, and even terraforming Mars are not only reasonable goals, but they are goals that do not require vast new technologies. Existing technologies, with some modifications, can take us to the Red Planet and even convert it into a second Earth.The book is written as an appeal to common citizens to reclaim their heritage of exploration and the wonder that comes with it and to step once and for all out of the cradle in which we have too long spent our infancy.You don't have to be a rocket scientist to read this book. Zubrin is a rocket scientist and his talent for explaining step by step how to get to and settle Mars is impressive.&quot;Earth is the cradle of humanity but we can not stay in the cradle forever.&quot;Konstantin Tsiolkovsky"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"The cover image says it is the updated edition, but don't be fooled.The kindle version, uploaded when the new edition came out and with the same cover as the updated edition is actually the 1996 version of the book.

He is a brilliant, funny, visionary, cantankerous engineer who has become a serious leader in the space advocacy community. His personal style comes across in his writing. He's a bright guy with a serious ax to grind about Mars, how we should get there, and how NASA is screwing up.Most of his criticism is based upon NASA's handling of &quot;the 90-Day Report,&quot; the report the agency submitted to President Bush after he called for a manned mission to Mars. What the scientists at NASA came up with was a huge, visionary program that would require every new technology known to manned space activity, from solar power to zero-gravity construction to cold fusion. Oh yeah, a lot of that hasn't been invented yet, will take 30 years to accomplish, and will cost taxpayers $450 billion. It is the bureaucratic mindset that sets Zubrin off.Mixed in with all the specific technical information are history lessons about exploration and its difficulties, as well as insights on why we need to explore and the value of Mars itself. Since the release of &quot;The Case for Mars,&quot; Dr. Zubrin has formed his own space advocacy group called The Mars Society, which is already setting up its own Mars habitat simulator in an arctic desert of Canada.He has also taken to describing ways in which the government can best fund the mission, such as offering a &quot;Mars Prize&quot; of $30 billion that would only be awarded to a successful mission. Zubrin shamelessly invokes Kennedy, Lindbergh, Frederick Jackson Turner, and others, and jumps in with a &quot;can-do&quot; attitude that will remind the reader of NASA or &quot;Star Trek&quot; in their better days. After reading Zubrin, you find yourself wondering, &quot;Jeez, why AREN'T we going?&quot;Zubrin also articulates his belief in the value of frontiers. A frontier provides the hope for escape from current problems--government, social hierarchies, ennui. A frontier can generate new materials (like the gold out of California), new ideas of government and freedom, and more potential for innovation and upward mobility. Governments that have to cope with an expanding, dynamic society cannot turn their energies toward controlling limited resources and a stable population. Anyhow, that's one theory.

Not only that, after reading this book, you will most likely end up a convert of Dr. Zubrin's way of getting to Mars (which is not as popular as it deserves to be).He has such a simple way of explaining everything, even the most complex issues.

Your future is in doubt. The plausible reality of near-term interplanetary exploration has future Martians hurling through space in &quot;tuna can&quot; craft, not &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;-class ships. As the author Zubrin concisely and with a wry humorous approach describes, NASA's executives needed a similar wake-up call to put aside their Star Trek fantasies and get serious about a Mars program. In the classic example of an elephant being &quot;a mouse designed to government specifications&quot;, Zubrin debunks the NASA plan for Mars, budgeted for $450 billion, to a feasible $20 billion. Relentless in striving to achieve 100% efficiency for mission design, even the crew is decidely non-trekkie. There's no Mr. Sulu or Bones nor even Capt. Kirk. Only two Mr. Spocks and two Scottys get to go.In one of many engaging comparisons to historical explorations, NASA is seen as the Imperial British, fatallly fumbling and bumbling their way in the Arctic wastelands while other explorers &quot;live off the land&quot; and expand their horizons. Economic forces driving the colonization of Mars are also compared to the exploitation of the &quot;New World&quot; by the powerful countires of Old Europe. However, the most intriguing aspects of the author's proposal is the reliance not on future technologies to be developed &quot;sometime&quot; but instead on gaslight-era technologies from the 1890's. The author's &quot;Mars Direct&quot; plan would establish low-tech chemical plants on the surface to firmly entrench the Martian pioneers by utilizing native resources. Instead of green-glassed domes built from thermoplastics and steel, Zubrin's colonies will be built from Martian brick and mortar. The book is filled with similar common-sense ideas for the exploration and colonization of Mars that will definitely make you do a 180 from any science fiction notions you may have about Robinson Crusoe on Mars.If you like to dress up in a velvet uniform and go around saying &quot;make it so&quot; into your plastic communicator, please don't read this book. However, if you got a chill every time you looked at the moon after the Apollo missions, you need to read this cover-to-cover in one sitting.

After you read Zubrin's and Wagner's book you'll wonder why humans aren't walking on Mars today .An excellent book, with a compelling message, in clear language. NASA should immediately adopt this plan for a &quot;doable&quot; manned mission to Mars within the next few years. -- Lou Varricchi"},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"I heard Robert Zubrin speak on the MARS DIRECT plan a year ago, and was impressed with the thoroughness of the planning.His vision is as thrilling as the first plans to journey to the Moon.But the US government of today is not as intelligent or as capable as the one that sent man to the Moon. It could probably not carry out Zubrin's plan.I believe the MARS DIRECT trip will be planned and executed by private interests.The Case for Mars should be a landmark book, one that will be looked back on as the one that provided the impetus to get men serious about colonizing Mars."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"Zubrin and Wagner's no-nonsense can-do approach to Mars explorationis a treat to read and a boost to the spirit.They explain complex science using concrete examples and plain-talking English.As insiders in the realm of space policy, they are able to explain the crucialdetails about a Mars mission such as types of vehicles and routes to the red planet.They also don't hesitate toto provide insights about the political motivations at play in the planning of such a large-scale expedition.The authors are convincing and entertaining in their comparisons of a Mars expedition toColumbus' travels, and of Amundsen's low budget approach to finding theNorthwest passage to the Mars-Direct plan. Most of all I wasuplifted by the possibility that in my lifetime humanity willbe once again, doing something really great, to benefit futuregenerations in an earth-shattering kind of way."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"I have been interested in the space program for years, and after several years of wondering if Mars would ever be within human reach, I am thoroughly convinced. Contrary to readers who apparently skimmed the book, Zubrin does indicate a variety of launch vehicles, including the Saturn V but also a number of Russian and recent American developments. He also calculates the costs of restarting the Saturn V program and figures them into his equations. He gives weight to monetary concerns that NASA officials seem to have neglected, concerns that deter some politicians and solutions that could make believers of them.His reasons for going to Mars also make sense. One element, found in five times the abundance on Mars as on Earth, sells on the free market at thousands of US dollars to the kilo. Scientific research is also a benefit, and the discovery of possible Martian life would provide insights into what genetic elements are universal to all life, and which are native to Terra Prima. The medical implications for the global community are staggering.And contrary to belief, the discovery of life off of the Earth does not discount religion, it is simply a blow to certain, and then only some, Creationists. As a religious person, a born-again Christian, in fact, I would not find the implications of alien life deterring, but exciting, and possibly, should there be intelligent life, an opportunity for evangelism. The religious argument is without merit.The book is wholly inspiring, and the Mars Direct and Mars Semi-Direct programs needs to be heard in the halls of Congress. An excellent read."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"I've never been what I'd call a space buff, but I found this book to be fascinating on many levels. Zubrin's lush detail on how the planet Mars could be made over into a habitable planet was delectable - I didn't want it to end. And his theory on the value of conquering a new frontier and it's therapeutic effects on our modern day malaise was inspired. This book provided a welcome journey to someplace completely new. I admit I skimmed through some of the more densely written rocket science chapters, but it's there if you want it."},{"Title":"The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must","review":"This book is one of the few books that I have read on the subject of Mars exploration that has been written by an expert in the field. It is therefore well informed and Highly Interesting. Robert Zubrin put forward a convincing plan to bring man to the red planet. Unfortunately in the second part of the book the author goes a bit beyond his field. The economic arguments for colonizing mars are at time doubtful and naive. The plan to terraform Mars appears to be more science fiction than science. Finally the philosophical reason for the colonization are a matter of opinion that might not be shared by all. Over all the book is interesting, but one feels that the author should have more to the subject he knows well and not venture out to much into speculation, which blunt the overall effect of the book"},{"Title":"Long George Alley","review":"Once again, a potential great book is full of trash. This book is about a horrid time in US History, written in different perspectives, but has an author who thinks that filth will sell a book. It was pretty much impossible to read it (I actually didn't finish it because I couldn't get through the language) and there's no way that I can recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Lights of Home: A Century of Latin American Writers in Paris","review":"This is a superb book that can be highly recommended for everyone interested in Latin American literature, the sociology of literature in general, creativity and the lives of writers. Author Jason Weiss writes clearly and has complete command of all the relevant primary and secondary literature. The book is valuable because it fills an important gap in literary scholarship by analysing in detail the enormous importance of Paris for the whole phenomenon of Latin American literature. Knowledge of the role of Paris in the lives of these writers is essential for any reader's understanding of their works. Mr. Weiss provides the historical background by discussing the changing perception of Paris throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. He then discusses in roughly chronological order the Parisian experiences of about two dozen important writers from Rub&eacute;n Dar&iacute;o to Hector Bianciotti. In the context of each life, he discusses the reasons, personal and often political, that brought the person to Paris, how they lived, whom they knew and how they worked. The book is, however, much more than a mere collection of biographical sketches; the discussion is enriched by intelligent literary criticism that shows how the Parisian experience became a lens through which these writers saw the Latin American world that is the subject of so many of their works. The book is also valuable because of its excellent discussion of the broader topic of writers in exile or at least living abroad and writing of home, and sometimes even writing in a new language. Finally, throughout the book Mr. Weiss never forgets to examine the reception of Latin American literature in France."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Out of all the polls that have been published since Clinton's presidency, the most revealing was the one taken right after he was impeached. That poll showed a fascinating fact. Those who knew about Clinton's other crimes (rapes, assaults, blackmail, death threats, etc.), thought he should have been removed from office, and those who didn't know about his other crimes thought he was just an innocent victim, being unfairly attacked because he was liberal. The truth is leaking out, slowly but surely, and this book helps to make sense of the damage that was done during Clinton's terms. The poor folks who have been fooled by Clinton, and who have been taken in by his fake version of love, will be affected and hurt the most. This book explores that subject, in depth, and you can tell its a great book by all the reviews it gets. It is a genuine classic, and I suggest you buy it, and then have it bound by a professional binder. No other book could sum up the 90's better than this one."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Maybe political pundits or media journalists were outraged or split when it came to the President's misbehavior, but, by and large, the American people were not. Dr. Bennett shows in his book that the American people were still giving a man who committed illegal and immoral acts high approval ratings even though he did not deserve them. Most people just looked at the economy, (which Clinton did not really help as much as many want to say), and looked the other way. This could and probably will have future grim effects on this country.Dr. Bennett wisely took every argument that a Clinton defender could make and refuted the claims. If we accept unacceptable behavior, we in America have for most intents and purposes given up on our public officials. Bennett tries to explain that if we only care about our own position in the world, and not judge behavior that should be condemned, our nation will experience a cultural and moral collapse.The real shame was the examples of &quot;death of outrage&quot;. So many people, including, Reverend Billy Graham did not seem to care about the President's inexcusable actions. The comments by Ann Landers did give me a good chuckle, though. She seems to have abandoned her convictions, if she had any to start with.Overall, Dr. Bennett's book is a quick, pleasurable read that unfortunately deals with a topic that had to be talked about. Because people like Dr. Bennett actually care for our nation, maybe some of that death will come back to life."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Reading this, some 11 years after the Lewinsky trial, helps to add a certain amount of context to the current (Obama) administration. With the resurgence of characters like Rahm Emanuel, Hillary Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and James Carville to the national political stage ... it is important to review the common political history of these figures and their roles in the current national political culture.\\"The Death of Outrage\\" is as much about the habitual (some would say obsessive ... in Bill Clinton's case) abuse of power and hording of influence, regardless of ethics or morality, by national political figures and their talking heads. This book is a timely and refreshing review of the hypocrisy of those who have historically supported the special counsel law, only to refute it when their party was the subject of investigation. Secretary Bennett is fair in this assessment as well, pointing out the flip-flopping observable by both sides of the aisle depending on whether it was Nixon's impeachment hearings, Reagan's Iran-Contra investigation, or Clinton's abuse of power investigation.The importance of this book is overwhelming. In an age dominated by agenda driven media (you can target any network news, CNN, Fox, they are all agenda driven), the ability to access information like this is critical to having a mature and balanced opinion on issues that affect our political culture and the leadership of this nation. This book dives into a subject that most citizens don't truly understand ... the special counsel law, and vindicates a man unjustly lambasted by a hostile presidential administration who specialized in the unwarranted subjugation of individuals' public images and the routine character assassination of those who dared question Bill Clinton's honesty and integrity.For Clinton supporters and apologists, this book is a must read. Secretary Bennett is very fair in his presentation of the facts, and in his assessment of the quality of the individuals involved. Judge Starr was publicly crucified in the media by James Carville, Hillary Clinton, Rahm Emanuel, and others from inside the Clinton compound ... and the more we learn about Starr, the more we see the case as not just being a sex-obsessed tyrant on a rampage. We see a methodical and respected judge who was called in by the Attorney General (Janet Reno) to investigate evidence of criminal acts of perjury and coercion and the abuse of power. We see a man whose investigation was reduced in the media to a sexually explicit witch hunt, as that was the only way to diminish the acts of the sitting president in the public's view to little more than a personal matter.This book bravely calls into question the tactics of a precise and mechanical machine of political influence and highlights corruption of the most insidious kind ... the kind that alleviates the powerful from responsibility."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"My outrage over the wide-spread scandals that have entangled this Administration like a noose around our American necks goes much further than a 134 page book. Bill Bennett could have conceivably written much,much more..but I guess that goes to the core of his concept. Unfortunately, many Americans, who have been over-stimulated by the constant onslaught of clandestine behaviors of the Clinton Administration, simply no longer care. Hence, the death of outrage. I get it. Do you?"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Mr. Bennett, in lay person terms, takes apart &quot;it's all just about sex&quot;, spun hourly by the White House &quot;Spin Doctors&quot;. It address, head on, that it is more than a good economy, budget deficits and the likes.Is there a need for role models? Yes! Is our present U.S. President what the &quot;baby boomers&quot; bring to the new century for as a leading role modle? Hopefully no! Mr. Bennett brings it back to what we all should be looking at, prejury, and obstruction of justice at every turn. Bill Clinton's approach to every day life can be summmed up best, &quot;wrong is right based on my defination of words&quot;. And right can be twisted as easily to wrong if it serves my purpose.I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks all of this is much a do about nothing."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Mr. Bennett has taken the step to hopefully wake up the public. Look back and see where we have been and what has become of OUR country's lifestyle. This book shows the facts and gives a moral stand to each. My, have we as a country been too busy making money and hanging onto our own little richness to notice the sludge in DC? Mr. Bennett reminds those who read with openness that we have let our heritage go to the dogs. Lies upon lies seems to be the tale. Must READ!"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"A great book outlining the moral morass of America. People who lack common sense and any moral proclivities will not like it, but those who do believe that values do have a basis for a functioning society will enjoy this book. Socialists and liberal are encouraged to keep an open mind and assess their own values."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"&quot;The Death of Outrage&quot; is a profound, excellent book that not only sums up the arguments against Bill Clinton and his defenders, but also presents new insights and angles to destroy their views. Bennett eloquently defends the ideals that Clinton and his cohorts have carelessly -- or intentionally -- undermined in their defense of the indefensible."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Finally a book that truly documents the scandle surrounding the Clinton presidency. Bill Bennett tackles the issues with vigor and focus and offers a fresh perspective on what Bill Clinton is about. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to look beyond the coverage on the evening news. The Death of Outrage dispells the myths and uncovers the legal ease surrounding this scandal. It is a must read for all concerned Americans."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Amusingly, the 1 and 2 star reviews dwell on &quot;right to privacy&quot; and &quot;judge not lest ye be judged&quot;. Bennet clearly exposes the disingenuous and self serving aspects of a president who is interested in no more that his political and legal hide while trying to protect his place in history. Wake up America!"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Bennett pulls no punches in his critique of President Clinton. He begins his book by acknowledging that he is a critic of the President. He builds credibilty by stating that this was not always the case. As education secretary he praised Clinton for his education reform while he was governor of Arkansas. That being said, he describes the reasons why he is now very critical of Clinton: an overflow of coruption throughout his administration. Bennett systamatically describes the main arguments that Clinton defenders are using. He then goes on to argue why, in his opinion, they do not measure under intellectual scrutiny. He addresses the bogus notion that this is &quot;all about sex between two consenting adults,&quot; to the theological arguments that Clinton's supporters are citing. Bennett attacks some defenses more effectively than others, but on the whole he is successful. It is important to note that Bennett is not simply &quot;preaching to the choir.&quot; The purpose of his book is to appeal to the middle ground that is uncertain about Clinton's ability. I enjoyed this book because it cuts to the chase and Bennett makes reading about a seven month old scandal interesting. The only criticism I have is that Bennett runs through all of the Clinton scandals like a dirty laundry list. It is, however, an effective case against Clinton."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"What more can be said about Bennett's book than the reactions to it from those on the left. Bennett knows how to frustrate those who defend the likes of Clinton: employ logic and analytic philosophy against them. Wonderful book by a man who lives the virtues."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This is a very logical, clear, good argument of a decline in American culture and how that decline is reflected in the acceptance of Bill Clinton's behavior by many Americans. Those who support Clinton should really give this book a chance. Bennett makes some very thought-provoking statements about the U.S. Constitution which are worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"A mere glance at other reviews shows that one-star ratings usually are non-factually dismissive, or address totally different subjects than the subject of this book (which was probably unread). Read this book first for the real reason half of America was outraged -- this isn't a book about the justifiable impeachment of the only elected president to undergo that indignity, but rather a philosophical and soft-spoken analysis that examines the exercised rhetoric of those who would demean themselves by defending the indefensible."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"It is interesting to note that people either love this book or hate it for it almost always gets either five stars or one star. And the &quot;one star&quot; folks are very fond of using terms such as &quot;holier than thou&quot; and &quot;puritanical&quot; to describe Bennett's position. It is my opinion that when you have the evidence on your side, you use the evidence to support your assertions--which is precisely what Bennett does. When you have no meaningful evidence, you pound the table and start calling the other side names or blow smoke screens with facts to do not matter.I feel that Bennett shows tremendous courage and leadership by unabashedly espousing good, moral principles and supporting his positions with sound, logical judgement. That is why this is such an EXCELLENT book! He successfully outlines exactly why we, as American citizens, should be outraged by what is going on in the White House right now. Right is right and wrong is wrong--Bennett makes no excuses.Bennett's best point--being &quot;judgmental&quot; is key to any responsible society. He states, &quot;Without being 'judgmental,' Americans would never have put an end to slavery, outlawed child labor, emancipated women, or ushered in the civil rights movement. Nor would we have prevailed against Nazism and Soviet communism, or known how to explain our opposition.&quot; Not only is it good that we judge our president--it is essential to the continued existance of this nation!Read this book and help make this country what the Constitution intends it to be!"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Once again, Mr. Bennett has astounded the masses by delivering another well written truth about morality and the culture of America, this time about Bill Clinton. A must read for all those who read James Carville's book to set their head on straight again."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This book supports justice and truth in this country. Mr. Bennett communicates his views in a professional, rational and thoughtful manner. He is a person worthy of respect and admiration. If justice prevails, we will all benefit. If justice does not, we will all suffer as we have been over this past year. An important fallacy of the Clinton crew that Mr. Bennett pointed out in this book is this - You can say you are for women in general and then treat women in particular poorly. The truth in this book is inspiring. I strongly recommend this book - especially to parents. You will feel glad to know there is someone as passionate and gifted working for our current and future collective moral health. We must assist in this endeavor. Let's do all we can to promote the well-being of our society, by standing up for what is crucial to its survival - TRUTH, DECENCY, LAW, HONOR, KINDNESS AND COURAGE."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This book is excellent. Mr. Bennett takes each one of the Clinton defenses and shows how they are flawed. He also defends Mr. Starr's credibility as a prosecutor, and tells how, ironically, Hillary Clinton's stance today on impeachment is exactly opposite of that she had during the Nixon impeachment inquiries. This book is straight-forward and uses alot of logic and reason to prove a very valuable point, that if Americans do not stand up today for absolute ethics then we will not have ethics anymore."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This is a thoughtful (to those who agree) compendium of the case against Clinton. The obvious thesis: he assaults American ideals. What isn't included is an equally thorough explanation of why our collective response has, to date, been passive approval. So just what killed outrage? And, what does it's death mean for our future? The partisan perspective is mild, and unavoidable. It's fairly balanced by recollections of the Mother of all Gates--water. Had it been that very rare tome that sways minds inclined to the contrary, it would merit 5 stars. A more thorough crack at what (more than Bill) killed outrage--a four star rating. An alternative title directed toward the grim reaper of outrages's death, James Carville: It's about purjury, stupid."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"When I initially saw this book, I thought it was probably just another finger-pointing, they said, he said, accusation-filled book about an already disgraced president. In this case, I was dead wrong. William Bennett's book, The Death of Outrage, is a masterful, carefully crafted dismantling of the half-truths, misdirected blame, deception, and outright lies that have protected President Bill Clinton and his administration. Bennett lays out the simple facts and historic accounts for the reader to see and digest. Over and over Bennett presents the facts and then asks the all important question, \\"Why is there so little outrage over this?\\"In his introduction, Bennett admits he is a well-known critic of President Clinton. But he also admits that it hasn't always been that way. According to Bennett, he was impressed with some of then Governor Clinton's public policies and his work on education reform, and even appointed Hillary Clinton to an education commission. But over the years, Bennett says he began changing his opinion of Bill Clinton as more and more evidence of deep corruption mounted. The allegations of suborning perjury, making false and misleading statements under oath, and obstruction of justice, the truth of which were clear and undeniable. Had we returned to the era of Nixon-style politics?Bennett builds a solid case for public outrage chapter by chapter. Each chapter covers and then uncovers another cloak of Clinton deception - Sex, Character, Politics, Investigations--Ken Starr, Law, and Judgment. Then Bennett adds his own conclusion and what he calls an Afterword, where he quickly brings the reader up to date on matters pertaining to Clinton's legal troubles. Then he adds a very interesting Postscript containing 10 important questions he wants the reader to consider concerning Bill Clinton and his presidency. He presents these as summary questions drawn from each of the six chapters. Together, they read like a checklist and ask the reader to consider whether these are acceptable traits and moral philosophy that describe the kind of person Americans should desire in their leadership. In a nutshell, Bennett summarizes his book into 10 essential questions!As if what Bennett has already provided isn't enough, he concludes the book with an amazing appendix entitled, \\"The Nixon and Clinton Administration Scandals: A Comparison.\\" This section in itself could be made into a pamphlet for those who still think that America's economic well-being is the most important measure of presidential performance, and not the honest character and integrity of our leaders.Bennett's skilled research, analysis and superb writing style make it clear by the end of the book that President Clinton's troubles were not a result of a \\"vast, right-wing conspiracy,\\" but the result of his own wrong doings.If after reading what Clinton did to America and our American ideals there is no felt outrage, then what Bennett says is true--our justified outrage has been put to death by our cold, senseless indifference."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"How does it feel to have your life destroyed by other people making hay out of your personal weaknesses?What goes around comes around, Billy Boy!Feel the pain, man.

Better men than you were mocked for feeling the pain of others.Maybe after this, you'll understand that forgiveness, tolerance, and understanding are virtues, and hypocrisy is not.Seems to me that there is more reason to burn Bennett books than smash Dixie Chicks CD's.

I long for a day when the two nations of the United States (The &quot;right&quot; wing and everybody else) will be healed. Perhaps this is just a resurfacing of an even older wound, namely the Civil War. The Republicans of the South (and elsewhere) continually defending the Confederate battle flag (note: it was only a battle flag, not the CSA national flag) and by proxy segregation and slavery. It is with bitter irony that a Republican freed the slaves, since now they are the party of the elite.This book is like all the other Clinton bashing books, high on venom, low on truth.

Bennett's shock- shock! at Clinton was revealed to be pure partisanship this weekend as he praised Bush's drunk driving and lying about it. If Bennett is going to pose as a voice of virtue, he should see the log in the eye of Republicans as well as that in the eye of Democrats. I don't know how he sleeps at night.This book is a slapdash, tediously written, utter intellectual sham, written purely with profit and politcs in mind. I can't imagine anyone enjoying it, apart from bone-deep Clinton haters and Democrats who love getting angry as Bennett lies, distorts, and prostletyzes to the choir."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"The best thing that can be said about Bill Bennet's new book is that it is a grammatically correct essay printed on good quality bond paper. It documents the alleged evils of the Clinton administration and attempts to elaborate on the absurd premise that the country has not demonstrated sufficient outrage over the Lewinsky matter. Obviously, the writer of this book is outraged, as are the countless career outraged-folks on TV like Pat Buchanan, Ann Coulter, Kate O'Bierne, Chris Matthews, Arianna Huffington, Rush Limbaugh, Pat Robertson, Ollie North, Jonathan Turley, Mona Cheren, Bayh Buchanan, Robert Bork, Stuart Taylor, Bill Kristol, George Will, Joseph DeGenova, ......etc., as well as all of their devoted listeners and followers. These outraged citizens of cable tv represent a larger group than those who expressed outrage over slavery and discrimination or about any other human atrocity in the history of mankind. The book calls for outrage, yet never explains why there should be more outrage over the Lewinsky matter than the intolerably massive amount that already exists. The outrage has been flooding the planet 24 hours-a-day through at least a half-dozen cable channels, hundreds of AM radio stations, and several thousand magazines' and newspapers' editorial columns, not to mention the evergrowing number of outraged websites. And of course there are the infinite outraged books, like this one, written by the infinite outraged Geraldo and Larry King guests. Just how much more outrage do we need? Perhaps he means that he would like to see the outrage take on a more palpable form, such as a mass protest in front of the white house, or a mass e-mail campaign to the congress, or maybe a public stoning of the Clintons. Well, if all of these outraged citizens could get off of their behinds and stop yakking for two minutes, maybe they could accomplish something revolutionary. Alas, these well-fed, lethargic carnivores are capable of doing nothing of the sort. Not surprisingly, the book conveniently neglects to ponder the lack of public outrage over Dan Burton, Henry Hyde, Bob Livingston and Helen Chenowith rolling around in bed ... god-only-knows what else and then (presumably) wiping themselves clean before walking into the Capital Building to sit in judgement of the president. But the author is very, very, very upset that the public isn't rioting in the streets over the President recieving oral sex and then lying about it. All in all, Bennet has written a fine book if you are a deluded moralist full of irrational hatred for Clinton and the liberals."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Wouldn't it be a better idea to issue a hollowed out version of Bennett &amp; Heston's book so as to afford a place to hide my Smith &amp; Wesson 38."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Methinks the self-proclaimed pillar of virtue named Bennett doth protest too much. He does casuistic cartwheels and Puritan pirouettes in order to project continuing Republican shame over Watergate onto the Clintons: a stomped-to-death tactic that does not, has not, and shall not yield another bitter grape, let alone the wine of salvation. Bennett's collage of Utopian morality, tired, glittering denials of human nature, and one self-replicating argumentum ad hominem after another speaks volumes about the hypocrisy, cynicism, and self-serving affronts to critical reason that will come to be seen as the true Reagan legacy. But why expect more of a failed &quot;Drug Czar&quot;, who never quite succeeded in recovering from his addiction to tobacco?

It is short, thus making it very readable in a short amount of time, and the way Mr. Bennett offers first the Clinton apologists views, followed by his own assessment of the fallibility of these arguments was the best way to present his argument.The book was especially easy to read and agree with because he uses sheer moral reasoning. The views presented are timeless, and by no means &quot;out of date.&quot; The reason people say that his morals are &quot;out of date&quot; is because some of the morals advocated by our Founding Fathers have been abandoned and are now found abhorrable by those who place hedonism above morality. That is why those who disagree with this book decry it.This book is for anyone who wants to aquaint or reaquaint themselves with the morality treasured by the Founders of this country."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"William Bennett, former drug czar and Secretary of Education under Ronald Reagan wrote this book in the midst of the Lewinsky-Clinton media circus. The book takes a close look at the comments made by FOB's (Friends of Bill) in the media who rushed to excuse the ... behavior of our &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot;. The book is a very quick read. I breezed through it in two hours.Bennett organizes his book under broad topics, such as &quot;Law&quot; or &quot;Ken Starr&quot;, and then proceeds to list the vacuous comments made by such &quot;intellectuals&quot; as Geraldo Rivera or ... James Carville. Bennett then goes into attack mode, and demolishes every argument and exposes every hypocrisy that these people [Rivera, Carville, et al] present. What's amazing is that Bennett does it in such a laid back, non-threatening style. I kept wishing he'd get a little angry with his comments, or deliver some stinging slaps on the mug of the media. I think that Bennett is the consumate conservative; restrained, calm and thoughtful. ... Bennett's book might have had more punch if he had jacked up the tone a bit. In the media saturated culture we live in, it is almost necessary to resort to screaming just to get yourself heard. Still, Bennett delivers his broadsides with deadly accuracy. I roared with laughter when he quoted Dan Quayle's comment that the new crime bill should be &quot;three interns and you're out&quot;. Who knew Quayle had it in him?The best part of this book can be found in an appendix, where Bennett shows the similarities between the Clinton and Nixon scandals. He uses comments made by Nixon and Clinton that both say the same thing about a certain accusation made against them. We all know what happened to Nixon. Why didn't the same thing happen to Clinton? Bennett shows in his arguments that when it was a Republican under fire, all is fair. When the tables are turned, it is a different story.Read this book."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Mr. Bennett said at one point that he had lived a very full life before he married; therefore, it was unlikely that he would ever run for president (thank God). Considering his totally negligible effects on either the Drug War or Education (two real jobs he had in previous admininstrations), one wonders why anyone pays any attention to his pronouncements. Isn't he just like any other media outlet--out to cash in on the Clinton-Lewinsky affair? As far as I can tell, this situation has been a financial bonanza for anyone who wants to cash in on an unfortunate and regrettable situation. The one thing about which I am certain is that the American people are not morally deficient; rather, we can all envision what it would be like to have the most personal aspects of our lives exposed to the public. We see such things every day as people are pursued by the media when their relatives are murdered, killed in accidents, or arrested for an alleged crime. Can't we all relate when a reporter asks: &quot;How do you feel?&quot; Private morality has little to do with public morality; if it did Bennett would be excoriating his fellow Republicans for accepting money from tobacco interests.

William Bennett's book enables one to gain perspective on the influence of poor presidetial character on the American culture. The president's nose only grows longer as the country waits to respond to his pattern of denial. The Death of Outrage should give this country a reason to respond, and a reason to have &quot;Rebirth of Courage.&quot; We need a new morality based on the virtues that have helped America grow strong. Bill Bennett speaks eloquently and authoritatively for those of us who believe America should continue to be based on strong moral values. Values that are based simply on relativism rather than truth result in clever manipulation of the truth. The clever, yet obvious, schemes of Bill Clinton have returned to haunt him. Ironically, the federal government sent the nation's schools comprehensive guidelines by which to develop curricula to teach alternative types of sexual relations, such as, regretfully engaged in by the president. This administration believes that such alternative sex will stem the tide of pregnancy and abortions. The pattern and example of the president's immorality is unparalleled. Bill Bennett's book is a refreshing, honest, courageous, and patriotic. His reasoning is consistent with those who want to reverse the moral decline of the presidency and of America.

But, of course Mr. Bennett would never do that- that is why this book's satirical backdrop is never far from view- think of this 3 Penny Opera about Oral Sex, within a subtext of Marxist-Lenninst-Maoist revisionism.Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Mr Bennett's arguements lack focus. At the very core of his positions, are the following sometimes unstated premeses (which are not backed up by historical facts):l. That the President's personal character has historically been important and, in comparison to W. Clinton, been more pristine. [Untrue, beginning with Jefferson's three illigetimate children].2. That Clinton's election is both sympton and cause of a decay in societal morals.Unaddressed to my satisfaction is a very vexing question in my mind (a compound one) which is:We live in a society that is able to peer into the most private and sensitive parts of politicians' lives and broadcast facts and rumors in a 24-hour news cycle, but should we? And are we as a country and society, better off for it?Mr. Bennett's credibility is lacking because he fails to meaningfully acknowledge the sexual and other personal failings of previous Presidents and members of Congress. By focusing strictly on this President, he comes of to this registered Independent as a right-wing mouthpiece.In retrospect, my purchase of this book was money not well spent.

Unfortunately, the cable shows usually give a guest only about 10 or 15 seconds to make her point before she is interrupted by the host. The format lends itself only to slogans and sound bites; it does not lend itself to clear analysis. This is probably why most Americans still believe Clinton was impeached over a &quot;sex scandal.&quot; Others, who vaguely understood that he was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice -- felony crimes -- thought he should never have been asked questions under oath about &quot;his personal life.&quot; Bennett's little volume is a much needed corrective to this misconception, among others.A woman who worked for a large organization brought a civil rights lawsuit alleging that the chief executive officer of that organization made a crude and unwanted sexual advance in a hotel room, and when she refused it, she was penalized in her employment. The executive denied that the event in the hotel room ever took place. As they were the only two people in the room, how was the woman to take her case out of the category of a &quot;he said, she said&quot; swearing match? She decided to try to prove that this executive had a pattern of sexual liasons with subordinate female employees, rewarding them with jobs and other perks. The executive strenously objected to this line of inquiry, but the Judge overruled him and ordered him to answer questions regarding affairs with employees. The executive chose to lie under oath about one such relationship, then tried to coach a potential witness to support his own false testimony. To make certain that the young female employee would corroborate his perjury, he used a well-placed and powerful friend to secure a false affidavit from her.This story is unfamiliar to most viewers of cable television.

Like wizards blowing some magic dust in our eyes or a party of Pied Pipers or, better yet, Alice in Wonderland's cast of characters, Clinton and his followers would lead us into an upside-down world where right is wrong and wrong is relative to some obscure &quot;personal&quot; definition .... a place where nobody's accountable .... and even if they were, a vague &quot;I'm sorry&quot; replaces real retribution, recompense and paying the proper price for one's wrongs."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Bennett tries to sound philosophical but he's not. His representation of opposition arguments is unethical in that it's a clear series of straw-man arguments, he deliberately misrepresents them in order for them to be easily knocked down. Not only that, but it's apparent the guy has his head way up his ass.I can't help but smile at the hypocrisy. Bennett could actually write this pretentious, self-righteous pile-of-crap while he was depositing eight million dollars into a slot machine! Eight million dollars! That's a lot of goddam coins!I also got a kick out of Bennett lecturing about the profundity and spirituality of sex. Gimme a break! We don't need a whale-of-a-man telling us about how sex should be. But since we're on the topic Bill, I understand missionary might be the only way to go for a puritan such as yourself, but for the sake of Mrs. Bennett what do you say you condsider an alternative? Female superior, or at the very least, a weight-neutral position, should be given some consideration.If you're a moral fundamentalist or you just hate the Clintons, this book's for you.

I'm not generally big on the idea of entrapment as a defense, but if ever anyone has been justified in using it, Bill Clinton is over this whole pardon debacle. After all, for nearly a decade now Hillary Clinton, campaign and White House staffers, the Democratic Party, editorial page writers, feminists, civil rights groups, moderate Republicans, liberal attorneys, academics, historians, and journalists have assured us, and him, that as long as Bill Clinton cared deeply, worked hard, and acknowledged that he isn't a moral paragon, then no personal crime should be held against him. Among the crimes that we have excused were adultery, sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, sodomy, perjury, obstruction of justice, invasion of privacy, treason, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum.As long as the Dow stayed high, it seemed like there was nothing that Clinton could do which would draw so much as a stern rebuke from the institutional Left in this country. Oh sure, Joe Lieberman famously expressed some mild disappointment over the whole Monica mess, but it was really just the sort of solemn head wagging speech your Dad used to give you as an alternative to a spanking, and then Joe of course voted in lock step with the rest of his Party to exonerate the big lug. Not a single member of Bill Clinton's Cabinet or staff ever resigned to protest his behavior; not a single member of his Party ever called on him to resign or even suggested that his offenses should be punished. At the end of the Impeachment process, Bill Clinton was left standing tall and the people who sought to hold him to account--Ken Starr, Linda Tripp, Kathleen Willey, the House managers, etc.--were widely portrayed in the press as a collection of obsessive weirdos. You can almost excuse the guy for feeling like he was bulletproof.So then what happens ? He's out of office for one month and what's everybody upset about ? What is the offense that finally gets even his wife and his former employees upset ? What could possibly be so awful that even lap dog columnists like Al Hunt, Eleanor Clift, Richard Cohen and Jake Tapper are offended ? What indiscretion is so monumental that it actually leads James Carville to stop defending him ? The straw that broke the camel's back turns out to be a little bit of simony. That's right; after all that's gone before, the piffling little matter of trading pardons for sexual favors and cash turns out to be the one thing that the Left can not tolerate. To an impartial observer, this just doesn't seem fair. It is far too late for Democrats to try to redeem themselves by finally holding Bill Clinton responsible for something; they lay down with this dog for a decade; it's no use expressing shock that they've woken up with fleas. Bill Clinton is the victim of the worst kind of hypocrisy. All those truly horrible things he did were just fine with the Party, as long as he was President. Now he leaves office and his own cohorts are going to nail him for selling pardons, a victimless crime if ever there was one ? Where do they get off ?This is the very situation that Bill Bennett tried to warn them, and the rest of us, about when he wrote this little book at the height of the Monica scandal :[O]n Bill Clinton's behalf, in his defense, many bad ideas are being put into widespread circulation.It is said that private character has virtually no impact on governing character; that what mattersabove all is a healthy economy; that moral authority is defined solely by how well a president dealswith public policy matters; that America needs to become more European (read: more&quot;sophisticated&quot;) in its attitude toward sex; that lies about sex, even under oath, don't really matter;that we shouldn't be &quot;judgmental&quot;; that it is inappropriate to make preliminary judgments about thepresident's conduct because he hasn't been found guilty in a court of law; and so forth.If these arguments take root in American soil -- if they become the coin of the public realm -- wewill have validated them, and we will come to rue the day we did. These arguments define us down;they assume a lower common denominator of behavior and leadership than we Americans ought toaccept. And if we do accept it, we will have committed an unthinking act of moral and intellectualdisarmament. In the realm of American ideals and the great tradition of public debate, the highground will have been lost. And when we need to rely again on this high ground -- as surely wewill need to -- we will find it drained of its compelling moral power. In that sense, then, thearguments invoked by Bill Clinton and his defenders represent an assault on American ideals, evenif you assume the president did nothing improper. So the arguments need to be challenged.I believe these arguments are also a threat to our understanding of American self-government. Itdemands active participation in, and finally, reasoned judgments on, important civic matters.&quot;Judgment&quot; is a word that is out of favor these days, but it remains a cornerstone of democraticself-government. It is what enables us to hold ourselves, and our leaders, to high standards. It ishow we distinguish between right and wrong, noble and base, honor and dishonor. We cannotignore that responsibility, or foist it on others. It is the price -- sometimes the exacting price -- ofcitizenship in a democracy. The most popular arguments made by the president's supporters inviteus to abandon that participation, those standards, and the practice of making those distinctions.This is precisely what has happened. Having refused to judge Bill Clinton for nine years, having refused others the right to judge him, Democrats and their fellow travelers no longer have any moral standing on which to rely when they seek to judge him now.Bennett systematically annihilates every defense of the President for those earlier offenses and brick by brick builds the case for why a healthy society must not tolerate, and why it is destructive to the culture to excuse, such behavior. His warning, which unfortunately went unheeded, is now coming back to haunt those who have excused so much on Bill Clinton's part that their current protestations inevitably ring hollow.It is late February, 2001, as I write this. Despite a few outright condemnations by former officials like Jimmy Carter and Hamilton Jordan and some general noises of disgust from the rank and file, no major elected Democrat has yet come forth to indict Bill Clinton and his behavior. But I will predict that, within the next couple of weeks, both Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, and probably John Kerry and Bob Kerrey, will give major speeches in which they cut Bill loose and say that finally he has gone too far. When that time comes, it will be helpful to recall that following Clinton's impeachment by the House, Al Gore referred to him as &quot;one of our greatest Presidents,&quot; and that Lieberman, Kerrey, and Kerry all voted to acquit. Given the opportunity to root this cancer out of the Presidency and remove him from the body politic, they all took a pass. It is useless for them to decry that fact that the tumor metastasized. They and their fellow Democrats were accomplices in Bill Clinton's &quot;assault on American ideals&quot; and, by their inaction, presided over the &quot;death of outrage.&quot; It may be possible to revive the victim--let us hope so--but they are not the ones to do it; they are too deeply implicated in Bill Clinton's reign of crime.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"William Bennett's book was written at the height of the scandals of Bill Clinton, just before his Grand Jury testimony. At the time it came out feelings were running high and Bennett as a political opponent of the president took his share of hits as a \\"Clinton Hater\\"Now four years later with a sober mind and with a much more important things to worry about the arguements made by Bennett make more sense, but his fears it turns out were unfounded.He soundly refutes the arguements of Clinton's defenders and has a great comparison of Clinton's defenders and Nixon's defenders. His part concerning the Biblical defense of Clinton could easily apply to those defending millitant Islam today.His worry about what the death of outrage would do to our culture was unfounded the country's response to the attacks of last year proved that without a doubt and outrage and American ideals will live as long as America does. The reason it was wrong was this. Bill Clinton was a small man and America saw that. America doesn't waste its outrage on small things."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Outrage . . . dead? What? Here, in this country? Now? Does Bennett have his big head buried in the sand? Read the papers, listen to talk radio, browse the Net, or turn on CNN, MSNBC, or R. Murdoch's Republican News channel (FOX) and you can see nothing BUT outrage among the pundits--and misplaced outrage at that. Face it, Clinton is a great president, and, to head off a couple of cliches that Republicans love to use, 1) no, not everyone &quot;does it&quot; and 2) Clinton is a great prez not only b/c he brought the country out of the terrible economic state that Reagan and Bush put it in. Clinton is far from perfect, and no one knows this more than he does. But no matter how many times he apologizes, professional moralists like Bennett tell us not to believe him. I have come to this conclusion: William Bennett is a big fat idiot.How is it that Bennett came to believe that he is the chosen one, the &quot;lonely moral voice in the wilderness&quot; that God gave the world in order to chastise those of us who think Clinton should not have been impeached and who think he's done a great job (which is over 60% of us)? Bennett gives me no reason (worth anything) for me to think that he is morally superior to Clinton. I am outraged at Bennett. He is so partisan he can't see straight. He doesn't see how thoroughly without vision he is himself, how cynical his views of democracy are.Bennett should stick to editing books, compiling works he didn't write, because he's not much of a writer himself. Bennett is too simple minded to be a really good editor, but read THE BOOK OF VIRTUES, a book he edited, if you really want to read something by this blowhard.

I still do not know what made me pick the tiny thing up, but I am glad that I did.Bennet's college major of philosophy is easily recognized here as he discusses the events and arguments which occurred in the midst of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. Each chapter is organized into a group of claims and arguments made in defense of Bill Clinton, followed by a clear, concise examination of those arguments with refuting points, except in the rare case where Bennet agrees with the defense. (I believe this only occurs once.) Again, the reader should appreciate Bennet's grasp on philosophy, both in his ability to clearly mold an argument as well as his convincing ideas on ethics.The thing about this book that is best, though, is that Bennet frequently writes in general terms, offerring insights into what makes a respectable, effective, and moral leader as opposed to what does not - the latter often displayed through Bill Clinton's actions and words. The people who I believe should read this most are those who are inclined to make the very arguments with which Bennet begins each chapter.I was disheartned by Clinton before, but my distaste turned to disgust after reading this. More so, however, I became upset with my own lack of outrage. This is a truly timeless examination of the importance of quality and morality for leaders of all time."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This book reconfirms this reviewers belief that Bennett's psyche needs to feel morally superior to those with whom he disagrees. He attempted to author a book of Virtues, yet avoided the greatest virtue - self-sacrifice(hardly a Republican virtue). Implied in his title, &quot;Death of Outrage,&quot; Bennett condemns the majority of Americans for failing to be as outraged as he over the President's lying about private extra-marital relations(historically, the expected and accepted lie for any spouse in most cultures for thousands of years). This &quot;author&quot; is not the least outraged at Republicans who opposed Clinton's highly moral intervention to stop genocide in the Balkans, a far more heinous immorality than lying under oath about sex. Like most of Bennett's talk-show appearances, the book relies upon empty, futile, pseudo-moral arguments stretched tightly around kernels of truth.Rather than purchase this book, outraged readers will profit more significantly by making a contribution to the Red Cross or perhaps Hillary Clinton's senatorial campaign."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"William Bennett is the former Secretary of Education and the editor of the recent bestseller Book of Virtues. Bennett has become a voice of morality for America. In Death of Outrage, Bennett laments the reality found in hard statistics; numbers that show that America is not as virtuous as Bennett would like. In disgust he writes, \\"In a self-governing and law-abiding nation, we must never allow ourselves to be lulled into passive disgust or indifference. We should never lose our sense of outrage.\\" For Bennett, America has lost its moral compass. America no longer has the correct notion of right and wrong. If Americans did, they would be outraged at the moral lapse of their president.Bennett's \\"outrage\\" is induced because his reality is flawed. The first step to happiness, and sanity, is to grasp the reality about you and the situation that you are in. Bennett writes from the belief that we are a nation of highly principled, morally correct people who, when they see the truth about William Clinton, would rise up and express righteous indignation, seeking to throw the President out. Wrong. Bennett, get a grip. The reality is more than 70 percent of America liked Bill Clinton and wanted the case dropped.But these numbers stop William Bennett? No. He is not one to give up just because the America populace is morally dull. He proves that with the Death of Outrage. Bennett is going to help us grasp Clinton's criminal offense and guilt; explaining it again as if we just don't get it. But Dr. Bennett we do get it. We know our President is a scoundrel and he cheated on his wife, lied to the people of the country and used his office to cover it up.Ultimately, Death of Outrage is about morality, and the lack there of in the America people. Bennett appropriately quotes the Bible various times in Death of Outrage underscoring the need for standards and morals in our nation. However, other socially concerned voices need to be heard along with Bennett, such as the voice of the social activist, theologian and contemporary author Jesuit Priest Daniel Berrigan. Berrigan reads the same Bible but comes up with a different reality . . . \\"The Bible has news for you; moral incapacity rules the world. The system does not know light from darkness.\\"Don't get me wrong, we need moral prophets, and this book does an admirable job at outlining the President's offenses and his defense, going on to dismantle them line by line. So, if you are looking for more details on the Clinton fiasco, or if you have been in a coma and missed this moral mess, then this book is for you and rates a solid \\"recommended,\\" otherwise it is &quot;conditionally recommended.\\""},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"More sanctimonious, nostalgic drivel from a man arrogant enough to style himself as the arbiter of American morality. What I've never understood about conservatives is their propensity to wail and moan over any governmental regulation of the economy, while at the same time aggressively and systematically advocating the legislation of social conduct. Similarly, the fact that any conservative dare broach the subject of morality offends me, considering the cynical, violent, and conscienceless methodology right wing politicians (corporate lackeys) have employed in forwarding their economic and political imperialism. Bill Clinton has been a disappointment to many, but comparing his primary crime--disavowing an affair that was none of anyone's business in the first place--pales in comparison to, say, the Iran-Contra dealings, the Gulf war (talk about wag the dog), and young Dubya's past drugging and present committment to turning the arctic national wildlife preserve into an oil field. The real moral decline is not found in what our leaders do, but in the fact that we let them do what they want to do. Bennett is among that wacky group of wasps who lament that they can't wave a magic wand and bring back a post world war two America that never was, a time when gas was cheap and Ike was President and McCarthy was watching your back.

Now, that's an outrage!&quot; Well, the revised edition has an added afterword; however, as with most of Bennett's writings, less is better. The afterword includes Bennett's take on unsubstantiated allegations that Clinton had committed rape in the 1970's. Does Bennett provide any proof? No, but who cares about things like truth when you are a self-proclaimed Virtue Czar?In fact, Bennett's book is nothing but a rehash of every hoary charge made by the hard Right against Clinton, whether real or imagined. One very bright note: the paperback edition of Bennett's diatribe came out at the same time as the revelations about Newt Gingrich's goings on with his own very young aide (which was a well-known fact in Right circles at the same time of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal and the subsequent attacks on Clinton's morality). Let's hope that puts a damper on Bennett's posturing for a while. Talk about karma and synchronicity!"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"The assault on American Ideals comes from the Republican Right. For years the Right has been trying to turn accusation into fact rather than the other way around - in essence making the law of the land Guilty until Proven Innocent. Next will come the public stockades. They have turned the media into a national joke; journalism into pulp fiction. As Christopher Dodd said, &quot;If you get a witness who can't recall something then they must be being disingenuous. If you have a witness with conflicting testimony then someone is lying. If you get two witnesses that have consistent statements then it must be a conspiracy&quot;. McCarthyism is alive and well."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This book in a highly obvious way contributes to the death of outrage itself, since it focuses moral judgment on whatmost people understand to be moral trivialities. Moral judgment is an important concept and one which should be used more and not less in politics. The problem with right wing and conservative morality, such as Mr. Bennett's, is that it ignores vast areas of blatant wrongdoing on a global or international scale and tries to make focus on sex scandal a substitute for that. For example, President Clinton could be rightly judged for his recent bombing of the defenseless citizens of Iraq and for his continuation of the economic sanctions that have killed 1.6 million Iraqis, half of them children under the age of five. That, of course, is a more difficult item, since many politicians are also complicit in the same actions.Morality is of vital importance in public affairs, but the type of morality that focuses on the most minute and ignores the most egregious offenses is at the very least sickening and at the worst apt to dull the sensitivities of the public. Another example of upside down morality is the so-called &quot;right to life&quot; movement that is so conspicuously absent from anti-war and anti-capital punishment movements. So, morality gets focused on saving embryo's with the developmental level of a tadpole (but the appearance of a human being) while warfare, the organized slaughter of millions of fully-developed human beings, is all fine and dandy.No, &quot;The Death of Outrage&quot; does not provide any useful guidance to morality in public life but, instead, contributes a substitute pseudomorality that itself degrades morality."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"&quot;Dost thou think because thou art 'virtuous,' there shall be no more cakes and ale?&quot; -- Shakespeare. Given what we now know about Thomas Jefferson -- that he kept a black slave as a concubine for 30 years and lied about it -- it would appear that outrage was dead long before Bill Bennett stumbled across its bloated corpse. Bennett, of course, sheathed his outrage when his benefactor Ronald Reagan let Oliver North run wild in the White House (contravening the law of the land and the will of Congress), and when George Bush lied about his role in the Iran-Contra affair. It would be wise to remind Bennett that Dante set aside the harshest of all hellfire for the hypocrite.

Keeping the Clintons means losing our collective souls.Consider, by their example, what the legacy of the Clintons is. If the President and First Lady can, then:* It's OK for anyone to lie under oath. * It's OK to blame others and wacko conspiracies for your problems. * It's OK to have sex with government volunteers and put them on the public payroll. * It's OK to obstruct justice. * It's OK to encourage perjury. * It's OK to attack judges and jurists and political opponents. * It's OK to attack prosecutors. * It's OK to violate privacy laws. * It's OK to threaten and intimidate critics, and much, much worse. * It's OK to obstruct justice. * It's OK to buy silence.....Buy this book.

While I agree that many who thought Clinton's sexual escapades were a disgrace to the office of president, they were forgivable. The perjury, subborning of perjury, and obstruction of justice should have caused his removal from office. It appears to me that the only difference between Clinton and Nixon was that the Republican congressional leadership had enough gumption to call Nixon's hand where the Democrats didn't and the opponents didn't have the power to go it alone. And now it seems that many on the left are hoping for Hillary, thinking this is a way to get Bill another eight years. Way to go, Bennett, in spite of your also having human frailties.

Bennett, past secretary of Education and also National Endowment For The Humanities under Ronald Reagan and past War Against Drugs Czar for President George H. W. Bush, has written a terrific book absolutely everyone everywhere should own, read and re-read often.His book titled THE DEATH OF OUTRAGE: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (1998), published by the Free Press division of Simon and Shuster, is a monument to clear thinking and get-to-the-point analysis on a critical subject for all Americans, the U.S. Presidency and what Mr. Clinton has done with it and to it during his eight years in office.Mr. Bennett learned well the lessons Harvard Law School professors taught him about stating his case clearly and briefly, always caring to put forward his most powerful arguments up front.His book is a slim one, only 154 pages long. His main arguments are stated very clearly and persuasively in the first four pages of his thoughtful Introduction. His writing style is crisp, clear, unpretentious, and a pleasure to read. Beyond question, William Bennett is a &quot;user friendly&quot; writer, and we need all of those we can get. He's an Ivory Tower person, yet thankfully not afflicted with the frequent Ivory Tower disease of inarticulate expression.He states that Bill Clinton and his close supporters reacted to criticism of Mr. Clinton's misconduct during his time in office (both as Governor of Arkansas and as U.S. President) in wrong ways which included diversion, half-truth, equivocation, and sophistry (&quot;sophistry&quot; is defined as a plausible but misleading or fallacious argument). They tried to trivialize the charges laid against Mr. Clinton, but, according to Mr. Bennett, without success.Bennett states that the charges against Clinton DO matter, and explains why. He analyses what the public reaction to them means, and asserts that Bill Clinton has inflicted grave social and political damage on America.He says that the president's behavior, far from being irrelevant to the conduct of his affairs, severely restricted his ability to govern. He states that the unprecedented recklessness of the Clinton administration in everything from influence peddling to sexual misconduct to alarming tactics of intimidation have been genuinely history making. He argues that Mr. Clinton and his defenders have exploited the natural tolerance of the American people, and made a mockery of the rule of law.Most interestingly, William Bennett states that the Clinton scandals (a plural word, to be sure) are neither trivial nor independent of one another, but rather are connected.He states that the Bill Clinton presidency is truly a shameful chapter in American history, and implies that Mr. Clinton's misbehavior must not be forgotten, unanalyzed, or forgiven.William Bennett's excellent book, written two years ago (I write this review in December 2000), is especially timely in the present circumstances. Mr. Clinton seems determined to continue a role of power and influence after his second presidential term ends in January 2001. His wife, Senator Hilary Clinton of New York, is THE prime U.S. Democrat Presidential candidate for the 2004 election, and Mr. Clinton leaves no doubt as to whom his wife's most influential advisor and quarterback will be.If Bill Clinton is allowed to return to power, the future most likely will be a replay of the well known past. William Bennett's wonderful book articulates better than any other similar book on a similar subject what that past has been, what it has meant to Americans, and by implication, what it will mean in the future if Bill Clinton returns to center stage."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Here is a well respected former Democrat, a Washington insider who uses his brain and an analytical, historically sound approach to make an argument.

Preoccupation with blow jobs in the White House is unbelievable when one considers the global issues that confront us at home and &quot;globally.&quot; Claiming that the real issue is perjury does not dignify the discussion.

It proved an excellent primer on which to base a much needed discussion of personal and public morality in this sad era of selfishness and permissiveness .

While Clinton promises the most ethical administration in history you will be reminded of Nixons &quot;I am not a crook&quot; statements. Clintons &quot;I did not have sexual relationships with that woman&quot; is scary. Bennett gives a clear concise review of the real issues. A president that purjured himself many times in the Jones deposition and to the Grand Jury. Lying blantantly to the American people and using friends, Hillary, associates and even his cabinet to lie for him, knowing exactly what he was doing. Stonewalling and his disregard for the judicial system. Realizing that if this President gets away with perjury that our court system will never be the same. This books gets to the real issues that could shape our country for years to come. Read this book with an open mind and you will be outraged by this president.This is not a political decision, it's a moral issue. Where are those that were outraged by the Nixon scandel?

This book shows you how President Clinton has tried to manipulate the system of being president, and how he may have tarnished that dubious distinction in the long run. We learn how Clinton and his army of Lawyers and Spokespeople tried (successfully) to portray Clinton the victim of the Lewinsky Scandal, and as it turns out, during the course of his impeachment, his approval ratings were at the highest of his presidency.

He seems to be making the assumption that the United States today is dominated by western philosophy and religion. While this may have been the historical foundation, the population base of the US has within the twentieth century expanded to include people who do not subscribe to a western based Christian doctrine. Bennett's failure to take into account this diversity causes him to incorrectly conclude that the country is morally deficient. Consequently, his observations do not reflect the complexity of life at the end of the twentieth century. As he is an adept writer, I would hope he would move out of the base he currently attaches himself, travel the country and begin to consider the potential lives that are not attached to the religious doctrines of the past, but maybe pointing us toward a compassionate future that he as yet does not understand."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Bennett's &quot;Death of Outrage&quot; has a thesis and it is excellently presented. However, there's this little point about the author having worked proudly in the Reagan Administration, probably the most dangerous time in the Republic's history for lies and shadow governments, and refusing to recognize or at least acknowledge that the death of outrage began, not with Clinton, but his ex-boss President Reagan whose web of lies and usurping of congressional authority and laws made Richard Nixon's former activities seem trite."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"William Bennett tells it like it should be told: by a paranoid schizophrenic on the psycho ward of the nearest hospital.

Of course, the fact that I was zoned out on ketamine while I read this book didn't help matters. My re-entry nightmare consisted of looking in the mirror and seeing Bennett himself gazing back! Wow! I had to run to the kitchen to rustle up some of Martha Stewart's tasty hors d'oeuvres to get over that one.But you may ask, who died and left him Moses? I dunno.

Mr. Bennett lays the facts before the reader in clear, easy to understand language and debunks Clinton supporters' point for point with Clinton's own words.One reviewer stated his dislike for the personal tone that the book sometimes takes. But what has not been realized by the reviewer is that the contorted double helix of untruths the president and his men have fashioned has made a book of this matter necessary.Ultimately only those individuals who would avoid reality will find great fault in this simple, yet eloquent, book that exposes the man know as William Jefferson Clinton for what he is.Even more... it tells us about ourselves.

Whose headquarters are now unfortunately in the Oval Office of this great country. An Office now corrupted and bringing down the Democrates into the dirt with them. You see, to the Clintons there is no such thing as political opponents or mutual respect for idealogically different opinions or beliefs anymore. To them everyone who is not of their belief is the enemy. Even to the point of feeling the same about the American people they are suppose to represent. If you do not whole heartedly support the Clintonites you are the enemy. With a capitol E. That means one half of the American people are Bill and Hillary's Enemies. Not merely a political opponent. Bennett knows this very well. And the monstous saber toothed, poison spewing termites of the Bill and Hilllary Clinton Machine (similar to the war depicted in the movie ANTS) go into motion to uterly destroy that light. I.E. the Peewee Hermans of Politics (James Carville, Susan Estrich and Mario Como). Throughout this entire saga we have watched as the liberal left (Democrates and Special Interest Extremist) have opened the floodgates of their true nature. Which is to defend anyone who supports their simple minded agendas and enslaving political and/or social goals. Regardless of the kind of person they are. Forget the founders, the federalist papers and the reasons America came into being. Power is all important to them not America. Their programs are the making of 21st Century Slavery and the masses are holding their arms wide open to this enslavement. Dependency on Liberal handouts is and will be slavery for minorities and women. It is just to bad that greed and power have blinded the leaders of these movements to the plight they reap upon their followers. There are no moral values that bind them, there is no honor to great to betray, there is no criminal act that they will not defend. There is no respect for the founders or the Constitution, nor the past where we received our core values. There is only winning at any price and any sacrifice. The Comos, Boxers, Conyers, Gores, Gepharts, Brauns, Daschels, and other left wing finatics of the left simply believe that there is nothing but power, greed, secular humanism and individual personal and physical gratification that matters. Their manipulation of blacks, women, churches and others is a testament to their total disregard for mere citizens for their personal survival, gain and success. Bill Clinton is a hypocrite, a lyer, and worse who will stop at nothing to maintain power, even betraying the Constitution, the American People and his Oaths of Office. These things mean nothing to him, but are tools to be used for his tyrannical regime. Do his misdeads raise to the level of Impeachment? In his own words and those of his wife yes, yes, yes. Who else in the history of this country has devided the entire population into such factions as this unprincipled man. Who can say one thing in the AM and another in the PM and the gullible left eats it up like he is a prophet. And march out like little storm toopers to defend their leader. The Hitler loyalist would be proud of these Democratic Stratagist. Bennett has in all his books attempted to do nothing more than show us that we once had, prior to the Clinton scourge, a higher expectation for ourselves and our future. That, as flawed as we were, we tried to be better than the mere sum of our parts. Unfortunately today the Democrates have given up and accepted that they would be more comfortable in the gutter, than up on the road. And they are wollowing in their self indugent decent into a chotic social slime. I hope Bennett never stops standing up for those of us who do not give up on the better side of humainity. We will never agree with those who defend this type of nonleader. It is astonishing that the Democrates can so easily support what these hypocites did and said during Nixon's failure, but forgive the same or worse conduct with Clinton. It proves unquestionably however, that they never have and never will have any firm foundation in honor, integrity, responsibility or patriotism. They are the party of corruption and deviance.

Clinton loyalists have no interest in plenary dialectics, nor are they concerned with basic facts. Spin trumps all when it comes to Slick Willie.This revised version includes an afterward written following the noble impeachment and the rushed mock trial staged in the U.S. Senate. Rather than provide Monday Morning Quarterback reflection, this postmortem revisiting allows for additional analysis of what was a widely known preordained conclusion. Bennett rightly argues that the Democratic Party has some repair work to do to its image and integrity. He cites NJ Senator Frank Lautenberg's brazen gratitude to smutmeister Larry Flynn for his defense of the Adulterer-in-Chief and profligate praise from many other Democrats whose unconditional support of their leader disgraced their party's long history of rectitude and character.Perhaps most telling is the synopsis of Democratic replies to Juanita Broderick's undisputed charge that Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton raped her two decades ago. The noisy defenders suddenly become eerily quiet, and even Clinton's most drooling sycophants-who so willingly smear the name of anyone opposing their leader-fail to speak out against Mrs. Broderick. Bennett quotes Dee Dee Myers and David Gergen-both of whom seem to tacitly-and very unhappily-acknowledge their belief in the authenticity of Mrs. Broderick's claim.I do have one criticism of Mr. Bennet concerning a lack of disclosure. At one point he mentions that Clinton's lawyer (who remains unnamed) was forced to admit to a judge that he had unknowingly assisted his client in promulgating specious information. The author should have identified the attorney as his brother, Robert Bennett."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Bill Bennett does a wonderful, eloquent job of describing anddefining the Clinton years - and debunking the \\"it's all about sex\\" defense, amongst others. While I don't agree with all of his political conclusions, his assessment of the Clinton slice-and-dice approach to any who dare cross the president is refreshing, after 6 years of Yessir from the media."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"I had read Bennett's &quot;Devaluing of America&quot; quite some time ago, so, when I saw that he had written another (nonkids) book, I had to get it. It seemed to me a little expensive for the size, but then after I had bought it I began to read it. I was wrong about the price, for it was all worth it. The analysis of what Clinton is doing is superb."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Bill Bennett's book set forth in a logical and forthwright manner arguments that need to be made by somebody in this country. I cringe when I hear people saying it doesn't matter, it's all about sex, etc. Mr. Bennett effectively analyzes and counters each ridiculous argument that Clinton's supporters have offered in the last several months, a period in our history that represents a shameful abandonment of moral principle. As a lifelong liberal Democrat, it depresses me that the only people speaking the truth on this issue are arch conservatives such as Mr. Bennett, because people might discount what he has to say based on his reputation as a rightwinger. He has some good things to say, that needed to be said. My only criticism is that he rushed the book to print without waiting to hear the president speak, and so one gets the feeling that one knows more than the author on this subject, which leaves me craving the sequel."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This book made me remember what it was like to be proud to be an American. The president's continuing cover-up has been allowed by our country's lack of outrage, and we have no one to blame but ourselves. The Clinton administration's attitude toward those seeking the truth is revealed as what one White House official has dubbed, &quot;our continuing campaign to destroy Ken Starr.&quot; William Bennett brings up an interesting fact--The Clinton Justice Department has brought a case that involved lying under oath about oral sex in a civil case to a perjury conviction. In U.S. v. Battalino, the Dept. of Justice prosecuted a Veterans Administration psychiatrist who falsely testified under oath that she did not have a sexual encounter during a June 27, 1991 appointment with Ed Arthur. However, Arthur had recorded phone conversations with his doctor in which she referred to the rendezvous. The doctor pleaded guilty to one count of obstruction of justice, was sentenced to one year of probabion, six months of home detention and electronic monitoring, and fined $3,600 for the same crime as our president."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"If, after reading Death of Outrage, you can't understand why character in public office is important, you never will. Bennett doesn't lecture the reader, he explains various defense arguments and then dissects and disposes them. You may love the President and rationalize any number of reasons why you think his transgressions, both legal and moral, should be ignored. What you cannot do is use intelligent and logical reasoning to defend the President's behavior. No good can come from lies. Bennett shows us why, if it were nothing but sex, the President should still resign.The truth is painful, but educational. The lesson is not to place your faith and your agenda in a man with no integrity or sense of honor."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Wow!

Some may even drop their phony liberal &quot;tolerance&quot; posture like reviewer Cheng Lee and reveal their bigotry against people of faith. Some of these reviews are good examples of why this book will become a bestseller. They also support my contention that those who still support a lying, perverted president are hypocritical, equivocating liberals or just plain fools. READ the book."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"William Bennett does a fine job explaining why Billy Clinton is the weak link in the democratic chain. Billy continues to make a mockery of the American justice system while thumbing his nose at the American public. Billy Clinton makes Nixon look like little league when it comes to White House scandal. The Republicans don't have a chance against the Democrats with Billy on their side. With the recent and ongoing sex scandal of Billy Clinton not to be confused with Billy Carter maybe he should be forced to pay the cost of the Ken Starr investigation as Newt Gingrich had to pay for the investigation against him. Of course he shouldn't be allowed to have Steven Speilberg or Barbara Streisand pay for it just as Newt had to pay from his own savings. Anyway this is a good book any good American should read from whatever side of the political fence you reside."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"An outstanding summation of not only the Clinton/Lewinsky affair and why it is so important an issue, but also a brief review of the overwhelming number of misdeeds and obfuscations by the Clinton administration. After eight months of stonewalling and attacks by the Administration on Ken Starr and anyone who would criticize this president, Bennett pulls the facts--more rather than less, sooner rather than later--into a comprehensive and coherent argument as to why character is important in our elected officials and why, while no one is perfect, Bill Clinton is so far from meeting the minimal standards of acceptable behavior; he must leave the office of President.I doubt it will change the minds of hardcore Clinton supporters, but reasonable people hesitant to judge the President, may gain a better understanding of the scope of Clinton's misdeeds and why the electorate has an obligation to render judgment on such behavior. We can do better and we must."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Bill Bennett reminds us that once we as a nation loose our honor and our integrity there is no more important mission for this country than to pursue honor and integrity. Therefore for the President to suggest that we need to put these matters behind us to get on with more important matters is a ruse. There are no more important matters for this country. This country which liberated France put an end to Nazi Germany created a Marshall plan to rebuild Europe demands that our leaders are looked up to not down to. This is what this nation needs to be about returning to honor and integrity in our leadership. How can we as a nation take Kelly Finn and run her out of the Air Force and not command the same of her commander and chief?"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Once again Bill Bennett shows us that some people in America still have character!

He lays it all out there for the American people to see and decide for themselves that our &quot;President&quot; is a fornicating scoundrel who splattered his dna on an innocent Hassidic coed, and brought this great Christian nation to the brink of moral collapse. I hope to see more of this great moral leader on the Larry King show promoting more books about morality and .....books that teach morality...and books to teach children how to be moral..and..and..uh..I'm getting sleepy now. I think I'll take a nap. Hopefully when I wake up, I'll see this great teacher of morality on the Larry King show and..yawn..and..oooh..Ok..I'm going to bed now."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"I am so tired of those, like Mr. Bennett, who insist on trying to convince all of us how &quot;Immoral&quot; we all are by supporting a man, who despite his pathetically sad personal blunders (that's right--&quot;PERSONAL&quot;--his infidelity is none of our business!), has done a pretty decent job of running the country. He seems to forget that there is, and continues to be, a majority of Americans who voted him in and support him. That we all don't live up to his standards of morality must be terribly frustrating. Well, it is equally frustrating to see a &quot;book&quot;(I use the term loosely) rushed to the presses in the blink of an eye simply to capitalize on a sad situation. The so-called &quot;Death of Morality&quot; is nothing but a fallacy Mr. Bennet, for I have lost nothing. While the Allmightiness in Mr. Bennet's corner may have, I do believe he's been fooling himself as much as he's tried to fool us. Such polemical rhetoric as this partisan trash is nothing but the pot calling the kettle black...while trying to make a few bucks in the process. I wonder what kind of book we'd see if Mr. Bennet were to take such a supposedly sagacious look at his own former bosses? One can only cast so many stones before they come flying back at him...I did let this blatheringly myopic dolt have his say, but I am not impressed. This was obviously intended as nothing but another sermon for the choir...I bet Rush loved it."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This is yet another part of the continuing Republican propaganda assault on Clinton.

Mr Bennett does a wonderful job showing how today's public must become ouraged at a leader's immoral, unethical, and unlawful behaviors. In excusing Clinton's indescretions and blatant double-standards, Bennett shows us our own moral decline as Americans. He shows how our leaders must be, first and foremost, of good character, and the guardians of our laws. This book showed me my responsibility as an American, to be angry at a leader's behavior as a representative of our Governmnet. If Clinton's &quot;servicing&quot; was at a hotel, that's his business. When he does it in the White House...in the Oval Office, it becomes mine! If we listened to Mr Bennett and American's would become outraged at it's leaders more often when their behavior becomes offensive as Mr Clinton's was, perhaps tomorrows leaders would watch themselves much more closely and become examples to follow, not excuse!"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Professional moralist Bill Bennett has outdone himself with this load of tripe. As seemingly the last person capable of 'outrage' he aims at his target Bill Clinton with Puritanical vigor. Of course one can imagine Bennett holding vast reservoirs of outrage having expended absolutely none during his years as a Reagan insider and Republican heavy. Grenada? Panama? Iraq? 'Deregulation'? Contras? Arms for hostages? What about his years as 'Drug Czar' and his connections with the nefarious DEA? Pretty selective sense of outrage if you ask me. Hypocritical? You bet."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"The only thing Im outraged about is the sheer hypocrisy of Bennett. He has written a library full of books preaching to the rest of us about the virtuous life and morality and making millions in the process. Then we find all the while he has been blowing 8 million on the roulette wheels, slots, and dice, while drinking and chasing women. It galls me even more that today he has the guts to host a daily program on some Christian radio network, along with regular appearances on the Fox News Channel.

Yes, the President was a total dolt when he became enmeshed with a seemingly overstimulated young adult. He is a cad but was elected by the people. However, Bill Bennett has appointed himself ( I don't know anyone else who even nominated him) as not only the US but western cultures high priest of morality. A custodial role he gave himself since he was a minor player during the Reagan Administration. This from a man who, to my knowledge, had no response to the murder of Archbishop Romero and the nuns murdered by members of the Salvadoran National Guard. Now this deserved at least deserved one of his mind numbing comments punctuated by at least two throat clearings. Bennett seemed oblivious or in agreement with Reagans's &quot;scientific, nutritional, analysis&quot; concluding that catsup is a viable substance to be sustained on ie vegetable. Oh, who needs school lunches when crack suppresses hunger anyway. Bennett must of grown tired of writing virtuous books for children and returned to what he does best, nothing.

Bill Bennett fairly and rationally clears up the distortions, tells us what really happened, and explains what is at stake for us if as a society we choose expediency over our core values. No, it's not just the economy--and no, it's not just about sex.

His comparison of Clinton to past presidents caught in lies, from Reagan to Nixon to Kennedy showed a careful, thoughtful treatment.The most striking argument he makes, in my opinion, is that the idea that &quot;all politicians lie&quot; is not as accurate as Clinton would like to think we all believe, or &quot;He's no worse than any other, so we should let it go.&quot; Bennett does grant that yes, politicians do lie, but that does not make it right, nor does it mean we should EXPECT it of them. He also points out the danger in refusing to differentiate between the &quot;small lies&quot; (&quot;I don't really like to eat that much junk food---but then, I don't really consider McDonalds to be junk food&quot;) and the whoppers (&quot;I did NOT have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky&quot; or &quot;It was just a fluke that I didn't get drafted,&quot; etc., ad nauseum).A lie is a lie. Republican or Democrat, president, congressman, governor, or mayor. Husband, father, or child. Yes, we need to forgive, but true repentance entails a turning from sin, with a resolution not to do it again. America knows Bill Clinton is not truly repentant and by not being outraged, everyone loses. EVERYONE.The more people I talk with and the more I read about this situation, the more I am convinced that the only people standing behind Clinton anymore are those who are happy with the *representative* form of government that our Constitution ensures, because of his representation of what they stand for...or don't stand for.This book should especially be read by those who have been sitting by (as I have for a long time) and said, &quot;Well, things are going pretty well, so who cares if Clinton cannot even be trusted by his own family--unemployment is low and the economy is cruising, so nobody would ever be able to touch him anyway, he's too popular.&quot; Read this book and see how dangerous this attitude is, and why we must refuse to let our sense of outrage die!"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Bennett so clearly shows that the MAJORITY of American voters PUT Clinton IN, KEPT him in, and want him to STAY IN, because THEY think and act JUST LIKE he does.

To defend themselves they will say, &quot;SHOW ME someone who has NEVER SINNED.&quot; They have scores of such remarks. Just read some of the other comments in this page.

His thoughts need to be considered in the public debate, whether or not you agree with them. Unfortunately, Bennett's tone suggests that he feels Clinton is relatively unique as Presidents go - - for instance, we are not reminded of Pres. Bush's pardoning of Cap Weinberger, but Bennett does remind us of Walsh when Bennett wants to put Judge Starr in a better light.

Now, that is an outrage."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"It is obvious from many posts regarding political book reviews that comments serve more to field a detest for one side of the political spectrum. Liberals, aka Democrats, want to bring up the negativies of Conservatives, aka Republicans, as a means of pointing out that one should not be criticizing when your own back yard has trash in it (Mr. Manges and Mr. Klinges). Conservatives want to embrace any publication that points out the horrors of the Liberal Agenda regardless of the lack of value in said publication (See the many reviews on books by Barbara Olson or the Limbaugh boys). There are many political sites for these opinions, but please do us all a favor and stick to a review of the book and not your unsolicited political opinion.Mr. Gathercoal's assessment fails to recognize the point of this book. On many levels one can be criticized for their actions. The first Bush Presidency can be justly criticized for the Contra Affair. What Bennett does is to look at the public sentiment towards the \\"popular\\" president and why that is disturbing. Mr. Gathercoal's comment \\"70% of the American public liked Bill Clinton and wanted the case dropped\\" is just the point that Mr. Bennett is trying to make: that those 70% should have been outraged by the \\"moral\\" position taken by Mr. Clinton with regards to his lying to the American public. That is the point of the book, to note that the American public did not utilize a moral code to determine whether or not the President should be supported.Mr. Bennett does, however, show his Conservative bend at times which can ignite the defense mechanisim in anyone who wonders why, if politicians are so concerened with morality, that they are only so when it is not connected with their political party. For that some of the \\"liberal reviews\\" do have merritt when bringing up the failings of the Right. But I think to a greater degree what Mr. Bennett does is to use this incident as a foundation for an attitude about people and politics that we, the American public, should employ not just to the Democrats but to Mr. Bennett's party as well and maybe if Mr. Bennett would turn his pen on his own party he would find that he would be more credible to more people.The book is well written and you will find yourself able to go through it in one sitting. It is best to come to this book with a mind that is open not to the subject of but rather the philosophy behind why the book was written. Some may not be able to this and it is understandable. If you have a bent towards Moral Relativism then this book will not convince you to change your stripes. It does not work as a harsh philosophical investigation into morality. If you are one who feels that the moral compass of America is off North then this book will justify that sentiment. If you sit somewhere the middle and can read the book without trying to minimalize the attacks by saying \\"well the other side did this\\" then I believe you will find some of Mr. Bennett's points worthy of reflectionPOST NOTE: A comment to the first person who voted that this review was not helpful: thank you for satisfying the attitude mentioned in my first paragraph. The idea behind a review is to add to the dialogue about the subject, thereby allowing the reader an understanding of content before reading the book. My guess is that your vote was solely based on attitude within the review rather than whether you found the review to be helpful to you in understanding what is occuring between the pages. You might honesty and objectivity to be beneficial to you in your everday life as opposed to walking the \\"party line\\" like a mindless automaton."},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Can't take credit for the pun since I read it in a earlier reader review. Nor can I palm off as my own what a reader in San Diego previously wrote: &quot;160 pages for $20? Now, that is an outrage.&quot;Mr. Bennett, however, seems to have no problem with compiling selected thoughts of OTHERS, many taken out of the larger context in which they were expressed, and once again, passing them off as his own. You have to hand it to Mr. Bennett, he's consistent if nothing else.Since so many words fm BOTH ends of the political and social spectrum have already been written, let me suggest readers consider a few absolute numbers:1. $60 million dollars spent on an investigation that results in 0 (zero) convictions of any sort.2. Special prosecutors fired by presidents under investigation: Nixon-1 (Archibald Cox); Clinton-03. Hse Judiciary Committee votes on impeachment:Nixon - 7 R's and 7 D's voted unanimously FOR impeachment.Clinton- 7 R's FOR and 7 D's Against = a straight partisan result.Final tally in the Senate for Clinton's conviction: not even close for conviction. (sorry, can't find the # right now)4. Federal felony convictions for Watergate: &quot;A bunch&quot;.....for &quot;Monicagate&quot; - zeroI fear that this one-sided, narrowly focused essay will do nothing to help &quot;heal&quot; the divisions in our country. As a &quot;fellow&quot; of the conservative Heritage Foundation, Mr. Bennett's position vis-a-vis Clinton is already known to many.The only &quot;good&quot; thing I have to say is thank goodness I didn't pay any of my money for it...it came as a &quot;gift&quot;...a &quot;gift&quot; the giver wanted BACK if I didn't like it: &quot;Just don't throw it in the trash&quot; he said. Hey, if you gave it to me, it's now mine to do with as I like, isn't it?

Bennett will have to re-dissect the &quot;throw no stones&quot; Clinton defense. The book fails as a political autopsy, and only hints at the underlying disease.

Both theater critics with an incisive eye and no nonsense look at the Utilitarian world that raped and pillaged the performing arts since the time of JS Mill and Stanley Jevons. No one has told this story better. The rest of the book is more \\"of the sixties\\" and has a lot of out of date stuff about taste that any writer can be forgiven, since he had to have an audience but what makes this five stars is his clarity about who the villains are here. Kerr was the first person to make me understand what was meant by all of the outrageous statements by artists over the past century and half about the \\"uselessness\\" of Art.That it is non \\"sense\\" (literally) since art is based in the evolution and development of perceptivity and patterning skills in a delightful package; and that it has both biological and evolutionary purpose in the development of the human mind, \\"nonsense\\" is the correct word. That reality makes the \\"Art is useless\\" comments by 19th and 20th century artists strange at best and incomprehensible at worst until Walter Kerr wrote his book, did the research and organized those chapters on the evolution of neo-classical economics. A discipline that has destroyed classical public goods and placed evolutionary development in the hands of the upper 2% who choose the taste for the rest of us.I first read this book in the 1970s after leaving the Army and going to conservatory. Since that time I have just watched Kerr's prophecy ravage the place until we went from 1,300 opera houses in Iowa in 1900 to 210 nationwide in 2000. Now there are less. The Utilitarians were the barbarians at the gate and Kerr showed us."},{"Title":"10 Minute Guide to Lotus Notes 6","review":"Due to company mergers I was switched from Microsoft Outlook 2000 to Lotus Notes 6.5. For those who've never used Notes let me assure you it's nothing like any other email client, and if you've ever heard anyone complain about Notes they were probably justified. I compared this and three other books on Notes: How to Use Lotus Notes R6, Using Lotus Notes and Domino 6, and Lotus Notes 6 for Dummies. I thought this book was the best for someone like me, needing to use Notes for email, contacts, and calendaring, but not too much database \\"collaboration\\" or programming.This book is a no-frills, concise overview of major Notes features with lots of step-by-step how-tos on common tasks. It isn't really well-suited for someone who's not comfortable using a computer because it packs a lot of info on every page without unnecessary filler, has fewer screen shots than other books, and it's entirely black and white--this book is more for people who're comfortable \\"messing around\\" with Notes to get used to it and provides pointers to places where things are kind of obscured in Notes.I've used many email clients and I work with computers for a living, but after fiddling with Notes for a few days there are still some things I just can't get a grip on like Replicating (sort of like Synchronizing in Outlook) and Archiving (very loosely related to PST files in Outlook), and there are many preferences/settings that aren't easy to find, or find again later, without the help of a book like this. This book is great to get you started without having to wade through the amusing rhetoric and diatribe of a Dummies book or the extraneous programming sections of a more comprehensive guide.Unfortunately neither this book nor any of the others I looked at completely explained how to do some things in Notes that were very easy in Outlook like synchronizing to disk so you can work with email while offline, and saving email to disk so you can go back and read/reply much later. This and the other books simply said \\"it's a good idea to delete email you no longer need so it doesn't clutter up your Inbox.\\" This makes no sense to someone who's used to saving every single email in offline folders. It definitely isn't a \\"guide to Notes for Outlook users.\\"If you're new to Notes but not a timid user of computers and email this book will help get you started quickly and later serve to remind you of things Notes puts in odd places. If you've used Notes before but are new to R6 or 6.5, this book may give you some useful info on new features but it may not clearly differentiate them. If you want the most info with the minimum to read (or pay!), this is the ticket. In any case if you're trying to figure out how to make Notes synchronize and archive email like Outlook, this book mentions those things but since they're somewhat foreign concepts in Notes you won't get the detail you're looking for, if it even exists!"},{"Title":"The Mode of Information: Poststructuralism and Social Context","review":"Electronic communications today have, according to Mark Poster, radically altered our discursive patterns, thus reconfiguring our perceptions of ourselves and our relationships with others. The Mode of Information: Poststructuralism and Social Context argues that \\"new forms of language wrapping are imposing significant changes in the social field, and that poststructuralist theory is uniquely appropriate to interpret this\\" phenomenon. This thesis is quite provocative, but Poster's delivery is somewhat uneven.An appreciation of this book requires at the very least a working knowledge of poststructuralism and the four theorists on which Poster focuses (Baudrillard, Foucault, Derrida, and Lyotard). Poster only rather briefly addresses the relevant theories themselves, and to a reader unfamiliar with the discipline, Poster's focus on application and his jargon-laden text will be somewhat inaccessible.Poster argues, as I indicated, somewhat unevenly. Much of the book is spent exposing minute shortcomings of Marxist, Weberian, and various other structure-oriented theories of communications, and the reader is often left wondering when Poster himself will articulate a theory. Therein lies a significant concern; Poster decries totalizing theories, arguing that such theorization is a feature of the \\"new, linguistically-based, structures of domination\\" in our contemporary society. Thus, the latter two-thirds of the book apply poststructuralist theory to individual forms of electronic communication, and Poster never provides a framework for understanding society as a whole.This, of course, is a hallmark of postmodern theory, and many readers will undoubtedly find sections of this book quite outlandish, particularly the chapters on Derrida and Lyotard. The chapters on Baudrillard and Foucault are, however, quite well argued and provide some excellent analysis of the impact of television advertisements and databases. The theses of these sections are relatively innocuous, and even a reader who strongly disagrees with the tenets of poststructuralism will find here something of value.Generally speaking, The Mode of Information will be welcomed by those who embrace poststructuralism and avoided by those who reject it. For the more ambivalent reader, Poster's book is a thought-provoking investigation into our contemporary means of communication."},{"Title":"The Mode of Information: Poststructuralism and Social Context","review":"Everyone who wants to understand how subjectivity, the \\"in here\\" of each of us, is shaped in the late modern age must read two chapters of this book. What McLuhan did for media, Poster does for information; he explains how databases and computer science set us up and bring us forth in their own distinctive ways. Saying he \\"explains\\" is perhaps too strong; the shaping of our \\"in here\\" is an elusive matter. But if you're looking to understand critics who complain that our everyday life is \\"informatized\\" and that the self is \\"multiplied by databases,\\" these chapters are superior to anything I've read eleswhere, especially given their brevity. The remainder --an introduction to post-industrial society and chapters on TV commercials and electronic writing--are excellent and will be useful to many.Poster's perspective is commonly known as \\"post-modern,\\" and he enlists four seminal thinkers to do the heavy lifting: Jean Baudrillard (TV commercials), Michel Foucault (databases), Jacques Derrida (electronic writing) and Francois Lyotard (computer science). Readers who are not familiar with this perspective or these authors may find themselves befuddled. Poster doesn't do much handholding; the book is a terse 150+ pages. To remedy this situation, readers may want to bone up with Robert HollingerPostmodernism and the Social Sciences: A Thematic Approach (Contemporary Social Theory)and/or Pauline Marie Rosenau,Post-Modernism and the Social Sciences.Once you're up to speed, anyone thinking hard about how the self, the hero of modernism, emerges within post-modern or more modestly late modern conditions will find Poster's slender volume an important contribution."},{"Title":"Separations: Two Novels of Mothers and Children","review":"Readers of Martin Seymour-Smith's invaluable, but suprsingly unappreciated, \\"Guide to 20th Century Literature,\\" are aware of certain writers of high talent who have yet to be translated into English. When Seymour-Smith's book appeared in 1985 these included Roberto Arlt, Jose Maria Arguedas, and Massimo Bontempelli. Now two of Bontempelli's strange works have appeared in translation. The novels are strange, it is (or should be) a commonplace that they prefigure magic realism. Estelle Gilson, the translator, has provided us with a brief introduction. She does not really discuss the style of the context of the books very much, but she does tell us how this supporter of Fascism criticized its aggressive and beligerent tone in 1938, as well as the race laws. He had a Jewish nephew who joined the American army and helped to liberate Buchenwald. He was apparently threatened with death by the Fascists during the Republic of Salo and was elected a pro-Communist senator in 1948, only for his election to be annuled because of his fascist ties.The two novels were written in the late twenties. \\"The Boy with Two Mothers,\\" is the more openly supernatural of the two. It is a story of reincarnation, and the title is deceiving since the boy never recognizes more than one mother at a time. Once the conceit is understood, the novel is less interesting as a fantastic tale, than as the story and determination of Luciana Veracina. As the mother of the boy before he was reincarnated she is an interesting portait of a strong ruthless woman who will do anything for her child, and for her sense of motherhood, ignoring both the boy's father and his current mother. She is resourceful, independent, cunning, rather callous towards other people's feelings, and much more impressive than her son's other mother. One is tempted to see a portrait of a fascist woman, or more accurately the portrait of a fascist as a woman. And yet women in Fascist Italy are supposed to support Fascist men, not be Fascist men. And yet that does not fully appreciate the irony of the ending.\\"The Life and Death of Adria and Her Children,\\" is less supernatural, and more interesting. Adria is not unlike Luciana, but in her case she has dedicated herself to preserving her beauty at all costs, while ignoring her husband and two children. When she realizes that decline is inevitable she goes to a mansion, isolates herself from all humanity and from all mirrors except one hidden and not to be used for twelve years. If there is any moral in her story, and the death of her two children (one who both lives and dies as it were) it is not obvious, and not one that Adria ever cares to learn. The style is more interesing and more memorable: \\"Boundless vacuity emanated from her singsong lamentation and shone in her suffering, childlike face\\" he says of one character. Adria is one day on the beach: \\"She listens to tender words, idiotic words, words as frivolous as flies. And like swarms of flies, men and women cross the sands, buzzing as they flit to the edge of the sea, holding hands in a line like strings of paper dolls.\\" In this little known volume, there is a work of an important writer, an undiscovered Italian master as it were."},{"Title":"Separations: Two Novels of Mothers and Children","review":"Separations presents two major works by Italian novelist Massimo Bontempelli under one cover.

I found that this version was easier to read than the esteemed 'landmark' edition (which has summaries, pictures, and maps), because there is more text and less distraction! Not much room in the margins, though, unfortunately. All in all, this translation is literal and generally quite good -- a good choice for studying or pleasure. However, most people I've spoken to have LOVED the landmark, so I also do not hesitate to suggest it.The text itself will drag in places if you are not completely gung-ho for everything about war. However, contained within are a lot of remarkable insights about the human condition which have remained stable for thousands of years. Well worth the struggle."},{"Title":"The Peloponnesian War","review":"I read this years ago as a young soldier. It was required reading for cavalry officers in my regiment. I thought I would load it up on the Kindle and read it again with the benefit of 25 years experience. The text is, of course, marvelous. However, the formatting is awful. Sentence breaks don't line up, but rather break at odd intervals through the page. It makes reading considerably less enjoyable.

Otherwise - needs work is the best I can say."},{"Title":"The Peloponnesian War","review":"Contrary to statements by other reviewers, I can report that this text is properly formatted, at least on a Kindle 3.

On the Kindle it was an enjoyable and enlightening read. Previous customer reviews give ample detail regarding its significance and its relevance to modern times.Read in conjunction withThe OdysseyorThe Iliad, it's easy to see how many of the battles fought between Athens, Sparta, and their surrogates could have become epic tales and poems in their own right.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Peloponnesian War","review":"My edition is an old Penguin paperback\\"For the power of Athens rests on mercenaries rather than on her own citizens; we, on the other hand, are less likely to be affected on this way, since our strength is on men rather than on money.\\" This could have been said also by the proud Japanese up until the bomb was dropped in WWII, or by the Taliban of the Left or the Muslim suicide-bombers of today.\\"This is a peculiarity of ours: we do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all.\\" said by the Athenians. Both quotes speak volumes of the views they held of their own societies.And Pericles himself: \\"My own opinion is that when the whole state is on the right course it is a better thing for each individual than when private interests are satisfied but the state as a whole is going downhill. However well off a man may be in his private life, he will still be involved in the general ruin if his country is destroyed.\\" The Cubans, North Koreans should not miss the significance of what is said here. And doesn't well off sound very much like well fare? If (almost) everybody is poor is it more just than some be poor and others rich? So for the sake of fairness we all are going poorer in the West, spiritually, culturally, and therefore economically.And what about Pericles' foreign policy? \\"I prefer the man who stands up to danger rather than the one who runs away from it ... Your empire is now like a tyranny: it may have been wrong to take it; it is certainly dangerous to let it go ... Those who are politically apathetic can only survive if they are supported by people who are capable of taking action [that goes for the American Left and the American military respectively]. They are quite valueless in a city which controls an empire, though they would be safe slaves in a city that would be controlled by others.\\" And who is going to control the world today is the USA refuses to? No wonder Athens declined once Pericles was out of the picture.Now a good response to the isolationist utopias of Libertarians: \\"It is a general and necessary law of nature to rule wherever one can. This is not a law that we (Athenians) made ourselves, nor were we the first to act upon it when it was made. We found it already in existence, and we shall leave it to exist for ever among those who come after us ... we know that you or anybody else with the same power as ours would be acting in precisely the same way.\\"The book is very dense, but intense. It has to be read slowly, in little sips, or else it can become tiresome. The speeches are glorious stuff. The images vivid, as could only be from a man who played a military role during the events narrated. The actions, tactics, comings-and-goings can become dizzying, but overall it is a imperishable classic that should be read by anyone who claims a right to vote and by those who call ourselves citizens and not lackeys or serfs."},{"Title":"The Peloponnesian War","review":"The history of the Peloponnesian is a brilliant account of a classic war that began as a preemptive attack on Athens by Sparta to prevent the domination of the Greeks by the Athenians. The war began in the year 427 BC and ended 27 years later with the defeat of Athens by Sparta. This history however is only up to the 21st year of the war. Although there are several translations of the work I selected the translation by Thomas Hobbes the 17th century philosopher. It is the first done in the English language. Thucydides was a soldier on the Athenian side which in a sense puts a lie to the common notion that it is the winners of war who write history. The war was finally won by Sparta, powerful on land, and an oligarchy with a communal outlook on life defeating Athens with the strongest navy in the world, and a democracy with an individualistic outlook on life. Ironically it is Sparta's eventual mastery of the sea that defeated the Athenians. Whether or not this bodes ill for America remains to be seen. History is not over.Thucydides relates not only the battles of the war in some detail describing tactics and the individuals involved, but also the strategy and the politics. There is intrigue, treason, broken alliances, and hubris. The winners of a battle rarely show mercy and treason is dealt with harshly with often entire towns put to the sword or enslaved. Among the combatants there is respect for the strong and contempt for the weak. Truces are often held to bury the dead because the dead are respected by all.Unlike Homer's Illiad written about one thousand years earlier Thucydides does not mention the gods as having a say in the outcome of the war. While religion is a factor it is not a determining factor in the conduct and outcome of the war. One could argue that Thucydides is a secular account of history whereas Homer is a more religious account.Thucydides should be mandatory reading and study for all white males between the ages of 16 and 18 of above average IQ. The History will prepares them for war and instill in them the desire and willingness to defeat the enemy. It teaches contempt for the enemy which is a valuable attitude in war. Pericles funeral oration to the Athenians is the most inspiring and most moving speech ever given. The resemblance of this speech to the Gettysburg address is obvious and leads one to conclude that if Pericles could inspire Abraham Lincoln in his thinking then Thucydides' History did so likewise and influenced the strategy and the eventual outcome of the Civil War including the period of reconstruction. The contrast between the Spartan outlook on life and that of the Athenians to the adversaries in all subsequent wars up to the present war on terror is striking indeed. There are lessons still to be learned from the Peloponnesian War and woe to those that fail to learn these lessons."},{"Title":"Postpartum Mood And Anxiety Disorders: A Guide","review":"This book has many case studies and describes each aspect of postpartum disorders in great detail.

First, the storyshows the world as almost entirely evil. All the characters except forone man and the puppy are either actively mean or just completely uncaring. The illustrator had some talent, but no forethought concerning how the illustrations might come across to the young reader. They were frightenning and conducive to nightmares."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"The main character, a cute puppy named Buster is the best part of this predictable story about a pup who is abandoned in the cold, hard world after his typical puppy naughtiness causes his owners to get sick of him. He then faces other uncaring people and some territorial animals like a big mean collie and a big mean tabby cat. Finally he follows a whole group of people who are going house to house singing Christmas carols. They don't even notice he's with them they're so wrapped up in their holiday spirit. Finally an old man who lives alone takes Buster in and the day is saved. The identical story could be told without the illustrations featuring Christmas trees, holly, or colorful paper chains. It feels like those touches were added just to make a book that would sell at Christmas. The illustrations are well executed and colorful. The dog is as adorable as can be with sad eyes and one floppy ear but the collie and the tabby look like werewolves in comparison. Out of twelve adults and three children that come in contact with this baby dog on a cold winter's night, only one, the old man, even gives a hoot. This might make a good conversation starter for teaching little ones about taking responsibility and having compassion but there are better ways to do that and there are certainly better holiday picture books to read to the kids at Christmastime."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"A wonderful book about an abandoned dog who eventually finds a home at Christmas time. It warms your heart and is a favorite of my 8 year old daughter's. It made my daughter think about how awful it would be to abandon a pet. It's a fairly easy read with a few challenging words. -- A nice happy ending to keep the Christmas spirit."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"ISBN 0590679848 - I love kids' Christmas books and have been reading piles of them lately. This is the only one that I am so completely torn about that I've put off reviewing it to give it some thought. I'm splitting the difference here and giving it 3 stars, and I'll tell you why.As a puppy, Buster leaves his mother to go to a new home, where he is cared for and called cute. That changes when, as he grows, he jumps on his owners and chews on their things. They leave him on the side of a road, in the middle of winter, because they don't want him anymore. Buster doesn't understand this and waits for them to return and, when they don't, he begins to wander, looking for someone who will take him in. Eventually, he finds the right someone and a new home.It sounds like author Linda Jennings has written a touching story, but it isn't quite that simple. Even the back cover blurb is harsh: \\"Buster's family has thrown him out. They don't want a dog anymore.\\" And the story is pretty harsh, at times, as well, and pretending this is just a great book with no down side is silly. First, his original owners yell at him and literally \\"pushed him out of the car and left him on the edge of a wide, busy road\\". No one notices him there and when he ventures into the road, he is nearly run over and he is yelled at, again. He is chased from one house by a huge dog who snaps at his tail. At another house, he is chased off by a cat. Finally, he joins a group of carolers who fail to notice him until they sing at Mr. Merriweather's house and he offers them all cookies, including Buster. That's a LOT of trauma in one short book. It is easy to see why some parents would find it to be something they wouldn't want for their own child.On the other hand, the \\"cold, cruel world\\" thing is fairly accurate and Buster is more exposed to oblivious people than outright mean ones. The territorial animals can't really be faulted for acting like territorial animals. And kids - those small people who love 101 Dalmatians, where a lady plans to make a coat out of some dogs - will not only survive hearing this tale, they'll enjoy it. The illustrations, by Catherine Walters, are a bit dark (the brightest one is the cover), but it's night time! They're a little spooky, but the world is spooky to Buster, so it's fitting. The final two images, where Buster has found a new home, are quite differently \\"lit\\" than the others. The details, in all of them, are great.If nothing else, this book would make a great conversation starter about getting a puppy, knowing that it will grow into a dog but also realizing that pet adoption should be a lifetime commitment, not to be taken lightly. It's also a good chance to talk about how people should treat animals, in general. For that opportunity alone, the book is worth picking up. If your kid made it through Cruella DeVille, your kid will make it through this one, but it really is a matter of personal parenting choice.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"I bought this book for my children, and they loved this book. They request on my reading it to them every night. If someone tells you about the uncaring few people not wanting this cute puppy, then they are only telling you negative. The whole point of this story is when a sweet elderly man finds the pup, and now not only does the puppy have a friend, but so does the man. It has an excellent heart-warming ending. You have to at least take this book into consideration, because it will make you and your child appreciate your family more. I would really like to rate this book 100 stars if I could!"},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"Read this story to my son every year for around 12 years. It was one of his favorite. Lost the book in hurricane katrina. My granddaughters live with us now and purchased it to read to them, and it is now one of their favorites. Both my son and granddaughters love hunting the animals hidding in the pictures."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"I want to start off by saying if you think this book will teach your child to abandon their pets, you are just plain stupid.This is a very heart warming story about an abandoned puppy who finally finds a good home, after his family leaves him when they decide they don't want him anymore.If anything, your child would learn that cruelty towards your pet is wrong and would refrain from doing so.This was one of my favorite stories as a kid. The illustrations in the book are wonderful, and I still remember the good feeling I would get after my mom would read me the story.Oh, and I still have all my pets I had when I was a little girl, didn't abandon them because of a book :)"},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"As a School Librarian my kids especially loved this story, around the holidays."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"Kids in my Kindergarten class love this book and ask me to read it over and over. It's a great book to get kids talking about kindness and what makes a loving family. I agree with everything the previous reviewer wrote and I am surprised at the couple of negative reviews. One wrote, \\"the story shows the world as almost entirely evil\\"... I think it shows the world through the eyes of a little puppy, something young kids can really relate to. The same person wrote, \\"the illustrations... were frightenning and conducive to nightmares\\". Are we talking about the same book?"},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"This book is horrible. I thought it was going to be a nice Christmas story about a dog. When I started reading it to my 7-year-old I was horrified. A family gets a puppy that they love at first, but as it grows up they yell at him and tell him he's, \\"more trouble than he's worth.\\" So, instead of surrendering the dog to a shelter, they \\"pushed him out of the car and left him on the edge of a wide, busy road.\\" Ultimately, the dog finds a new home and the book has a happy ending, but not before he's almost hit by 2 cars, is bit by another dog, is yelled at by other people, etc. If the author is trying to use the book to teach kindness and compassion, she could have achieved the same thing by having the dog surrendered to a shelter. Unfortunately, I think some kids may think if they can't keep a pet anymore, a good solution would be to leave it by the side of the road so their pet will have a happy ending like in the book. I am getting rid of this book and urge others not to buy it."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"I picked up this book because it looked like a cute heartwarming story about a little dog at Christmas time. What I found was frankly appalling. What is it saying to our children when a storybook talks about leaving a dog on the side of the road simply because his family didn't want him anymore? The responsibility of having a pet is very big and is a hot topic for many families. And to teach a child that it is OK to \\"throw away\\" a pet is unacceptable. I urge you to not get this book and I am throwing mine straight in the garbage."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Found Christmas","review":"Couldn't the dog have just been taken to an animal shelter? Why did the story have to go that extra, extremely cruel, mile of leaving the dog in an unknown part of town? Yes, teaching children about responsibility is a really good thing, but not at the expense of an animal. To say to the animal, \\"You are more trouble then you are worth\\" is just plain heartless.Please, there is little lesson to be gained from kids reading this book."},{"Title":"Human Evolution: An Illustrated Introduction","review":"I am an anthro grad and felt I needed an update, having been away from the field for some time. This is a great overview of current thinking in the field. Terminology has changed. New concepts have evolved. It's just what I wanted. I don't know WHY hominids are now hominins, but the author almost apologetically informs me that's the way it is, so I've got to change. OK, if I have to, I guess.I'm somewhat dumbfounded by these other reviews. I can't imagine why Roten calls this book awful. In what way? The writing is clear. It's not the least bit boring, and he doesn't overwhelm you with arcane detail. If you want a popularist treatment of the subject, go for it. You can always read a Donald Johansen book and listen to him brag about himself. This book isn't out to entertain you, but to inform you. I read half of this on an airplane and was captivated.Another three-star review says he is continually reminded this is a textbook. Well, duh! It IS a textbook used, among other places, at Oxford. And there's nothing at all wrong or poor about the pictures or illustrations. They are very helpful.And, no, it doesn't have Homo florensis. That was only first detailed in late 2004. This book came out in 2005, so the text must have been finished prior. There is no way it could have included florensis. It is updated every five years and is in its fifth edition. I'm sure the author will include florensis next time. Be patient. Florensis isn't such a big deal anyway. Most anthropologists think it is an island-isolated erectus anyway. It doesn't 're-write' paleontology. Oh, wait! The news stories say it did!My only mild criticism of the book is that it is too short with too little detail. But for what it is and what it is intended to be, it's great! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Human Evolution: An Illustrated Introduction","review":"This book deserves its description as introductory,and therefore it shouldn't be confused with more advanced works,but within the outlined scope a very outstanding quality has been reached in elaboration of highly particular issues which are of crucial relevance for gaining threedimensional perspective-spatial,temporal and causal-not only in classical introductory remarks that are to be found in similar books,but also in succesfull blending of these with wealth of theoretical insights into evolutionary process and biocultural adaptation.Bibliographic entries are few,provided with each chapter,but this is not deficit for such brief book.Highly recomendable for primary knowledge of evolution-it is neither too simplistic,and also not too elitistic."},{"Title":"Human Evolution: An Illustrated Introduction","review":"I'm no anthropologist, but I have spent the past decade or so studying science. Recently, my interests have turned to biological anthropology and I have been building a library of books. This is one of my favorites! The text is easy to read and the pictures and diagrams are good. As an educator, I am always looking for more resources to supplement the texts that I adopt for my classes. This is a great reference and easy read for an introductory class. Where more detailed information is lacking, I just beef it up with materials from my other books. I only wish that I had an electronic copy!"},{"Title":"Human Evolution: An Illustrated Introduction","review":"A good entry level book. Illustrations are fair but photography is quite poor. The writing stile continuously reminds you this is a textbook. The fifth edition needs updating, no word about Homo floresiensis. All in all though a good quick reference book to keep handy."},{"Title":"Human Evolution: An Illustrated Introduction","review":"This book is so bad that I want to burn it instead of selling it back for mad cash. It is and extremely difficult to follow reference on subject matter that is already difficult enough. The only redeeming factor is the pictures, some of which are very amusing. However, nothing can save this book, as it might be the worst thing ever written. If I could give it zero stars I would do that."},{"Title":"The Cancer Dictionary: An A-to-Z Guide to more than 2500 Terms","review":"Everything you need to know about cancer is in this book.

Great book to buy!"},{"Title":"The Cancer Dictionary: An A-to-Z Guide to more than 2500 Terms","review":"This book is so much easier to have on hand than a Nurses reference book. It simply and directly defines just about all cancer terms and most diseases. It also has a reference section in the back that gives you addresses and phone numbers of important cancer organizations. I like how quick and simple it is to use. More pictures and drawings would be nice. But the ones they used were the most important ones for me. Don't leave this one off your list."},{"Title":"The Cancer Dictionary: An A-to-Z Guide to more than 2500 Terms","review":"This book is an indispensable tool in anyone's efforts to better understands cancer treatment terminology. With this book I also highly recommend another cancer book I found at amazon.com. &quot;World Without Cancer&quot; Especially to the cancer sufferer, these books helped our fight with cancer. We found the information we needed to make educated decisions about treatment."},{"Title":"Lovey Mary","review":"It really is a pretty story. I really enjoyed it.

Peter Thompson shows great promise here as an author of science-based suspense thrillers, and *Living Proof* is all the more exemplary in its employment of \\"secret biological warfare experiments\\" subject matter, which recent political events have rendered uncomfortably plausible.Readers may differ as to whether they believe our government is capable of the kind of conspiratorial skullduggery suggested by Thompson. My own impression was that while the basic premise that the government might develop illegal secret weapons is sadly realistic, some aspects of the \\"secret plan\\" uncovered as the story unfolds were ultimately too bizarre even for most hardcore conspiracy buffs. But sorry, no spoilers!As is typical for this kind of quick-read thriller, the major characters (and especially the \\"bad guys\\") are drawn with a fairly broad brush without a lot of complexity. So it goes. Despite the obvious made-for-the-big-screen chararacteristics of both personalities and plot, this book succeeds as entertainment.

And with LIVING PROOF, the debut novel by Peter J. Thompson, you'll be turning pages long into the night.At its core, LIVING PROOF is a classic man-on-the-run tale.

Thompson clearly has his finger on the pulse of today's headlines, and his writing skills ensure that his readers will feel their own hearts racing as a result. The author shows a fine talent for crafting action scenes that pack a furious, visceral punch.In summary, LIVING PROOF is a strong first novel from a promising new voice. ... I'm eager to see more from him in the future."},{"Title":"Living Proof","review":"Ramon Willis is on Death Row in Texas at the beginning of \\"Living Proof,\\" a thriller by first-time author Peter Thompson. Willis was convicted of murder, and he is on the verge of being executed, despite his repeated claims of innocence. Lena Dryer is an ambitious reporter who interviews Ramon for a series of newspaper articles that she is writing on the death penalty. Soon, Ramon becomes a target when he uncovers a bizarre conspiracy involving the prison system and high-ranking members of the military. He enlists Lena's aid and the pair frantically try to stop the plan before it is implemented. If Ramon and Lena are caught, they will be quickly eliminated.Thompson does a good job of setting up the novel. His opening sequences effectively draw the reader into the action. Thompson's characterization of the death penalty, Texas style, is chilling and realistic. Without editorializing, the author brings home the horrifying nature of assembly-line executions.Thompson maintains a high level of suspense throughout the book, keeping the reader turning pages anxiously to see how the story will play out. I liked the character of Ramon, an intelligent and compassionate individual who used his time in prison to \\"get his act together\\".There are a few areas where the book falters. Conspiracy theories are a staple of current fiction, and the conspiracy in \\"Living Proof\\" is a little too far out to be believed. The villains are stereotypes, with no shading or subtlety. In addition, as the book progresses, the plot becomes rushed and repetitious, as the good guys constantly scramble to stay one step ahead of the bad guys.However, \\"Living Proof\\" is a worthy first effort. Peter Thompson is a promising author with a knack for writing suspense and I look forward to his development as a writer."},{"Title":"Living Proof","review":"This was a book I couldn't put down. I tried to--started reading Living Proof last night, then woke up at 4:30 a.m. thinking about it--and couldn't do another thing until I finished it today. The story unfolds at breakneck pace. Each scene seems so real, believable, and exciting. Peter Thompson really knows how to write--plot, character development, he has it all down pat. I can't wait for his second book to come out. In the meantime, I hope Living Proof will be made into a movie! I'm going to go out now and buy six more copies to give to my friends.

An innocent man, Ramon soon discovers that his supposed death leads to a horrifying secret. He has become part of a military run experiment, and he is expendable. While Ramon survives a test injection longer than any of the other subjects, three weeks is sufficient to order his termination. Fortunately, a soldier with a conscience comes to his rescue, giving him life to allow the truth to surface.Now Ramon is on the run, depending on journalist Lena Dryer to help. She had been writing an expose on Texas executions, and witnessed Ramon's death. His sudden reappearance offers her a chance at headlines and prestige-if she can live long enough to make the dream come true. Together they must stay alive long enough to find someone who will believe their improbable story.Author Peter J. Thompson provides a plausible, horrifying look at possibilities in this debut offering. With a plot that could have been torn from newspaper headlines, Thompson combines biological warfare, conspiracy theory and medical experiments in this suspenseful thriller that readers will find impossible to put down. Ramon has a history of petty, though not violent, crime, rescuing his character from the usual absolute innocence. Lena thinks of headlines before any other priorities, resulting in unexpected tragedy. While flawed people, together Ramon and Lena make a memorable team. Although some of the plot may be a bit predictable, it is written with sufficient punch to keep the reader glued to the pages. Strikingly rendered and thoughtful executed, LIVING PROOF comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Living Proof","review":"This new thiller from Peter J. Thompson will keep you on the edge of your sit. From the first page till the last, this creative and exciting story takes the reader on a roller coaster ride of suspense. I loved it and have bought copies to give to some friends.

Meanwhile Austin Star reporter Lena Dryer investigates the death penalty and concludes Ramon received a terrible defense, but the state sought conviction not truth.A week later Dr. Conrad Meeks injects the lethal poison and announces Ramon dead. However, Ramon awakens to find himself a \\"guest\\" of the Army conducting chemical experiments on the homeless or the death row inmates. Three weeks later Ramon still lives in perfect health, a shocker as everyone else exposed to the chems dies rather quickly. Lieutenant Charley Green, realizing the illegality of the experiments, frees Ramon before dying. The government chases Ramon to stop him from exposing them and willingly kills innocents like Barry for the \\"bigger good\\". Refusing to hide in Mexico, Ramon turns to Lena as his only hope to destroy a nasty conspiracy.LIVING PROOF is an exciting cautionary tale that warns on two levels: anything but the facts death penalty (of course the author lives in Illinois) and the hidden military top secret R&amp;D perhaps focusing on biological and chemical warfare. The story line is very exciting from the opening gamut when it is obvious the state is more interested in closing the books than insuring a fair trial before switching to a human guinea pig experiment and finally into a chase thriller. Fans of action packed conspiracy thrillers will appreciate the smooth transitions of Peter J. Thompson's strong tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Living Proof","review":"This Book Rocked. I read in 5 days. Totaly aswome book. I cant wait till his next novel."},{"Title":"Living Proof","review":"This book put me very much in mind of one of my favorite authors, Martin Cruz Smith, in style and pace. Mr. Thompson has done a great job of riveting the reader to characters that come and go around his main protagonist Ramon Willis. His use of contemporary history blends into this novel to add a compelling authenticity to an imaginative plotline.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it."},{"Title":"Gauguin Tahiti","review":"Most art books give you lots of gorgeous plates and a view from 50,000 feet of the artist's entire life. Gauguin Tahiti was a pleasant and positive exception from that generalization.The book does contain lots of gorgeous plates, but also shows a tremendous number of sketches and source materials backed with extensive notes on what the author wrote and said. This enables a careful reader to appreciate the development of icons, iconography, themes and cosmology. The number of interesting essays in the book is unexpectedly large: 17 by my count where the usual art book has perhaps 3 or 4. The essays come at Gauguin from slightly different perspectives, helping you to fill in a 360 degree view over time.Most art books focus on the artist's best known work. I was very pleased to see this book deal thoroughly with Gauguin's relatively little known sculptures, wood carvings, unusual prints and experimentation with materials and processes. To me, that made this book a particularly rich experience.If the book has a weakness, it's that the authors of the essays cannot quite bring themselves to describe the less attractive parts of Gauguin's life style and personal habits. So you end up with a partially sanitized package. Like so many artists, his ability to communicate visually was marred by a weak ability to relate to others in constructive and supportive ways.Be prepared to spend time with this book. Each essay builds on insights from earlier ones with lots of cross referencing of images. As a result, your knowledge will build to a level similar to that of taking an MFA course for a semester on Gauguin's Tahitian and South Sea works.If you read only one art book this year, you would do well to pick this one. This book will also make a wonderful gift for anyone who loves Gauguin's paintings and wants to learn more about his entire oeuvre.Take a close look!"},{"Title":"Gauguin Tahiti","review":"This book gives a lot of informaton over the Tahiti-period of Gauguin, not only of his paintings but also of his his sculpture and graphic work. It's state of the art, but a bit dull. Beside, if you want to know more about the exoticism in Gauguin's oeuvre or the symbolism in his work I recommend Gauguin's skirt by Stephen Eisenman or Symbolism by Rodolphe Rapetti. On the other hand, if you are interested in the total output of the artist (and not only his paintings), this book is highly recommemded."},{"Title":"Gauguin Tahiti","review":"Paul Gauguin (1848-1903) is one of 19th Century Europe's most mythic artists.

Very haunting."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"This is an interesting book. I watched the movie first and as a result I wanted to be sympathetic to Mr Panzram. After reading the book, i did change my opinion about the man. Although the book tries to blame the justice system for his actions, his own words give you insight into a mind that is self absorbed and feels that the rules of society only apply to others but not to him. I didn't give the book 5 stars only because the authors don't blame Panzram for his own actions."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"This is an amazing book. If you have any interest in our prison system or the abuse of the America society towards children this book will amaze you as well.This is a true story of a man whom was abused during his life time and all he wanted to do is kill people and die him self.He wanted to tell his story but did not trust anyone to tell his story to. He was befriended by one of the new guards at Leavenworth prison in Kansas.This guard one was one of the one persons in Panzrams life that he trusted.The whole book is written from true events penned by Panzram his self."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"Jim Long and Tom Gaddis did a great job on the book. But after reading Henry Lesser's \\"Recollections of Carl Panzram\\", I felt that Henry Lesser could have done just as good a job. Too bad self-publishing was not around in 1928. The big publishers were not interested in taking a risk and printing the graphic material. The heart of the story is truly the Panzram Papers themselves, which are a passionate autobiographical depiction of the life of a criminal. Unfortunately the book is not as passionate. The stuff on Sinclair I felt dragged the story flow. But the book was on a deadline and thus, there was material which was excluded from the book, some by choice and some, through no fault of the authors or publisher, may not have been known about at the time. This book really needs a proper re-release with the additional material included such as Jim Long's Afterward which has never been printed to this day. It also seems that there is some misinformation. Carl Panzram cannot be put into a box...literally. He cannot have a label placed on him. He can have many, some of which would be: grandiose, psychopath, intelligent, truthful, prison reformer, writer, philosopher, teacher, coward, martyr, career criminal, serial killer, innocent victim, escape artist, shapeshifter and inventor. There are hundreds of lessons to learn from Carl Panzram's life. And they are a lot more realistic and obtainable than that other book about a martyr which so many people seem to read. Read Panzram's words, they are the heart, soul, and truth of the his story."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"Originally titled Killer: A Journal of Murder; had been out of print for many years; and is *the* classic of all first-person American prison narratives. Offers penetrating insights into both the pathology of a mass murderer and a penal system that has changed little since the turn of the century. Gaddis's and Long's footnoting--which doesn't drag on the narrative drive at all--provides crucial information concerning time, place and Panzram's evolving relationship with Lesser, the guard/aspiring writer who became Panzram's implied reader and without whom these accounts never would have been penciled. Panzram's darkness is bottomless, but at times, between the lines, one can hear the pounding of a wounded all-too human heart."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"Panzram's words are chilling and bare, but the failure comes in the book that Gaddis and Long have interspersed around them. They seek to use Panzram's case as an illustration of the failure of the barbaric penal system of the first decades of the 20th century and marvel at how Panzram was almost rehabilitated under a permissive prison regime in Oregon. But they fail by not paying attention to Panzram's own words.Indeed, Panzram's story is not some generalizable failure of the penal system -- how many other boys were in the same prison in Red Wing and didn't turn into sociopathic killers? According to Panzram's own words, he was the worst one even at his arrival in Red Wing.In his memoir, Panzram details with glee murders he committed in various parts of the world when there was no long arm of the law to capture him; at that point, he could have lived as a free man in most of the world, even the United States. Panzram lays out plans he had for weapons of mass destruction in the manner of Timothy McVeigh and for bioterrorism at a time when such those words had not needed to be coined. The failure of the penal system is not that Panzram remained a criminal, but that of people who didn't kill him when they had justification.If you read this book, focus on Panzram's words and not on the apologetic muckraking for prison reform that surround them."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"In response to Shawn Sutherland's ponderance as to whether one might find redeeming value to reading about such a fellow as Carl Panzram, perhaps one might question what created such a man? And by discovering this one might prevent another such creature. Of course I'm presupposing that you find Mr. Panzram's actions to be something that this world couldn't use. I find myself admiring Mr. Panzram and striving to be more like him. Can you blame him for being disgusted with his fellow race? I find myself hating you more with each passing day. You allowed a man who has caused much more havoc and has done many more \\"evil\\" deeds to be elected to the office of the President of the United States. Yet you find fault with Mr. Panzram? You are a strange person.If you want to know what your society is making of men, then read about Carl Panzram. Perhaps then you will get an inkling of what you are capable. Dare you be as humane as Mr. Panzram. For is it not human nature to war on one another?"},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"Stay away from this book. Its purpose is to incite evil.

It has no redeeming value."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"Facts about some people in this book can not be proven.Author fails to give a bibliography of where me got information about laundry foreman killed by Carl Panzram."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"PANZRAM: A Journal of Murder by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. LongIn his time Carl Panzram murdered twenty-one human beings and committed just about every kind of impulsive psychopathic crime imaginable. Others have killed more - doubtless done as much damage - but because he wrote with such lucid unrepentance about his life and acts, Panzram stands out, leaving behind as eloquent a testimony as any criminal who put pen to paper.I am 36 years old and have been a criminal all my life. I have 11 felony convictions against me. I have served 20 years of my life in jails, reform schools and prisons. I know why I am a criminal. Others may have different theories as to my life but I have no theory about it. I know the facts. If any man was a habitual criminal, I was one. In my life I have broken every law that was ever made by both man and God.Sadistically punished at the reform schools he attended after his family broke up around 1899, he hit the road at fourteen, riding boxcars, robbing and setting fire to churches, and escaping whenever he could from jail. His descriptions of the tortures he experienced in prison at the hands of the warders are like something out of the Inquisition's annals. Travelling on steamers to Mexico, the Belgian Congo, and Europe, he became a proficient and remorseless murderer, despatching boys and young men (often his lovers) with rocks and pistols. Later on in captivity Panzram was to be very clear about who and why he became so wild.If someone had a young tiger cub in a cage and then mistreated it until it got savage and bloodthirsty and then turned it loose to prey on the rest of the world, to go anywhere and kill anyone it wanted to, then there would be a hell of a roar from those in danger of the mad tiger. Everyone would believe that to be the wrong thing to do. But if some people do the same thing to other people, then the world is shocked, surprised, offended [...] They done it to me and then don't like it when I give them the same does they gave me [...] If you are going to go on teaching others as you have taught me, then you must suffer the same as I.So while he would never admit it, decrying his religious schooling at length, Panzram's indoctrination at the hands of the reform school priests had burned an indelible philosophy straight from the Old Testament on the young Carl, one of righteous vengeance. Panzram sets out his life and crimes, brilliant stories of terrible deeds. He writes of his ideas of the roots of crime and institutional corruption, the scope of American crime, demolishes all fiction-romanticised ideas about criminals, and compiles the best glossary of criminal argot I've read.Had it not been for a meeting in 1928 with Henry Lesser, the life of Panzram would have been forgotten after his execution in 1930. For the next two years Lesser, a prison guard with a modernist reforming ethos, worked at making Panzram his friend, encouraging his writing and, despite Panzram's firm position that it was impossible, working to nurture some kind of conscience back into the convict's dark soul. It was to be of no use for Panzram who argued with a terrible finality (that must have been crushing for Lesser) that he was a unchangeable product of the cruelties inflicted against him. Lesser's efforts on his behalf though meant that Panzram's book (of which lengthy sections feature here) was eventually published thirty years after his death and brought to public attention the horrors of the unreformed system.A most timely book that should be read by anyone interested in extremes of the mind or life inside the American penal system in the first half of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"I've always wondered what made people like this do such awful and disgusting things as described in this book. I now have a better understanding after reading it. Not all criminals are made by bad parenting skills or savage prison systems but in this case it can't be mistaken what lead this man into what he would eventually become. Everything about Carl Panzram's story is a tragedy. His days as a child, adulthood, his confessed murders,the sickening natures of these murders and even his own death (which he gladly welcomed with open arms) will make anyone thankful they were not subject to these conditions."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"Carl Panzam, a Minnesota farm boy grew up in incredible poverty on a worn out dirt farm near the town of Warren. he had no toys except for a shovel and hoe, never had a birthday, subject to vicious beatings at the hands of family members. he was sent to the 'reform' school, a type of institution little better that a prison where spendingtax money on stone construction and heating systems and cafeteria meals were immensely, more important that helping troubled boys so that they can become usefull honest citizens. There Panzram, was subjected to vicious beatings administered by the local cracker staff because he was 'recalcitrant' in his english studies.He was probably, deslexic and had a great deal of difficulty with his studies. it was a thoroughly mean horrible place to grow up in. his experiences in this place, (just being in a place like this would stygmatise a person for life) and the tortures imposed on him in his adult life spent mostly in prison, he was probably molested by a reform achool staff member, help turn him into an utter unredeemable monster. he was remarkably, frank about his evil selfand his unredeemableness and about his sole goal in life to murder as many as possible, men, women, and even children. a classic example of how the state and its minions, are supposed to reform criminals into usefull citizensbut, in fact turn them into frankensteins.A must for people seriously interestedin criminalogy and a very unusual book."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"Written in 1928, and first published in 1970, the autobiography of Carl Panzram by himself is quite a read. In this book, you will have the whole Panzram text (including many letters from him, later in the book), but you will also have a lot of text by the authors, who give you a context, explanations that Panzram doesn't provide, and overall, clarifications on the whole thing, which are most welcome. Just know that perhaps over a half of this book is not written by Panzram himself.Carla Panzram spent most of his life in institutions, reform schools or prisons, and he developed a philosophy of hate that would justify, to him, a life devoted to robbing, raping, killing, burning, and destroying everyone and everything. His ideal plan was to kill the whole human race, no less.The book is undoubtedly an important item from a historical perspective, and sociological and psychological ones, but make sure not to easily fall into recycling this text for this or that ideology. Panzram clearly excuses himself, albeit in a vague and incoherent way, all of he does, because he has been hurt himself. He says it explicitly when he explains that he wants to take revenge on everyone, for things done to him, and it doesn't matter if those he takes revenge on never did anything to him; it was enough that they were the same kind of person who mistreated him.From a literary perspective, Panzram wrote in a prose style that Hemingway would give world-wide fame. The very first Panzram words in this book are quite excellent.If you expect extremely gruesome details of murders and rapes, you won't have them. Panzram made no bones about those things, and so, in a way, you get the feeling he doesn't care much about it, not enough to dwell on it a lot, which is what another serial killer would do. And this is exactly the thing that makes Panzram an unlikely candidate to be a \\"serial killer\\", even though he did kill 21 people, which is more than many famous serial killers. Panzram doesn't act out of psychopathy and antisocial feelings in the same manner as a regular killer does. The line is fine, and perhaps it isn't there at all.Another thing you will find in this volume is an excellent inside account of American institutions in the early 20th century. That is priceless, and few actually know the sort of torture used in those establishments back then. Remember that electo-torture scene in \\"Lethal Weapon\\"? With the sponge and Mel Gibson? Well that thing was used on Panzram, and known as the \\"humming bird\\".The book has a tendency to say that society produced Panzram through the way he was mistreated, but don't buy that too easily. Indeed, the fact is that everyone in the establishments Panzram was in was treated the same, and Panzram was the only one to develop a philosophy of hate and act on it the way he did. It's no excuse. Panzram truly is Milton's Satan when he devotes his sorry life to causing as much damage and harm as he can, until self-destruction.\\"Panzram\\" suffers from some typographical errors. For instance, and for unknown reasons, \\"he\\" often becomes \\"be\\" in the text. You'll easily correct the mistake, if you notice it at all, but it's there, and it's more frequent than you'd think. While Panzram's spelling was edited by the authors, they sometimes leave out a lot of mistakes, for unknown reasons once again. Panzram will write \\"tho\\" and \\"thru\\" and \\"its\\" instead of \\"it's\\" in some texts, and in others he will have a perfect spelling.This book should not be thought as a liberal's wet dream when it comes to criminality. Panzram was very much his own man throughout his life, making his own decisions, and explaining them himself with extreme clarity. He could have chosen a different path, many times over. He stuck to his plan of hate, and got what he had coming to him. Indeed, he has been out of prison a lot, through escapes, and earlier in his life legally, and he never once tried to lead an honest life. Yes, life is unfair, but if you can't accept it, you'll never make it. Panzram is the typical case of the person who truly thinks the world owes them. No man can live a good life with that philosophy. No matter how bad the world treats you, it will never owe you jack, and by \\"the world\\", I don't mean \\"people\\", I mean life in general."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"A great read into the mind and actions of a true monster.If you like serial killers and those like them, you'll dig this book.Several friends have borrowed it and came away impressed!(and disturbed)Again, if you have an interest in this kind of thing, this one won't let you down."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"If your wondering what a person filled with hate does or a person who hates everbody is like you'll enjoy this book. Panzram came from nothing and it filled him with rage against everbody but Henry Lesser (the man he wrote his memoir for). Filled with murder, arson, sodomy and burglary by the Devil himself. You get to read his memoir with the author filling in the history and blanks for you. The chapters are just short enough to take a break from the book, although I read it in two days. I've read crime, death scene books, WWII books and never come across a book so engrossing. A different kind of book for those who enjoy crime and serial killers. It's a good find."},{"Title":"Panzram A Journal of Murder","review":"I had never heard of Panzram until I saw a Youtube video on serial killers, and I got interested in reading this book because it is said to be his journal--written in his own words. I really wanted to understand how a psychopath thinks and feels, and didn't want it filtered through PC professional writers.I have now finished Panzram, and was somewhat disappointed to learn that his actual journal entries and letters comprise maybe 1/4 of the book, and the rest is filled in by descriptions of the times in which Panzram lived, the penal institutions that housed him, and other things. It was interesting, but I'd hoped to hear more about Panzram's motivations and why he did his crimes. There is some of that, but easily half the book is Panzram whining about how bad people made him bad. The truth is that Carl Panzram was pretty much bad from childhood, always in trouble, burning down churches, getting in fights, running away from home, etc.All that being said,Panzram is an interesting book despite the flaws and filler.

I wish this book had existed then. It would have helped me enormously to understand the apparently mysterious world of Malian Islam. But Soares' book is even more valuable today, when US policy makers are grappling with the possibility that Islamic extremists could turn the Sahara, including Mali's northern region, into another Afghanistan, even (some would have it) threatening US oil interests in the Gulf of Guinea.The author brings to this book not only first-rate scholarly credentials (he has lived with the people whereof he writes) but also a refreshingly level-headed approach to a subject which is often obscured by repetitive and alarmist group thought. According to most commentary, Malian (and West African)Islam is increasingly polarized between Islamist radicals on one side and so-called traditionalists, centered in and around the Sufi brotherhoods, on the other. Soares' careful, field-honed analysis demonstrates that in Mali there is a broad spectrum of Islamic belief that defies simplistic categorization. His insights help explain why Mali's diverse Islam has been a significant component of Mali's successful democratization based on a culture of tolerance.Anyone interested in Mali, Islam or African politics will profit from reading this well written book.Robert PringleAmbassador (retired)"},{"Title":"Body Mind Spirit: Exploring the Parapsychology of Spirituality","review":"Charles Tart, with a strong academic background (electrial engineering, psychology) has been diving into the depths of the paranormal many years.

It brings together a variety of perspectives from serious researchers. None of the chapters (each by a different author) was a waste of my time, and several were excellent. In answer to the previous reviewer, I don't believe the intent of this book is to &quot;convince&quot; anyone of the reality of psychical phenomena -- I believe the intent is to provoke thought as to how these phenomena might be explained and what they may mean. The entire problem with modern psychical research is that it has moved away from studying the phenomena on their own terms and has tried to cater to scientific materialism by imposing laboratory controls, an effort which has proved largely (but not entirely) fruitless. Anyway, this book is not aimed at close-minded skeptics (if it was, it would be published by Prometheus -- right?). It is aimed at those whose minds are open enough to take the evidence at face value and consider what it may mean. Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence (of which there is plenty) -- but they also demand extraordinary investigation and extraordinarily serious thought, efforts which the debunkers seem unwilling to make."},{"Title":"Body Mind Spirit: Exploring the Parapsychology of Spirituality","review":"Charles T. Tart's &quot;Body Mind Spirit&quot; is a reasonably satisfying exploration of metaphysical matters. Eleven parapsychologists explain their beliefs about psychic phenomena and spiritual hypotheses. There's no hype here: these are serious scientists doing their best to test rare and subtle effects. Experimental parapsychologists claim to have proven that people can sometimes communicate nonphysically (telepathy), perceive distant objects or events (clairvoyance), foretell the future (precognition), and influence quantum events (psychokinesis). One can disagree, of course, but the experiments can be studied in parapsychology texts by Edge, Krippner, Kurtz, and Wolman (listed here in footnotes and a lengthy bibliography). Other parapsychologists try to rule out the above four influences when they study out-of-body and near-death experiences, past-life recall, apparitions, channeling, poltergeists, and dozens of other reported phenomena. As William Braud says, &quot;A great deal of what is encountered along the spiritual path is quite beyond the reach of current science. Here, one must be armed with trust, faith, hope, love, discernment, and a tolerance for ambiguity and for contraries, rather than with the feelings of safety, certainty, familiarity, and understanding that science can provide.&quot; One of Tart's conclusions, after decades of such study, is that something spiritual probably does survive death, but that little of a separate, body-shaped personality is likely to survive for long. William G. Roll argues that souls attach not to our bodies so much as to our families, posessions, and all that we value and protect, overlapping with other such souls.

I had read previous books by and edited with Dr. Tart. This book presents a number of challenging articles written by scholars about parapsychology. I read the book as a cataylst in the study of the possibility of souls. There seems to be a number of media celerity mediums who claim there is a conscious mind and personality survival of death. They are helping people with grief and at the same time becoming millionaires.So this is the background in which I read this book. I was most intrigued with William Rolls ruminations about a long soul rather than a personality survival. However his reasons for discounting personality survival seemed to me a bit premature. Roll states since mediums have never been able to get lock combinations or phrases from the deceased when only the deceased knew these phrases or numbers before hand, proves the personality and memory die with the brain. I say, wait ! When we come into life language (words) and numbers are concepts which we learn. They are abstractions and the brain does store these, but after death is it not possible our consciousness and individuality still may survive ? Although the memory secures language and numbers it may die with the body. Perhaps memory, if such exists, after death, could be an ability to view situations in past, present and perhaps future. No numbers or language is required for such a mind. We don't need to assume the mind is identical after death as it was in life for consciousness to survive.So you can see this book has me thinking, and it will you as well.

Though it owes much to Capra's &quot;Tao of Physics&quot; and Coxhead and Cade's &quot;Awakened Mind&quot; it is nevertheless a worthy addendum to the present obsession of 'becoming' Spiritual. Tart is well placed to present this information since his academic background is established and unquestionable. This book, while being eminently readable, lacks the passion and compulsion of the equally recent,yet brilliant, &quot;The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years&quot; by Richard G. Patton. Patton delivers a driven figure who directly addresses the synchronisation of 'Body Mind Spirit' without in any way patronising his audience, while at the same time revealing profound insight into the deeper nature of man. For my money, Patton has by-passed the need for academic verification, since his vision is so compelling. However Tart does offer the next best thing. A qualified success."},{"Title":"James Ensor. (Edited by Jacques Janssens)","review":"Bonfini Press. 93pages. 54 color reproductions, 27 black and white. Text by Jacques Janssens. According to the liner notes, Janssens was primarily a historian who undertook this study of James Ensor because of his great admiration for Ensor's artwork. Indeed, this book has more of a biographical feel than an artistic one, although the artistic merits of the work is of course discussed.But it's obvious that to Janssens the most interesting aspect of Ensor was the fact that he was a pure artist. Ensor was unhampered in his painting by any considerations of what anyone else might think about it, but was totally committed to giving free rein to his unique imaginative creativity. While this sort of dedication to one's own artistic integrity is admirable, it is certainly no guarantee of genius; but in Ensor's case, this refusal to conform or compromise was eventually vindicated in his lifetime - both in the regard of other artists, and what is more unusual, to the public at large.Until that recognition came, Ensor had to endure scathing criticism and abusive insults. This rejection was almost universal, and ironically, true acceptance and appreciation came only after his creative powers had begun to wane.But what caused this crushing rejection of Ensor's work during his most fruitful period? Ensor was an imaginative boy drawn to the fantastic. His fascination with light and color was a way of pitting his imagination against the gloomy,gray skies of his native Belgium. His fascination with masks and bizarre depictions of masks and skeletons derived from associations with the carnival masks his family sold in their souvenir shop.According to Janssens, Ensor delighted in these grotesque, satirical, imaginary scenes simply because he found them pleasing, not because he wanted to make a statement about society. But strangely enough, in simply giving free rein to his fancy, he produced paintings and engravings which did, indeed, seem to speak volumes about the hypocritical pretentiousness of bourgeois society.Not all of his paintings were fantastic, but even his more realistic ones were also hated by the critics because of his unconventional and bold use of light and color. It is truly hard to understand today why this should have caused such a stink in art circles. I can only conclude that this was a very repressed and convention-ridden society which hated and feared anything outside the boundaries of habit and custom.Is his artwork truly the work of genius? So it is now said. I don't know, but I do know I enjoyed most of the works reproduced in this volume, and I liked the story as told by Janssens. I have to admire someone who pursued his own dream and believed in himself enough to ignore the malice of the crowd."},{"Title":"Viking Longship (New Vanguard)","review":"The Osprey range of military history titles has an excellent reputation for detail and historical accuracy, and \\"Viking Longship\\" by Keith Durham is one of its finest examples. The longship is one of the most distinctive and popularly-known features of the Viking era, and it is only right that it should receive a book-length treatment of its own. Although the book that is only 48 pages long, the author has nevertheless managed to fill it with a wealth of information.Durham charts the evolution of the longship from its earliest antecedents in the Bronze Age through to the Norman Conquest and beyond, to c.1100. His focus, however, is on the early medieval period, between AD 350 and 900, for which he uses a number of case studies of recovered ships. In doing so he recognises that not all were necessarily constructed for the same purpose, and describes in detail the differences in design depending on whether a vessel was essentially coastal/riverine or sea-going, and whether it was built for war or trade or even (as suggested by the Oseberg ship) as a pleasure craft. He also notes the useful research that has in recent times come out of experimental archaeology - modern reconstructions of longships. Furthermore, it is important to note that while most of the examples Durham describes originated in Scandinavia, that the same technologies and principles were in use across northern Europe during this period, and that much of what is described also applies to Anglo-Saxon and indeed Norman vessels.The text is supplemented on every page with black-and-white photos and diagrams depicting the available archaeological and pictorial evidence for the period, as well as more modern reconstructions of longships. There are also 7 pages of colour artist's impressions, provided by Steve Noon, of which the standout piece is a part cut-away depiction of an 11th-century cargo vessel or 'knarr', with each of its component parts annotated on a separate page. The rest of the illustrations are similarly clear, although it would have been useful to have a summary diagram showing the main developments in ship construction during this period. At the back of the book a glossary is provided, although (perhaps for reasons of space) it is quite short and omits a number of terms which are used in the main text. It is disappointing also that, unlike many other titles in the Osprey range, there is no list of further reading.In all, however, \\"Viking Longship\\" is an excellent and highly accessible introduction for anyone with an interest in naval technology in the early medieval period, or in the Anglo-Saxon or Viking era in general. As someone who is currently writing a historical novel in this period, I have found it to be a highly informative and indeed invaluable guide."},{"Title":"Viking Longship (New Vanguard)","review":"This is a great little book about the details of how Viking ships were constructed. It goes through the history of the development of Viking longships and describes (in great detail) how they were constructed. Thankfully, there is a glossary in the back for us landlubbers. Mr. Durham does a great job of conveying how magnificant these vessels were. The craftsmanship and lore that went into building these longships was, quite simply, amazing. There are numerous detailed drawings and the paintings are quite good (something you can't say for all the books in this series). After reading how these boats were constructed, it is easy to understand how the Vikings were able to be the force that they were. The best indication of this is the Peacock that was discovered in the ship-burial from 1000 AD. Imagine what that Peacock went through to end up in Norway! This book is strictly about how Viking longships were built and does get a bit technical. It is worth reading if you are curious about Vikings and their seafaring ways!"},{"Title":"Viking Longship (New Vanguard)","review":"Although the book is not lengthy it really presents an excellent OVERVIEW of the evolution of the water-craft we all have in mind when anyone says \\"viking ship.\\" This book is an excellent starting place for anyone who seriously wants to learn the detailed history of the water craft that began to evolve more than 8000 years ago in northern Europe.

However, if you're looking for detailed and very sophisticated extended presentations, then a good idea would be to get in touch with the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark. These folks are easy to work with, take credit cards, and have a myriad of books on viking ships written in english. I will say that some of these books are a challenge (unless you happen to be a shipwright). Closer to home, one might contact Scandinavia House on Park Avenue in New York City to check them out."},{"Title":"Viking Longship (New Vanguard)","review":"I originally bought this book for the pictures, as I am building a 1/72 sacle model of a Viking longship.

Living in the Los Angeles area, he has had opportunity to know many of the jazz musicians personally and to share their stories with the readers. As the title implies, this is a personal recollection for Levin.Floyd's book fleshes out some of the jazz history and clarifies some points. One is the story about the plaque in Touro Infirmary in New Orleans. Trumpeter Muggsy Spanier had a perforated ulcer which was operated by the famous Dr. Alton Ochsner, Tulane Professor and founder of famed Ochsner Clinic. During convalescence, Spanier composed and later recorded a tune called &quot;Relaxin' at the Touro.&quot; Previous jazz writings had told about a plaque in Touro commemorating this event. Floyd tracked down the plaque which administration couldn't exactly locate. Because there had been renovation, the plaque was in a somewhat obscure location. Levin interviewed Muggsy about the event and they became fast friends. ( This is frequently a jazz quiz question: In the famous Muggsy Spanier tune, &quot;Relaxin' at the Touro,&quot; what is the Touro? Now you know the answer.)Levin writes about musicians he has known including Benny Carter, who wrote the foreword, James P. Johnson, Milt Hinton, Wild Bill Davison, Artie Shaw, Barney Bigard and many others. He also includes many West Coast musicians with whom he came in contact. There is a chapter on musicians, lesser known, who deserved greater recognition. Two of those included reedmen Pud Brown and Rick Fay.Levin's concluding chapter covers the struggle to get an appropriate memorial for Louis Armstrong. Funds were being raised by various jazz societies and individuals for a statue of Armstrong to be erected in Armstrong's native New Orleans. He recounts how Bing Crosby donated the proceeds of a concert in San Francisco which put the fund over the top. That twice-lifesize statue of Armstrong stands in Armstrong Park in New Orleans and was unveiled on the nation's bicentennial in Jackson Square in New Orleans. Levin made the presentation, on behalf of the Louis Armstrong Statue Fund, to the city of New Orleans. Four years later, the statue was permanently erected and dedicated in Armstrong Park.This book is not a definitive jazz history but an interesting view into the lives and careers of musicians who have been influential in shaping jazz--America's Music.My review of this book is not without personal bias. I have known and worked with Levin on the Board of American Federation of Jazz Societies and have visited with him at various jazz festivals and in his home. Two of my photographs have been included in the book. I am pleased to have known him and congratulate him on completion of this book, his labor of love."},{"Title":"Classic Jazz: A Personal View of the Music and the Musicians","review":"Maybe I shouldn't call the book a popouri of Jazz musicians because Levin's stories of the many personalities and events are well organized. However, a mine of classic jazzmen, famous and/or forgotten, are included with stuning, compeling and personal detail. Many talents I followed years ago who'd dropped off the radar, and about whom I've never been able to glean prior information, are included along with their more famous brothers and sisters.What makes the book a real five star celebration are the first hand naratives along with page turning drama and pictures that carries along any New Orleans, Chicago, San Francisco, et. al. jazz lover. The book is in lyric style just like the music it presents with great pictures as well.Persosnally I savored the mid-century west coast scenes, documenting what has not prevously been so well described, about Ory and the host of his compatriots including my favorite, Buster Wilson (whom I had never found in any other publications).For me this is the best jazz book ever -- just what I wanted."},{"Title":"Classic Jazz: A Personal View of the Music and the Musicians","review":"If you love New Orleans traditional jazz, you gotta read this book. Mr. Levin writes about many of the legends of jazz and recounts personal experiences with many of the the jazz musicians. I liked the depth of treatment by the author. He tells you a lot of interesting things about the musicians and their careers, but doesn't go overboard in telling you more than you really want to know. His telling of the story of how the statute of Louis Armstrong made it to Louis Armstrong Park in New Orleans is especially informative. I recommend it to most anyone who has an interest in traditional jazz, but especially to those who want ot knwo just a little bit more about the major players."},{"Title":"Classic Jazz: A Personal View of the Music and the Musicians","review":"Please see my review of the paperback edition.

Particularly, his coverage of Eddie Miller, Pud Brown, Muggsy Spanier, Wild Bill Davison,Rosy NcHargue, and Yank Lawson-Bobby Haggart's World Greatest Jazz Band is appreciated.

No book is absolutely complete history, but Levin does a superb job of highlighting the trad jazz revival. His accounts of Eddie Miller, Rosy McHargue, Pete Daily, Bob Scobey, Turk Murphy, Muggsy Spanier, and others are flavored with personal reflections and accurate facts., He gives Kid Ory his rightful due, and, although too brief on Bix Beiderbecke, Red Nichols, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and nothing on George Brunis, he treats the west coast revival of dixieland with much needed love and respect.

But what's not quite as well known is that equally horrible racial massacres occurred several times in the last year and a half of the war. Enraged and frightened by the appearance of blacks in blue uniform--a rage and fear fueled by old southern worries about slave uprisings--at least nine massacres took place in Florida, Arkansas, Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia, and Louisiana. One of the most horrible was at Poison Spring, Arkansas, where Choctows serving under the rebel flag killed, scalped, and mutilated black troopers. The single largest massacre occurred at The Crater in the battle for Petersburg.This collection of essays goes a long way toward bringing this uglier side of the Civil War into the open. Individual essays about specific massacres as well as the imprisonment of black soldiers and the treatment of white officers commanding black units are prefaced and ended by very good essays about race in the Civil War written by Gregory Urwin and Mark Grimsley. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Black Flag Over Dixie: Racial Atrocities and Reprisals in the Civil War","review":"Black Flag Over Dixie: Racial Atrocities and Reprisals in the Civil WarIrwin's book on Civil War events was a much needed source of knowledge for me. I have done a lot of Civil War research but this is the first time that I learned of the tactics involved in the war with such graphic details. I like this book because he actually use materials from the participants of war. So much of the history is lost to generations because of the silence of all the people involved including later generation and the fear and shame of what happen in the war involving Whites, Blacks, and Indians. I was born in Camden, Arkansas and finished High School there, living only a few miles from th battle area and never knew anything about the war in Camden, slavery,and hardships. This book provides information that people need to know information, not because of wanting more violence, but to realize and learn what actually happen. This is a need to know book! It provides a journey through Dixie that is important to me as a person. I often wondered how lost building skills were lost, now I know, if skills are not used they become lost in about three generations. If events are not transfered to each generation they quickly become obsolete, and that also happens with history, unless someone researchs and reveals the information.

This book is heavy on Kansas City and Big 12 Sports, but along the way there are interesting and provocative discussions of race, gender, and other ethical issues that permeate the world of sports. Jason is entertaining, makes you angry, but importantly also makes you think, which is why I like his writing."},{"Title":"Jason Whitlock: Love Him, Hate Him, Ten Years of Sports, Passion, and Kansas City","review":"First off I would like to say that it is evident that the current nine reviewers here on amazon did not understand the full purpose of one reading this book and the purpose of Jason writing it. With that being said let me use this review to explain what I have found through my research and expeditions. I first stumbled across this book in the year 2006 while I was in Ronoake Virginia researching bears(which I will get to later in the review.) The book was sitting on the sidewalk beside an apple tree growing out the ground so due to my hunger for both literature and nourishment I picked up the book and picked an apple and began heading back towards camp. By the time I got back to to the outskirts of town where I had set up my tent night had fallen and I noticed my tent and all of my supplies were gone. Devastated, although determined, I sat under the moonlight and began reading \\"Love Him, Hate Him: Ten Years of Sports, Passion and Kansas City.\\"During my time reading I noticed Jason's brilliant use of symbolism, I noticed him truly letting out the words of the soul, and I noticed him making hidden allusions to the ancient Mayans legends of bearded bears through the use of modern day sports reporting. This is where my account gets very incredible, though very plausible. Even though I didn't know it at the time, I had fallen asleep on the exact middle of the book(the exact page, word, letter, etc.) and awoke surrounded by giant black figures. I suspected they were bears which has now been clarified since reading the second half of the book. Anyway, the black figures kept growing/multiplying until all I could see was black and I realized I was now floating in space. On what used to be the fur of bears, I saw a star scape. I floated for over three trillion years in space until I was finally confronted by the great bearded bear.While starring into the eyes of the almighty bearded bear I discovered infinite truths of the universe and existence. The truths are impossible to speak in any language but if Jason Whitlock were to subtract a single number from the formula to infinity, all but one truth could be read from his mind and written by Spencer \\"pencils\\" Krug on a really big sheet of paper. The one truth that Jason would subtract off is the one and only truth that matters in finding out the meaning of your own being. This contradiction has only lead any experienced reader of Jason's novel to believe that the only truth in our universe is that the truth is unreachable.So after returning home I learned that the trillions of years I spent inside the depths universe was only about 1/1,000,000 of a second here on earth. I finished reading the final half of Jason's novel and learned that bears do in fact exist and that there's a chance they could know the subtracted truth. In conclusion, by reading \\"Love Him, Hate Him: Ten Years of Sports, Passion and Kansas City,\\" you will not uncover the reason why you can perceive things, you will not see an unimaginable color, you won't get a first-hand look into a bear's mind, but you will not be disappointed. The first-hand journey into Jason's thoughts is a euphoric experience that you can't miss out on. I thank Mr. Whitlock for all that he's bestowed upon me and hope everyone else will after experiencing the thrill ride that is \\"Love Him, Hate Him: Ten Years of Sports, Passion and Kansas City.\\""},{"Title":"Jason Whitlock: Love Him, Hate Him, Ten Years of Sports, Passion, and Kansas City","review":"After reading Jason Whitlock's extremely honest, well-crafted, insightful current weekly articles (up to mid-2012), I came looking to see if he'd written a book.

Whitlock is incapable of providing a shred of sports analysis or even a mildly objective opinion.

Whitlock's lunacy is masked by scatter-brained prose that not only makes your eyes hurt, it mercifully forces the reader put down the book before any of the stupidity sinks in.Jason Whitlock couldn't be trusted to write his own nametag, much less a book, and this disaster proves it."},{"Title":"Jason Whitlock: Love Him, Hate Him, Ten Years of Sports, Passion, and Kansas City","review":"...loves him, but his \\"journalism\\" is sheer drivel.

Jason never goes to the trouble of actually interviewing sports figures before baselessly and erroneously attacking them.

It is unworthy of having been published in hard back.Do not waste your money on this trash."},{"Title":"Way of the Daimyo","review":"I had high hopes for this book. The court and mass warfare are very important to the L5R CCG but haven't tended to feature prominently in the RPG. I was looking forward to a book that would tell me how to integrate them into campaigns without turning them into solely court-based or warfare-based campaigns.Well, I got that - sort of. First off, WotD has a lot to say about the Glory system. Many of you may have found Glory was a bit unworkable in D10 as presented - you could go up far too fast, and the fact that Glory was supposed to be constrained by your social rank didn't work out.This has been changed. Not only has Glory been redone, there's a new mechanic, Status, that measures your character's official rank within Rokugan. The Emperor, for instance, has a Status of 10 but may only have a Glory of 3 or 4, if he's never participated in that many heroic deeds. (I'd argue that Toturi III had a Glory of 7, but that's ironically mostly from his days before being the Emperor. Glory 10 is reserved for Shinsei and the Thunders). Conversely, a famous Ronin such as Dairya might have a Glory of 6 or 7 but no Status. My only problem with this is that it seems a fair bit of book-keeping, but it might turn out to be worth it.However, it goes downhill from here. The rest of the book is concerned with the five 'stations' that high Status characters can acquire - the Warlord, the Ambassador, the Keeper of the Temple, the Provincial Governor and the Master Sensei.The problem with these classes is the all-or-nothing effect. They provide advantages that are of very little use in a campaign that isn't focused on, say, running a city, and that are overwhelming if it is.Consider, for example, your general L5R campaign - say the PCs are magistrates, or servants of a Clan Champion. One PC decides 'I want to take the City Governor Prestige Class/Path'! The DM is immediately torn. He either has to shift the campaign to the city, giving that PC a huge advantage over all the others, or continue as he's done, which means that the City Governor PC has a city somewhere in the background and is burning a lot of points/XP on something he never uses.This is the biggest problem with the game and it's hard to get over it. I guess this sort of thing would mostly be useful for NPCs - but a GM/DM can give an NPC City Governor or Warlord whatever he wants, he doesn't need to bother spending points or taking levels in it.The book is further detracted from by a generally low level of editing. There are lots of spelling mistakes, incomplete clauses and sentences that don't make sense. Luckily none of them are in rules-critical points, but it's still frustrating.High points are not confined to the Glory/Status system. The book also has a more detailed mass combat section which is usable and simple. It offers more detail than that presented in L5R D10 2E and doesn't have much scope for PC involvement, but it presents a more tactical battle experience where different troop types have more effect. Again, it's more complicated than the basic, but the payoff is sufficient, IMHO. Then again, to me, the clash of mass armies has always been an important part of the L5R mystique. There are a few weird bits - entire units spontaneously becoming tainted as part of the random battle events mechanic - but easy enough to tweak.Overall I give WotD 4/10. It's a little hard to review a book with such a specific purpose, but as the DM of a campaign where PCs are starting to obtain high rank and I wanted to give them a chance to become more involved in the government of Rokugan, I found it disappointing. If I am the target audience - and I think I am - the book fails to meet expectations. If I'm not, the book is poorly marketed and narrowly focused, and still deserves bad marks. Overall, you might find it useful for background and further fleshing out Rokugan, but this is a long way from a must-have."},{"Title":"Alien Games","review":"First off a Warning. This book is highly erotic. The sex is very graphic and there is a lot of it.I enjoyed this book because it was different. It is a sci-fi-romance-erotic-adventure. The main characters are humans who have been kidnapped and taken aboard this ship for study by the Revan. Its a study of sex. The Revan no longer have sex but have found that the lack of it is killing them. They have gathered subjects from several worlds to watch them have sex. They create several different sexual situations for the subjects. The subjects are not allowed to resist because they are mind controlled. Once the Revan have all the info they need they will disspose of the subjects.The two humans, Bruce and Jenna, are rival althletes. They have a strong attraction to each other but have never really acted upon it until now. Now that they are thrown into this bizare situation they must drawn on thier feelings of both attraction and respect for each other to fight for thier lives. Along the way they fall in love. Now the love story is sort of a minor detail in this tale. Its more about the sex.I liked the concept of this story and my only complaint was that I wanted the love story to be more of the story and that would have made the sex more interesting."},{"Title":"Alien Games","review":"Bruce Glenn and Jenna Walsh are at the top of their game. As respected athletes, they are both newly crowned winners of the World Triathlon Championship. They are definitely at the top of their game physically. Jenna, however, is unable to let anyone get close to her and has acquired a reputation as a great competitor but a nasty person. Most people have learned to keep their distance from Jenna, but Bruce continues to try to approach the other athlete. He has been attracted to her for quite some time and even though he knows that he is setting himself up for a fall, he cannot resist congratulating Jenna when she becomes the winner of the race. She replies in what has become typical Jenna fashion, distancing herself from Bruce.Unbeknownst to the champions, their athletic abilities have garnered them some unwanted attentions. An alien race has been observing them. After the competition is over, Jenna and Bruce seek some down time at the same resort. They are easy prey for the aliens who kidnap them and bring their to their spaceship. As prisoners, they go through the humiliating experience of examination by the aliens. Soon, they discover that they are not alone and are just pawns in a larger, sinister plan.As Bruce and Jenna grapple with their kidnapping, they begin to grow closer. Jenna lets down her guard and embraces the familiar to her. Bruce is amazed by the changes in Jenna and cannot help but to grow closer to her, even as they and the other kidnapped creatures try to find a way out from under the oppressive control of the evil aliens.Alien Games is a fascinating what if scenario. The author had me rooting for Bruce and Jenna from the early pages of the book. The other alien life forms are varied and vivid descriptive passages brought the scenes to life. With erotic sexual scenes and never ending suspense, Alien Games will appeal to science fiction and romance fans alike!"},{"Title":"Alien Games","review":"There are a lot of \\"humans kidnapped by aliens for breeding purposes\\" books out there, and this one isn't like that at all. Two humans - Bruce and Jenna - are taken abruptly by aliens for the purpose of data gathering about their sexual abilities. Along with three other pairs of humanoid-aliens from other planets - two cat like ones, two gorilla like one, and a pair with four arms and blue skin - the aliens test them in groups and decide that Bruce and Jenna (Jenna specifically) are the lynchpin to save their race.What I found most clever about the book is how the author took standard images of aliens (short, big heads, etc.) and gave reasoning to them, along with the four-armed aliens revealing they were the ones that taught the KamaSutra to the human race, was fun and a nice twist. The sex in the book is unique but no less hot, and because there is mutual attraction between all the groups and coercion from alien implanted modification chips, you don't have that uncomfortable forced taking that many of these books start out with. Because it's not about the aliens taking humans for sex slaves at all, and what Bruce and Jenna find within themselves after their abduction is well drawn out and thoughtful. Jenna's turn from hardened do-it-all alpha female to a passionate woman who loves with every fiber of her being is timed well and all the characters are wonderful to read about.All in all, worth the money and I'll keep Claudia Rose as an author to pay attention to.

His bravado and financial capability open Harris to a world of erotic pleasure, voyage, gourmandise and to a number of encounters with interesting people of his era. Frank Harris stood by his friend Oscar Wilde until the latters' demise. Faithful both financially and compassionately, Harris is a hands down man of the world and lover of humanity.

Although it is erotic it also is a depiction of life in the 19th and early 20th centuries in England and the U.S. The author was obviously a well educated person and a bit boastful but the descriptions of life are most vivid. I saw a movie of part of the book and it starred Jack Lemmon playing the part of Frank Harris.

This book made me dream of the opposite sex so badly and it made me grow up so paifully, impatiently and anxiously, and also gave me lot of day dreams. This was a journey of the life of a gentleman who met so many different and wonderful women under different kind of situations and at different levels. All the descriptions were so intimate and so detailed! Every incident was an erotic long journey in bed.

He was vain , boastful and ever ready to toot his own horn BUT he tells exactly what he thought. His descriptions of his amatory adventures are spot-on and nobody who has ever been with MORE than one woman would doubt a word(!).Caution : you should read more than the juicy bits as you will glean information on the tenor of the times and how a guy from nowhere climbed the ladder of success in the cut-throat world of literature. His work on Shakespeare, which is good, cannot hold a candle to this splendid autobiography. Scoundrels always charm us and Frank was one of those delightful scoundrels that mesmerized the dinner table. Ever anxious to deflate the imperious, he illuminates the warts of the rich and snooty.I'd require this in any course on 20th C manners and morals.

Moving right along, it is an incredible piece of fiction, autobiography, and now history. I have heard his cowboy story quoted as fact by ethnic studies instructors, watched the plays of Wilde and pondered both of their distorted lives, wondered about his comments on the Churchill's, etc.Harris, however pathological, is, for the first two or three books, a remarkable read. I doubt that many read every word, and now could never imagine reading ALL of it. However, if you want to understand something of 19th Century English literature and life, I think you need to read at least half. Just expect to be very weary of Frank Harris after a bit. As Wilde famously observed: \\"Frank Harris has been received in all the great houses - Once.\\"Ponder the change in lives if nothing else. This work was scandalous when it came out. In the age of internet porn it is now mostly a historical curiosity. In time it will dwindle to the point where it will disappear. Harris ended up in Hell, if it exists at all.

This book is very quaint considering the amount of pornography that can be found in movies and on the Internet today.I give this book 5 stars because I have read that to masturbate successfully one just needs a fast hand and an overactive imagination which I suspect this writer has.Not that I have any \\"first hand \\"(no pun intended ) knwledge of the subject!!!!"},{"Title":"My life and loves (Traveller's companion series)","review":"A very minimal amount of research will tell you that 1) this is by far Mr. Harris's best known and most popular work and that 2) it is at best &quot;highly unreliable&quot;, as one source charitably puts it.I happen to think there is something very suspect, or at least very curious, about being known primarily for your autobiography. If we hadn't heard of you from elsewhere, why would we want to read your autobiography in the first place? Well, in this case the answer is fairly obvious (for certain of us, that is, not me), but, on the other hand, anyone can do that, especially if he's allowed simply to manufacture the anecdotes.In short, you're wasting your time bothering with this boastful, swaggering, blustering imposture."},{"Title":"Unit Operations: An Approach to Videogame Criticism","review":"Bogost's begins with a promising venture into the video game territory. This time we are promised that video games are distinguished from books and films, and that the \\"ludology\\" of video games is recognized as an independent field. Bogost uses philosophy in order to accomplish this mission. Although when it comes to critical arguments, Bogost's approach is mainly Badiousian, he sets forth a rich array of classical and contemporary philosophies, from Plato to Spinoza, Deleuze, and Harman. I have this feeling that at some point Bogost emphasizes too much on the narrative and cultural aspects of video games and therefore, his project falls into the same category of mainstream cultural critiques of video games. But there are sections which penetrate right into the structure of games and their architecture. In these sections, Bogost uses a heavy deal of Badiou's axiomatic set theory to back up his theory of unit operations. This is not essentially a negative point but he could develop a genuine theory of his own and eliminate the risk of associating video games with philosophy which for the most part has the same restricting role of literature (the narrative) and cinema (the filmic) for video games. Overall, Unit Operations is a rich and an insightful book, but falls short in some of its ambitions."},{"Title":"Unit Operations: An Approach to Videogame Criticism","review":"This is how interdisciplinarity is done: Bogost weaves Madame Bovary, Grand Theft Auto, cellular automata and Deleuze together into a powerful theory cutting through the my-piece-of-the-elephant scholarship which dominates games studies.If you have a particular need to feel uncultured and slow witted, this is definitely a 5 star recommendation: it's terrifyingly erudite while being, if not a stroll in the park, at least a manageable uphill hike through difficult terrain."},{"Title":"Unit Operations: An Approach to Videogame Criticism","review":"This book isn't what it sounds like at first glance. It is a view of video games from a literary criticism perceptive. Don't buy this if your interested in game design if you don't also have a passion for literary criticism."},{"Title":"Unit Operations: An Approach to Videogame Criticism","review":"Unit Operations is every bit as brilliant - and damn fun a read - as those of us lucky enough to've had early glimpses at Bogost's project had hoped.It's tempting to write a review of this book in the form of a treatment for a mega-million-dollar console game, and that temptation seems to me no accident: this book will change the way you pay attention to ALL, in both senses of the word, coded systems you yourself use.The backstory of the book's authoring is itself almost too Hollywood (or new Hollywood, since EA, Blizzard, and LucasArts are the MGM, WB, and Disney of our era): author was a Chief Technology Officer for an A-list interactive marketing agency in L.A.; author leaves the biz to become a professor working on recombining the DNA (and languages and ontologies) of software development with the DNA (and languages and ontologies) of literary and cultural criticism; his mutant creation is now on the loose.Your mission, reader, is to...To what? Because in the game of Unit Operations, the first-person shooter is transformed into something of an Eleatic archer: where before our attention would just race to the next target, Unit Operations teaches us new ways to listen to the Bow.The open-source software movement has from its beginning been particularly well-attuned to games with written language's units of operation. Unit Operations provides a long-awaited common ground for both technological and literary culture.Not since first reading Geertz' Interpretation of Cultures have I had the sense of encountering so path-breaking a work in the level of its critical innovation and the clarity of its readings."},{"Title":"Unit Operations: An Approach to Videogame Criticism","review":"A bulging boutique of bottom-up beats bearing from baroque battles to bogus babalities."},{"Title":"Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights","review":"Perhaps one day people will learn not to purchase wasteful books.

What a disgrace."},{"Title":"Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights","review":"This book opens up showing the abuses of many of the big name Animal Rights groups. The vast majority of funds raised are not used towards benefiting animals by research or health funds but actually go back to programs to raise even more money. These figures are not released by these various groups because it would by common sense cease people sending them more funding.A value judgement is given that human life has greater importance and to lose sight of this can only lead us to a world where groups like the Taliban can kill off women because they have no value. Humans are the present reigning species and this book does not suggest that we abuse or neglect animals just that we utilize our funds with information. To believe that you are giving to a charity for the welfare of animals and instead find out that the money goes to a select group whose salaries are in the top 5% and also that the charity funds and defends voilence and destruction of research is very disheartening. This book provides a vast number of source for all claims it puts forth, similar to the Susan Faludi book \\"Backlash\\".Please keep your minds open and don't be lazy thinkers when you gift your funds to organizations."},{"Title":"Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights","review":"Already read 'The Hijacking of the Humane Movement' and 'Misplaced Compassion'? This is the least known of the three basic books that tell the frightening truth about the animal rights movement, but it's easily the pick of the litter. Be sure to read the reviews written by the animal rightists here -- if they don't convince you that this is what you're looking for, nothing will!Carefully documented, consise, clear, and READABLE, this is the one to have your dog or cat club legislative liaison and officers read, the one to leave with your state legislators when you visit them, the one to spend a weekend with if you're scared of all the bad laws that are being passed. It would be great if the AKC's leadership would read this ... but not a chance: They're working with the movement now.If you haven't read the other two, just get this. The only real question is why did we let it go out of print?"},{"Title":"Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights","review":"Kathleen Marquardt was called a &quot;murderer&quot; because she hunted. Her daughter, came home from school crying because of that. Later on, she was sick, and treated, during which time she read up on animal rights. From that, she started an organization called Putting People First, and went on to write this book.One cannot look at this book without keeping this in mind. She got angry, and vowed to do something about it. Animal rights groups have Hollywood stars and lots of snazzy advertising, while Mrs. Marquardt relies on a presentation of facts. These facts include the following:1. Destruction of years of research on infectious diseases2. Hunter harassment that had included shots fired at hunters3. Bombings4. &quot;Liberation&quot; of animals, some of which have dangerous diseases, and5. The movement's goal to oulaw pet ownership.This does portray the darker side of the animal rights movement, forcing a person to think hard. It can also shatter notions of animal rights groups that are held closely. Furthermore, this book proves that one need not be a memeber of PeTA to care about animals and oppose cruelty. A must read for anyone undecided about animal rights."},{"Title":"Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights","review":"This book is out of print now but should not be. On the contary, it should be required reading for all of us. Ms. Marquardt delivers devestating attacks on extremist groups and by using their own words and actions, shows just what the results of their programs would be....total extinction of ALL species including that well meaning but blundering species call humans. Contary to what was said in another review, the quotes are all documented, and the reader is shown where the information is if they choose to verify themselves. All Ms. Marquardt is asking for is a level playing field rather than the slanted, biased reporting that so often takes place in our society today....."},{"Title":"Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights","review":"Impeccably researched, well written. If you think PETA is warm & fuzzy, you need to read this book. Especially the documented quote from PETA's founder, comparing the six million human victims of the Holocaust to the six billion broiler chickens that die every year. She believes the latter is as tragic and lamentable as the former.A particularly good read while you're eating a hamburger, and curled up in fur boots!"},{"Title":"Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights","review":"There is certainly a reason that Kathleen's Animalscam is currently out of print: this book was a sorry collection of laughable excuses as to why human beings ought to be able to continue slaughtering, torturing, and exploiting animals for whatever trivial reasons they like. A copy of this book is currently available in my own public library, and I've a good mind to check it out and 'lose' it conveniently.What disturbed me most about Animalscam was the section on animals as they are used for 'entertainment'. The author stresses that circuses animals are 'treated well' by their handlers, and that there is no good reason why they should be liberated from their miserable lives in ridiculous clothes, as they perform meaningless tricks for thousands of humans that will forget it all in the space of a week. I don't dispute the fact that many circus handlers are kind to their animals (although many are NOT), but what the author fails to mention are the horrendous experiences that many of these animals must suffer through when they are captured from their native countries and 'broken' by natives, all to make them easier to handle for shipping to the Americas. A chilling documentary shown recently on the Discovery Channel aired just such an experience; I remember watching in horror as a small African elephant was strapped down and beaten repeatedly by callous workers to show the animal who 'was in charge'. The animal's destination: circus life in the United States."},{"Title":"Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights","review":"I'm a supporter of animal rights, but wanted to keep my mind open, and read a book written by someone who opposes the animal rights movement. I am glad I did: this book confirmed by belief in animal rights, and rendered me even more dedicated to the cause. The author's arguments are weak (her critique of vegetarianism is atrocious), and her tone is decidedly angry and vindictive. I guess that's why the book is out of print.What angered me most about the book is that, while she claims several times that she supports &quot;animal welfare,&quot; she offers absolutely no information on how to help animals, and in fact, completely ignores the very real problem of widespread animal abuse that takes place in our country, and the world. She ignores that researchers have proven that acts of abuse to animals often progress to violent acts towards humans. She ignores that some of the greatest minds in history--Plato, Pythagoras, Ghandi, Da Vinci, Emerson, Einstein, Chief Seattle, Tolstoy,(and probably many women who went unrecorded)--have promoted kindness to animals and vegetarianism.One gets the feeling that because a Peta representive indirectly insulted the author (by calling hunters murderers), she went into some kind of an infuriated tailspin, hurredly creating an anti-animal rights organization, and writing this miserable book. What is sad is that her actions can only hurt the animals, whom she claims to care about.Incidently, I have visited Peta's offices in Norfolk, Virginia. I was relieved and pleased to observe a well-functioning and organized group. There, I met with a professional and courteous staff who work long hours on small salaries. Various rescued dogs and cats walked sedately up and down the halls. It was a real thrill to be there. On my last day, I collected lots of great pamphlets and stickers from them which I disseminated back home. I gave then a big donation too--as they are doing the work that I only wish I had more time to do. Thank you, Peta. I am New York State teacher with a Masters in English, and I look forward to promoting Peta's powerful message of respect for our fellow creatures in my classroom for years to come.The name of Marquardt's group is, &quot;Putting People First.&quot; Unfortunately, mankind has been &quot;putting people first,&quot; for a while, showing a stunning disregard for our planet and other species. This attitude of &quot;putting people first&quot; has resulted in the suffering of both wild and domestic animals, and has caused serious environmental degradation and imbalance. I believe that &quot;putting people first&quot; also erodes the human spirit, as it puts us out of touch with out place on the planet. We are not happiest when we dominate and harm nature and her creatures, but when we live with them amicably and peacefully. They have so much to offer us.While the research on the benefits of a vegetarian diet is so solid, it is hard to dispute (though our author gives it a weak try), there are many people who will dig up reasons to test on animals. My feeling is that animals are off limits--no matter what seeming &quot;good&quot; comes from harming them. To me, it's not worth it. Can human life really be seen as precious if it comes from hurting other, more vulnerable creatures? I believe not. Plus, I am sure that once we decide that animals are off limits, we will &quot;miraculously&quot; come upon processes that lead to cures without the use of animals. Also, as the field of alternative medicine grows, we find that tradtional medicine doesn't really cure us at all--only masks the symptoms. We as a society are finding that healthcare is most effective at the preventitive stage (ironically, a vegetarian diet dramatically decreases the chances of suffering a degenerative disease), and that when we do get sick, alternative measures are the most effective for getting to the root of the problem. Sometimes we must close one door firmly before we notice that others are open.The best way to help the animals is to get in touch with your true self--that gentle, loving part of you that wants to heal and nurture, not harm, torture or destroy. For optimum health and happiness, respect yourself and the earth by eating with conscience, and letting other creatures live their happy lives. Be an example of love and caring--and not of anger and exploitation. Do it for yourself--and the animals."},{"Title":"Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights","review":"Author has a chip on her shoulder because she was insulted by animal activists who referred to hunters as \\"murderers\\". In general it's poorly written, biased and poorly researched. If you want a good laugh, read this book. The vast majority of animal activists are not hellbent on destroying humankind for the sake of non-human species-which the author tries to press this view that all activists are.

Fittingly, Regnery, an ultra conservative publisher, was the only one who would touch it.Ms. Marquardt's errors of both logic and fact are legendary. The book's ridiculous and weak arguments are too error-ridden to do justice to in one review. It would require a literal rewriting of the book line by line. Contrary to what the next most recent reviewer claims, the book is poorly documented and relies on biased, equally error-prone &quot;sources&quot; for most of its &quot;factual&quot; information. In one amusing passage regarding veal calves, Ms. Marquardt blatantly plagarizes from the equally extremist group, Animal Industry Foundation, and gives no credit whatsoever to them! Classic garbage-in, garbage-out process.Would-be readers should know that Ms. Marquardt's wise use extremist group, Putting People First, died out over 5 years ago due to lack of support and members. It published its last newspaper, The People's Agenda, in 1995. That rag was five times more sloppy than AnimalScam, issue in and issue out. I know because I closely monitored the group's activities and publications and have every single newspaper they ever did in my possession.AnimalScam is a joke of a book that never deserved to be published in the first place."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"This was the first Sandford novel I read and I really liked it. Regarding the criticism some made about Jake not mourning, different people mourn in different ways.

As he has done with his &quot;Prey&quot; series he develops the characters well, but weaves in twists and turns that even the most avid mystery reader wouldn't think of. I was convinced on who the killer was only to be thrown a curve as the plot developed. The book was definitely a cannot put down, and in fact I finished it in less than two days. I am looking forward to more by Sandford involving these new characters. I particularly like &quot;Jake&quot; the ex-cop turned lawyer. As a retired police officer who then went on to law school I can empathize with him. Keep up the great writing"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"John Sandford's straight-forward mystery \\"The Night Crew\\" tells the story of Anna Batory as she tracks down a twisted, mysterious killer who stalks her, brutalizes her friends, and leaves a trail of bodies everywhere he goes. It's not for the faint-hearted or squeamish - there's enough gore and mayhem to satisfy the thriller genre crossovers.Anna Batory is a capable, modern woman who leads a weird sort of paparazzi crew through that part of L.A.'s nighttime mess that people want to see on their television sets: Murder, Rape, Robbery, Assault, Burglary, Larceny, and Motor Vehicle Theft. The wetter, the messier, or flashier the better! Anna and her gang of commercial photographers trail mayhem rather than celebrities and sell their video footage to the highest bidders who pay handsomely. Anna and her gang knock down 6 figure incomes and have a satellite truck of their very own. The \\"Night Crew\\" is very good at finding stories and getting the best video shots of them possible.The story opens when they cover an (staged) animal liberation raid on a warehouse and jump cut to a suicide jumper and his drug induced high dive shot with multiple cameras and perspectives. The jumper, a high school student, is high on a drug called wizards. The next morning Anna learns that one of her cameramen has been murdered. More murders follow and when Anna's name is carved into the flesh of a victim, Anna teams up with Jake Harper, the dead student's father, to find out why all this is happening.The story's action bounces between Anna's hunt for the killer who's pursuing her, Jake Harper's hunt for the drug dealers who sold his son the Wizards, and \\"The Two Faced Man\\" who delights in murder, torture and blood-soaked sexual fantasy. It's a decent story however marred by character slips, jarring coincidence and plot disconnection. One of the most shocking character slips happens when a morally \\"hardened\\" Anna criticizes Jake for \\"merely\\" breaking the legs of the drug dealer who sold his son the wizards. She follows that thought up at the end of story in such a way that it breaks the romance that developed between her and Jake. Is it simply coincidence that Anna's cameraman's girlfriend looks so much like Anna that the stalker killer confuses them?The second half of the story is much, much better than the first. The action picks up and the characterization fits more closely with the \\"Prey\\" work that Sandford is famous for.Sandford's development of the romance between Anna and Jake is unexpected and so roughly done that it invites suspicion that Sandford doesn't have much of hand for writing mystery and softer focus romance in a way that enhances the effect of both. The first touches between Anna and Jake happen are unprepared and clumsily drawn. Though both characters are later described in terms akin to sexual athletics, inevitably Anna's thoughts turn to the man who is trying to murder her even as Jake labors between her legs.The story ends abruptly. Rather than summarizing the action and retiring the characters comfortably, Sandford presents an epilogue set some months after the climax of the story. Jake is breaking up with Anna for reasons that are perfectly understandable - Anna is not the kind of person that you really want to spend another minute with if you help it.The audio quality of the audiotape presentation is terrible to the point of being almost unlistenable. The narrative voice is flat and monotonous. The vocalizations of the characters are extremely loud in comparison. The difference between the two presentations that are combined in this story is so radical that you need to listen to this story with one hand on the volume control."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"This was an excellent John Sanford book.

Not everyone talks this way, so why do writers have to give the same voice to every character. I picked up this book a week ago because it's about my area and have yet to finish it. It seems the only books on the market these days are about preverts, mass murderers, physcos and whatnot. Everyone has a gun, everyone is hip, everyone is a lawyer driving expensive cars, and into golf. I am so upset. Where are the Dickens and Twain's of this age? It's an ok book but I certainly won't buy any more of his stuff. Call me disapointed."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I must admit I was pleased to see another Sanford novel, even if it was not a &quot;Prey&quot; book. The book started off promisingly, but ultimately leaves one in the dust wondering what happened. The ending is far too abrupt and I had the feeling that Sanford simply ran out of gas. As usual, the nice touches abound; Anne Batory is a non-practicing pianist, Creek is a veteran and the ex-cop is a lawyer. These touches are not unlike normal L.A. life where everyone is someone else. As a pleasant evenings diversion, this book suffices, but for re-reading, far too much is telegraphed and the ending seems more like a ten car pile-up."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"The main problem I had with Anna Batory is that I did not especially like her. The concept of Sandford's heroine being in charge of a &quot;night crew&quot; which is a group of freelancers roaming the city in search of a story to sell, at any cost, with absolutely no moral sense of right or wrong in relationship to those personally impacted, does not suggest role model main character material to me. I want a hero I can, in my fantasy, hope to emulate. Anna does not make the grade. Therefore, it is truly fitting that she does not get her man in the end who represents everything she is not! Had I not been exposed to the &quot;Prey&quot; series and the Lucas Davenport character, I may not have been so disappointed"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"The Night Crew is so different from Sandford's more famous &quot;Prey&quot; books. When I say &quot;different&quot;, I mostly mean &quot;worse.&quot; Not only is it an arduous read, but character development (which Sandford excels at with Lucas &quot;Prey Series&quot; Davenport) is weak and inconsistent. The red herrings are painfully obvious and the cop turned lawyer who still gets incredible access to crime scenes is ridiculous. I really don't understand what happened in The Night Crew as Sandford's regular series is consistently excellent."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"This book is a decent read.

The whole story about Batory was to predictable."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"The way John Sandford creates a psycho who stalks an innocent videographer, Anna Batory, was sheer brilliance. Anna attempts to find the stalker who is slowly eliminating everyone she comes in contact with. Teamed up with one of the best homicide cops, she is searching for the truth in a web tangled with lies. The story is choppy in some parts, but the suspense is definitely there. I recommend this book to anyone looking for the suspense ride of their life. I am looking forward to reading other John Sandford books."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I enjoyed the overall story in the Night Crew but felt the characters had very limited vocabulary and very limited emotional responses to situations. However, the book was a quick and easy read for a quiet weekend and did not involve any emotional input on my part."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"This story was so terrible it made me mad. I don't know why I didn't return it for an old book I really wanted &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;. I've turned in less bad books. The charcters were wooden and Creek was someone I'd never want to really meet. I guess he was slated to be some hunk lover dude but he's more like a dud. And then this Glass character who started out to be a tough chick cop ends up by Creek's bed side knitting (cucumber covers?) of all things. And Anna, the main character who gets beat up and is still able to hobble around has gotta be tougher than Zina or whatever that woman is that comes on Saturday nights. Near the end I just sped read to get through the crap. I bet the writer did this to make a fast buck, and I will NEVER read any of his other books. He must've had silver screen in his mind as we wrote this trash. Don't waste your time reading this junk, Huck Finn will make you so much happier!"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I have read several of John Sandfords &quot;Prey&quot; books and found those worthwhile, so I was eager to read The Night Crew. I was very disappointed in this book. The author introduces the reader to 10 or 12 characters, starts to give details about who they are and how they fit into the storyline, and then never carries through with each character's agenda, leaving the reader with a lot of unanswered questions and many unfilled holes at the end. For example, Jake, a main character in the book has just lost his only son, and within a day is in the arms of the other main character, and the grief over his son is forgotten. They don't ever even mention the funeral. It's totally unbelievable. Also, Wyatt, the investigator on the case is in love with his partner Pam, in fact goes so far as to disguise himself and sneek into the hospital to see her, (she, by the way, has a one night stand with another character, Creek, and is totally in love with him and has abandoned her police career to play nursemaid at his bedside--ridiculous!!) The main characters chase him out of the hospital, thinking he's the killer, and figure out later it was him, just spying on his partner, beacuse he has a secret CRUSH on her--how stupid is that. They never develop anything on this storyline, and the whole thing, like many other dead ends could have been totally left out of the book. The characters chase all over the city starting storylines that ultimately go nowhere, and in the end, the find one simple clue and instantly solve it all!! The book isn't predictable, because it makes no sense. Everyone falls in love with everyone else at first glance and you are given no information on each character to ever really care about any of them. The reader keeps expecting some of the clues and storylines to come together at the end, but they never do. All is left hanging. Total waste of time to read."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"After reading this , I'm convinced some guy who has it in for the real John Sandford somehow got this book published under his name. It seems almost impossible that the same author who turns out the great &quot;Prey&quot; series could also be responsible for this. Weak , unexplored characters, a uninvolving plot and a &quot;who cares?&quot; resolution makes this the worst book I've read in awhile. I can understand how an author can get sick of writing the same characters over and over and want to try something new, but this entry was just a wasted effort. I don't mean to sound so brutal, but I can't fathom how someone can write such consistently excellent books like the &quot;Prey &quot; novels and then turn around and write something so terrible."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"An interesting start, but fades quickly. Plot is very disjointed and several characters are never developed or developed very poorly. I read the entire &quot;Prey&quot; series before this book, and highly recommend those stories."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"The book was pretty good (not as good as the prey novels, or even the Kidd novels) up till the end, it has no closure for the characters, unless he plans to make another, i know there was a big gap between the Kidd novels. It wasnt written as well as the prey novels, and the characters werent as strong."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"...literally. This is one of three books in my entire life that I have just given up on. I got about halfway through and still found no likable characters or anything holding my interest, so I quit reading. I've always enjoyed the Prey series, and was actually looking forward to reading this because I wanted to see how John Sandford would do without Lucas Davenport to fall back on. Now I know. I could not have been more disappointed."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I found Night Crew to be far below the level of all the Prey books by Sandford. What plot there was went in so many directions, I, as an accomplished reader, needed a road map. It's not very often I have to go back and re-read pages to stick with a story. Having characters with similar names: Jake, Jacob, Jason led to confusion as to whom was alive, dead, or waiting to be heard from. Speaking of characters: Please find me any person that could possibly take the physical assaults Anna received and continue on to &quot;solve&quot; this chaotic &quot;thriller&quot;. Even V.I. or Kinsey would have been hardpressed to handle all this violence. Developing a more in-depth study of Anna's relationships with other characters would have helped to give better insight into Anna as a person. A film crew at night chasing news stories has a lot of potential. Kooky characters and violent events can still be used. Just keep it believable."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I am nearly finished with the Lucas Davenport series by John Sandford. He is a greater writer - but as with any writer where you are reading a series, it is always best to read them in order. I highly recommend this seies, but also suggust that you start with the first book of the series and work your way forward. You will enjoy them much more and not be sorry that you did."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"This is a standalone written by one of if not the favorite author in my personal library. I've read this book at least four times over the many years since it's publication. I recommend The Night Crew to anyone who follows Lucas Davenport and/or Virgil Flowers but who might enjoy a little side trip. While the reader won't find the favorite characters from the Prey series, I believe the storyline will immediately captivate and not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"You always look forward to turning the page. I never want to stop and mark the spot for later reading."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I enjoy the series written by John Sandford. Since I live in Minnesota it is also fun to read about the area and recognize some of the streets mentioned int he book. The murder mystery is well written and keeps you interested throughout the book to the end when you finally find out the villan."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"Just finished \\"The Night Crew,\\" I've been a Sandford fan for years and this is not one of his best but an OK read. The job of the night crew roving Los Angeles searching for newsworthy events is exciting in itself but Sandford doesn't seem as comfortable in L.A. as he does in Minnesota and neither does the reader. Also, \\"the Night Crew\\" Lacks the police focus and viewpoint that Sandford is so good at as with Davenport and Flowers. Also, the development and insight into the life of the serial killer is lacking as compared to Sandford's other villians. If you are a true Sandford fan as I am you will want to read it. If you like Sandford try myHorseshoes & Nuclear Weapons (Attacks on America the Mike Hatch Terrorism Series)andTake It to the Limit"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"The Night Crew is one of those books that willkeep you up all night to finish.

Although he continues his masterful writing and development of his characters, the plot of The Night Crew leaves a lot to be desired.

I guess I am spoiled by the sheer genius of his previous works"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"Fresh, relentless and efficient, Sandford's Night Crew rocks from the very beginning. Sandford guides us through the Los Angeles &quot;never dark&quot; so swiftly and confidently that you won't have time to catch your breath. The world of Anna Batory &amp; the night crew is new to a genre dominated by renegade cops and Jody Foster-like Feebs; it's a very welcome innovation. My one regret about the novel is that the freelance videographers need more time on the page. But then that's what sequals are for"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"This is totally a mediocre stuff from John Sandford...the story begins with a suicide jump and the video crew picturising it,this is followed by some more killings,some more false leads and what not.If John sandford thinks that he has kept the readers on the edge of their seats through out the book then he is totally wrong.When you come to the ending and find out who the killer is then you realise that almost three-fourths of the book does not lead you anywhere.There are so many loose ends and i could not find any connection between the suicide jump and the killer.Did the killer murder him or did he commit suicide..well who cares.I think John sandford should stick to Lucas Davenport character and his prey series ....avoid this book at any cost."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"After reading several of the &quot;Prey&quot; series, I expected the same quality when I began this book. I was very disappointed. While some of the writing was good and parts of the plot were interesting, I thought the book as a whole was disjointed and at times it seemed as though Sandford didn't know where he wanted to go with it so he just filled in with a bunch of fluff until he got around to the plot again. I found the character of Jake especially unbelievable. Imagine losing your only son to a drug induced suicide and then two days later making jokes and romancing someone you hardly know. The ending was especially pointless and disappointing. I would recommend any of the &quot;Prey&quot; series, but definitely not this turkey."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"This is fast paced , has excellent plot. I didn't get ahead of the story and I read a lot of mystery stories. I can hardly wait to read the next book by him that is on my shelf."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I am usually a big fan of John Sandford, but I was very disappointed with Night Shift. I found the story full of loose ends and very unrealistic. When Jake's son dies by jumping off a building, all he can think about is trying to romance Anna. The plot constantly changed course making the book even less interesting. Usually, I can't put John Sandford's books down, but this time I could not wait to be done with it."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"John Sandford is a phenomenal writer. It's too bad that this book doesn't show that. It is a fast read, and does have a swift pace, but the plot was a bit unrealistic and the characters weren't as fun to read as the ones in his &quot;Prey&quot; and &quot;LuEllen and Kidd&quot; novels. I was dissapointed in this novel, but I do think it's worth reading once. It isn't a bad book, but it isn't a great book either."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I enjoy Sandford and was really pleased with this new area of his growth. He seemed to take this new character to another level and I am hopeful that he can continue as he does with the prey books. He has a Lady lead who is into the suspense and mystery of the nightly TV news in LA California and she is quite a lady. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"This is a very pretentious and unrealistic book; not only on plot but even the printing is very artificial. I found that the jumbo letterings were very bothering for my reading. And this book should be condensed at least 1/3 on pages consumption. Another trick of the publisher's to push higher price for a thicker book. The whole story is such a bore and disappointment. You just could not watch some tabloid TV programs to get a novel done, Mr. Sanford, you should have some realistic night-crewing street exeperience. You got same problem as your PREY hero, a detective driving a Porche? Give me a break, it could only have happened in Eddie Murchy's &quot;Beverly Hill Cop&quot;"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"Once again, John Sandford has put it all together and come up with a winner!

A John Sandford novel is always a suspense-laden thriller that grabsthe audience from the action-packed start to the mind tingling finish.Anna Batory is an intriguing new character, who readers will want tosee more novels starring her. The story line is near vintage Sandfordexcept moved from Minneapolis. In spite of this being a superior nailbiter, it is not quite at the level of the author's &quot;Prey&quot; series.Still fans of chilling thrillers will positively love this novel......Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I loved The Night Crew until I got 3/4 of the way through it. Sure some parts were kinda unbelievable (Jake barely grieving for his son; Pam just camping out at Creek's beside) but I put those things aside because I was thinking, &quot;Boy, this is building to an AWESOME climax! Is the killer Jake or Creek or someone else?&quot; I couldn't wait to find out. When I actually did find out, I was so angry that I could barely finish the book. I found out and didn't even care! It was just, for lack of a better literary term--stupid. Don't bother with this book. It took 4 hours out of my life that I'll never get back. Don't let the same happen to you."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I could see Courtney Cox playing her in the movie. But Deputy Dewey boy should take a vacation from this thrill ride. I also would like to thank John Sandford for not using the word Prey in the title. Too many of his novels have the word prey in it, its becoming a sterotype."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"Like other reviewers, I am a big fan of the Prey Series. And like other reviewers, I found the style of Night Crew substantially different from that of the Preys.But I liked it.With respect to the style -- there are two really obvious differences. One is the location, Los Angeles, as opposed to Minneapolis-St Paul, the center of the Prey universe. This is perhaps the biggest weakness of the book. The reader doesn't get a real feel for the locale, or the feeling Sandford spent much time there. LA was just a name, with its associated collection of street names, but it could have been almost anywhere else, for all I knew. I had no sense of the atmosphere that comes out in Michael Connelly's work.The other obvious difference is the main character is female. I find it fascinating when an author writes on a protagonist of the opposite gender. In this case, Sandford is more successful, as far as I can tell as a male. I never had the feeling that the character was straying into a male perspective.Other aspects of the book were also good. Unlike most of the Prey material, this book was a bit more mystery, a bit less thriller. In mysteries, the question is what did happen, while in thrillers, the question is only what will happen. And Sandford plays fair. He provides enough clues for educated conjecture without making it easy on the reader to guess the answer.I also liked the characters. Probing characters isn't Sandford's strong point in any of his work. But I found the ones in this book likeable and, unlike other reviewers, I found them believable.So I recommend Night Crew. It was a lot of fun to read, and I didn't feel at all cheated at the end. It isn't Lucas Davenport, but it doesn't need to be."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"Fortunately, this was not the first John Sandford novel I've read. Had it been, I probably would never have discovered the delights of Sandford's \\"Prey\\" series, which is far more accomplished and enthralling.\\"Night Crew\\" is about Anna Bantory who runs a free-lance TV crew that roams Los Angeles at night, gathering footage they hope to sell to television stations. One night, they tape a raid by animal activists. Coincidentally a call comes in that someone is on a hotel window ledge and may jump. Anna's crew records the jump.Hours later, someone murders a member of Anna's crew and off we go into the pursuit of a crazed killer who is obsessed with Anna.Ho-hum. The characters are thin, the plot contrived and the novel interminable. It's not a total waste of time, but there are many other cop-novels out there that are far more enjoyable, including Sandford's own \\"Prey\\" series, which I highly recommend.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"Written with the same choppy scenes of an MTV video or the guerrilla journalism film of the story's main characters, this novel is quite unlike Sandford's Prey or Kidd series. Not only is the pacing and style different, but also his male characters have fully embraced their feminine sides to the point of being almost wimpy (even a minor character, a massive weightlifter, can freely admit to his fear of surgery). Perhaps this is to enhance his female protagonist's machoness, perhaps it's a slam at sunny California from the security of his snowbound Minnesota; either way it's a noticeable departure from his stubborn, tough-as-nails, manly-men characters.Sandford has structured The Night Crew like a standard mystery, where the reader doesn't discover the identity of the killer until the heroine does. This means a lot of dead ends, as every last red herring has to be tracked down before the case cracks wide open. This too is a departure from Sandford's standard fare.As with any \\"introductory novel,\\" Anna Batory's story is packed with background information about its characters. Combined with the brief story segments, accommodating all the backstory makes for some very choppy, occasionally disoriented reading. I'm sure some of this is intentional, but at times it all became a little overwhelming. Combined with a lackluster serial killer (there's really nothing to him beyond general creepiness and a generic FBI profile) and several noticeable plot holes (How is Anna's neighbor able to check up on Creek who's registered in the hospital under an alias? Why aren't suspects immediately written off when they lack the requisite facial damage?), and The Night Crew becomes a run-of-the-mill story, rather than a masterpiece.For all its shortcomings, though, The Night Crew is still an enjoyable read. Television is full of shows that didn't gel right away or took awhile to find an audience. Should Sandford choose to send Anna, Creek and company off on another investigation I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"John Sandford is obviously a prolific and talented writer, as evidenced by the success of his Lucas Davenport &quot;Prey&quot; series. However, with &quot;The Night Crew,&quot; I have to wonder why all the hoopla? Granted, this book has a very interesting and unusual premise---following a bunch of &quot;reporters&quot; who film unusual or bizarre accidents/murders/arsons, as they occur. The main character, Anna, is sympathetic and you can relate to her, in some ways. The book's best character, Jake, the ex-cop, is also quite different and interesting.Alas, however; the plot gets so confusing and the identity of the murder is so &quot;convenient,&quot; yet unexplained. The ending, both in regards to what occurs with Anna and Jake's relationship, and Creek's strange visit to Anna's ex-boyfriend, is just frustrating. No closure!Now, if Sandford intends a series, this ending might work, but if he doesn't, he's robbed the reader of the all-important resolution of vital closure. A real disappointment."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"Anna is an interesting character; she's complex, tough yet likeable. The story is a thriller, with a good amount of suspense and tension. I enjoyed the bits of dark humour and the well written dialogue.This book is not quite as good as those in Sandford's 'Prey' series, but it is worth reading. I'd look forward to another book in this series."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I too am a fan of &quot;The Prey Series&quot; and can't believe this book is by the same author. There were so many things that were unbelievable and stupid in this book that you will just start shaking your head. I would have to say at the top of my list is that the main character lets a man she has met once move in with her to protect her... come on. I'll let you guess what happens next. The climax was anticlimactic as a three year old child could see through the so called &quot;trap&quot; the villian fell into. If you want true enjoyment in a novel BAINE KERR'S HARMFUL INTENT is the best courtroom thriller I've ever read, buy that not this garbage."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"The Night Crew was a different twist for Sandford. I really like most of the Prey series. I was prepared to not like this book but it was fair. Anna Batory was a little unbelieveable. With no real police training she did better than the real ones did. I liked Jake Harper and Creek, they were more believeable to me. A killer is after Anna, no one can figure out who it is. Of course they finally do and that part ends ok but then the last chapter is added and the whole book does not end right unless Sandford is coming back with these same people. I doubt he is as the copyright is four years old. You are left hanging at the end. Part of the book is very scary and hard to put down, but because of the unbelievealbe Anna and the bad ending I only gave three stars. If you like a book with fast action but it doesn't seem possible then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"It's a good John Sandford. I admit Lucas Davenport is my favorite from the Prey series. I did like Lucas better as a bachelor. He's a bit boring now that he's married, but The Night Crew will keep you up late with them until the last page. I guess even John Sandford needs to get out of Minnesota once in a while so he takes us to Los Angeles for a change and it is an exciting change. I did think I knew the bad guy at times, but I wasn't certain until the very end. It's an old Sandford but a good one. Anna Batory is an interesting character. She is tough, intelligent and relentless. Give it a try. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"Anna Battory is the star of John Sandford's stand alone thriller, \\"The Night Crew.\\" Sandford is best know for his Prey series featuring Lucas Davenport. This novel revolves around a group of people roaming Los Angeles at night trying to film newsworthy events and sell them to local and national television networks.Anna and her crew film an animal rights group raiding a research lab at UCLA, then they stumble on a distraught high school kid on the ledge of a hotel. The kid jumps, the crew films it, and they sell it to all the networks. Then a member of the crew, Jason, winds up dead.The novel summary says the suicide and Jason's murder are two murders that drive the plot. And they do, but not in a relevant way. Also, the father of the suicidal teen shows up bent on finding out what happened to his son. He was an okay character, except for the fact that little was done about his pain over his son's suicide. Anna and her crew are all portrayed solidly, and Anna was given more background and depth than Lucas Davenport has in any of the Prey books, yet this book wasn't as near as fun as the worst Prey books.Anna and Harper, the kid's dad, investigate the killings but the investigation lacks the depth or the twists that Sandford is so good at in the Prey series.This was a fun, quick book to read, but not as exciting as the Prey series. Still, I'd recommend it to all Sandford fans."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"This is only my 2nd John Sandford novel, my first being &quot;Certain Prey&quot;. It was a bit of a letdown as I wasn't able to connect to the characters in &quot;Night Crew&quot; like I could in his other book. For one thing, Jake, the once-policeman now turned lawyer, just lost his son to suicide. He even watched it several times on tape and never really seemed to get too upset about it. He referred to the incident as &quot;my kid&quot; died. Well, as a woman, maybe my perspective is different, but wouldn't a dad still be a bit more upset than that? And to jump into bed with someone he had just met up with a couple of days later...also I agreed with other reviewers who thought Sandford left alot of loose ends. Like when Jake and Anna watched the suicide tape looking for clues, a piece of paper fell to the ground. What was it? Did I miss something? I was listening to it on audiotape and may have skipped something there, but couldn't see where it tied in. I usually hate to hear a good story come to an end, but with this one I was tempted to do some fast forwarding. I believe I will go back and check out some more of the Prey series, they seem to be John Sandford's best work."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"When compared to other works of Sandford's, this book is disappointing. Standing on it's own, its not terrible but certainly is not great. The plot is choppy and leaves many loose ends. The characters though not completely unlikable, don't come across as interesting to the reader. The ending is terrible with huge loose ends at which point you usaully want to know if there is another book to let you know how it comes together in the end. If there is another book, I wouldn't read it."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I read &quot;The Night Crew&quot; while waiting for the latest Prey novel to come out in paperback. If this is any indication of his non-Lucas material, I won't be in a hurry to check out his Kidd series.Normally, I think Sandford is a great storyteller who writes with clarity. This book is just sloppy. I had a very hard time figuring out what was happening and why.Also, none of the characters or their relationships really ring true, except for Anna's platonic relationship with her second-in-command of sorts, Creek.It's a quick read, and it's not totally horrid, but I would recommend it only as a last resort if you're the type that absolutely has to have something to read and this is all you can find."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I LOVE mysteries and I am a fan of Sanford's &quot;Prey&quot; books but this was a pile of junk! I'm the type of person who doesn't try to guess &quot;whodunnit&quot; throughout the book - I just get swept away. Well, I didn't have to guess - the answer was so obvious the suspense was non-existent. I never have any idea who the killer is and I knew this one on about page 60! I'm just mad I finished the entire book to find out I was right all along..."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"John Sandford isn't the best writer around &amp; he's not the greatest plotter around. But he's one of the most interesting mystery writers around because his stories take place at the intersection between the police &amp; the news media. Half the fun of his Lucas Davenport series lies in watching Davenport use leaks to manipulate the media to his own ends.In this new series, Sandford gives us a sort of guerilla news crew. They roam the streets of LA at night &amp; catch incidents on video tape, then sell them to the Networks. One night they film an animal liberationist raid on a lab and a drug addled youth jumping from a ledge. In short order someone starts attacking &amp; killing members of the video crew. Is it connected to one of the videos they shot? connected to both?Sandford moves the story along briskly &amp; he's created several likable characters who seem certain to pop up in future books.GRADE: C+"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"I enjoy John Sanford, I must admit, but sometimes I don't like it when authors waste there time writing books about anyone but the characters I am interested in. I love Lucas Davenport and all his cohorts and wanted to be disappointed in this book. I wasn't at all. In fact, when this book was over I was hoping he could manage a second series featuring these characters.
