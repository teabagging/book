This intense story reflects a young boy's life in London with no family or place to go. The novel begins with Oliver's mother dying, while giving birth to her son and the father remains unknown. Throughout the novel we learn about Oliver's struggles on living on his own. The young boy is befriended on the way and taken in my Fagin. Fagin along with the Artful Dodger invite Oliver to stay with them and become one of them, a thief. While going on one of the adventures of pick pocketing Oliver is caught by Mr.Brownlow who instead of reprimanding the young lad, decides to rise him. Throughout the book Oliver searches for the answers to his past while trying to stay alive on the streets of London. Miraculously, Oliver's family lay right under his nose the whole time. The theme of Oliver Twist examines the importance of a family. Oliver plays a forsaken child, abandoned by all-parental support and thrown into the cruel world at a very young age to live on his own. Oliver's early years taught him to fend for himself and he suffers from never experiencing a loving and nurturing childhood. The tone throughout the novel focused on abandonment and how to live and survive on your own. The setting of the book plays a powerful part as the story unfolded. Dickens describes the setting of London and all the places that Oliver stays very descriptively. \\"The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy order. The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt...\\" (page. 56). Dickens explains the facilities that were available to poor Oliver, and makes them sound unbearable. He does an excellent job making the setting come alive and feel the characters thoughts. I would recommend this novel because I found it very moving and towards the end you are only hoping for the best for poor Oliver."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I always wanted to read this book--and any other Dickens--after being subjected to the musical featuring child stars Mark Lester and the late Jack Wild. It is with great sarcasm that, though I love the musical, to find that the novel differs greatly is such a surprise. I will also admit that this is the first Dickens novel I have ever read, and find it interesting to note that children have never had easy lives since the beginning of man's origins up until now. We just hear more about it these days.The amazing cruelty with which orphans have been treated through history is depicted here with a verbal imagery which the reader will not soon forget, and the cast of supporting characters keeps one fascinated due to the human characteristics Dickens gives them. How a largely bland, yet sympathetic little boy stays true to the purest of righteous virtues seems far fetched at times given his treatment at the workhouse and being constantly surrounded by thieves and murderers like Fagin, Sikes, the Artful Dodger, and Master (All he does is laugh) Bates (I won't even elaborate on that name, but snickered quite a bit at it). Most children would have succumbed to their surroundings long before 12, but Dickens seems to be going for nature verses nurture here, pointing out that people can rise above their environment, and I cannot argue. Most people know someone who came from awful circumstances, only to become the opposite of all the negativity they've been surrounded with. So then, maybe there are street walkers like Nancy--the true hero of this story--who have hearts of gold as well, and there are wealthy people who are the antithesis of everything you have ever heard like the man who comes to adopt Oliver.Dickens makes one thing very clear in Oliver Twist: right makes might, and if you hold on long enough goodness can indeed win the day, no matter how hard life gets sometimes. He also stresses that, among the many paths in life one chooses, the virtues of goodness and honesty are the best roads to take in the end. A classic worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dickens' writing is exacting, descriptive and illuminating. In structure and style, very similar to many of Dickens' other works, particularly Great Expectations - the poor orphan makes it big while encountering interesting and malevolent characters along the way.Oliver Twist brings us dark yet humorous characters like Sikes, Fagin, the Artful Dodger, etc.Great reading and an important part of any classic collection."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist is more than just a great literary classic; it is also a gripping commentary on the state of social welfare and the problem of crime in Victorian England. Through Oliver's experiences, the reader gets a first-hand look at the miserable existence of children in the &quot;charity houses&quot; and the desperate lives of criminals such as Fagin and the Artful Dodger. This novel is a fine example of the genius of Charles Dickens: he could cause his contemporaries to think about the world they lived in, while at the same time telling them an intriguing story that they could not wait to finish. His stories are just as valuable today for the same reasons."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist is one of Dickens' masterpieces where his talent of creating memorable characters shows in all its glory.

Some of his criticisms of society could still apply today. It was more graphic and violent than I thought it would be. Dickens writes the best characters I've ever read. Even the minor characters have personalities and flaws. Dickens has this way of narrating that makes you feel so connected to the characters and makes you care about them a lot.August Rush, the movie, was a great retelling of Oliver Twist and now that I've read the book, I can see even more similarities (the biggest similarity - he runs away from an orphanage and gets picked up by a band of musicians that reminds me a lot of the band of thieves in Oliver Twist). Oliver Twist was not really a page turner, but it was the easiest novel of Dickens that I've read yet. The ending felt a little contrived to me, but I felt so moved by all of the characters through the rest of the novel that I didn't mind very much. I can see why this novel was shocking at the time it was published. Dickens sheds light on things that people just didn't like talking about back then and nothing is black and white."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist is one of the most memorable of Dickens' books, and rightly so. There's a lot about orphans, the welfare system (or lack of), and other social injustices, but it weaves itself into a good story about a poor little boy."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist was the very first Charles Dickens that I ever read. Even though I read it at a snail's pace, I knew that I would love it. Oliver twist highlights many of the social evils that prevailed at that time period. As the title suggests, the story revolves around a nine year old orphan, Oliver Twist. We see him being ill-treated by people, and never getting an ounce of love and kindness. Even though Oliver's story maybe like a fairy-tale, I love how Dickens potrayed the evils lurking at that time for the poverty stricken, especially for poor kids. Also, like most books of Charles Dickens, almost all the characters were memorable, although not so much the \\"good\\" ones. Like in most of his books, the villainous characters are the most unforgettable and the good, saintly ones almost seem dull compared to them. How can anyone forget the pompous Mr Bumble or the evil Sikes or the highly entertaining \`The Artful Dodger'?The book is also peppered with instances of irony and sarcasm which along with being funny, also showed the deplorable conditions of the poverty stricken people. Oliver Twist started my love for Charles Dickens' books, and now even though I have read other books of his, Oliver Twist will always have a special place in my heart."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I wasn't sure to expect when I ordered this book. I've heard great reviews, but sometimes when I get around to reading the book, it just doesn't live up to the hype. Not so in this case.I sincerely enjoyed this tale of the young, innocent Oliver Twist and his story of misfortune. While the novel was darker and more violent than I'd at first anticipated, the language flows like poetry. I loved the roller coaster ride Dickens takes us on as Oliver searches to escape the evils forced upon him, only to be pulled back in. The build to the climax of the story was expertly formulated and executed.Oliver Twist is a classic in the true sense of the word. If you've not had the pleasure of reading this novel, don't delay. Order it today."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dicken's understatement is potent enough to kill at a hundred paces, with laughter. The creepy thief lord ends every sentence with the address \\"my dear;\\" the overdressed Beetle complains when shivering paupers make him feel cold; and those who beat Oliver are encouraged because how else would a child ever learn?"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver TwistBy Charles DickensThis book is about a young boy who starts out in life badly but slowly rises into a loving environment. The first characters are introduced in a house where the young boy known as Oliver Twist is being born. The doctor is able to save him, however his mother passes away after giving birth. He is taken to a place for orphans where he and other orphans are abused much of the time. When he is nine years old he is taken to a place for work by a beadle, known as Mr. Bumble. Later on an undertaker takes Oliver from Mr. Bumble's hands and begins to teach Oliver how to do his line of work as an apprentice. After being treated badly by his family, Oliver decides the best idea is to run away from them. While running away Oliver meets a gentleman by the name of Jack Dawkins. After seeing Jack Dawkins and his buddies way of work, he runs away once again and falls very ill, that is when a kind gentleman, kinder than anyone Oliver Twist had known before that moment ever was to him. After becoming deathly ill he meets a merry old gentleman by the name of Mr. Brownlow who treats him as if he is true family. He and his wife and others who live there treat Oliver nicely and begin to make him feel better. Through the story Oliver meets many other people concerning his life. Most of the characters are about the same, most of them are mean and hurtful towards Oliver but there are also other characters that are kind and gentle towards the poor boy. Oliver is most likely the only one who can be said as innocent. The main conflict is external for throughout the story Oliver is going against the other people. He doesn't realize he is truly going against them but it can be seen.Two events that can make up this plot would be when at the work he is taken to by Mr. Bumble; Oliver decides that since he is voted to be the one, and that he is so starved he will ask the cook for seconds. This turns out to be a bad idea and is offered to be given as an apprentice to anyone who wants him, which the undertaker takes and begins Oliver's life in the outside world. The second would be when Oliver runs away from the event the boys who have a bad line of work as thieves which brings him to the presence of the Merry old gentleman and his small family. This is because he is now introduced into a kinder world than he has known before that point. I like the fact that this could relate in some aspects to people no matter what time because there are still orphans to this very date. \\"Oliver cried lustily. If he could've known that he was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of churchwardens and overseers, perhaps he would've cried the louder.\\" I also like this because it shows how Oliver evolves throughout his life from a bad environment to a good one. \\"Hush my dear you must be very quiet or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad as bad as bad could be, pretty nigh.\\" This shows how kind he is being talked to as compared to old ways. \\"Oliver's clothes had been torn in the beating he received; his face was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead.\\" I would recommend this book to others because no matter who you are you'll find at least one aspect you can relate to, and if you can't find one you will have a change of heart for anyone that can be described like Oliver Twist and it will change your view of the world you had before."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This book kept me reading till the very end.

This freezing also happens when using the dictionary.

I galloped through 50 page stretches, engaged and loving it. So I go to pick up Oliver Twist, and it starts out much in the same way. I found myself halfway through in nearly day, but then, Dickens puts on the brakes. You can tell this was originally a serialized novel, there is so much padding just after the midway part that it drags to a near stand still. Only near the end did it redeem itself with a extremely convulted family tree and coincidental ending, which if you read Dickens is expected. There was never a passage in here that knocked me over with its beauty like Expectations and never did I really feel myself feeling for any of the people in the book like I did in Expectations. This is a very melodramatic book and only a few of the situations made me really feel for the characters like I did in his other novel."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist was orphaned at birth by an anonymous woman. Oliver grew up in an orphanage where the children were starved, and mistreated. At the age of nine he was sent to a workhouse with many other hungry children. One day Oliver asked for extra food, so he was sent away to be an apprentice to Mr. Sowerberry. Oliver didn't like Mr. Sowerberry, so he ran away to London. Which was when he got into the wrong crowd called Fagin, who got him to pick a pocket or two. There a nice man took him in where he was happy, until Fagin comes, kidnaps him, and forces him to break into a house, but he gets shot and is left in a ditch. Mrs. Maylie the servant who shot him finds him, and decides to nurse him back to heath with the help of her niece Rose. Fagin hasn't given up yet, Oliver wakes up to see then staring through his window, so he raises the alarm but they get away.

Of those five, Oliver Twist is my least favorite. It is obvious Dickens is making a statement against the Poor Laws of his time, and while that was a worthwhile cause, this book suffers from it. For me, the best element in Dickens' work is his humor. Even his villains, like Quilp in The Old Curiousity Shop, are often hilarious. However, any comic relief is few and far between in Oliver Twist.Because Dickens is such a fine novelist, a three-star book for him would qualify as a five-star for anybody else. But if I were looking for an introduction to his work, I would try Pickwick Papers, or Nicholas Nickleby."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The story of an orphan boy literally sold for labor in Victorian England had to be told &amp; Dickens describes the whole affair with a delightful sarcasm, sparing no one. The problem with this book is that it seems to wander off track, devolving into a sort of anti-semitic soap opera. Worth reading, but not Dickens' best."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This book has a lot of excitement about the Orphan Oliver life. This book turned out a wonderful ending. Master Bates, Oliver Twist, Fagin, Mr. Brownlow are great character. Don't read Great Expectations because this book will make you bore a lot."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Browsing through this recent edition of Oliver Twist, I was surprised to see that Philip Pullman, of all people, wrote the introduction, a task usually reserved for established scholars. Surely Mr. Pullman, who is famously intolerant of any British writer more popular than he is (with the exception of JK Rowling, towards whom he is notably obsequious) cannot tolerate Dickens? After all, Dickens was not fond of other races or women's rights - two things Pullman has ripped into both CS Lewis and Enid Blyton for - yet here he is, providing an introduction to one of his novels. What's the difference, Philip? Is it perchance because it's easier to scorn Blyton in these politically correct times (and because your master, Rowling, has also publicly been rude about her writing)? Is it because criticizing Lewis for his Christian beliefs that - how shocking! - made it into his children's books is acceptable, but knocking Charles Dickens isn't?Perhaps if Dickens' less tolerant attitudes affected his popularity we'd see you change your colours about him, too. Or is it because even you have to admit that Dickens is a truly great writer with two things you do not have and seemingly never will possess: a sense of humour and great skill in creating timeless characters.And in case you are wondering, Charles Dickens is my favourite writer, period."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"yup, i couldn't finish this one. it was well written, engaging, humorous at times, sad at other times, almost everything that a person could want in a book. it had one major problem though, it really was just too negative. the people were too cruel to each other and there was far too much injustice and dirt, everything was so dirty, dilapidated, dark, discomfort, disquieted minds and any other words you can think of that start with 'd' and end in something unpleasant."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"When \`Oliver Twist\\"'s first installment appeared in 1937, it is probable that not even Charles Dickens was aware that his story about the young orphan-turned-thief would become so timeless. Almost 70 years after its first publishing, the novel is still contemporary, and not only because it deals with human nature, but mostly because it depicts children being exploited by villains.In this time when children are even trade as slaves in many parts of the world, \\"Oliver Twist\\" becomes even more resonant. The novel is a social commentary on the social situation of Britain in the XIX Century. With Oliver (the character) Dickens meant to demonstrate the social situation of his time, when the poor classes were getting even poorer and the rich people richer every day. Above all, the boy's story exposes one of the worst periods in history of Britain for the poor people.The environment where Oliver spends most of his childhood is populated by thieves, murderers and prostitutes. At the same time, the orphan always meet good people who want to help him, and nevertheless fail. But there is also the Church and the government, and by that time poor people could only be helped if they moved into government workhouses.One of the most interesting things in \\"Oliver Twist\\" is the importance of the characters' names. The name \`Oliver Twist' is the clearest example. His surname alludes to his reversal of fortune throughout the story. On the other side, Rose Maylie echoes her youth and beauty, and Mrs Mann lacks maternal instinct.\\"Oliver Twist\\" is an unforgettable book populated by strong characters. Dickens prose is so touching and well developed that has funny and sad moments in the right doses. This is one of the books that stays with the reader long after he/she has finished it."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dickens' 2nd novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; is a crucial MUST for an understanding of Dickens. While I do not consider it a 5 star book, it shows many sides of Dickens. It shows the harsh conditions of Victorian England very well. But it also exposes us to Dickens cynical sense of humor. One case is where the magistrate who is suppose to judge a case is comically unaware of the case. Also Dickens presents us with dramatic irony in that Fagin (the thief) treats his boys better than the legitimate firms. Dickens also provides us with a wide variety of characters. Also, Dickens provides us with an interesting situation in that it is clear that the legitimate firms do not hesitate in their abuse to Oliver. Fagin clearly DOES have a conscience. His concern for Oliver is genuine when Bill Sikes goes into his psychopathic rages. Furthermore, Dickens makes sure we feel a slow and agonizing pain when Fagin is arrested and doomed to die."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Anybody who claims that Oliver Twist is not a good novel should be ashamed of themselves. First of all, Mr. Dickens wrote this in 1838 WHEN HE WAS TWENTY-FOUR! To all of you people who claim that this novel is boring and the worst book they ever read, let me ask you this one question - do you think you can write this well at 24 years of age? I think not. So, you basically have no right to criticize this novel. As for its not being as good as Mr. Dicken's later works, you must remember that he had less experience at twenty-four then he did when he published his other wotks. All in all, I liked it much better than A Christmas Carol."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This was a book that can't be described. This book was so good that it made me want to keep turning the pages until it's finished and hope that he made another. The way Dickens describes the alley the charactors is just mezmerizing. I could almost picture the entire book in my head with these words he has given us. With other books there just to boaring and complicated and are hard to follow, some authers forget that were just kids, but with this book I can just sit back and enjoy it. Oliver Twist in my opinion gets 4 out of 5 stars, bravo Mr. Dickens"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Any aspiring writer has, no doubt, read those writing books where it goes into great detail about how, in order to make a story interesting for the reader, they must throw obstacles in their protagonist's path. After reading the first few chapters of this book, I was cursing Dickens thinking, \\"How many more obstacles are you going to throw in this poor boy's way? Hasn't he taken enough?\\"I actually wanted to wrap my arms around Oliver and tell him that somebody cared about him (another poor boy, Dick, did that for me as Oliver ran away to London, Dickens having redeemed himself).In this edition, Edward Le Comte of Columbia University stated that Oliver's troubles stemmed from the surrogate fathers he had in his life (Fagin, Sikes, etc.) and got love from his surrogate mothers (Rose, Mrs. Maylie, even Nancy). How true. Oliver flourished under Rose and Mrs. Maylie, even Nancy felt a maternal instinct towards the boy. To me, it was this surrogate maternal love that kept Oliver going and held out hope for his future.The part of this book that rocked me was the very end, as Mr. Brownlow, who eventually adopted Oliver as his own son, extracted the truth from Oliver's half-brother Monks. Throughout the book, Dickens did not even hint at the fact that Oliver's father (who is Monks's father) was Mr. Brownlow's dear friend (Oliver came across Mr. Brownlow as his pocket was being picked by the group of thieves Oliver unknowingly came upon as he sat by himself upon his arrival to London from the cruel life he experienced in the country).What are the chances of picking the pocket of a stranger who just so happens to be your father's best friend?It was nice to see the gang of thieves get theirs in the end (although too bad for Nancy that she suffered the end that she did).An enjoyable read. Very anxious to see Roman Polanski's take on the book, with his movie coming out at the end of this month."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist is the most widely read of all Charles Dickens Reads and this Book has been the second Novel of CD after the Fun and humour of The Pickwick Papers. This book added to reputation of Charles. The story says of a boy's journey from hell to heaven. Many years ago, England was cruel and a hard place for kids, it was believed! Oliver's mother dies and he grows up uncared and unloved. He has to work hard, ill treated by the dreadful Mr. Bumble. When Oliver asks for more food, the story speaks for many children everywhere whose voices society refuses to listen. Neglect and Abuse are exposed in this tale of Oliver Twist.Fagin is one of Dickens' most evil characters. It's the Artful Dodger who befriends Oliver Twist when he reached London and he introduced him to the bullish Fagin. Oliver is plunged into a nightmare in his Den and every time he tried to escape, he is caught and when his friend Nancy tried to help him, she is murdered. Of coz, there are good people too in this story. The end is winning edge \`Good over evil'. A nice read and must for all kids collection."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I love Dickens for his characters, and he does a masterful job with Oliver. He is the always hungry boy whom no adverse circumstances can hold down. Reading a Dickens novel is like meeting a whole bunch of unique and wonderful people. Who can forget Fagin and his band of boys or Mr. Bumble with his had and cane? Dickens' books were all written to make people aware of the inequalities of society during his lifetime. Some found this uncomfortable, but the general masses loved it. This book is actually one of my favourite Dickens' books, but I love them all. He could really tell a story, and so what if there's a little moralizing in each one?"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist is one of the all time classics that cannot be described with words. The life of an innocent little boy and the tragic circumstances under which he is grown up to see the world. His honesty and innocence really makes you think about how miserable the life of people can be. And it reminds you to think about the people living in poverty even today. I first read this book in my primary school, and have read it many times since (and have always learnt something new in every read). I even admired the Video based on this book. Just read it, and you will surely shed at least some (invisible?) tears on the life of this boy."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This is a story telling about a poor child who called Oliver Twist&iexcl;s life. He is an orphan. He has never seen his mother or father. He was sent to a special &iexcl;baby farm&iexcl; when he was still baby, living with other orphan s with inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing. This was the way Oliver was brought up.On Oliver&iexcl;s ninth birthday, a man who called Bumble came to bring him to another place, which is more difficult to live for a child. He has to work in a workhouse with much work to do from every 6 o&iexcl;clock in the morning till night everyday. He was treated badly by other young workers, all were laughing at him since he has got no parents. And his master also punished him frequently. With such treatment, Oliver was so sad and decided to leave the workhouse and walked to London by himself. During the journey, he made a new friend-Jack Dawkins, (but Oliver usually calls him the Artful Dodger).Oliver thought that it would be his new life in London, but unfortunately, Dodger was not a good guy, he was a thief of gathering thieves. Oliver was asked to be a member of them, actually, it was not &iexcl;ask&iexcl;, it was &iexcl;force&iexcl;. Poor little Oliver was arrested by policemen at his first &iexcl;job&iexcl;. After that, a king man, Mr. Brownlow brought him out and gave him a new life. With a short moment of happiness with Brownlow, Oliver returned back with his thief life since he was caught by Dodger at the street, and Oliver could never get back to Brownlow, he lost he way and no news about him anymore.At last, a woman came out, Nancy. She was the most kindly people inside the thief group. She helped Oliver to get out of the thieves&iexcl; control. Finally, Oliver went back to Mr. Brownlow&iexcl;s house and lived with them so happily.The first time that I read Charles Dickens&iexcl; fiction is &iexcl;Christmas Carol&iexcl; .it is a really special story. And started to read another story, Oliver Twist. It is a really interesting story, maybe I should say not only interest, its so emotionality and touching. Oliver was a strongest child that I have ever seen as he&iexcl;s an orphan but living with his heart. He didn&iexcl;t give up at any moment.Most of us know that the story of the young orphan who risen above his station to become a rather good man. I remember that, there is a sentence, which always pops out from my mind. &quot;Please, sir, I want some more.&quot; Oliver was too poor since he is always been badly treated, no enough food and clothes at anytime. When he asked for some more, he will surely receive corporal punishment, reflects that others were so cruel.The author went into great detail over the trials Oliver faces, like he is pale and thin. As well, the descriptions of the thieves and poor reflects a belief that once one slides toward the path of destruction, it is nearly impossible to return. What I was surprised to find, however, was just how humorous the novel is. The chapters unfolded, to realize how much more there was to this classic than simply a story about an orphan who falls in with a gang of unruly pickpockets. I feel that just like I have already read it as a child.I highly recommend this book to you since it&iexcl;s interesting, touching and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Can someone be pure of heart, or are we all products of our environment and upbringing? Dickens explores this premise in his novel 'Oliver Twist' quite effectively, while creating some of the most memorable characters ever written. (The Artful Dodger, Fagin, Charlie Bates, etc..) At the same time he also captures the essence of Victorian England perfectly. (At times while reading I even felt that I was there with them, wondering around in the dark of some of these houses waiting for a candle to be drawn to show me the way.) Oliver is an orphan just trying to stay alive in an unsympathetic world. He falls into the company of pickpockets and thieves, and battles to maintain his moral character. He catches some breaks, but seems to always be plagued with the worst luck. (You find out later that not all of it is coincidence, as forces are deliberately working against him.) Most of the so called bad guys are not all bad, and not everybody with the proper upbringing is good. You feel a sense of sympathy for the people living under these conditions and at times can't blame them for what they have become. Even Fagin you find yourself rooting for at times, even though he's the one ruining so many young lives by corrupting them into his own way of life. Even if corrupted though, this book still shows a few people willing to change their ways, either for good or bad. You are not caste into one mold. My only critique of Dickens and this novel is that it was originally written for a magazine in which Dickens was paid by the word. At times it is very obvious he has drawn out a description or a point beyond what was necessary."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This is possibly the best introduction to Dickens and one of my Dickens favorites. I like how he sets the right mood from the very beginning. His depiction of poverty and hardship is vivid but not oppressive to the reader. And what Dickens has in this and all of his books, is characters. You meet interesting people in challenging and dysfunctional circumstances, but you know that the writer took the time to developed psychologically-realistic and nuanced personages.Oliver Twist is condemned to a childhood of poverty, but the cold and indifferent world does not crush him. Misfortunes, intrigues, and plots eventually lead to Oliver turning the corner on his miserable existence and assuming a dignified place in society. The character overcomes seemingly unsurmountable odds. He has a lot of staying power. The indifferent world which Dickens paints in the book turns out to be not as cold and inhuman as one may at first think. Oliver does not come out of his situation entirely on his own, he is helped by others. And the bad guys Sikes and Fagin mee their own just end with some help from the justice system.Dickens portrays poverty and the underworld in a truly compelling way. This book also is a perfect example of his stylistic facility--to be able to write such long sentences and keep the reader so desperately engaged in the story is a mark of a great writer."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I'm feel really glad that I read this book, you now, I'm only 18 years old and this story make me realize of many things that I haven't notest and which for I have to be grateful ."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I really loved this book, I read it when I was twelve, at a time when I new the musical very well.

It is trash but his potential shows through.The Penguin Classics version seen here gives us the book as it was originally serialized in magazines, and it is filthily anti-semitic, as is The Merchant Of Venice by Shakespeare and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, two other filthily anti-semitic British pieces of work. We have an established tradition here of Jew hatred in jolly old England.The characters in Oliver Twist are caricatures given to us as pure good or pure evil. I don't know which are worse. Rose Maylie is so sickeningly sweet and good as to be worse than the bad uns. So is Oliver Twist for that matter. Reading about either of them is like eating french toast with gobs of maple syrup but leaving out the french toast. Just spoon that maple syrup into your mouth straight.Beauty and goodness are equivalent to each other. Rose Maylie is so pretty, pretty as a picture, pretty as two pictures, and so is our pansy goody two shoes Oliver Twist. Perfection is too weak a word for them.Meanwhile, the Jew is a despicably ugly character, both physically and morally. And when Oliver wakes up and looks out a window he spies the Jew, and he wakes up screaming The Jew! The Jew!This edition of Dickens's viciously anti-semitic work identifies its primary villain as The Jew perhaps 300 times. It's The Jew this, The Jew that. If someone tried to get this garbage published today, the only publishing house that would take it would be from Aryan Nation.The problem with completely slamming this trash is that even though the characters are one dimensional, either goody goody good or bad uns, and even though it is a sledgehammer of constant Jew hatred, you still have a fledgling Dickens, a neophyte Dickens, which is like having a rookie Reggie Jackson on your team. He is going to hit some homers and win some World Series games. He has awesome talent and it does show.There is a confirmed tendency to hero-worship the famous. Dickens or Shakespeare could have written any old garbage, and often did, and still most people would praise it to the skies because they really aren't looking past the name.Do you have the independence and the true taste to really tell the wheat from the chaff? Very few people do. And Reggie Jackson struck out an awful lot, and had a big mouth which his foot fit easily into, and was never accused of being a nice guy.This early version of Oliver Twist reeks. Get the musical instead. Or look for a later version, one that doesn't scream about The Jew ten times a page.The introduction tells us that Dickens had Jewish friends who told him that this book was anti-semitic, and Dickens answered basically \\"yes, but most Fagin type criminals ARE Jews\\". Even so, he deleted some of his references to The Jew and added a nice Jew as a minor character in one of his later books. Big deal. That doesn't balance Fagin. Oh, I've ripped out your liver?

Well, here's a view from a Freshman in HS. This book totally blows. It has some good moments during the action sequences, but in all honesty, Dickens makes this story way longer than it had to be by straying away from Oliver and the thieves. It's not exactly the most absorbing story to read.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I don't think anyone should appreciate the works of a genius. Genius works is clearly a drudgery. The book, Crime and Punishment, is a great example of a novel that shows class and good writing by a &quot;regular&quot; writer. Charles Dickens and super gifted and no one should appreciate that. One should appreciate the hard way of learning and thats what normal people do ... they grasp the material with efforts. genius' have the easy way out and thats the main example of Charles Dickens. And anyways who wants to read about an orphan. You know that it'll always be a happoily ever after story that can no ppoint, no class, no morals, and no pride. I encourage people to read A Tree Grows IN Brooklyn, an easy to read novel that actually tells you something."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"People will often say that the exceptions will prove the rule. While instances of this occurrence are difficult to come by, the novel Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens represents one of those instances. In the novel, the main point that Dickens tries to make is that the common 1830's stereotypes of the poor were incorrect. He instead claims that the experiences a person goes through growing up affect whom they become, not that a person of a certain status is inherently good or evil. While this theme holds true for most characters in the novel it does not apply to the protagonist Oliver. Oliver throughout the story is portrayed as good despite the way he was raised from birth. This implies that he has some form of inherent good, which goes against the theme Dickens was attempting to portray in the novel. While most contemporary critics would see this as being somewhat hypocritical, the audience that Dickens was targeting would see it as revolutionary. At the time of his writing, his intended audience was the English middle-class. He felt the stereotypes imposed by people of this class were immoral. Unfortunately, the only way he could truly reach this audience was to portray this poor orphan boy as a saint. In doing so, he was able to counteract the notions of the wealthy that the poor are inherently evil. Once the audience was to this point, which occurs fairly early in the book, they would now be more receptive to the deeper characters of Nancy and Charley Bates who are inherently good despite their life of crime and poverty."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"For one whose impression of classics was quite ruined by other less intriguing books I found Oliver Twist to be a surprising delight. Written by Charles Dickens in the 19th century this book portrays the harshness of the lives of the poor in London during the same time it was written. This book enraptures the reader with plot and language (despite the odd paragraphs here and there) and offers a multitude of fascinating characters.Dickens writes of an orphan boy, Oliver Twist, who runs away from the workhouse and unknowingly joins a group of robbers and pickpockets. The plot that would have been original when it was first published is now quite commonplace. But the language and memorable characters are enough to draw you deep into the story and make the book a page turner.The unforgettable characters that Dickens has created seem real enough to be someone who had actually lived. The characters are far from appearing fictional; all aspects of their personalities and appearance could be someone who one could pass in the streets (excluding their 19th century attire). Each character seems to have distinct words and phrases that one would associate with them, for instance Mr. Grimwig constantly says &iexcl;I&iexcl;ll eat my head&iexcl; and at times he&iexcl;ll add in another head for which he will &iexcl;eat&iexcl; along with his own. The characters in Oliver Twist are hard to not remember, for there will always be some character that comes to mind when you think of something or the other (like heads).Despite all this, the book does have its flaws. A novel that would have taken me less than a week to read has now taken me three. Although Oliver Twist may keep you hooked there are parts of a book which may make you put down the book and fail to pick it up for a few days. I find some intervals where Oliver is not present to be dull and somewhat lacking in fresh content. Although such chapters are somewhat a rarity they were enough to make me lose interest in the book itself for a couple chapters.Oliver Twist, flawed as it is, is still a brilliant piece of work worth the time to read. One should not miss out on the opportunity to meet the memorable characters which come straight from the streets of 19th century London and make Oliver Twist such a novel worth reading."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Starting with Oliver's premature birth to a dying mother looked on by a gin-swilling nurse in a parish workhouse, Dickens tone is extremely satirical. Though his meanings are clear, his craftsmanship with the English language is in rare form in the beginning of Oliver Twist. The \\"distinguished and enlightened gentlemen\\" who's reform policies for the workhouse are raked over the coals in glowing language represent an unusual type of Dickens character for me. Usually even Dicken's villains are multi-faceted characters whose motives we understand though disapprove of. Here, the Directors of the parish who eventually pay to get rid of Oliver, are difficult to conceive of. The hardships of the workhouse inmates, more especially what seems like intentional starvation, seem hard to believe though as I read this book, the death of a foster child in New Jersey from starvation brought to light many things going on in twenty-first century reality which had seemed implausible in this nineteenth century novel. The satirical language is often humorous though the subject matter is not and makes the account more palatable. The first of the book is spent in this way which seems really to be more of Dicken's social commentary than pure story line.In true Dickens style, each of the characters Oliver meets throughout the story are part of a larger, more elaborate plot line that the story is ever trying to unfold. After being apprenticed to the coffinmaker Mr. Sowerberry, he is taunted by the charity boy - Noah Claypole - until he makes a break for London. Accidentally falling into the clutches of local fence Fagin whose aim it is to turn him to a life of crime, Oliver struggles to break free with the help of various good hearted people he befriends along the way despite his situation. It is only through their help who believe in him against all odds that we find that Fagin's attempts to make Oliver into a thief or at least believe that he has broken the law is not entirely the result of chance. As a shadowy figure going by the name of Monks attempts to remove proofs of Oliver's origins, it is up to his new friends to piece together the puzzle of Oliver's life and help him to break free once and for all from the poverty of his existence.Until Oliver's friends get involved, I wasn't entirely grabbed by the story line but I don't know if that was from my inability to connect with the workhouse characters or my familiarity with the early part of the story. Once they got involved and I was into a part of the story I knew nothing about, I did really get into it. Like A Tale of Two Cities, I would say that this one starts a little slow but takes off towards the middle. Unlike that novel, however, its lacks the profound nobility, with some characters having little value except as a vehicle in the commentary (like Mr. Bumble). The Tale of Two Cities was not an out and out social commentary (it was hidden well within the folds of the pages) but I would have to say that Twist is. It is a good story, well worth reading, but its lasting value is not in the character of the orphan Oliver - it is in the passion of the author against the wrongs of the then welfare system. It seems more to me to be a moralism: a tale to remind us of ourselves and to guard against the mistakes of the past and to ensure the lives of the vulnerable in the future."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I had to read to read this book for school.

I think that I might have liked this book better if not for two things. Number One, I hated how the introduction in the beginning said that Charles Dickens was Anti-Semetic when there is so much evidence which is shown in books like &quot;The Friendly Dickens&quot; which show that he is not Anti-Semetic at all. In fact, he drew Fagin as he was because that was just the stereotypical picture of a Jew, and he created Riah in his last novel to make amends for Fagin's evil Jew because it offended the Jewish public. I also didn't find the villians that interesting and when the views left Oliver and turned to Fagin and Sikes I was pretty bored. This novel started out good, but it faltered. I suggest that if you are a big fan of Dickens, buy this novel, but not this edition because of Nancy Springer (the author of the introduction) misleads the audience drastically."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"It seems that C harles Dickens can look into human beings' inner world.

You've got heroes, villains, comedy, tragedy, social commentary and detailed descriptions of face, dress, and city. You've got the whole world wrapped up in a story that has you rooting for the good guys even after 150-plus years, and even though you know the good guys are too good to be true.The story of Oliver Twist doesn't need to be retold in this review. The plot twists are ridiculous at times --- though a lot less ridiculous in Dickens' day than they would be in ours. Today, few kids are orphaned at birth, and few are shamed by being bastard children. Today, few people can move from town to town, changing their name and escaping their past. (It can be done, but it's very hard.) Today, it's believed that everyone can be redeemed and everyone can become a master of his own fate. Not so when Dickens was alive. The world really was a place in which many lives were short and brutish.Dickens conjures up those depths, but what he does so remarkably is to show the life that survived in them and the humanity that each of us has. Humanity comes in many forms: Oliver and his little friend Dick, somehow maintaining sparks of kindness despite their horrid treatment in the parochial orphanage; the pickpocket/prostitute Nancy risking her life to save Oliver; and the evil Fagin and Bill Sykes feeling remorse about the things they've done. Those are the indelible images that stick with me, even more than the soft-hearted humor that Dickens always blends into the mix.Dickens masterfully opens the curtain on the sordid life to which England's lower classes were consigned, and he is angry about it. He was the first to be able to bring that perspective to a wide audience through a popular medium, and he helped to create the momentum that changed the treatment of the poor and sought more humane ways of dealing with crime and lack of opportunity. The seething in this book is echoed today in protests around the world over inequality in wealth and opportunity --- showing that Dickens is as relevant today as when he put pen to paper."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twistis perhaps the most culturally prevalent of Mr. Dickens' novels. Everyone has heard the famous line: \\"Please sir, can I have some more?\\" What a lot of people don't realize is thatOliver Twistwas actually Dickens' attempt at a social critique of the prevailing prejudices against the poor and downtrodden in Victorian England, and the appalling work and living conditions that they were subjected to as a result of the Poor Law of 1834. In this capacity Dickens was very successful; his novel helped draw attention to the problem and precipitated a wave of compassion toward the poor. However, his success in improving the image of one marginalized group was perhaps marred by the slandering of a second marginalized population: the Jews. Dickens' anti-semitism is very apparent in the character of the Jew Fagin who is repeatedly likened to a demon, and who is characterized by a jumble of derogatory Jewish stereotypes. By contrast, Oliver is hardly characterized at all except to be described as a kind of nebulous blob of pure goodness who is tried by hardship at every turn-- thereby winning our sympathy.Like many of Dickens' novels, Twist's plot hangs on the convergence of coincidence. Though the seeming acts of fate that drive the story are clearly contrived, it is done in such a self-aware manner that the reader can't help but overlook the ridiculousness of the plot twists. My favorite part of Dickens' story-telling in this novel is the bitingly sarcastic manner in which it is written. The narrative is dry and exceptionally witty, and I frequently found myself laughing out loud at the masterful use of irony that turns what could be rather dark and depressing parts of the novel into dark comedy. The manner of narration makes up for the rather stereotypical good vs evil, villains-get-their-just-deserts plot formulation. I really enjoyed readingOliver Twist, and I would definitely recommend it for a first time Dickens reader, with the one qualification that it does reflect the prevailing prejudices and racism of the time, and should thus be taken with a large grain of salt."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Charles Dickens' famous novel Oliver Twist is a fantastic and exciting tale of mystery, drama, and adventure detailing the perils and orphan encounters in his journey from orphanage to happiness. Though the basic storyline is somewhat similar to Dickens' Great Expectations, Oliver Twist will maintain an observant reader's interest and fascination with its historical accuracy, biting wit and sarcasm, and harsh criticism of the poverty and corruption in 19th century England. However, some with a less than excellent reading comprehension level may have difficulty understanding Dickens' dialect and ironic sense of humor. The vivid and colorful depictions of characters such as Fagin and the Artful Dodger thickens the plot and helps the reader to draw personal connections and become involved in the story. The clear imagery, irony, and symbolism of Oliver Twist (and not to mention its fame) all prove that its literary merit goes without saying. Seamlessly aternating between tragedy and dark humor, Dickens ensures that there is never a dull moment in reading Oliver Twist. It is a must-read for any seasoned lover of classic European literature, young or old."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Set in early 19th century London England, Oliver Twist is an insider's look at the life of paupers,dirty lowlife criminals,andpickpockets.It takes you from a parish workhouse,to the poverty-stricken streets of south London,to the high society in Pentonville.The story begins when a young woman bearing child,withered and and drenched to the bone,shows up at the parish workhouse.She gives birth to a boy and dies.That boy is Oliver Twist.Oliver is underfed,overworked and treated with contempt throughout his entire childhood.When he enters the parish workhouse at age 9 he is picked by fellow parish boys to \\"ask for more\\" with tragic results.He is marked impertinent and contemptible and is offered along with 5 pounds to anyone who will apprentice him(and therefore take him off the workhouse's hands).Throughout his many adventures(and there are many)Oliver comes across such characters as Fagin,a corrupt old Jew with a band of pickpockets,Bill Sikes,a brutal,violent robber, and the mysterious Mr. Monks,whose connection and interest in oliver is unknown,The book's many twists and turns,revealing Oliver's history little by little keeps you interested,while the sweet,kind and gentle nature of Oliver keeps you rooting for him to the end.Dickens'ingenious plot and witty remarks make this book a true classic.Some readers may be disappointed by the lack of details relating to oliver's origin,wich, although complex,are fully described in the book's last few pages and are difficult to relate to the rest of the story.Dickens was only 26 when he wrote Oliver Twist,it being only his second book published.Although some readers may declare it melodramatic,and there are a number of questionable coincidences throughout the story,Dickens is a truly remarkable storyteller and the book is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dickens's famous novel about the orphan who says, 'Please, sir, I want some more'. An early work, Oliver Twist was published in monthly installments at a hectic period in his career, and was not carefully planned. Dickens intial concern is lampooning the New Poor Law of 1834 and the system of workhouses established to house the indigent; before long the story moves to London and deals with the timeless issue of good-versus-evil. One of his darkest novels, it shows London's criminal underworld and has many nasty characters. The resolution may not satisfy all readers, as it depends on several coincidences and contrivances.Oliver Twist has some of Dickens's best characters: his most controversial creation ever, Fagin, the leader of a gang of young pickpockets; Mr Bumble, a pompous panjandrum; the evil Sikes; and the Artful Dodger.Contains one of his most memorable scenes, which involves the thief Sikes and his girlfriend Nancy. In his last years Dickens gave public readings of 'Sikes and Nancy' against the advice of his doctor, friends, and family. He performed with such passion that they believed it caused his health to deteriorate and eventually hastened his death.I recommend a quality paperback edition such as Penguin Classics or Oxford World Classics, as these include helpful explanatory notes."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens is one of my favorite stories for many different reasons. I had read the children's version many different times when I was young and I loved the story and would read parts of it over and over again. It has scenes of romance, and violence, and mystery and just about any other type of genre you can think of so anybody would enjoy it. When we did a free-choice book report last year, I decided I would read the real version.As soon I started reading, I realized that it would take a lot longer than I thought. Dickens uses words that are more for accelerated readers so the book is impossible to skim or you will miss the whole story. You really have to pay attention to the context around the words to understand them if you don't understand what he is trying to say. The book can be a bit confusing to start off but there is never a dull moment. Also make sure you take the time to read the whole thing because if you read the first parts it isn't as exiting as the parts closer to the end and the ending is really good!"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"English actress Miriam Margolyes' reading of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist is without peer. She breathes consummate life into every character. This is the definitive audio version of Oliver Twist. Thus far, no other narrator or actor approaches Margolyes' power in animating this towering classic. I unreservedly recommend this marvelous and completely unabridged recital of Dickens' immortal tale. My only quibble is that the producers have not yet issued Margolyes' reading on CD. As of April, 2006 it is available only on audio-cassette; a failing which hopefully will soon be remedied."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Like so many of Dickens' novels, Oliver Twist is a fantastically crafted and engrossing novel. Dickens follows the life of a young orphan boy, Oliver, who grows up amidst desperate poverty in London in the early 19th Century. Dickens leads the reader on a delightful and engaging romp, as Oliver escapes his orphanage, gets mixed up in the wrong crowd, and ultimately comes out on top.The story within Oliver Twist is very engrossing, replete with many twists, turns and surprises that are occasionally tragic but more often witty or flat out hilarious. The characters are all superbly developed, and the multiple story lines are intricately and cleverly woven together. Oliver Twist is an excellent introduction to Dickens, and patient readers will find this novel accessible. The intricate plotline does require some concentration, while some readers may be annoyed by Dickens' notoriously lengthy sentences.This is an important book to read for it is heavily engrained in Anglo-American culture and most first-time readers will recognize many of the names (Fagin, Artful Dodger) and scenes from previous cultural references. While clearly enjoyable at the superficial level, the novel also makes a powerful statement about poverty and the power of the human spirit in the face of depravity."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"In this book Dickins shows the reader how children in England during the Industrial Revolution.

It skipped parts and chapters. would not recommend for school"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"These adapted classics are very good for students learning English and desire a more sophisticated story. Oliver Twist is written in a way so that it is still interesting and accessible. Nothing is more frustrating to a teenage or adult ESOL student than to have to read books that are geared more for young children or attempting to read books that are too difficult. This series helps them read material they may have heard of and practice their reading in English too. They are well written and the story is clear. Illustrations help readers get a feeling for the time period and the characters. I find these books, including Oliver Twist very helpful."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"When I started reading Oliver Twist, it was an assignment for school and nothing more. However, I was soon intrigued by little Oliver, a quiet, naturally pleasant little boy, and who is apparently a magnet for bad company and lives in a workhouse. I wondered how he could remain so sweet and childish through all he'd been through.Dickens kept me turning the pages with cliffhangers and anticipation. It's witty and it has hilarious moments concerning the band of thieves. Master Charley Bates' laughter is infectious even from the pages of the book, The Artful Dodger's proposed \`genteelman behavior' is amusing, and Fagin's witty remarks always manage to entice a chuckle from me and my dad as we read it together.The only thing that irritated me was that Dickens leaned a little too far to the left and the right , and didn't have any middle ground. Oliver Twist is a perfect boy. He does nothing wrong. Ever. Not once. I don't think it portrays people with a sense of morality well enough, because even those people are not perfect(coughRosecough). However, the way the little robber gang is written represents the underside of human nature very well.Dickens' sense of description was astounding. It really made everything come to life, from the dirty, disgusting streets of London to the beautiful country lane. It gave me a vivid and detailed picture in my head.All in all, Oliver Twist is an excellent book.The story was very well put together, and he leaves no loose ends to be tied up. There are dull moments in the book, but Dickens brings us back with a sudden twist at the end of a chapter that will leave us at the edge of our seats, begging \\"Please sir, more?\\""},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens, Illustrated by George CruikshankOliver Twist is a great literary classic.

The poor orphan is one of the most memorable protagonists in English literature. The supporting cast is something worth mentioning, also. The distinctive portrayals of Master Bates, the artful Dodger, Fagin (who is sadly a Jewish caricature), and Bill Sykes make this novel a page-turner.Much of the satire in this story involves the 19th-century English social class, political upheaval, and daily life in the slums of London. And they work so well here.A-"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist is a classic! If you don't know already, it's about a 19th century orphan who lives a disturbingly difficult life in a British workhouse. Mr. Bumble treats him poorly, and so does nearly every other adult figure in his life.Oliver runs away at the age of 12 and ends up staying with some young thieves and pickpockets. They are not happy when Oliver is reluctant to get involved with their criminal activities. He is injured in a failed bank robbery, and is befriended and helped by the kindly Mr. Brownlow. This begins a chain of events which leads to the truth behind Oliver's troubled past and to a resolution of his sad story.This is a great read. I recommend it as a good place to start to get familiar with the tantalizing tales of Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Excellent work from Charles Dickens. Every child in the world should read this book."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Along with \\"Great Expectations,\\" \\"Oliver Twist\\" was one of my father's favorites. This book starts with the birth of Oliver Twist. his mother sadly dies, and Oliver is at the mercy of the brutal orphanage headed by Mr. Bumble. When Oliver asks for more food (his famous line), the orphanage decides that this is intolerable. They offer 5 pounds to anyone who will take Oliver off their hands. (Though in defense of the orphanage they do refrain from giving to someone who is obviously unfit.)Oliver ends up in the employ of the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry. He is 1/2 way decent to Oliver, but that is more than can be said for Mrs. Sowerberry, Charlotte, or Noah. Oliver runs away, and it is not long before her runs into the Artful Dodger. The Dodger convinces Oliver to join him in Fagin's employ. Fagin is the head of a group of thieves. But is he really such a bad person? He takes better care of the boys than the so called legitimate firms. He's a little crafty of course, but he is trying to survive in difficult times.Well, Oliver ends up with the law on his tail. In this 2nd novel, we can see Dicken's brilliant techniques. The scene of a mob chasing Oliver is of course disturbing. But Dickens gives us a chance to laugh when he explains it: \\"'Stop thief, Stop thief!' There is a magic in the sound. The tradesmen leaves his counter and the cart man his wagon...\\" Well, Oliver is found innocent, but not before Charles gives us a fierce (but still comical) literary attack on the courts. Dickens is best known for his sympathy to the poor in these times. But we should not neglect his fierce and comical side.Well, the tension is released as Oliver is taken in by the kind Mr. Brownlow. But all can not be quiet for long. Fagin is concerned over Oliver's sudden disappearance. Why not? Oliver knows where he and his boys reside. Tensions tighten further when we see Bill Sikes (who unlike Fagin really has no redeeming traits) goes after Oliver. Oliver is captured, and in a redeeming moment, Fagin warns Oliver to be careful around Bill Sikes. Sikes then takes Oliver on a job that ends with Oliver getting shot (though not fatally).But all is not lost. Oliver befriends the kind Rose Maylie and she helps Oliver back to health. We later learn that Rose is Oliver's aunt. But there is more bad news. Oliver's 1/2 brother Monks wants to get a hold of Oliver. Monks runs across Mr. and Mrs. Bumble. (In an attempt to give Bumble a redeeming trait, Dickens has him marry the down on her luck Widow Corney.) Through the destruction of a certain locket, Monks is able to secure an inheritance for himself. But there is more to come.Nancy pities Oliver and wants to return him to Mr. Brownlow. But Sikes fears that Nancy will turn him over to the authorities. Tensions get worse when the sociopathic Sikes clashes with the notably more human Fagin. Nancy gets Oliver to safety, but is soon BRUTALLY killed by Sikes. It is not long before Sikes is persued by the mob. It would seem that Dickens has contempt for mobs even when they are chasing a killer.Oliver is of course saved, and part of the story ends happily. But poor Fagin is arrested, and the courts are not so merciful. Some of his acts were criminal, but he was just trying to survive. Fagin certainly treated the boys better than the orphanage did. Fagin is sentenced to death, and Dickens makes sure we feel sympathy for him: \\"What right have they to butcher me?\\"While this is only Charles Dickens's 2nd novel, it does show his ability to skillfully combine disturbing events, and cynical comedy, as well as bringing several plots together. (Not to mention creating fully 3d characters.)"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I recently reread Oliver Twist and was quite surprised as to how faithful the musical \\"Oliver\\" and also several film adaptions are to this story originally written in the 1830's. Obviously there are minor difference but it is tough for even Broadway and Hollywood to diminish a good story. Sure Oliver Twist is sentimental and melodramatic and loose plot ends are tied up ever so neatly but it still has something to say to the 21st century. Poverty,crime,homelessness,and corrupt government officials still plague us today as there is no change in basic human nature. Dickens preaches to us about these evils but he does it so humorously that the hammer with which he hits us over the head leaves us improved rather than wounded."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Personally, I read fiction for the plot- the story. Some read fiction for the characters, some for shared experiences, or some for the writing itself. But I must admit, I am a bit of a Philistine. I just want to be entertained, and Oliver Twist was an entertaining book.Rarely have I found myself cheering for a character like I cheered for little Oliver. My heart broke for him through the majority of the book as he faced hardship after hardship that no human should have to face. Even when Oliver finds comfort, the author writes in such a way that foreshadows impending doom for the main character and this makes for fun, 'sitting on the edge of your seat' reading. I also enjoyed the 'British slang'. It wasn't hard to understand, but just funny in a quirky kind of way.The only gripe I have about the book is the ending. Most of the book was written excellently, but the ending was a bit of a letdown. I appreciate a happy ending just like anyone else, but the ending in Oliver Twist came together slowly and with little interest."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Every student ought to read this book.

He's not subtle, is he? Yes, I enjoyed it. Oliver Twist is wonderfully imaginative, often funny, and fictional characters don't come more vivid.

And the continual references to the diabolic Fagin as \\"the Jew\\" are a bit much, even by the standards of the day. \\"Dickens is literary now, of course, because the books are old,\\" writes Nick Hornby. \\"But his work has survived not because he makes you think, but because he makes you feel, and he makes you laugh.\\" He made me laugh, too.

Plus, it works on my non-MP3 player. The reader definitely makes a difference to how this book is appreciated. Owning it means I can listen any time I need a Dickens fix."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I absolutely adore Charles Dickens. His beautiful, poetic language, coupled with some of the courser English dialects spoken by some of the characters, makes for some very colorful scenes in the story. Additionally, his subtle humor often catches the reader by surprise, and makes it all the more hilarious. For example, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, two not-so-charming people, find themselves in a parish workhouse and divorce, Mr. Bumble is described as being so miserable that he forgets to be thankful to be rid of his wife.Much of the story is sad, and there are some parts that are downright heart-breaking. However, the recurring idea of this story is hope. Hope that lives through innocence. Oliver is faced with some horrifying circumstances, and all throughout, he maintains his innocence and good heart. In the end, his purity shines through and is ultimately rewarded.This book looses a star because it seemed like Dickens would go off on tangents that had nothing to do with the main story. After a while, it would become distracting. This book lacked the concise story-telling of some of his other works."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK..!! it is a classic book that you must have in your collection. i always enjoyed it since i was a kid"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I had read several abridged \\"kiddie\\" versions of Oliver Twist when I was in middle school, and as a teen I was semi-addicted to the 1960's musical adaptation Oliver! so I thought that I knew all there was to know about this famous British literary urchin. Not so. Actually sitting down to read the full version of Oliver Twist has shown me that the original story is much more clever, and much darker, than I had anticipated.Young Oliver is born in a workhouse, and although his single mother dies in childbirth and leaves him with no one to give him true care or attention, Oliver thrives, in a certain sense. He grows up in this workhouse, and the horrors of his childhood can seem all the worse because of the light comic tone of the narration. Charles Dickens is always a wonderful author for pointing out hypocrisy, cruelty, and social injustices, but though it's good to be made aware of the evils of the day, it can still be hard to read about children starving and being beaten. 9-year-old Oliver's situation is so dire, it's a relief when he escapes to London and finds himself trapped in a life of crime! At least when he's with the criminal gang of pickpockets, he gets to eat.Notes on Oliver: I notice that Oliver speaks just a tad on the aristocratic side, when compared with the other boys in the book. He just doesn't have the same penchant for slang and sauciness as his peers. On this read-through, I also perceive for the first time that Oliver himself isn't all that interesting. He's 100% sympathetic--you want to save him and nurture him, but aside from his general goodness, he's a bit of a blank canvas. He's so incorruptibly pure, it's like it doesn't occur to him that anyone could possibly be deceptive or dishonest, which is why he's no good at thievery even after receiving some training.One thing that hasn't changed for me while reading the book: I'm still ridiculously fond of the Artful Dodger. He wears a jauntily tilted hat and a gigantic tail-coat with rolled up sleeves, and he's altogether grubby, which makes him look like the coolest homeless middle-school-aged kid in literature, aside from Huckleberry Finn. He's got this big store of worldly knowledge and Oliver relates to Dodger like he's a bizarre type of grown-up, but as you're reading, you know that Dodger's really just a kid.Things that surprised me: There's an entire main character in Oliver Twist that didn't appear in any adaptation I read or saw until now--Monks, Oliver's half-brother! Wow. I scarcely know what to do with the fact that there's this whole important person in the book itself, and yet he's so ultimately inconsequential to the heart of the story. Monks isn't much of a villain when compared to the murderous, abusive awfulness of Bill Sikes, and just adding more family drama to Oliver's origin story isn't all that interesting. I think the adaptations had the right idea when they removed him.Also, things for the Artful Dodger go rather differently in the book than they do in the films and abridged books.Well, Dickens is never anything but good reading, but I wound up liking the real Oliver Twist a good deal less than I thought I would. Maybe I should stick to re-reading A Christmas Carol instead. Grade: BFavorite quotes:\\"It's all over, Mrs. Thingummy!' said the surgeon at last.\\" (pg 3)'A clean shirt,' thought Oliver, 'is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles' walk in winter time.'

Not only is Oliver Twist an enjoyable story, it is a biting commentary on the social conditions of the day. The book is full of satire and humor. Those of you who found it boring and long obviously missed this humor. Dickens is also a master of literary caricature as is especially obvious in Oliver Twist. It is not by coincidence that this book is a classic which has been adapted and retold for years."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I have to admit that I was quite disappointed by this book that started out beautifully. About halfway through the book, Dickens dropped Oliver and started pursuing all of the books other chracters, of which,I might add, there are too many; if he really wanted to keep all of the characters then he should have made the book longer, or scratched a few of them. Although I did understand the book, the excess of characters forces the author to pursue each one of them, thus making the novel complicated. When I say that it was incomplete, I mean that it did not pursue all of Oliver's exploits, it was not a total attack on the system of society back then because it failed to impress sadness upon the reader at the end, simply because Oliver had a great life from twelve onwards. If he had been hung for doing nothing, simply falling into one of Fagin's setups, then this book would have had a bigger impact. Look at Uncle Tom's Cabin, for example. Tom dies an awful death a few days before his rescuer arrives, and Uncle Tom's Cabin caused the Civil War and the end of slavery! Finally, I think that Monks is introduced too late in the story, forcing Dickens to rapidly let the plot unfold at the very end of the book."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"It seems that Charles Dickens can look into human beings' inner life.

The life of a main hero smacks of unnatural due to numerous sharp turns in his fate brought about by pure coincidences, which finally deliver him from the slum of life. To struggle through the part relating to a reader the life of Oliver in the family which adopted him, you have to possess a load of sentimentality which can afford you to listen to your national anthem twice a day and still enjoy it after a couple of years. However, if you manage to avoid all this schmaltz, you will discover a brilliant and curious piece of literature. Dickens, with his talent of journalist, produced a captivating, if strictly correct, account of London's underworld and the life poor people were forced to live at the time before the welfare state. The parts dealing with a gang of thieves and parish paupers make this book worth reading. Alas, in this case the canvas is more valuable than the portrait on it."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I doubt I would have had the patience to read this Dickens if it hadn't come in serial form.

Laced with suspense, temptation, and adventure, the story line retains the full attention of readers while depicting life in Victorian England. Charles Dickens proves his high literary caliber by using myriad complex themes and symbols embodied in the story of a simple boy of simple means. He brilliantly exemplifies the societal imbalance and hypocrisy of the middle and upper classes through a young boys' story.Moral standards are put into question in the novel. Oliver embodies the meaning of innocence and purity, even though he is considered filthy to the superior classes. While the whole world, starting from the orphanage and ending with the pick-pocketing gang, attempts to tell Oliver the meaning of purity, he remains true to his morals. This is a statement to readers about the hypocrisy of society at the time.Dickens uses relatable characters and humor to capture the audience and portray the setting and circumstance of the time in an interesting way. Although he illustrates a sad, depressing situation, his use of Oliver's spirit and tenacity render a hopeful impression on the reader. I found myself rooting for Oliver as he confronted individuals who intervene his mission for righteousness and love. I would highly recommend this book because it gives insight to Victorian England and the Industrial Revolution in Europe during the time through a young, noble boy's soul."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I would like to have know how long it was between the updates.

This is no dry musty tome, but a vital novel that arouses both passion and intellect. A literal page turner, I found myself having more than one sleepless night when I just couldn't put it down.Inside are some of the major characters in the realm of fiction; Fagin and his gang of child thieves, including the Artful Dodger. Nancy, the proverbial hooker with a heart of gold. Master Charles Bates (was this a pun even then?) Bad Bill Sikes, who shows the darker edge to all of this dangerous fun, and the innocent, pure Oliver Twist, who is the very definition of nature over nurture.A great book, and one that I am glad to have finally read."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"A novel of this size can be daunting for the reader. \\"If I start this book, I'm going to have to spend the next month finishing it\\". That's what I thought anyway. But in Oliver Twist I sailed through the pages. It's rare that a classic, and I have read many of them, becomes a page-turner but this one did. Maybe I was lucky in not having seen the film versions prior to the reading of the book because I desperately wanted to find out what happened to Oliver and the multitude of other brilliantly written characters who inhabit the pages of Dickens' classic.The plot is simple. A boy escapes his orphan home to live in London with a group of thieves and pickpockets. He's saved from this depraved life by a kindly, lonely old gentleman. But the villains, Bill Sykes and especially Fagin, fear that the boy may rat them out and so they kidnap him back. Can Oliver make it back to the life he deserves?Oliver's story is not a very originally one, but it is enlivened by some of the greatest characters I've ever seen written. My personal favourites and there are many, are Noah Claypole who becomes a principle player and a very funny one at that, near the book's conclusion; and Mr. Brownlow, who's catchphrase \\"I'll eat my own head\\" had me bursting into laughter.The book is diminished by its excessive sentimentality at the conclusion. Its female characters, apart from the courageous Nancy, are written in a golden light so as to become fantasies rather than the gloriously dirty reality of their male counterparts. A sub-plot between Mary and her boyfriend is ridiculously excessive.Against these weaknesses, the book is a triumph of character. Often memorably played on screen, the two villains have become more famous than the title character, who is slightly simpering. Fagin is deliciously smarmy and Sykes is evil incarnate. They get their comuppance in justifiably brutal fashion. Dickens like most of us was a sucker for a happy ending."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist is one of Dickens' early novels - he worked on The Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby simultaneously - and one of his best loved. It has what you would expect from him: memorable characters, evocative descriptions, melodrama, pathos (more often bathos) and a plot that relies on completely incredible coincidences. These latter are sometimes explained away by the characters themselves as being ordained by Fate, benign or otherwise, and must have been more acceptable to a Victorian readership than to one of the present day, who are likely to groan at each 'who should it be but' revelation.The crossovers with Pickwick and Nickleby are noticeable. For example, The Artful's court appearance is clearly intended to be as funny as Sam Weller's, although it pales by comparison.The most famous character is of course Fagin, and Dickens' casual anti-Semitism in his treatment of him is another thing that might discomfit the modern reader. He references him as The Jew, always in a derogatory manner. That this is a reflection of contemporary attitudes can be seen from Scott's Ivanhoe, in which Jewish characters are treated with similar hostility and contempt. But it is not the main characters that are most successful - and especially not the title character himself, who is innocent and bland beyond belief - but the supporting cast; Mr. Bumble and his lady, the servants in the house that gets burgled, the old bachelor who keeps threatening to eat his own head, and many others. They make the book a delight.As always, Dickens is the master of descriptive narrative and he conjures a grim and compelling view of Victorian London's underside.If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times as their first. Either book will probably leave you, like Oliver, wanting more."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I haven't read the unabridged edition, but I could still detect gaps in the convoluted plot. The reading level is more appropriate for high school students. This book is nearly 400 pages long, so you might as well go the distance and read the original."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dickens' Oliver Twist is, of course, wonderful, deserving all the fame and fondness that it has garnered over the years. I'll instead focus on this Penguins Classics edition, which may interest those looking for a hardcover of the novel. The cover is nicely decorated and textured, the paper is high quality, the introduction and notes are informative, and the illustrations are wonderful. But there are two negatives. First and foremost, the font is smaller than average and a strain on the eyes after a while. I also purchased Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma from the same Penguin series, and their fonts are larger and easier on the eyes--what you would expect in typical hardcovers. I wish they had used the same font here. Second, and again in contrast to the Austen novels, the ink for the marvelous watches on the cover smudges a little, and is (as another reviewer noted) lifted partly off with the sticker on the back. This is not a big deal for me, but may be for others. Otherwise, this is a fine edition that looks great on the shelf and is a pleasure to peruse. Just remember to give your eyes more frequent breaks."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I picked this book up at my local library for a book report. Since I am 14, I didn't expect to really enjoy this book, but I had heard so much about it so I decided to read it. Once I had read the book, I was surprised at how much I liked it! I could not put this book down. There were numerous occasions where I kept wondering what would happen next. I was surprised by the murder. I guess I kind of saw it coming though since Sikes seems as if he has it in him. The trials Oliver goes through in this book really make you think. I was disappointed by Mr. Bumble. He treated Oliver as if he weren't human. All in all, I enjoyed the characters. I give 5 stars to Dickens for writing this novel. He has made me an admirer of his books. Now I truly know why he is such a great author. Everyone should experience this book!"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This is my favorite novel by Charles Dickens. The book hooks you in and is a fascinating page turner from beginning to end. It has loads of adventure, mystery, and drama. It also has a lot of melodrama which reminds me of the old silent movies. Dickens writes about the villainous characters with a great deal of sarcasm, often calling them \\"philosophers.\\" He describes the good characters in angelic terms. I was surprised to read a very virulent description of the Jew Fagin. It reminded me of Nazi propaganda. I got the impression that Fagin's business associates, the merchants who sold the stolen merchandise, were also Jews. This book thoroughly goes over the phenomena of how badly lower class people are treated in their lives. They are constantly abused, verbally and physically, by authority figures. I really wonder what it is about poverty that makes people treat each other so abusively and inhumanely. Some people say Dickens' books are flawed. That doesn't matter whatsoever. The important thing is that Dickens was the greatest storyteller of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This is a review of the Penguin Classics edition of Oliver Twist with the cover designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith. I won't discuss the text here -- except to say that if you like Dickens, this is for you -- just the edition.First of all, it has the full double-handful of Penguin extras: scholarly introduction, author's introduction, notes on the text, a glossary of thieves' terms, a map of 1800s London, alternative text fragments from other editions, and, of course, illustrations.Second, Bickford-Smith's cover is just as lovely as it looks online. The pattern is printed directly onto the cover (rather than on a dust jacket), and if you can't quite tell from the image, it's printed in dark green on creamy white, with a matching green ribbon bookmark.I only have a few issues: one, Amazon put a sticker on the back which slightly removed part of the design when I peeled it off. It was not stuck very tightly, so this makes me a little nervous about how long the design is going to stay on the cover before it starts to rub off. Two, the binding is glued, rather than sewn, which is a little less long-lasting, I think.But on the whole, these are lovely editions, and I think they're well worth the Amazon price. I'm only knocking off the fifth star because of Amazon's sticker on the back."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I wuz robbed! Back in high school I had an English teacher who hated Charles Dickens. He found him dull, boring, wordy, and complained of Dickens' endless descriptions, formulated story telling, length of his books, and endings that were easy to predict. In his class, we focused on Mark Twain, Herman Melville, and Nathaniel Hawthorne, among others. We were never assigned Dickens or expected to read him. And I generally respected the opinions of this teacher, so I refrained from the work of Dickens. Now, many decades later, I read in Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" that \\"Oliver Twist\\" was one of the books he had read in the past three years that he thoroughly enjoyed. So, as we are about the same age, I decided to give it a try. Was my teacher dead wrong! Yes, the book is long, but it certainly isn't boring. Who knew that Dickens had a terrific sense of humor? And as the sarcastic narrator of this tale, he is laugh-out-loud funny. Yes, the book follows a pretty strict formula. But Dickens admits in the telling that he is following the popular style of the day: A chapter of anguish followed by a chapter of relief. Repeat. And each chapter ends with a cliffhanger. But we must remember that Dickens' books first appeared as magazine serializations. And yes, there is a ton of descriptive text, but so well written that I found it interesting. Also, I did know early on how the book was going to end. However, not knowing how Oliver was going to get to that end made the book compelling to read. There are terrific characters within, exciting plot twists, and to top it all, Dickens surprising humor. Now I'm anxious to read more Dickens. I should have started years ago. By the way, in the Penguin Classics version, there is a long Introduction, but writer Philip Horne had the courtesy to warn new readers not to read it because of the \\"spoilers\\" that are included. Also, Horne presents almost 100 pages of notes at the end of the book. Don't let that scare you off. I never had to refer to them."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"It really isn't that hard. I read it during the summer vacation between 6th and 7th grade and I didn't have trouble with anything in it except for the old-style slang.Maybe this isn't Dickens' best novel, but keep in mind, it was one of his first."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The Oliver story is no doubt familiar to you. From films, musicals or abridged versions. Why read the book?Two reasons: Dickens humor and his power of description. His humor is apparent in quotes like: &quot;if the law holds a man responsible for his wifes actions, the law is an ass&quot;. His description of 19th century Londen and of many unforgettable colourfull characters make this book still a joy to read."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Although focusing on the misfortune's of a young protagonist, Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist must not be viewed as a story stictly for adolescents. Dickens, more popular in his time than in modern America, had a subtle way of unveiling the failings and shortcomings of late 19th century English society. It is my belief he hoped to alleviate the misfortunes of everyday life through change by presenting a looking-glass before the English burgeois. What better way to appeal to the decency of man than to present a tortured, half-starved, bright-eyed orphan? Readers will feel a strong sympathy toward Oliver and demand justice. Because justice is done at the close, Dickens succeeds in making his point of the strength of human spirit. He presents hope in a world of despair; sunshine in the fog of London. And although criticized as a &quot;choppy narrative&quot; (this &quot;choppiness&quot; comes stems from the original serialization of the novel) Dickens reminds those of us with a few more years under out lengthening belts, that children, regardless of their lineage, deserve the chance to flourish and will indeed lead productive, honest lives if given love and knowledge rather than hatred and brutality"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Even allowing for the excellent reputation of theEverymans Paperback series, this edition is special.The explanatory notes make the story fully comprehensibleto first-time readers of the novel; and even readers whoconsider themselves experts on Dickens and his times mayfind some suprises ontained therein.

At first they were not to trilled, but as they have read it and get more into it, they can't wait to get to the next chapter."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"It is hard for me to evaluate Charles Dickens.On the one hand, he is a brilliant satirist. His evaluations of \\"self-made men,\\" capitalist theory and empiricism in Hard Times, A Christmas Carol and others are magnificent. His ability to put together a plot, and have it develop into a thrilling finale, like in A Tale of Two Cities, is masterful. His command of the language is top-of-the-line.On the other hand, sometimes Dickens' pacing can feel a little slow, especially in his exposition. The first half of a Dickens novel can be a tough road to hoe, even though the ending is ultimately worth it. Sometimes his plots--in order to have that wonderful conclusion he's known for--are too contrived to be believed. Sometimes his desire to point out social ills outstrips his desire to tell the best story possible.Oliver Twist is a perfectly representative Dickens novel, capturing both the master's strenghts and weaknesses.The satire in Twist is great, showing us the hypocrisy prevalent in the officials running state charities who want to take care of poor people, not to help the poor, but to secure payouts for themselves. The ending of Twist is dynamic, as the thieves and murderers finally get their comeuppance. The writing throughout is engaging and warm.Also, Twist sometimes drags. It drags in the beginning, and throughout, whenever Dickens feels compelled to give us background on the situation. Usually, he's introducing more background in order to pull off all of the coincidences that he needs at the ending. Oliver Twist's ending is very, very contrived.Another feature common to Dickens is having wonderful characters. Twist is archetypal Dickens here, too: Fagin (especially), the Dodger, Master Bates (don't blame me--that's the way it is in the novel!), Sikes, Grimwig, Nancy and others are dynamic and memorable. In fact, my main complaint character-wise is that, compared to all of these interesting characters, Oliver Twist himself gets a little lost; he sort-of goes from situation to situation, observing but not really acting.Oliver Twist, like its author, has its ups and downs. It is certainly worth reading for its merits, but the impatient reader will take warning of its faults--if you're the type who's apt to give up during slow bits, you might not quite make it.Fully three stars."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"For the younger reader exploring Charles Dickens, this abridged version will not be intimidating. It'll help open the door to classic literature, and challenging ideas.\\"Oliver Twist\\" is a complex story about the English welfare system for orphans, overlayed by a story of love, family, and the pursuit of each.What is missing from this version is Dickens' long descriptions and thorough presentations of a situation. What makes Dickens great, in part, is his multi-woven characters, filled with color and excitement. Some of that is lost here.That said, this is an excellent choice for an older child having trouble reading, or the younger, aggressive reader.

It then follows the young boy to London, where he falls in among thieves, who force him to break the law. Oliver is then caught in the act of stealing, and tries to keep his head above water. However, a character named Monks has his own plans for the boy.The end of the book was, by far, the best part of the entire story. The writing style of Charles Dickens baffled and bewildered me countless times, but I did get through it, and unless you're willing to give a lot of thought and effort to this novel, I would not suggest reading it."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Charles Dickens is the best author England ever produced next to Shakespeare. He was simply a literary genius. My copies of Great Expectations and David Copperfiel are my two most valued possessions. I frequently find myself rereading old passages from not only those two novels but from almost all of his works. The one work I reread passages from least often is Oliver Twist. Oliver Twist was somewhat of a dissppointment for me. Yes, it was only his second novel, and he was still experimenting the with medium, and we can't expect masterpieces from a young artist, but the Pickwick Papers and Nicholas Nickleby (the novels he wrote before and after this) were so much better! It was as if he suffered a one novel slump with Oliver. It isn't an awful, unreadable novel, but it isn't a great novel either. There is too much melodrama and the sentimental scenes are atrocious. I did not care much for Oliver, either. All of the novels good scenes come from Fagin and Bill Sikes. The descriptions of Fagin moving stealthily through the London streets and of Sike's reaction to the murder are as good as anything else Dickens wrote. But on the whole the novel should be avoided.

There's a perfect blend of social commentary, long-winded descriptions, plot twists and surprises, and Dickens' satirical voice, which is a surprise if you've just read something more straightforward of his.

We all win here.)So anyway, I enjoyed Oliver Twist immensely and I had difficulty setting it aside to go to bed at night. The suspense and action and twists of fate in every chapter kept me completely enmeshed in the novel. Like, seriously addicted in the evenings. German television's paltry offerings drove me to Dickens, but now I understand how literate people before the mid twentieth century stayed entertained. The text was originally published as serials in a monthly paper so Dickens relied on soap opera suspense techniques to keep readers interested. And his writing has this certain inexplicable, charming quality.That said, both Dickens and Oliver Twist are a little problematic for me. Modernity and the passing years have rendered Dickens a trifle trite and he has become kind of like the Thomas Kincade of literature. He's just oozing sentimentality. And he's safe. Sure, there'll be whores and murders, and drinki'n and thievi'n, but in the end everything is always alright. The good guy always comes out ahead. And your protagonist remains a saint. A sweet, tender-hearted saint who somehow never sours on life. You're not exactly taking any chances with Dickens.For modern readers, sometimes Dickens feels hopelessly outdated. Fagin's absolutely black and white portrayal as an evil Jew street gang leader is appallingly anti-semitic. But, as usual in my head, nothing is ever clear and I'm stuck between admiring Dickens' handiwork in creating such a chilling villain in appearance, deed, and speech and loathing the way he characterizes Fagin as first and foremost a Jew. In fact, most of the time he's simply called the Jew by our narrator and various characters. Can we still like the crafting of a character who is this outdated and wrong? Can we overlook the anti-Semitism? I tend to with, for example, Merchant of Venice, because Shakespeare's portrayal of Shylock is a least a bit more nuanced and sympathetic, but there's nothing redeeming about Fagin. No easy answers on this one, though I don't think we can overlook the positive political impact Dickens' body of work had on the Victorian social code and the political movements and laws they inspired. Dickens is, after all, the guy who practically began the whole notion of Victorian charity and inspired child labor laws.Two of the important characters of this work, providing some comic relief and relatively sophisticated satire are The Beadle, Mr. Bumble, leader of the orphanage and workhouse, and his eventual wife, a manager of the workhouse for the poor. These two, through their dysfunctional marriage and misguided ideals of public service, satirize the banally evil and officious bourgeois who are only concerned with status, title, and their own material comforts. Nancy, one of the female members of Fagin's gang of thieves, is also subtle and well-written and she may actually be one of the only truly round characters in the work."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dickens' famous story of a young orphan's struggle to survive on the streets of London is rightly one of his most remembered.Two outstanding characters have been contributed to literature - Fagin and Jack Dawkins the Artful Dodger.Dickens writes Fagin as a puppet master, controlling the orphaned children as pickpockets and the adults like Bill Sikes as thieves. His subterfuge of a penniless pauper with a kindly approach are at odds with the moments he steals gazing at his hidden stash of jewels and his barking moments of brutality. Though his name is Fagin, Dickens refers to him more often than not as \\"the Jew\\", a label quite jarring in today's culture. Fagin is sinister though and many see him as a devil like character. His many schemes, plans, and selfishness all contribute to the image.The Artful Dodger is a whirling dervish of charisma and charm, teaching Oliver the tricks of the trade and leading the cohorts of youngsters as the ultimate example they should all be aspiring to. Dickens chooses to have the Dodger answer for his crimes as he is finally caught and sent to jail. Tantalisingly, Dickens implies that the Dodger will be deported to Australia though we never see Dodger again after he is led away back to jail. Maybe he was thinking of writing a sequel with him as a grown up character?Oliver is by no means a great character but a likeable one. His tribulations put us on his side early on and his base survival has us enthralled and rooting for him throughout. Bill Sikes isn't also that great a character. A one dimensional thug and bully, his character is indeed menacing and ugly but unfortunately never goes further.Nancy meanwhile is another triumph of characterisation. Dickens shows her kind side, her deceitful side, her desperate life, and ultimately her sacrifice. She longs to stay with her boyfriend Bill Sikes despite his brutality and maintains a cheerful and optimistic disposition throughout the miserable drama. Her life and desires are complex and is one of Dickens' most enduring creations.The overall story of Oliver Twist, of his rise to grace through typically fantastical and novelistic conceits, are but a sideline to the true nature of the book - Dickens' concern and portrayal of society's inhuman treatment of the poor. The book remains important and memorable for this reason. This is probably one of Dickens' most accessible books, a great book and a true classic."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist is the best novel by Dickens.Out of all the very enjoyable books by Dickens, I think Oliver Twist just has that certain wow factor that keeps the reader hooked from page one.This novel, along with The Christmas Carol, are great read alouds that both adults and children can enjoy.I've read this book at least a dozen times, but Oliver Twist seems to get better with time."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Cons: L-O-N-G. As another reviewer stated, if Dickens can say it in 10 words, he'll go with 50.Pros: Strong character development, suspenseful story, interesting social commentary, the Oxford World Classic edition offers a bunch of educational commentary - so, I read it and learned about the laws Dickens didn't care for, the relationship between himself and the illustrator, etc.As an accountant, if something isn't able to hold my interest, I'll put it down and try something else.

Even now when I'm older and wiser, it is still my favorite. (The only thing I didn't like about it from when I was nine was the scary picture of Fagin when he was captured.) The names are great and the exaggerations make it funny. &#34;Mr. Bumble&#34; just makes me laugh, and &#34;Fagin&#34; gives the impression of fangs. Speaking of Fagin, as a Jew, I was upset the first time I read the unabridged version because of Dickens' apparent anti-Semitism in referring to Fagin more as &#34;the Jew&#34; than by his actual name. However I realized that 18th and 19th century England were very anti-Semitic, along with being anti a lot of things besides that, such as the Irish, the Africans, and others.

It is about a young boy named Oliver Twist. He is an orphan who escapes the mean and cheerless workhouse and he goes to the streets in London during the 19th century. This book was very interesting. Charles Dickens wrote this book really well. He made it seem like I was living Oliver's life and going through all the bad and good times he had. When Oliver joined the band of the street urchins and their leader it seemed so fun, I wish I could have been there with them in the pick-pocketing game. When Oliver first got on the streets, he was sad and unhappy, then when he joined that band on the streets, he had alot of fun and laughed alot. Overall,Charles Dickens Oliver Twist tells how it would be like to be an orphan living on the streets. He made it seem so fun and interesting, and sometimes I even felt like I was there. Charles Dickens made me experience the sad parts of what being an orphan might be like. I highly reccommend this book to any Charles Dickens fans."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dicken's novel,Oliver Twist, is a stinging commentary on the class system of Victorian England. The author uses the protagonist, a young orphan,as an archetypical victim of the growing influence of the middle class and its intolerance of the poor. Although Dickens's use of the novel as a vehicle to express his opinion of the social conditions of the time, his writings are extremely drawn out and can sometimes be difficult for the reader to comprehend the plot of the novel. Overall, Oliver Twist gives its readers a valuable insight into the author's view of Victorian England, but one should read the book thoroughly to understand its context."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I had to read it for eng.

Either way the story is still good and that's why I gave it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This really isn't an accurate review. I downloaded this but in the end didn't read it. I heard that it was great from several other people, I just never found the time."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The novel, Oliver Twist, is about a young orphan boy that first grew up on a farm but was later moved to a workhouse but only, to be sent away as an apprentice to an undertaker after he accidently asked for seconds. Everyone in England pretty much treated Oliver as a lesser being and when he was an apprentice for the undertaker, Mr. Sowerberry, his first apprentice, a young charity-boy named Noah Claypole, insulted Oliver's mom and this resulted with Oliver attacking Noah and then later running away to London after he was beat severely by his master. When he arrived in London he had no where to go so, he first sat and rested for a while. Then a boy named John Dawkins a.k.a \\" the Artful Dodger\\" met Oliver and became his friend. Sadly Oliver did not know what he got himself into but, after he was introduced to Dodgers master ,Fagin, the went out on to the streets of London accompanied by Charley Bates. Oliver then noticed that the Dodger and Master Bates were sneaking up on this old man in front of a book shop and, that's when Oliver realized that they were in fact thieves. Quickly Oliver ran away as fast as he could but the old man saw him and shouted \\"thief!!!\\" and soon a large crowd was after Oliver. That is only what happened in the first half of the book. To find out more your gonna have to read it. Over all the book had an excellent storyline and it was very, very detailed. I felt a lot of suspense and drama within the book while I was reading it so, I was always wondering what's gonna happen next and it was hard to put the book down. Sadly though the book had its downers. For one thing half the vocabulary was very hard to read. Also this book went into so much detail that it got off topic for a few minutes several times within the book. It also switches characters several times causing you to end in the middle of a suspenseful part and end up in a boring part that you have no idea what exactly is going on. All in all the book was fairly well written and I would recommend it to people older than 16."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The book Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens and the movie Oliver Twist directed by David Lean have many similarities and differences. I think the movie was great but the book sometimes wandered away from the main storyline and Oliver but overall it was great.The book and the movie were very different. In the book, Sikes commits suicide and hangs himself before they could catch him but in the movie a person shoots him off the roof when he tries to escape with Oliver. I think the book's version is better because it was much more dramatic. Another difference is that in the book Fagin is hanged but in the movie he is spared. I think that the movie is better because Oliver saw that Fagin wasn't that evil but was just too greedy. Oliver Twist helped free Fagin from the authorities. Another big difference is that in the book Monk is a mysterious figure that is one of Oliver's enemies that woks with Fagin but in the movie, Monk isn't even mentioned. I think that the movie's version was better because monk was too mch of a shadowy character. He dragged the book on and on with boring scenes. As you can see, the movie and the book are very different.The movie also had many similarities. In both of them, Oliver's mother and father are unknown characters and Oliver Twist is sent to a parish workhouse. In both movie and book, he asked for more gruel. The leaders of the parish workhouse did like that and thought that signified that Oliver Twist was greedy. They sent him away to be an apprentice of a coffin maker. After he was teased about his mother and been to his first funeral, Oliver decided that he didn't like it there so he ran away. He joined a street gang in London. This happen in both book and movie. Another similarity is that in the end, the good rules over the bad. Fagin and Sikes both are captured in the end and Oliver goes to live with his kind and loving grandfather. It was a happy ending. As you can see, the movie and the book are also the similar.If I were a scriptwriter, I would change many things of the movie. First I would put Monk back in the story. I would also change the beginning where it begins in a storm. I would change the beginning right to when Oliver Twist as a baby is born. It wouldn't seem like it would be dragging the movie for as long as it could with useless scenes. I also would have changed the scene in the end where the giant mob of people rush against the gang of thieves to find Oliver. I would have made it more dramatic. It seemed like it was so easy to just take a giant piece of wood and hammer down a solid reinforced door. I would have made people with ladders climb up to the room and get in through a window while they try to crash open the door. It shouldn't be this gigantic wave of people either. They should have tried to enter without them noticing and quickly rescue him. Also when Sikes tries to cut across the roof with Oliver, I would have made a more exciting scene instead of Sikes being easily shot down. I think that the movie was generally too dreary. It dragged on about everything.Oliver Twist the book and Oliver Twist the movie are really great and exciting but both could use some changes. The book kept on dragging everything on and the movie was too dull."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This is a excellent book about a 9 year old orphan at a Workhouse who decides to ask for more food.Of course,workhouses are EXTREMLY strict and cruel,so they make Oliver be sold.I'm not going to say anything else or I'll give the plot away and I cant do that."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Its tough to be a single mother even now. Years ago in England it was no better. Agnes Fleming, Oliver's mother did not survive the birth of her illegitimate child. Though she had a wedding ring on, as circumstances fell in, all evidence of Oliver's paternal identity was deleted.Charles Dickens in his own way has portrayed the dilemmas of an orphan boy. It is in his suffering and experiences does the book achieve a universal significance.The Story in shortOliver Twist is born in a workhouse. An orphan, we follow his ordeals along with other orphans who are ill fed. When Oliver asks for more food he is severely chastised. Oliver's experience as an apprentice to an undertaker is even hideous.When at that man's place he fights a boy almost double his age called Noah Claypole, we for the first time realize that Oliver is a survivor.Oliver runs away and comes across such characters called Charlie Bates and the Artful Dodger. They are actually a part of a ragged pick-pocking gang lead by Fagin the miser. Thus Oliver becomes Fagin's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He learns the art of the gang and gets caught one day. Luckily he falls under the care of his real life aunt Rose Maylie and the kind Mr. Brownlow.But even then its not the end of his troubles as his past catches up with him. Monks his half brother wants to take a revenge. Bill Sikes another criminal, too is after him. But alls well that ends well. The Fagin gang is nabbed, Bill Sikes is killed and Oliver's true identity is revealed.CharactersCharles Dickens' novels generally have a variety of characters. But the one which actually struck me in this book is that of Nancy. Nancy is a criminal much like \`Moll Flanders' but her motherly instincts gets the better of her. Her mother scene till haunts me. Fagin is another study in crime much like the ruthless murderer Sikes and the Psycho type Monks.SocietyYou get a picture of the day. The position of women, the condition in the workhouses, child labour, class differences along with the obscure world of crime.There is also some relief from the tension in the love story of Rose and Harry.The AuthorThey say that \`David Copperfield' is autobiographical. Well you will find generous amount of similarities here.The EndYou may never know what you may find. Oliver finds that his past is neither so hidden nor so shameful as he has been led to believe. So clouds do have silver linings !"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The classic story of a boy named Oliver who joins a gang of thieves, who's leader is a man named Fagin.

The characters are by far the most beautiful part about this novel. Each one of them represents a different attitude and different style of living, and they seem so realistic in what they say and do that it's almost as if you know them in real life. It's also very interesting to find out how life used to work back then, in Dickens's time. However, like any other book, there are some ups and downs, but most of the story is high in the clouds, so don't let that stop you from reading it. I guarantee you that after you read this book, you will feel a slight bit of satisfaction of reading one of the most popular books in history."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I was looking forward to reading this story in \\"episodes\\".

Now the experience is ruined for me. At the very least, Amazon, give the user a choice to download the next chapter early rather than ruin the serial experience by lumping everything together."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The young genius Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was still publishing monthly installments of \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" when he began writing Oliver Twist.What a tale! Young Oliver is born in the workhouse to a mother who dies giving him birth. He is apprenticed to the undertaker Sowerby; fights with one of the undertakers idiotic apprentices Noah Claypool; flees to London and comes into the clutches of the evil Fagin arch pickpocket. In this den of thieves we meet such unforgettable characters as the Artful Dodger; the despicable Bill Sikes and his mistress Nancy.There are also many good people who populate the many pages of this novel. The Maylie family especially young Rose who rescue Oliver after he is injured in a foiled robbery escapade are helpful to the young waif. Mr. Brownlow is also a rescuer who eventually adopts Oliver. This novel is a fine bildungsroman as we follow child Oliver on his tempestuous journey through the London streets.Oliver Twist contains many scenes which are film worthy. These scenes include the flight of Bill Sikes from the London mob following his murder of Nancy; Fagin's last hours in Newgate Prison prior to his being hanged;the vivid descriptions of nineteenth century London and pastoral scenesof beauty. The portrait of Oliver's half-brother Monks is well drawn.The novel is not perfect. It relies too much on coincidence to be realistic. It is if you will a fairy tale but a great one!"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The story of Oliver Twist, written by Charles Dickens, is a classic bildungsroman, about the difficulties a child had to endure to survive in the 1800's. Dickens satirizes the atrocious trait of human selfishness by illustrating how it comprises ones humanity as the helpless and vulnerable are victimized for personal gain. Oliver Twist is an orphan from a small village not far from London, who is forced into social conventions by a city council. He escapes his horrible captor, a woman who steals food money for her personal use, but unfortunately lands in the hands of a criminal mastermind, who forces him to pickpocket in the London streets. He luckily is taken under the loving care of a family who gains the information of Oliver's previous captor. Many scenes are dedicated to the fallout of this criminal family which proves that with a positive environment, people are able to succeed in life. Oliver Twist has been around for nearly 200 years and I found it a very good novel, not only for its content but also for its moral truths. It is interesting because it allows children and young adults to imagine what life was like back then and to contrast their lives to Oliver's. This realization allows the reader to see that some people have more difficult lives then others and to not take advantage of them."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I'm a junior in high school and I had to read Dickens's novel in my sophmore year. I liked it. It's my favorite book. When I first read it though, I wasn't looking forward to it. Dickens writes too much and uses a lot of big words. The entire first paragraph is practically one big sentence of how the name of the town Oliver was born in is not important. That's not a very good way to start a book a high school student has to read. The best parts of the book are with Fagin's gang, anything not about that tends to get boring."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The last time I read this novel was because it was required for high school English. And I must admit that I do not remember the story of the nine-year-old orphan being such a wonderful story. It was with some trepidation that I picked up the novel some 10 years later, but I am so glad I did. This is truly a great tale.Most people know the story of the young orphan who rises above his station to become a rather well-off young man. If you've never read the story, I'm sure you've seen a commercial or other show where a young ragamuffin stands with a bowl outstretched, and plaintively states, \\"Please, sir, I want some more.\\" What most do not probably know is just how hard it is for young Oliver to make the transition from rags to riches. Dickens goes into great detail over the trials Oliver faces, of which there are many. He is nearly starved, ridiculed constantly, runs away, is \\"befriended\\" by a gang of thieves, nearly tossed in jail, nearly saved by some wealthy new friends, kidnapped by his thieving \\"friends\\", nearly turned into a thief himself, shot . . . . Needless to say, it is definitely a very long and very trying life that Oliver leads prior to ultimately claiming his birthright.Dickens does an amazing job of painting Oliver as the sweet young innocent with a heart of gold. As well, his descriptions of the thieves and poor tend to reflect a belief that once one slides toward the path of destruction, it is nearly impossible to return. This belief is clearly reflected in the ultimate fate of each sinister character in the story. This fatalism was not suprising, and can be expected from most of Dickens work. What I was surprised to find, however, was just how humorous the novel is. Dickens depicted his characters, and their often-times immense ignorance of the real world, in such plain language, that the reader cannot help but laugh at the idiocy of their beliefs and self-importance. It adds an extra Oomph to an already amazing story."},{"Title":"One Giant Leap - Love Poems","review":"That is what this book is all about, love and respect.

This is a work of love, frequently bordering poetry. Yet, it is a scientific book of high class. Hermann Weyl, one of the very great mathematicians of this century, then explains the mathematics behind symmetry, mostly group theory, and obtains all forms that, by repetition, completely fill the plane and the space (the crystallographic groups). This is wonderful reading. After it, the reader should be prepared for a beautiful recent discovery by R. Penrose, that there are aperiodical forms that completely fill the space, and, still more surprising, that Nature makes use of them. They are the quasi-crystals (not treated in Weyl's book, of course)."},{"Title":"Symmetry","review":"Be forewarned this book is technical and mathematical. Though you can definitely read it without going through all the math and thinking it through it won't be nearly as valuable to you as it would be if you spent some time and actually thought things out and figured them out rather than just speeding through. That being said this is probably the best examination of symmetry out there that I have read. Weyl starts from very simple concepts and eventually works his way up to examining even complex ornamental symmetry. Of course much of what he says about symmetry is true of aesthetics and beauty in general and many parallels can be drawn between what he is saying and other items like music that may not appear to have clear symmetry right off the bat. Unfortunately in the version I have the citations that Weyl makes are not clearly listed, but many of the authors are fairly prominent and easy to look up. If you like this book I might also reccomend G. D. Birkhoff's Aesthetic Measures. Where, Weyl is interested more in just symmetry Birkhoff is interested in mathematical aesthetic examination in general. Overall this book is a must read for anyone interested in aesthetics."},{"Title":"Symmetry","review":"Symmetry is about the mathematical underpinnings of symmetry as it appears in nature and art. The book is divided into 4 sections, the first Bilateral Symmetry covers reflection. This lecture goes into biology and art. The next lecture is about rotational symmetry. I was able to follow the math presented in this lecture but had trouble in the 3rd lecture titled Ornamental Symmetry. Ornamental symmetry is mostly about tilings of the plane. There is a lot of math presented in this lecture. I had to fall back on my rudimentary knowledge or abstract algebra and linear algebra to understand it. My point is that without this knowledge this lecture and the next one The General Idea of Mathematical Symmetry would have been impossible for me to follow. However, I still recommend this book to people who don't have any of the above background. Symmetry covers the concepts behind symmetry well, and it's applications to nature and art can be followed by anyone."},{"Title":"Symmetry","review":"Symmetry is a fundamental characteristic of most living creatures, some natural features such as crystals, the basis of some mathematical models and a beautiful form of art. Most animals possess a form of bilateral symmetry, with only minor differences our right and left sides are mirror images of each other. Weyl gives examples of all of these types of symmetry, images with text explaining the details regarding the symmetry of the object.At the end, he gives the mathematical explanations of the symmetries, how they can be combined into the construct known as a group. The symmetries can then be sequentially combined to perform multiple actions and generate other actions. This dual examination provides a great deal of insight into the idea of symmetry. Biologically, it is clear that there must be powerful evolutionary advantages to symmetry, as it is universal in the animal kingdom. Humans also have a natural affinity for symmetric objects, as symmetry is a universal theme in the art work of cultures with little or no contact between them.Weyl has written an excellent introduction to the concept of symmetry. It is an idea that is easy to understand and the different motions of a symmetric object are a very good way to begin the study of group theory. Artists can also obtain some benefit from the additional knowledge of symmetry that they will get from this book."},{"Title":"Symmetry","review":"Very well written introductory book to symmetry-group theory notionsconcise and thought provoking lacking some modern notions and strong mathematical deductionsCan be read from high scool studentsan easy pace book ideal for a first contact with the subject"},{"Title":"Symmetry","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It offers very deep insights on the use and implications of symmetry, not only in art, but in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. It also provides a comprehensive mathematical treatment at an accessible level. The reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is that sometimes the mathematical steps were not fully spelled out, or the explanation was vague, so a few passages left me wondering what he really means. More examples, figures, and details would have helped. Still, it was an exciting read - for the first time I really understood the theory of relativity and what it means in terms of symmetry. The author also impresses with his breadth of knowledge, being equally comfortable with the latest mathematical methods as he is with historical development of the field, all the way back to the Egyptians and Greeks. The book is fairly slim and I read it fast, yet learned a lot."},{"Title":"Symmetry","review":"One of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. Not very long. Requires some knowledge of basic geometry. Good intro book."},{"Title":"Symmetry","review":"Hermann Weyl was a mathematical giant of the twentieth century, and nowhere was his influence more profoundly felt than in his work on the applications of group theory to the physical sciences.This book, compiled from a lecture series Professor Weyl gave just prior to his retirement from the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, provides a nice introduction to these ideas, but also waxes philosophical at times which makes it an interesting read even for the knowledgeable student.This book is filled with greyscale pictures which provide examples of precise types of symmetry in both art and nature. In many ways, it is these pictures which make the book so suitable for beginners in the discipline of symmetry.Group theory is the mathematical language of symmetry, and the first chapter of this book discusses bilateral symmetry in depth. This is the simplest and more familiar of all symmetry types as it is present in our own bodies.Professor Weyl also spends a good amount of time discussing the inherent bilateral symmetry of the universe and the laws of physics. This is an inadvertent source of entertainment as a few years later it was discovered that contrary to all the evidence and philosophical inclinations in this direction , it is actually not so. Weak nuclear interactions lack bilateral symmetry.Oddly, this makes the universe even more like our own bodies which also appear to have bilateral symmetry until you really get inside of them.The second chapter covers translational and rotational symmetries and provides many examples both from art and nature.The third chapter discusses ornamental symmetries which are essentially two dimensional lattice symmetries.The final chapter introduces crystals and the mathematics of symmetries in general.There are also a couple of appendices which provide some additional mathematical details on a couple of points.This book is widely considered to be a classic, and as I said is chock full of pictures illustrating various types of symmetries in nature, art, and even in mathematics itself.I'd recommend this book to just about anyone with a smidgeon of curiosity. Many of the ideas on the mathematical side lack any appreciable development, and so this book reads a bit like a sightseeing tour, which I'm sure is exactly what Professor Weyl intended.Widely referenced. Excellent reading. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Symmetry","review":"This is a tough read for an amateur, but still worth the effort.

You HAVE to finish it. you have to find out who is pulling the strings behind all the bad things happening to the richest man in town, Reginald Spencer. The man who owns the plant that supports the town and has been laying off LOTS of workers.You HAVE to follow the work of Jim Stanton, newly widowed, and his new partner, Shelly McGuire, as they put the pieces together. You MUST know if the killers are smarter and more determined that the detectives following them.Out of Nowhere is not a \\"cozy\\" read. If you like sunshine and sweetness in your mysteries--well, you won't find much of that in this book. The killers are brutal, the descriptions can be graphic. I found it hard to decide which of the two killers was the most frightening--loose cannon Cooper(who LOVES blood-and inflicting pain)or cold-so very cold- Cutter(who kills because it's his job and he does it without emotion).Mr. Miller displays his knowledge of the police scene effectively. The politics of police work show up in Stanton's dealings with his superiors and with the mayor and Reginald Spencer. Stanton tries to do his job in spite of interference from higher ups.A real highlight of the novel is the byplay between Jim and Shelly as they move from antagonism to teamwork to a hint of something more personal. Shelly McGuire is a wonderful character! Her wit, intelligence and courage add a great deal to the story. Her no-holds-barred approach to life fills the book with enery and a great deal of excitement. She is definitely an asset to Jim Stanton's work on the case.Reginald Spencer is being blackmailed by a person unknown. He has been ordered to call back all of the workers he laid off in an attempt to save his failing business. When he doesn't move fast enough to sulit the disembodied voice on the phone--people die in horrible ways. First, but not last, is his only son who is a victim of the two hired killers--in spite of professional security protection.Spencer is reluctant to lose his fortune and people pay for his reluctance. He tries to run and tries to hide but he's being watched. Will he pay the final price? Stanton and McGuire struggle against the unknown mastermind as well as the deadly killers.Out of Nowhere is full of twists, turns and surprises. There is a great deal of depth to the story. The characters are real--even the evil ones. Miller brings Cutter to life(if that word can be used for someone so cold and deadly). We see part of the story from Cutter's point of view. We see how and why he works. We delve into the madness of Cooper's bloodlust. We see the struggle of good against evil in the battle of wills between Cutter and Stanton. And we're not sure which will win.I found my emotions and my intellect involved in this book. I liked Stanton and Shelly(actually, I loved Shelly!) I felt revulsion and fear for the behavior of Cooper and Cutter. And I really disliked Reginald Spencer for being the creep he was. I hope to see Jim and Shelly again.(hint, hint, Mr. Miller)"},{"Title":"Out of Nowhere","review":"Talented author, Tim Miller, provides another fascinating read with his newest thriller OUT OF NOWHERE.

When Reginald doesn't respond soon enough to please the voice,his only son Aaron Spencer is killed in a unique manner. But Reginald still has not rehired enough of theworkers that had to be let go for the financial survival of the company. He then loses his only daughter.Cooper and Cutter, the hired killers, don't know who the voice belongs to either, they just know he paysvery well, so they follow his orders to the letter. They receive the orders over the phone, and when the job isdone they find the money in a designated area. What could be simpler?Cutter likes to finish the job cleanly and leave, but Cooper is a sadistic slice-and-dice man who likes to takehis time until the last gurgle emanates. He kills not only for profit, but in his spare time he kills just for thefun of it. No, not for gratis, no one has hired him for these fun seeking sojourns. It's simply for his pleasure.Detectives Jim Stanton and his partner Shelly McGuire are with the Wright Valley Police Departmentworking the violent crimes unit. They knew this one was going to be a hard case to work on when they learnedthe victim was Reginald Spencer's son, and in particular after learning how Aaron died. They could not havebeen more right.This is Mr. Miller's second bone-chilling novel. It starts off with a bang - - uh, no, sorry, it starts with -- well never mind, you'll see; it's just what it takes to capture your full attention and hold it to the last page.You know the characters. They are everyone, yet no one. You see them in your neighborhood, stores,malls, hanging around airports, anyplace you might go. They are that real in the story, along with plenty ofaction to keep you reading.Mr. Miller is an excellent writer who knows how to make his characters come out of the book at you,or you are pulled into the book with them.

However, if you really want to go wrong with almost any language, start by using a dictionary as a study tool!

If you just want to look up words, there are free online dictionaries such as the one at kamusi.org. This dictionary doesn't tell you the noun classes of nouns, which is a severe shortcoming; it means that after looking up a word, you won't be able to tell how to use it grammatically in a sentence, unless you can guess its noun class from its form. Usually you can guess, but I can't imagine how I would have known, for example, that \\"suruali\\" (trousers) was class 9 rather than, say, class 5. The only way you'd find that out would be by finding that information somewhere else than in this dictionary. Someone who knows a lot of Swahili may be fairly successful at guessing (e.g., \\"anga,\\" \\"sky\\" is probably class 5 because it refers to a place and a natural phenomenon), but I don't believe that any non-native speaker could guess in all cases, and this will be a particularly tough barrier for beginners.In general, the entries only provide extremely skeletal information. For example, nowhere in the entries for \\"hungry\\" or \\"hunger\\" does it tell you that the idiom for \\"to be hungry\\" is \\"kuwa na njaa\\" (to have hunger). The entry for \\"tungamo\\" tells you that it translates as \\"mass,\\" but without giving any other information. \\"Mass\\" can mean a lot of things: mass communication, a cancerous mass, the mass of an object. If you then flip to the English-Swahili section and look up \\"mass,\\" you won't find any clarification, because the only noun listed as a translation back into Swahili is \\"wingi,\\" which means something different.So if you're sitting at a desk with an internet connection, I don't think you're likely to find this dictionary the most useful resource -- but if you're traveling, it's far too bulky to carry around.I'm a native English speaker, so I don't need the pronunciations given for the English word, but they look a little odd. They all seem to be given for a particular British dialect, so, e.g., \\"stair\\" is shown as two syllables, \\"ste\\"+schwa. I checked with a British English speaker who seemed to speak a pretty standard, educated London dialect, and she pronounced \\"stair\\" as one syllable. I'm sure the pronunciations given here are correct for some dialect in England -- maybe it's the \\"received pronunciation\\" dialect of British English that used to be considered the \\"Queen's English?\\" East African users of this dictionary should be aware that many of the pronunciations are nothing like what you would hear in Texas or Scotland, and not even necessarily the same as in London."},{"Title":"Swahili-English, English-Swahili Practical Dictionary (Hippocrene Practical Dictionary)","review":"This dictionary is practical, and inexpensive (relatively speaking) and in print and available.

The premise of the story is their inability to communicate verbally with each other and the havoc it causes. Duped monetarily by her friend during a business venture, June withdraws into herself becoming insecure and depressed. Matt saves the day for June but with her lack of trust in human beings, she cannot see the forest for the trees. Why would Matt make good on someone else's duplicity?This is my first time reading a romance novel by Doris Johnson and I found it delightful and somewhat different. Johnson's locales are serene and made for romance; she highlights large houses that are used to board multiple people, i.e., bed and breakfast type homes and she showcases nontraditional occupations. One concept that is familiar is the family theme running through the book, which is refreshing. Several couples and their relationship issues are touched upon which adds a nice flavor to the novel, giving you a different take on the personalities at play and their resolve. Add brooding males, strong willed females and other humorous characters and MIDSUMMER MOON becomes a pleasurable reading experience.Reviewed by Dawn R.

It shows the side of military life not shown on the news. In short, the author was an American World War 2 soldier stationed in the jungles of Liberia. His 1000-man contingent was assigned with defending the Firestone Rubber plantations from Nazi attack. The soldiers broke up the monotony of jungle life with run-ins with local wildlife and villagers, especially the local women. The ensuing tales of prostitution, debauchery, nonsense, and high jinx make this one of the more entertaining theatres of WWII. I highly recommend this book for light reading."},{"Title":"Belles of Shangri-La, The","review":"The Belles of Shangri-La is a memoir by a white U.S. Army doctor stationed with black American soldiers in Liberia during WWII. They were protecting a Firestone rubber plantation and Roberts Field, a transport air base.Memoirs like this one provide the only look available at small bits of American military life. Generally, they are privately published and done many years after the fact at the request of friends or family.Two other examples areKorea Between the Wars: A Soldier's StoryandVieques Island: A Few Good Men on Radio Hill.Korea Between the Wars: A Soldier's Story, by Fred Ottoboni, is a memoir about a young man serving during the post war US military occupation of what became the Republic of Korea.Vieques Island: A Few Good Men on Radio Hill, by Theo Bennett, is a recently written memoir about a young marine serving on Vieques Island 50 years ago.There are many books available about WWII, the Korean War and the Cold War but you won't find many about GIs in Liberia, the 1945-48 US military occupation of Korea, or serving on Vieques Island.I appreciate the service done by the authors of these books in writing them.

Within the paradigm shared by Warren, academicians should look more at the interplay and fusion of native and African cultures in the history of South America in the past 500 years."},{"Title":"Psychoanalyzing the twelve zodiacal types","review":"Originally published in 1929, Hall's Psychoanalyzing the Twelve Zodiacal Types is a somewhat misleading title. By reading Halls other works, one will gather he has a solid understanding of human psychology. But this book does not venture too far into the psychological world, and for the most part remains an astrology book more than a psychology book. The book is laid out typically, with each sign getting its own chapter, and in groups according to their class (i.e. cardinal, fixed, common). I feel that the descriptions for each zodiac is not too far from what you would find in other well written (and understood) astrology books. This book is concise and to the point and makes no claims of right/wrong, better/worse. The use of this book is more for those who are practicing nativities and the like and who are, perhaps, looking for an alternate means of assimilating information. The zodiacal descriptions are all based on the Sun sign which must be considered when making an accurate reading of a horoscope. While the information in the book is probably just as accurate as most other authorities, I would not say this book is a neccessity."},{"Title":"Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology: Information-processing theory","review":"The information-processing theory is associated with the development of high-speed computers in the 1950s. Researchers-most notably Herbert Simon and his colleagues-demonstrated that computers could be used to simulate human intelligence. This development led to the realization that computer-oriented information-processing models could provide new insight into how the human mind receives, stores, retrieves, and uses information. The information-processing theory was one of several developments that ended the decades-long dominance of behaviorism in American psychology. It focused on innate mental capacities, rather than on conditioned, externally observable behavior. By enabling experimental psychologists to test theories about complex mental processes through computer simulation, information-processing models helped reestablish internal thought processes as a legitimate area of scientific inquiry.The information-processing theory of human cognition encompasses several basic stages. Information received from external or internal stimuli is inputted through the senses and transformed by a variety of mental operations (including representation by symbols). It receives attention through the perceptual processes and is stored in either short-term or long-term memory, where it interacts with previously stored information to generate a response, or output. These stages may take place in a number of different arrangements. The simplest is the serial model, in which the stages occur in succession like a chain reaction, with the output of each stage becoming the input of the succeeding one. However, stages can also occur simultaneously, a phenomenon known as parallel processing. Serial and parallel processing can also be combined in what are known as hybrid models. Another important characteristic of information-processing models is resource allocation-the way in which energy is distributed in the system. This refers to the fact that the efficiency of each stage in the process may depend on whether certain other stages are operating at the same time.One of the many areas investigated through the use of information-processing models is human error. Errors that occur during the early stages of processing, such as misunderstandings, are called mistakes, as distinguished from slips, which occur during the selection or execution of responses. The increased understanding of error provided by information-processing models has been useful in eliminating a variety of technical and industrial problems by isolating and addressing their causes. Those problems classified as mistakes often involve the size of an information load and the way it is handled, while slips are commonly remedied by redesigning instruments and equipment so they can be used more efficiently.Another area that has been investigated using information-processing theory is reaction time-the amount of time needed to respond to a stimulus in a particular situation. Reaction time is an important feature in the design of automobiles and many other products. Factors influencing reaction time include complexity of the decision required before action can be taken; stimulus-response compatibility (the physical convenience of the reaction); expectancy (it takes longer to respond to an unexpected stimulus); and the relative importance of speed and accuracy in the required response.For Your InformationJohnson-Laird, Philip N.

Emphasis throughout the text is on the dynamic properties of nerve cells, their specificities of behavior, and the aberrations which result from lesions, genetic variation and enviromental factors. Some experiments undertaken on the peripheral nervous system are also described, as certain principles deriving from them often relate to central neural problems.Neuroscientists will appreciate the author's critical approach to experimental studies in which technical limitations are pointed out and interpretations are aften qualified or debated, and will be especially interested in his discussion of the latest work in many rapidly advancing areas such as enviromental influences on visual responsiveness. Students without much background in neurobiology will find the two introductory chapters, the three chapters on nerve cell biology and techniques used in the field, the part introductions, and the chapter summaries most useful in providing a foundation for understanding the experimental work."},{"Title":"Ancient Wisdom, New Spirit: Investigations into the Nature of \\"Being\\"","review":"This book is &quot;an endeavor of authentically investigating the depth and scope of the nature of &quot;being.&quot;&quot; How would a person go about doing that? Mr. Ralston answers in the following way. &quot;To the best of my ability my work has always supported a genuine look into our own &quot;event&quot; - uncovering the principles and dynamics that determine our experience of self, body, relationship, interaction, life, and reality. As you may well imagine, such an undertaking would assume many forms and involve a lot of experimentation. It's not an investigation or a communication that happens overnight. It takes dedicated work and serious mind-challenging considerations.&quot; I liked this book because we read transcribed tapes of live seminars where students struggle to comprehend their own &quot;event&quot; via dialogues with Peter Ralston. Questions are the method Peter uses to explore that which can not be explained logically. The investigation takes you beyond the rational and irrational into the realm of paradox. Whether you are an advanced student or a beginner this book is an excellent place to ground your search. There is a breadth and depth to the material that allows for multiple readings and contemplations. If you have come this far - looked up the book, read the review and are still undicided - assume that I'm incompetent as a reviewer. You have come to close to the treasure to turn and walk away now. Seize this book and investigate who you are. Honestly, what else is there?"},{"Title":"Ancient Wisdom, New Spirit: Investigations into the Nature of \\"Being\\"","review":"While I immensely enjoyed Ralston's other books I think that this one fails to deliver. The &quot;principles&quot; book clearly laid out guidlines that could be practiced. The &quot;tui shou&quot; book did likewise for push hands. However, in this book Ralston abandons his earlier &quot;grounded in the physical&quot; approach and delves into the ontological/mental discoveries he's made over the years. In my opinion, these discussions will make no sense to someone not involved in the physical practice that he teaches because you need the practice to provide a context in which to understand the material. Even for one with an internal arts/philosophy background I find his discussions difficult to follow. It's almost as if he has something great to communicate but hasn't figured out how to transmit it yet. This is reflected in his interaction with students in the book. This book also reflects a recent trend in taiji which is to get caught up in over-intellectualizing the practice. If you're doing more reading and thinking than practicing you'll never get anywhere. For someone taking his classes this might be a valuable resource but for others I would suggest they look to his other books for insight."},{"Title":"Ancient Wisdom, New Spirit: Investigations into the Nature of \\"Being\\"","review":"Ancient Wisdom is a great book, one that can be read again and again and again. It's a lot like the Tao Te Ching, but more fun (and more rewarding for and demanding of the reader). Peter Ralston's communication style really comes across throughout the book. It's more personal and light hearted than some of his other works, but is still razor sharp and relentless in its purpose. It's not one of those books that you read and then say, \\"Oh yeah, I read that one. The answers are all on page 452.\\" It's one of those books that illustrates a process of discovery and that asks questions of the reader which can be used as vehicles (such as chissels and catapults) for real personal change. It's not necessary to have a background in martial arts or philosophy or whatever to make good use of this book. In fact, that stuff would probably get in the way if you try to filter the communication of the book through those paradigms. A willingness to understand more about yourself is all you need to read Ancient Wisdom. I will say that if you have ever worked with Peter directly you will probably enjoy the book even more, but don't let that scare you away from it if you haven't. One of the great things about Peter is his willingness to communicate with those who want to get to the bottom of something. I don't think he would mind me saying that you can always send him an email if you have something come up for you from reading and contemplating Ancient Wisdom (or The Book of Not Knowing or any of the others). That's part of what makes this book better (or at least more accessable) than the Tao Te Ching. It's a communication. A dialogue. You can email Peter Ralston or go to a seminar and get great feedback. Lao Tsu's a lot harder to get in touch with!"},{"Title":"Ancient Wisdom, New Spirit: Investigations into the Nature of \\"Being\\"","review":"Ever wonder what those zen people are getting after with their koans? What they are looking for in their sessins? Ralston sweeps aside all the traditional tomfoolery and dives right into the heart of the matter. With brilliance and subtlety he finds distinctions where others cannot or perhaps will not. What is most remarkable is his absolute honesty. This man is intent on saying what IS true, regardless of how hard it is to swallow. This book is a series of dialogues between Ralson and his students. Get this book and sincerely throw yourself into it. Then get ready for \\"AHA!\\" butt clenching realizations that will leave you and your self experience forever transformed. Its hard work, all done by you, but I cannot communicate the depth and power of these teachings. When is the last time a book truly transformed you? I hope you choose to study Ralstons teachings, but even if you dont, BE happy friends."},{"Title":"Lust for Life","review":"The back cover makes this book sound like an entirely different book than it actually is. Whoever wrote the synopsis for the back cover should be fired because it sounds nothing like the book that I read, except for maybe one or two things that did happen in the book. It makes it sound like it's mainly about two sisters but it's actually about one sister and her sexual exploits with a hot guy and another sister thrown in every 10 pages or so.Martha is the main character in here. We get to read how perfect she and her life is for a little while. Then her husband leaves her and the whining about that goes on for quite a long time. Nothing interesting happens in that time except for Martha falling apart. Then Martha goes to a salsa club and meets Jack. Then the mind-blowing sex they have is written in every detail several times. In some ways, I have a hard time believing that Martha is the best mother, like Adele Parks wants us to believe. I mean, it seems Martha is out every night with Jack and when they're not out at different places, then they're having sex all over Martha's house with Martha's two children and Martha's sister in the house. Of course we have a couple scenes thrown in so we think Martha is just the best.We also have what seems to be the same phone conversations between Martha and her ex husband, Michael. Those conversations consist of Martha whining and asking why he left and Michael is always distant and snobby. It got to be old really fast. Yet another thing that kept on repeating was the conversation between Eliza and Martha, in which Eliza would say how Jack was just going to break Martha's heart and Martha going on and on about how he makes her feel young and she won't fall in love with him and just how he's the perfect guy. I wish whoever edited this book would have cut some of those conversations out because it was just the same thing over and over and the reader only needs to read it once to get how Eliza stands about Jack.I really didn't care for the character of Martha, if you couldn't tell already. At first, she just seems too rigid and then after Jack, she acts like a teenager even though she still has responsibities. There was just nothing for me to connect with and therefore I didn't root for her at all. The book also goes on and on about how she feels and after awhile, I just started to scan the pages until I found anything semi-interesting to read.Eliza, the other sister, gets very little space in this book. It's almost like her story is an afterthought. In the beginning she is shown as the wild child of the two sisters. But then Eliza decides it's time to grow up and so she dumps the guy who she feels is to immature for her. The rest of the book, Eliza is pretty much the baby-sitter to Martha's children and the person Adele Parks' puts in when she needs someone to argue with Martha. Before and when there's a lull in Martha's sexploits, Eliza goes on a few dates but the men she goes out with are all wrong. There's really no middle to Eliza's story-just a beginning and an end.I would not recommend this book to anyone. \\"In her shoes\\" is a much better book about the relations between sisters. \\"Lust for life\\" or \\"The other woman's shoes\\" as it was published in the UK, is just a wannabe compared to Jennifer Weiner's \\"In her shoes\\". I also have \\"Larger than Life\\" by Adele Parks, which I haven't read yet but I'm hoping it's quite a bit better than \\"Lust for Life\\"."},{"Title":"Lust for Life","review":"This book had me scratching my head, wondering how it got published. There was nothing to sustain it for the first two hundred pages apart from two events, Eliza leaves her lover and her sister Martha gets dumped by her husband. So I waded through that bit hoping for something a bit more interesting than descriptions of Martha cleaning up after the kids and drinking her woes away and Eliza going on dull dates with dull men.But the only thing that happened after that was that Martha met a two dimensional prat called Jack who had a big penis and that apparently was the cure all for being heartbroken. After that I stopped reading, because frankly I was bored. Sorry Adele, your characters are about as believable as those in a day time soap."},{"Title":"Lust for Life","review":"Ok, I realize novels aren't necessarily realistic. And perfect-looking marriages do break up unexpectedly and for no apparent reason. But how often does a perfect, gorgeous man willing to take on a divorcee and her two small children show up immediately? Even if it happens, it's not interesting. Even worse is the other sister's dilemma... she wants a mature responsible husband instead of her flighty Peter Pan boyfriend. In the end she gives up and settles for the boyfriend, who has not changed at all. She apparently needs more self-esteem or she would not accept the unacceptable. Does anyone learn or grow in this book? It seems Martha doesn't have to, and Eliza just regresses. A depressing book, which doesn't ring true to real life."},{"Title":"Lust for Life","review":"Eliza is envious of her sister's life - Martha has it all - the loving husband, the adorable children, the mortgage, the pension plan... When she dumps her musician boyfriend Greg to find a more appropriate grown up man and comes to cry on Martha's shoulder, she discovers that Martha's husband Michael has left her. The house in shambles, and Martha in shock, Eliza moves in the help her sister make the transition to singledom. But Martha assumes this is just a phase and Michael will be back. When the sisters venture out on the dating scene, Eliza has a hard time finding a new relationship, while Martha jumps right into one with charismatic Jack Hope.Parks has penned an interesting story about a woman who finds herself suddenly single, but it fails to fulfill the reader. Rather than empowerment, Martha wallows in self-pity waiting for her husband to return, even while engaged in a relationship with Jack. While it is billed as a story about both sisters finding love, this is primarily Martha's story. Eliza and the male characters were basically one dimensional and their characters never fully developed. Eliza's many blind dates should've been a focal point. As it was, each was relegated to a couple paragraphs - definitely a missed opportunity. Parks has penned much better."},{"Title":"Lust for Life","review":"Very slow moving in the beginning. The main character, Martha explains her feelings and thought processes . . . redundantly. I thought that the 2 sisters would actually be switching places . . . like twins. But they only switched lives metaphorically. Generally predictable with a completely unrealistic Hollywood ending. The only thing it had going for it . . . the English slang. But the word \\"whilst\\" seems to be overused."},{"Title":"Lust for Life","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, but it was just so predictable. I kept thinking that the author was going to stick in some sort of plot twist, but it never happened. I liked reading about the two sisters and I liked the descriptions of their neighborhoods in London. But, jeez, to get dumped by your husband and then fall immediately into a absolutely perfect relationship with the very first guy you meet. It was just too perfect."},{"Title":"Lust for Life","review":"Raising two infants (two and a half year old Mathew and ten month old Maisie) is hard work, but Martha loves being a mother and wife to Michael though at times she covets the freedom that her sister Eliza enjoys. Thirty years old Eliza lives with Greg the musician in his flat, but envies her sibling as she wants marriage and children with a man whose vocabulary was a shade wider than that of her nephew.Eliza dumps Greg fleeing to her sister only to find Martha heartbroken because Michael has left her. After a weeping fit, both siblings agree they must enter the dating game though their goals vary; Martha wants the F fling with no commitments while Eliza desires the marital thing with total commitments. Martha meets Jack who wants more from her while Eliza goes through a horde of men seeking her Mr. Perfect husband. Neither has found love not even comfort with the hunks they have bagged.LUST FOR LIFE uses humor and sex to somewhat mute the overall serious tone of the story line that focuses on what one desires in life and relationships that enhance or impede obtaining these aspirations. Martha and Eliza are fabulous sisters both yearning to a degree to have what the other possesses yet clearly love and care for one another. While the supporting male cast augments insight into the sisters, the complex relationship between Martha and Eliza keeps the tale from spinning into an inane chick lit throwaway as each sibling walks in the other's moccasins.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lust for Life","review":"Although the plot is dead-on predictable, I still found it to be an enjoyable, heartwarming and funny story.

A great resource to use. -Straightforward Parenting and Consultation."},{"Title":"He Hit Me First: When Brothers and Sisters Fight","review":"I am the mother of three, ages 8, 6 and 3. My older two, boy and girl, fight constantly...about everything. Over the years I have bought at least a dozen parenting books and tried every suggestion. Time outs only work for the time the kids are \\"out\\". Taking away treats doens't work...the ability to get a rise out of a sibling is worth the loss. My husband and I do not model hitting, screaming or calling each other stupid head. And, when one kid is pummeling another, I cannot ignore it and let the blood fall where it may. This book, actually made me feel better about parenting children who continuously CHOOSE to fight. It was the first book I read which said that the kids actually LIKE fighting. It doesn't seem possible, but since getting along would be so much easier, the fighting must bring about a payoff for them. The book also lists each age and the demeanor typically associated with that age and how well each age is able to get along with every other age. So if you have kids ages 7 and 8 they will typically have a different dynamic then kids ages 5 and 6...and be prepared for the next stage. I actually breathed easier after reading this book. My kids still fight, but I am no longer desperately searching for the magic bullet to make them stop. I am no longer going to bed every night wondering where I went wrong. Reading this book is like having an understanding friend nod and say \\"been there it's tough\\".

This turns out to be a good thing and a bad thing. The good aspect of it is that it actually just comes right out gives advice on how to deal with conflict between siblings. Most contemporary parenting books start out with a bunch of trite anecdotes about this family and that family that I just find aggravating. The advice seems right on the money, too: kids fight because they get something out of it; they enjoy the activity as well as the attention they get from it. So you should ignore what you can and take simple, direct steps to stop more serious fighting, not making a big emotional deal out of it. There are a bunch of little ideas on do's and dont's that are very useful. So the first four chapters are great. Then thing get weird. They start talking about how kids with different body types (i.e. fat and skinny) have different personality traits. Wasn't that discredited, like, 80 years ago?? They make all kinds of generalizations about personality traits based on birth order and gender too. Almost all of the generalizations were completely, hilariously off-base for my kids. They also seem to view \\"working mothers\\" as some kind of anomaly from normal family relationships, which I guess might not have been totally off-base in 1982, but makes the book pretty dated.

I made the recommendation to some of the upset people that rated that book a 1 start to read The Listener. Taylor Caldwell is a how do I put it, they just don't make woman like this any more. She's authentic, every character creative and different, and her words put you directly in the scene. At times it's as if somebody from another realm is writing for her. I won't tell you the end of the Listener, but it's a ending that only hollywood wish they could steal. I never cried reading a book, but this one got me teary eyed, a great reminder on how we don't have it as bad as we think.

Everyone should!"},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"Taylor Caldwell presents vividly, like she always does, the situations of daily living of different souls - their most private thoughts, emotions and feelings. The reader will definitely identify himself/herself, and identify others, with one (or more) of the characters in the book.The problems presented by the characters are as actual as they were 30 years ago, no changes in society. As you start agreeing with what the character presents and identifying more and more, you will experiment the answer and the same healing that the soul in the book experiments.Taylor Caldwell has this gift of taking the reader to the very core of her novels, making the reader one of the characters involved.Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"I first read The Listener when it was originally published.I found it to be one of the most inspiring books I had ever read.

However since reading Taylor Caldwell's other novels it peaked my interested and I am glad I read it. I still don't know what to believe and you cannot will yourself to have faith; you either have it or you don't or it's something you cultivate (in my humble opinion), however this book gave me hope more than any other spiritual book I have ever read. Even though it was published almost 50 years ago it's message and the topics presented in the book are timeless (as with many other Taylor Caldwell's books). You don't have to be Christian to enjoy or find comfort in this book!! Highly recommend!!!"},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"I first read this book in 1968.

Even though I am clearly aware that the book was fiction, I liked the ideas presented in it. As I am writing this from memory-- some 30+/- years after the fact-- that should give you some idea on just how much of an impact.In an age when science, engineering, physics, etc.... had taken over the thinking of society, a man was faced what to do with his life's earnings following his wife's death.The man made a rather interesting choice. He took all that wealth, and made a place for people to come and unburden themselves, and gain a sense of meaning, peace, and even forgiveness.While the town was some no-name town, where all this took place, it was written giving the sense one could actually find it, and do so themselves.Numerous fictional characters, from all walks of life enter into the room, spend their time talking. Some non-descript, some utter and complete confessionals. And then when they push the button they are confronted by something, someone whom they did not expect to see.This book resulted in a subsequent, sequel book, called--No One Hears but Him.While a continuation, it picks up the lives of other, \\"everyman\\" people, who benefit from their encounter with \\"Him\\" in that room from which no one will describe.I encourage you to read them both. Especially if you find yourself wanting someone to talk to, and not knowing anyone who will take you seriously enough to listen as intently as you want/need. You'll find that there is Someone who does listen, and doesn't charge a penny. Even if you don't go to the room that does not exist."},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"This was one of the books I reported on while in college. The theme struck me then and when I saw it on the list I wanted it."},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"This book, published in 1960, tells the story of 15 &quot;souls&quot; -- people from many walks of life -- from judges and doctors to a humble, devout cleaning lady. Each person goes into a sanctuary like building to spend time with &quot;The Listener.&quot;I won't tell you who &quot;The Listener&quot; is. You might guess, and you might not. But one thing I can guarantee -- your life won't be the same after you read this book. You can be Catholic, Protestant (with all the variations therein) or even a Hindu, Moslem or Jew, and be challenged by reading this book.Through these 15 stories, Taylor Caldwell expresses more about the real essence of Christianity than all of the &quot;Doctrinal&quot; books I have read -- and as a PK (preacher's kid) I've read a lot of them. This describes more than a &quot;religion.&quot; It is a relationship with the real originator of Christianity.We have a lot of garbage being promoted in the name of religion today -- and a lot of it is in the name of religion, and trying to be carried out politically. It's easy to forget that Jesus Christ Himself was notoriously apolitical. He was about REAL spirituality -- something that starts in the innermost part of a person and spreads outward.The message of this beautiful book is as important today as it was when it was written. The fact that circumstances and cultures have changed is irrelevant -- human nature hasn't changed at all.Read this story. It will be among the most worthwhile time you've spent."},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"I am a Hindu believer by birth, The Listener is one of those few rare books that opened up my horizon to the truth and suffering of Christ (and human beings. In fact, this book gives me watery eyes every time I read it, and I read it often. The New Testament was written by The Apostles in The Apostles\` words, while The Listener is The New Testament written by and in the laymen\`s words."},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"This book has become a favorite of mine - it's a classic! I plan to recommend it to many of my family & friends - & I highly recommend it to you too!The chapters in this book are actually categorized as \\"souls\\" - each one dealing with 1 person who came to \\"the Listener\\" in a broken state, and left healed (in more ways than one).This book has the potential to really hit home - showing that we ALL have problems (no one is immune), and that we are NEVER really alone - a concept that is so easy to forget these days.I don't want to spill the beans re: who the listener is, but after you read the first chapter you'll instinctivly know (if not by the first chapter, then definitely by the second). Once your realize who it is, it will serve as a reminder that we all have a \\"listener\\" - available any time, day or night."},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"I read The Listener in the 60's before I went to Vietnam. As a combat soldier in very frightening conditions I oftened remembered the calm I had when I read The Listener. Recreating that calm in my heart helped me live through that war.

He doesn't say a word. He listens to all your problems or perceived threats, jealousies, sins, resentments, guilts or whatever devil is hounding you, without judgement or condemnation. You will leave the chamber with deep reflection about your life, maybe relief, at the very least understanding human frailities and man's often vicious and petty nature and how love transcends and lets you feel like you are not alone.

You will not regret picking up this loving novella of short stories within the big chapter of life."},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"I enjoyed watching the vignettes of broken lives getting restored as people saw or met The Man Who Listens. The technique of having the characters unwittingly ask questions that reveal attributes of the Man, are also powerful, at least the first few times this technique is used. The person who wrote this book clearly must have been a reflective observer of humanity.However, I was most disappointed by the ending. After going through a litany of 14 individuals whose lives have been warped by their own or others' evil, the author constructs an ending that would require people choosing to do good! Nevertheless, I did enjoy the flavor of the ending, and how it reflected the Cold War era in which it was written (1961)."},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"The Listener has helped me through many crisis. It returns to my mind when most needed. It is a book that can not be put down and never be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"I began reading Taylor Caldwell as a teenager in the 1980s. I thought that she was just another romance writer at the time. However, as I have grown and my literary tastes have evolved, I find myself coming back to Taylor again and again. There is something far more than simply a good story or interesting characters in Taylor's writing. She is a spiritual writer, a woman with great insight and depth who understands the suffering of humanity, and the hope that lives beyond this ephemeral world. At the ripe old age of 40 I am reading The Listener for the very first time. I feel like I have reconnected with a long lost friend. The writer's kind and knowing voice serves as a kind of spiritual guide.The story is quite simple. People go to a quiet sanctuary to meet with a \\"listener\\" in private. At first, the individuals are timid and uncertain of the listener's identity. Is he a psychiatrist, a physician, a clergyman? The troubled individual bears his or her soul to the listener and gradually experiences a sense of peace, grace and forgiveness. At the close of the session, the individual encounters \\"the listener\\" beyond the blue curtains and is overwhelmed by what he or she sees. It is a mystical experience, what one imagines to be a vision of Christ.Taylor's main message is this: we can go through our entire lives, if we will it so, in a virtual fog of ego and delusion. Then, if we are lucky, \\"blessed\\" some might say, we will be given a single moment of grace in which the scales fall from our eyes and all at once, we see the truth of who we are and the purpose of our existences as mortals on this earth. That moment is both humbling and painful- and yet it brings us tremendous meaning and joy. Read this book as you would read sacred script of any religion- with reverance and gratitude."},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"This book truly illustrates God's love and His willingness to listen to our heart cries. Everyone who goes before the &quot;Listener&quot; comes away rested and at peace. Taylor Caldwell did an excellent job of portraying a loving Father who truly wants to hear his childrens heart cries. I highly recommend this book. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"The Listener","review":"I loved this book, I read it again and again. If someone asks what my alltime favorite book is, this is the title that comes directly to mind. This gets to the core of all things. What is Love? We are here to Love, why else would we exist?! Without fear we would all love so much more, so easily, like children. Be like children and experience true joy! You haven't lived till you read this book! Can you tell I loved it!!"},{"Title":"Meet the Press: 50-Years of History in the Making","review":"This book is a excellent tribute to the public affairs program that spawned such programs as &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and &quot;This Week&quot;. This book is a very interesting look at the political faces that have passed through &quot;Meet the Press&quot; in its first fifty years. This book is a must read for those who really enjoy this program."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Accelerando begins in the not-too-distant future, and spins the tale of a family living during the techno-pseudo-rapture of humanity from physical form to digitized representations living in a Matrioshka brain. The conflict that develops between \\"meat\\" humans and \\"post\\" humans forms the basis for most of the story. What makes this unpalatable situation so frightening is that the steps leading to it each seem relatively benign and harmlessly logical.One striking aspect of this work is that it was the first bit of science fiction I've read that actually left me feeling as though people living today could see the events described in the book unfold. While the malleable world available to silicon \\"uploads\\" certain sounds fun, there is also a dehumanizing element -- how can creatures \\"born\\" in a world where death is virtually impossible understand why it's bad to harm physical entities? What worth does a person have if any necessary physical posessions can be congealed out of smart goo/nanomachines at virtually no cost? What value does one have in an information economy when your brain has a fraction of the computing power of your bedroom wall?My only minor gripe with the book is the ending is a bit abrupt, and didn't quite ring true to me. Still, the fascinating glimpse of a possible future and the enjoyable trip through the first few gigaseconds of post-singularity human history are enough to leave me very satisfied."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Okay, so the novel began life as a series of short stories, this is obvious as you read through. There are sections of text that both explain the surroundings and historical situation at that moment as well as bridging together leaps of time and location. These seem intrusive and detracted from the overall flow of reading, but I can't deny that they were in needed to make sure you \\"got it\\" and weren't wondering/wandering how we got here. The core of the book for me were the truly original concepts of the future and our evolution, the hard core science part of the fiction, regarding the conversion of our solar environment to computational material and nano-transformational matter, and how we expand our sense and reach of self beyond our physical limits. This was great stuff. It was both the base atmosphere of this literary environment and a key to generating suprises and twists. Are we directing our own future or are our inventions directing it/us? And if there are aliens, wouldn't they evolve this way as well? The story kept me entranced and entertained AND started me thinking. And for me that is a good book."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"You will enjoy this book if you are a fan of speculative science fiction; this one highlights technological singularity and how a few generations of a particular family tree are affected.It starts off with America badly in debt and with an on again off again relationship between Manfred and Pamela. Manfred is a globalist interested only in the ideas that will not only make the patent holders lots of money but also in advancing the pace of civilization. Pamela is dominatrix and control freak who works for the IRS. Manfred owes lots of money through convoluted speculation from the IRS that if Manfred stayed home (read: the United States since he's a citizen) and earned money from patents he's giving away for free then he would owe X amount of dollars in taxes. Understandably he's not ok with this arrangement in which he suddenly owes money to a country he hasn't actually lived in for years. He has several ideas before breakfast to patent each day that could make him a billionaire and, with each patent that he gives away for free its like giving Pamela, the IRS, and his country the finger. The reason he does this? The United States' current thinking, philosophy, and agenda are at polar opposites with the way the Manfred feels the world should operate to propel itself into space using new economic ideas and mechanics.And this is just the beginning. Civilization discovers an alien signal from the depths of space but most of the population doesn't care since the implications are unlikely to affect them for millions of years. A second signal closer to home (originating only a few light years away) is kept secret to avoid panicking the public. At the same time the first uploaded neurons from lobsters to the global network gains sapience and seeks escape from humans. Manfred is queried by the lobsters for help and a solution to two immediate problems is found. People can emigrate into space easier as a result. An expedition to another star for investigation is possible eventually thanks to technology that allows people to upload themselves to virtual machine. And a group of people agree to visit this star even though it means leaving behind a copy of themselves to live out the rest of their lives.There are so many twists and turns in this roller coaster that you're not quite sure where you'll end up."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"While a great and incredibly imaginative book, I couldn't help but feel that the story got too big for Stross to give it a fulfilling ending. Nonetheless, I have never before seen the implications of the singularity told in such a clear way."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Fans of R.A. Lafferty will likely appreciate this one, but I lost interest and patience not far into the book. Probably a better book than I give it credit for, but I just can't do semi-silly any more."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"All of the novels that I have read by Stross so far have shown an enormous amount of promise and verve. Accelerando lives up to all that promise, mostly because Stross has finally thrown any interest in conventional plot overboard. It is a heck of a wild-eyed ride, full of irrepressible ideas and fun. Uploaded lobsters and revolution through patenting-- when the writer has this much fun, it is almost impossible for the reader not to come along for the ride.The way that Stross uses the characters here is interesting. Although exceptional, the Macx clan is not heroic. The events of the book only weakly associate with their inner life, if at all. There's no nice restorative structure which saves the universe as Amber overcomes her inner demons. The character arcs are more real and (to my mind) appropriately disconnected from history. Still, this aspect may be dislocating for people who would prefer a more traditional character-based structure.Highly recommended. Onward toGlasshouse."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I gave Stross five stars despite a host of problems: The eerie resemblance to Wil McCarthy's CONTINUUM, the ungainly structure, the unconnectedness of the parts, the almost mind-numbing avalanche of new words and phrases and the unrealized ending. The last part of the book comes in for major criticism as the action bogs down and seems repetitive. Despite all of these potential literary land mines it is an incredible work of science fiction / projection.The Singularity has acquired the status of a new buzzword, in particular after the book by that name by Kurzweil. Most novels start post-Singularity where all the problems have been worked out. Stross starts at the near future, when the first signs of the long exponential growth in intelligence and computation begins to affect the way we feel about ourselves. The novel is essentially a generational saga (with the first, the story of Manfred, easily the best). The second part covers his daughter and the third, her son. A Shia emir in orbit beyond Mars is teh least realized character - phony and totally unreal. Strange concepts like smart matter, phase studies, resurrection, virtual reality universes - all are credibly depicted. Interspersed throughout the book are historical outtakes describing the incredible changes decade by decade.The search for alien life ends with the discovery that, yes, intelligent life exists but it is no longer biological. For reaons of energy and computation, the civilization cannot leave its home star. This ia a unique solution to Fermi's Paradox. The author believes (and I agree) that if we do encounter aliens it will be the mechanical (not the flesh) kind. The future as depicted here is exciting, strange and very bleak - at least from the perspective of this pre-transcendent human. The efforts to return mankind to a pre-Singularity world is all the more telling, as if only the familiar can satisfy us. Great read -"},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Accelerando by Charles Stross is the book you've been waiting for, especially if you are a fan of Singularity theory.The Singularity is a theoretical point in the development of a scientific civilization at which technological progress accelerates into infinity or beyond prediction, a concept popularized by Vernor Vinge. This is believed to occur when artificial intelligence or intelligence enhancement is perfected. I've read several sci-fi books that take place AFTER the Singularity, including Vinge's Across Realtime. Usually from the viewpoint of the humans who were left behind by the crazy post-humans who fully embraced change. Accelerando is the first book I've read that actually takes the reader THROUGH the Singularity and out the other side. A staggeringly ambitious novel, with a lot of terrific ideas. I highly recommend it, despite the fact I haven't quite finished it."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I was looking forward to reading this one, but in the end I barely made it through. Stross shovels on an unbelievable amount of jargon from page one, and that's all there really ever is. I never got the sense that Stross was ever interested in making this more than an bolted together mess of the current hot topics in Sci Fi.The characters are two dimensional, poorly formed and motivated, and undergo almost no development. You never get the sense that they're anything more than jargon mouthpieces - with the one exception, they largely march through the plot, never really taking in, reacting to, or feeling anything. The bold print passages that link what I'm assuming were formerly independent short stories seem rushed. And don't even get me started on the endless run-on sentences...In the end, I'd hoped for a lot more given the hype surrounding this book."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"It is rare that I am unable or unwilling to finish reading a book. I couldn't even make it through the first 50 pages of this one.

I don't know why. It was awful.I have no problem with Stross' muddled vision. The problem is his writing style is absolutely horrible. Don't believe me, select \\"random page\\" and see if it grips you.It feels like the author is struggling to be clever in each and every sentence. He fails horribly.I don't get the book. His over-reaching style clouds the story that he is attempting to tell.There are much better alternatives available.

Although I found the story and characters to be a little wanting at times, these elements often felt like mannequins anyway, putting human form on the tsunami of ideas Stross lays out. If that doesn't sound fascinating to you, this ain't the book for you - I think I added one or two more stars to my review simply because of the education I received reading it: after damn near every paragraph I would have to put the book down and look something up on wikipedia. A must for true geeks; not so much for everyone else...."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Charles Stross combines cutting edge current tech with future technological speculation to illustrate how scientific progress will lead to the next human evolutionary step.

I envy anyone just about to dive into Accelerando, Singularity Sky and the excellent 'sequels'."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"A stunning collection of essays grouped together as a novel. Its origins show in the lack of character development but few books have me laughing out loud and blown away by the audacity of its ideas. Stross never disappoints!"},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"From the opening chapter, this book is jammed with speculation about where the accelerating advances in technology may be taking the human race (and other species!). The narrative and characters are engaging, but ultimately (for me), what kept me burning through the book was Stross's incredible imagination about the future. Many of these ideas seem destined to occur. Great book!"},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Set in the near future, this group of related stories is about an Earth where technology has run rampant, and humanity's inability to keep up.Computing power, and artificial intelligence, have passed the limits of human intellect. Nanotechnology is everywhere, reprogramming and replicating at will. Posthumans, with all sorts of biological implants, have rendered people extinct. Corporations have become alive and sentient. New resource allocation algorithms, collectively called Economics 2.0, have replaced capitalism and communism.This book is about three generations of the same family. Manfred is a freelance broker in intelligence amplification technology in a world where everyone must be 30 seconds ahead of everyone else. Years later, his teenage daughter, Amber, signs up as an indentured astronaut on the first exploration ship heading to Jupiter. It is to get away from a domineering mother who insists that Amber have a \\"normal\\" life on Earth. Her son, Sirhan, finds his destiny intertwined with all of humanity. Along the way, most of the planets in the solar system are systematically taken apart by various sorts of mini-robots and nanomachines. There is also a multi-year journey to a specific brown dwarf star a long way away. Building a ship with sufficient life support for people, and propelling it at any reasonable portion of the speed of light is not possible. Therefore, the \\"passengers\\" have been uploaded into a nanocomputer the size of a Coke can, and that is sent to the stars.I thoroughly loved this novel. Cyberpunk fans will also love it. It does a fine job at the near future speculation, it's cool, it's high tech, and it's got a good story. What else does a reader need?"},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"A fix-up novel examining humanity's ever-increasing technological development throughout the 21st century and beyond, culminating in the conversion of most of the mass of the solar system into \\"computronium\\". Three generations of the Macx family live through these changes and try to survive the Singularity and the actions of humanity's AI descendants.The concept of the technological Singularity has been used in a lot of stories in the past decade, but Accelerando is the most complete look at how it could happen and what the effects could be. It starts out in the 2010's with Manfred Macx just starting to utilize always-networked wearable computers and software agents that become primitive extensions of himself and quickly moves on to a point where most of a person's personality may not reside in their physical body at all. The technological extrapolation is fascinating and technological change is portrayed as something moving forward almost with a life of its own that will drastically change the lives of everyone who survives it, but also shows that most of humanity may not survive the changes.The book is probably not for everybody though. It seems to be specifically aimed at a techno-geek audience. If you don't already have some idea of what computronium is before reading the book, you are likely to end up lost and overwhelmed with all the concepts being thrown around. It is very much a book of concepts without much character development and a plot that still strongly shows its origins as individual stories. If you have some background in technology and recent hard SF concepts this is a must-read book."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I believe Cory Doctorow said it best when he said something like 'makes hallucinogens obsolete' This book is brain meltingly lovely. Instead of being sci fi to inspire the dreams of yesterday (which seems to be so much of what's out there), Stross creates sci fi that is truly future speculative (not predictive, just mentally inflammatory in the best possible way). Don't get me wrong, this book has it's flaws, and there are bumps in the narrative. However, they're totally forgivable, as Accelerando takes you along for a ride that is both outlandish beyond belief, and all too believable."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I've read most of Stross' work, and enjoyed it all. This book was a roller coaster of ideas, using the history of a key family to pull the reader along. Was it complicated? Yes. Was it very technical? Yes. But that's all part of the fun. I really enjoyed this book, and found the future history it proposes frighteningly believable and just around the corner.As for it becoming dated and irrelevent too soon - I just re-read the E.E.Doc Smith Lensmen series, where space ships were controlled by teams of people doing calculations (no computers), but that dated content didn't make the series any less enjoyable."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"While characterization and plot is somewhat lacking, it is no worse in those respects than many other hard SF books. Accelerando is THE most realistic novel of the human/transhuman/posthuman transition I have yet encountered. Its history as short stories brought together shows in the structure, but I think that is possibly the best way he could have shown such a difficult and complex issue."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Accelerenado is a nice read. Even though we kind of heardabout the road to the singularity before (e.g. Ray Kurzweil):One day in this century, machines will have more processingpower than human brains - and that will make for a completelynew society. The singularity.In Charles Stross' words: \\"Sometime in this century laboring womenwill produce forty-five thousand babies a day, representing10^23 MIPS of processing power. Also around the world,fab lines will churn out out thirty million microprocessors a day,representing 10^23 MIPS of processing power.After that day most of the MIPS being added to the solarsystem will be machine hosted\\".And obviously human minds will be connected tothe machines. In accelerando we have the meta cortex -a distributed cloud of softwareagents that surrounds humans in the near future -a thing which is as much a part of the books charactersthan the society of mind thatoccupies their skulls.Eventually, human minds are running more on machines than theyare inside human skulls. Death and biology conquered.No problem, except perhaps for the legal system. I.e.\\"the law didn't recognize death as a reversible process.people pay for having their heads frozen after their death,but when they wake up all reconstructed in some simulationand without any rights - was that what they wanted ?\\"And off we go to the fourth decade,where the machines are up to 10^33 MIPS and rising, allthoughthere is still a long way before the solar system is fully awake.People (kind of) with neural implants, that feel as naturalas lungs or fingers, with half their wetware runningoutside their skull in a personal metacortex, i.e. cyborgs,gets the first alien nessage - on where to find the router to pluginto the galactic internet.This we also kind of expected - think Timothy Ferris here.The new stuff (for me) comes with the ceti- communication with extraterrestrial intelligences -Surely, you need a piece of software, that you put intoyour head to allow you to have a highlevel protocol service that allows you to connect to the (alien) router and start the ceti.After that you transfer yourself into the alien network -and find yourself in a simulation where you dont need to simulate breathing.Oh sure, you dont feel all that human if you dont breathe?But so what, you are a posthuman now !Eventually you catch up with other superintelligences.Or at least you know they are out there.Superintelligences don't go travelling, as they cantget enough bandwidth to transport themselves from one placeto another through the routers ... and perhapsthey don't really need the outside input anymore -having become a superintelligence what is there really to learnfrom the outside anyhow? (And so Charles Stross neatly solvesthe Fermi Paradox for us!).The planets are all dismantled and used as materialsto build a Matrioshka super brain.The only question now is if information from such a superintelligencewill ever become apparent to someone looking infrom the outside (think fred Hoyle here)- or it will just die living nothing behind.I don't think we really get the answer form Charles Strosson that one. But he does make the impact on technology on human society, identity and consciousness totally believable. Of course things are reallygoing to go down this road. It is inevitable.Highly readable, techno-babble and all, but not all that new.We kind of heard it before. So now we are certain thats the way it is going to play out. For sure !Simon"},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"The first 50 pages of ACCELERANDO were exciting and insightful and mind-blowing and fascinating and fun. And then it became a self-parody of overwrought, ideas-at-the-expense-of-interesting-characters science fiction. Given all the praise for this book, I was sharply disappointed."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"This book is a little preachy and the constant anti-capitalism propaganda is frankly irritating. The book has an agenda where all information should be shared freely. The characters waltz around with constant free bandwidth, limitless computation, and free access to the net. This all misses the very important fact that energy is not free.Energy is not free. Energy to fuel our bodies. Energy to create bandwidth. Energy to put satellites in the sky. Energy is at the core of this book, yet he never once acknowledges it.It takes energy for an artist to write a song - they should be compensated for their time and effort. It takes energy to come up with an idea - the person who does so should be rewarded for it. Life takes time and energy. Yet, the easy with which our protagonist comes up with his ideas flies in the face of that and the statements made about all of our energy being open source... that's just bullcrap.Add in that this book is often too absurd to accept and you don't get good scifi."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Accelerando is an entertaining collection of loosely related anecdotes spanning a time that covers both the near future and the post-singularity world. Stross seems to be more interested in showing off how many geeky pieces of knowledge he has and how many witty one-liners he can produce than he is in producing a great plot or a big new vision. I expect that people who aren't hackers or extropians will sometimes be confused by some of his more obscure references (e.g. when he assumes you know how a third-party compiler defeats the Thompson hack).He sometimes tries too hard to show off his knowledge, such as when he says \\"solving the calculation problem\\" causes \\"screams from the Chicago School\\" - this seems to show he confuses the Chicago School with the Austrian School. He says that in the farther parts of the solar systemMost people huddle close to the hub, for comfort and warmth and low latency: posthumans are gregarious.But most of what I know about the physics of computation suggests that warmth is a problem they will be trying to minimize.The early parts of the book try to impress the reader with future shock, but toward the end the effects of technological change seem to have less and less effect on how the characters lives. That is hard to reconcile with the kind of exponential change that Stross seems to believe in.He has many tidbits about innovative economic and legal institutions. But it's often hard to understand how realistic they are, because I got some inconsistent impressions about basic things such as whether Manfred used money.His answer to the Fermi paradox is unconvincing. It is easy to imagine that the smartest beings will want to stick close to the most popular locations. But that leaves plenty of other moderately intelligent beings (the lobsters?) with little attachment to this solar system, whose failure to colonize the galaxy he doesn't explain."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"The science-fiction is excellent. It's not just technology-oriented science. In fact, I would say the \\"science\\" focus is economic. And Stross truly understands the potential impacts of advanced science and technology on economics. However, the storyline is not tied well together and the book seems to have little point with regard to a complete story. Instead, it seems to be \\"printed streams of conscious\\" on the part of the author. So from the perspective of a \\"story\\", I think many will be disappointed. However, I give it 4 stars for it's hard look at a potential future of humanity, for it's thought-provoking nature regarding uncommon technology and economic visions, and it's combination of hard technology-fiction and economic-fiction."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"There was astonishingly little character development and real plot development in this novel. I'd already read two of the author's Manfred Macx short stories that were adapted into the first part of the book, and enjoyed them. Unfortunately I knew as much about Manfred, the lead character tying the book somewhat together, at that point as I knew at the end of the book. And the rest of the characters were even less well-drawn and pretty unlikable. I wanted to know more about the singularity and what it did to the people who embraced it rather than to those who resisted and fled from it, picking up only bits and pieces of the technology that caused it. It would probably be difficult to make post-singularity \\"people\\" feel comprehensible, since they'd be so different, but it would be fun to read an attempt. Despite these problems the book pulled me in and I made it all the way to the rather random ending, which seems to set us up for more. There was plenty of foreshadowing of the book's \\"surprise\\" ending. There were probably lots of fascinating things going on elsewhere Many great SF writers have not been so good at characterization (Clarke, Asimov, for example), but they did very well indeed with setting, and could tell a story.The idea of the singularity in human history fascinates me, so I may even try another of Stross' books."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"\\"Accelerando\\" will surely please many fans of William Gibson, Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling despite its flaws of which some are quite noteworthy. Stross' novel works best as a novel of ideas, depicting the ascent of humanity into a \\"posthuman\\" late 21st Century future as seen through the eyes of Manfred Macx and two generations of his descendants. His is an apocalyptic vision of artificial intelligence progressing so rapidly that sentient hive minds reconfigure the inner Solar System to suit their needs, forcing humanity's exodus to distant Saturn. Stross relentlessly pulls the reader into that vision, his tale told vividly in a fast paced style, quite dizzy at times, rarely pausing for a brief moment. And yet his tale is one replete with flaws, lacking the literary eloquence I've expected from the likes of William Gibson and Bruce Sterling respectively, in their early novels \\"Neuromancer\\" and \\"Schisimatrix\\". Another glaring flaw is Stross' unexpected recycling of \\"Star Trek\\" concepts like \\"Borg\\" and \\"Borgified\\", which detracts from his unique, unrelenting vision of an artificial intelligence-dominated \\"posthuman\\" future. While \\"Accelerando\\" is a rough diamond, not a polished gem, of a novel, it remains one that will captivate some unfamiliar with Stross' work as well as those who are his most devoted fans."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Having read Stross' Halting State already this year, I kind of knew what to expect- high lingo density with tenacity for accurate futurology. Accelerando starts (Part 1, Scenes 1-3) in a future much like Halting State, actually- rich in tech, internet connectivity and hardware interface. A few years down the line (Part 2, scenes 4-6 ) and we experience the plot around Jupiter and a little bit beyond with a wave of socioeconomic change, the approach of the \`singularity,' and an unyielding torrent of new technologies. For the finale (Part 3, scenes 7-9) we're confronting a reality which makes little sense to us upright monkeys: seemingly magical wonders, bizarre family reunions and galactic neighborhoods.

Stross fills the book with ideas which could be big and important, but I never got over the feeling that I was reading a 'tongue in cheek' parody of something or other. To be honest by about page 400 (I read on a Kindle 2) I got pretty bored and really ran through to the end of the book. There are many, perhaps too many, grand ideas here, but Stross does not pause long enough to develop them in any meaningful sort of way. One of the main themes is a running battle between two people over their child. As it turns out this may have been the most important thing Stross had to say.This is a very complex book and requires a lot of attention and a good dictionary (that won't always help as Stross makes up a lot of words). I think CyperPunk is pretty much a dead genre, and maybe Stross would argue that this isn't CyperPunk; but it sure reads that way to me. I'm glad I finished this book more to have gotten it done than edification."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"First, I think many of those giving low marks on this book would give higher marks and have more interest if they had read something like Ray Kurzweil's \\"The Singularity is Near\\". There may be better books on the topic, but Kurzweil's explains the idea of a Singularity, many of the expected effects, and the path it will take along with why it will take certain paths. If you have some background on the idea of a Singularity (even if you don't agree) Accelerando is much more interesting, and understandable as a work of fiction. It will no longer seem choppy and lacking in depth, the reverse actually.Now if you have only read of the Singularity in serious works, this book is a breath of fresh air as an example of what could happen one day in the future. This becomes a highly entertaining enjoyable read. While a bit long it just pulls you along each step of the way almost like a good Dean Koontz book.I would have given it 4.5 stars if available as I felt suddenly cheated at the very end by how the story just rather stopped. Like the author couldn't come up with a more creative ending. To criticize Mr. Stross' creativity considering the rest of the book however is rather foolish. So I will just say the ending he chose didn't satisfy me."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"This book consists of episodes during three generations of the Macx family. During those three generations, the human race is superceded by artificial intelligences, (referred to collectively by humanity as 'The Vile Offspring').Surviving humanity leaves the Solar System to the AI's by the end of the book and lives a nanotech derived existence near a brown dwarf star elsewhere.Uploads to cyberspace and back to realspace are commonplace, death is temporary when backups are taken into account.Stross paints a dystopic picture of a universe where humanity comes to exist on the fringes outside of a greater uncaring civilisation of AI's that exists in what used to be the Solar System. Identity is something of a variable. People can split off copies of themselves and reintegrate them later by the end of the book.People are still recognisable as people except that they can operate in a greater variety of modes. They know more but aren't any smarter than they are now.Whatever faults the book has, it does give the reader a lot to think about and I'll be reading the sequel some time in the future, although I doubt that the human race will take the course mapped out by this book, if only because the aliens aren't likely to be there."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I've been discovering Stross' novels in highly non-chronological order. \\"Singularity sky\\" impressed the *beep* out of me with its combination of imagination and humor, and some of his other novels have also been very enjoyable.But THIS one...this one goes a little beyond mere enjoyment.SF writers are actually notoriously bad at accurately predicting the future. The danger is in extrapolating trends - \\"extrapolating\\" is roughly the same as \\"getting it wrong\\". So, no Soylent Green (\\"Make room, make room\\"), no eco-catastrophe (lots of novels from the 60s), etc.Knowing that, an author has to work pretty hard to make us suspend our disbelief. Suspension of disbelief is not the same as hanging it by the neck until it's dead! Stross manages this so well in \\"Accelerando\\" it's frightening. He makes the impact on technology on human society, identity and consciousness totally believable. Of COURSE our consciousness is going to be decentralized, split between bits still running in the old wetware and bits running as external agents on other platforms. Of COURSE there's going to be a Singularity (and this is the most believable one I've read about yet). And of COURSE there's a perfectly societal response to all that.The characters are still recognizably human, but sometimes just barely. One particularly well-written passage has one of the main characters lose his external computer support (disguised as a pair of specs) through which he was running many of his supplementary agents and programs. He is like a man with brain damage after that. He can still function, but his thought processes are..alien to us.Stross is also very fond of casually tossing HUGE concepts into half a sentence during a conversation. I kept cracking up at his mention of what were essentially self-aware financial instruments - your options are coming to GET you!This is a wonderful book. Dazzling, captivating, occasionally very funny and just a damn good read. Highly recommended. Hugo Award next year."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Charles Stross has written expansively on the concept of the Vingean Singularity, where the rate of technological advance increases so rapidly that the future cannot be foreseen. In Accelerando he charts the course of three generations of the Macx family before during and after the singularity.The novel was originally a series of self contained short stories and is very episodic. As such, there is a series of events that are all resolved within the same chapter only to come unravelled at the start of the next. However, all the smaller story elements fit into a greater arc chronicling humanity's rapid rise, obsolescence and recovery.Stross's writing is excellent, although computer literacy is a must. Indeed, this isn't an easy read but it is quite a ride and well recommended."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Accelerando (2005) is a standalone SF novel. It is set in the near future during the meltdown of nation states and capitalism. The EU has self-disorganized into the European Confederacy and the United States is almost bankrupt. And the underground economy is taking over the world.In this novel, Manfred Macx is a genius who is patenting lots of primal ideas and assigning the rights to several Free Foundations and variously selected beneficiaries. He gets free passes and other nonmonetary compensation from these astounded recipients, thus has little need for cash. Manfred has an ongoing sexual affair with Pamela, an IRS entrepreneur who constantly reminds him of his estimated tax arrears.Pamela traps him into getting her pregnant and then forces him to marry her. Manfred is reasonably satisfied with the arrangement except for the arguments about their frozen female embryo. Three years after their marriage, Mandred is on the run while his divorce is being processed.Manfred is harassed by Alan Glashwiecz, who has been retained to pursue Pamela's interests in the divorce. However, he also encounters Annette -- a representative of Arianespace -- whom he had previously met three year before. Annette breaks his preoccupation with Pamela by seducing him in her apartment.In this story, Amber is his daughter, who eventually gets thawed and birthed. She gets her first neural implants at the age of three and finds herself able to function in the adult world. Yet Pam doesn't consider Amber worth consulting on her life and raises her to be independent of her neural auxiliaries. So Pam runs away at the age of twelve.Sirhan is the son of Amber -- the one in Jupiter orbit -- who grows up to be a historian. He legally seizes his mothers assets and drives her into bankruptcy. Then the other Amber -- the one on the interstellar voyage -- returns to find that she has become a party to the lawsuit.This story reads like William Gibson on Angel Dust. The story starts out strange and gets even wilder. Of course, the Singularity has something to do with it.This story took the author five years to write. One suspects that he had to take time out to let his brain cool. Enjoy!Recommended for Stross fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of the coming Singularity, expansion into space, and interstellar aliens.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"[This review was first written on my web site. Amazon does not allow URLs to be embedded, but if you google on gordon's notes you can probably find the online version -- that one has lots of fun links to explore.]Charles Stross is a former pharmacist, former programmer and journalist, certified geek, and current full time writer. Most people would tag him as 'science fiction' writer. From what I've read of his journals, and especially his books, he's terribly bright and very imaginative.Accelerando is one of his commercially successful books (scan it for free before you buy at accelerando.org). The amateur Amazon reviews are well done (one of the two 'professional' reviews is by someone who didn't read the book); I can't add much to them. The book does not fully succeed as a novel -- it was published as a series of short stories and it doesn't hang together all that well. There are some annoying plot holes (no security on the goggles? Did one of the lead characters flee to alpha centauri or commit suicide? Why is Pierre asking what happened - he was there?!), some dangling and overly fluid characters, and too many annoying synopses of 'what went before'. The writing itself is professional, and that's no mean trick, but the work would have needed a harsher editor and a complete rewrite to fly as a novel.That's ok, because it's really a series of speculative essays disguised as a novel -- and the thinking is deep and creative. I thought I was being a bit whacky when I blogged about the spanish inquisition as a corporation, and the emergent sentience of corporations in the ecosystem of economic interactions, but Stross goes much, much further. He plays with the idea that at some point the relationship between finance wizard and financial instrument might be inverted, so that souls would be traded by sentient financial instruments. That's not bad; I can just about see how it might happen ...The embedded essay I most enjoyed reading, however, is on one of my all-time favorite topics -- the Fermi Paradox. This is one of those conumdrums that bothers a very few people a great deal and is irrelevant to most of humanity.In short, we ought by all rights, to be overrun by little green beings. The puzzle is that we appear to have much of the galaxy to ourselves. To the Fermi fan-boys this is the biggest question around, to which matters of theology or epistemology are merely academic.The answer to the Fermi Paradox is most often expressed in the terms of the Drake Equation. The best bet is that something utterly inevitable ends all technological civilizations like our own in well under a thousand years. The most popular candidate for an \\"inevitable fate\\" over the past 23 years has been the Singularity (Greg Bear's 1982 short story 'Blood Music' is the earliest version of the Singularity theory I know of, Vernor Vinge developed the ideas extensively in the early 1990s.) Stross takes these ideas and pushes the boundaries. Why might a post-singular entity find travel unappealing? Why would it be hard for entities like us to live near such a beast -- even if it didn't spend any time thinking about us?Reading Stross is like having an extremely bright and free thinking fellow over for a beer (or something, these UK writers seem fond of a range of substances). He tracks all over the place, the narrative doesn't always hang together, but it's a heck of a lot of fun -- and where else can a geek get his Fermi fix?"},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Charles Stross has managed to generate an excellent reputation in science fiction in a very short amount of time (note his *three* Hugo nominations in a single year, which is a nice trick for anyone to pull off). And while Stross' work to this point has justified the growing reputation, Accelerando is the clincher -- a three-generation-spanning explosion of ideas about future of humanity that's just mindblowingly fun. Stross starts the reader in the very near future -- the shallow end of the pool, as it were. But things get deep fast as Stross extropolates technology accelerating at blinding speed and humanity (and, well, others) doing its damnedest to keep pace.What's nice about Stross' writing is that even as the ideas get wild, the writing stays grounded; it doesn't hurt to be a hard-core futurist when reading this book, but it's not absolutely required. What *is* required is a willingness to let the top of your head get screwed off while Stross pours in several gallons of wild speculation. If you can handle that, you're going to be in for a treat. Acclerando is one of the books the rest of the genre will calibrate from.Will this book deliver yet another Hugo nomination for Stross? It'd be a shame if it didn't."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Accelerando is a mind-blowing, thought-provoking collection of novellas that are tied together into one giant novel that takes the reader from an evolutionary and almost recognizable future to a revolutionary and bizarre one. Stross shows a masterful ability to wield his impressive knowledge of computing technology and other intellectual disciplines without boring those readers who aren't technofreaks or social scientists. It is one of those rare novels that manages to be simultaneously educational and entertaining.The prose can be intentionally in-your-face at times, but the contrast of this occasional brutality with the delicate intricacies of Stross's wide-ranging vision only makes Accelerando all the more intriguing.Along with Neal Stephenson, Charles Stross is one of the finest and most exciting SF authors writing today."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I recommend this book. It's accessible, but Stross respects his readers enough that he doesn't write to the lowest common denominator. I found the first half of the book absolutely fascinating - I couldn't put it down and I was glad for the five hours on the plane to grant me uninterrupted reading. Many challenging conceptual extensions of today's bleeding edge - a real pleasure. The next 30% of the book was a long setup for the last few pages, and I didn't enjoy the same sense of discovery as in the first half. Frankly, the last 10% was a real challenge to finish, but the payoff is worth it."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I attempted to read this, got about 60 pages in and decided that it wasn't worth the effort. I didn't like the main character, didn't care what happened to him and wasn't impressed with the authors attempts to think of 17 radical ideas before breakfast and then include them all in the book. The first several chapters read instead like short stories that were a showcase of all the amazing ideas that the author came up with but were only thinly linked with the other chapters leaving the plot somewhat disjointed and incoherant. I've mentioned in other reviews that it takes a fair bit for me to not finish a book once started but so far i've been unable to convince myself to finish two Charles Stross books."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"By the time I finished ACCELERANDO, I was again reminded how it's just as well that we are, each of us, only so long for this world. With the increasing pace of technological change being what it is, this world is starting to get a little too weird for me already, and I'm not even 50! Imagine living in the mid-21st century timeframe Charles Stross sets his novel against: A time in which the interface between the human mind and the digital realm allows for a genuine expansion of consciousness and the evolution of our species into something new and just a little frightening.ACCELERANDO deals with three generations of the Macx family, beginning in Manfred, who could have been born in the 1980s and now, as a thirty-something adult, has vast amounts of computer processing power sewn into his clothing and experiences so much of his reality via the web that without his hardware he's all but deaf, dumb, and blind. In Manfred's world we are learning to literally \\"upload\\" the brains of living creatures, neuron by neuron, into cyberspace. Later, in the world of Manfred's daughter, Amber, humans can use digital technology to spin off \\"ghosts,\\" rudimentary copies of their consciences that can worry about rudimentary tasks. By the time Amber's son, Sirhan, starts coming into his own, most of the human beings in the inner solar system have uploaded into cyberspace, the inner planets are being systematically pulverized and turned into raw material for increasing computer bandwidth, and our own sun is little more than an energy source for a growing, almost God-like digital mind. Stranger still is the suggestion that intelligent lifeforms elsewhere in the universe often share similar fates.Needless to say, ACCELERANDO is highly speculative and ideological, even veering toward satire at times. The novel raises all kinds of provocative questions about the nature of consciousness, identity, and even what we commonly call the soul. In the process Stross throws at the reader all kinds of techno-jargon that we can barely make heads or tails of, though computer geeks will probably have a easier time of it. For me, this made the novel rather difficult to absorb at times, and the parts that take place in purely virtual reality got a bit annoying.And yet I couldn't shake the suspicion that maybe Charles Stross is really on to something here. 200 years ago a 70 year old and a 17 year old could carry on a conversation in mutually understandable terms. Today that's just not possible, and the pace of technological change is accelerating ever more. Technology, specifically digital computer technology, is shaping who we are as humans and what our society is becoming. Resistance is futile."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Accelerando is a painfully uneven work which shows its roots as a collection of short stories. Act I is a transparent free culture screed that includes one of the most ham-fisted and ugly sex scenes to ever be used as a transparent political allegory. The characters introduced are superficial 2-dimensional stand-ins for political movements without adding new insight into the debate. Act II is where the story gets good legs, shifting to a space opera pondering the probable incomprehensibility of super-human intelligence. Act III and IV are anti-climatic."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Next to no science in this science fiction- it's mostly a world of reimagined legal and business systems that don't hold even fictional water. As for the style- meme spew."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"How much you love Act 1 really depends on your political philosophy.Basically, in Act 1, Stross postulates an economy where your wealth depends on how much you give to others and create value for others. It was insightful and interesting, but utterly fails in two aspects: he conflates economic terms, and gives far too much time to exposition by the various characters about how evil the other side is. The protagonist wants to give everything away for free, contributing to society on his own terms. But Stross keeps using \\"capitalism\\" to mean \\"government takeover of your assets to use for the common good\\" It is like reading Ayn Rand, but backwards, and it made for a distracting, ranting lecture that didn't even make sense due to Stross' conflation of terms.In Act 2, Stross goes more into the hardcore SF that we expect of him. In the rest of the book, we deal with some of the usual Stross themes: uploading of consciousness to computers, and also his own ideas on how the Singularity may come about and what it would mean for humanity. And of course contact with aliens, who have undergone their own singularity. It is a frightening and fascinating future described here, where the Singularity will not be good for humans at all. At least, what we think of as humans now. His examination of uploading of consciousness is treated in more detail and with more repercussions than I've seen in many books that deal with the issue, except perhapsThe Golden Age.Finally Act 3 will be interesting for fans of Caprica or Dollhouse: creating AIs and computer simulations of people based on every recorded bit of information about them, and speculation on are they really the original people, or a copy, if you can't tell which one? And what is life? Fans of this theme may also be interested inAfter Life - Novella.If I have one complaint, the book really should have been 3 books, since it reads more like 3 novellas, with tenuous connects between them, and sometimes seems more to be a list of ideas rather than fully fleshed out novels."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed the first third of the book. It was just futuristic enough to feel like a better-informed Gibson novel. In fact, the barrage of specific \\"cultural\\" references make me think I must have crossed paths with the author at some time in my on-line life back in the early- to mid-90s.Unfortunately, the last two thirds of the book followed a disjointed Schismatrix pattern without maintaining verisimilitude of the future. Without offering spoilers, turns of phrase common today were used far in the future by people with no real reason to find that phrase culturally contemporary at any point in their lives. (Ouch, I tortured the language to avoid revealing too much.)I forced myself through the rest of the book, hoping for Act 3 to pick up significantly, only to have an extraordinarily weak payoff in the end. The only way to have a more disappointing ending would be for it to be purely solipsistic.I'd advise buying a used copy and enjoying as much of it as you can. If you pupated in the Internet world of Ultrix/BSD/Linux/SunOS and Usenet back in the day, you'll have a lot of positive chuckles and not a little bit of future envy."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"The first third of this book is some of the most head-exploding wildly visionary futurism you'll ever see in a novel, fully rivaling Neuromancer or The Diamond Age. The second part is not bad but slows down a bit, as it fails to really fully explore the possibilities of the posthumanism it postulates (apologies for the alliteration). The third part contains essentially no new ideas, and is merely a reshuffling of characters that are by now as used up as yesterday's technologies."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Having read some of the author's short stories and loved them, and being a fan of all forms of science-fiction, I snatched up \\"Accelerando\\" when I saw it in a store. I took it on holiday with me, where in two weeks I read seven books. At the start of the holiday, I read the first 100 pages of \\"Accelerando\\". On the plane trip home, with nothing to read, but I left the book unfinished.Despite the enthusiasm with which the author writes, and the great dialogue and narrative, the story just doesn't go anywhere. For two hundred pages the main character spoke to other characters and had his external memory stolen, leaving him semi-amnesiac. But that was all. He found his memory, which was stored in his intelligent glasses. I didn't find any motivation to read on.The book's full of awesome ideas. There are a lot of ideas for tech, for how the world might be, how it might look, what its people will be like - there are philosophical questions, emotional tangles, relationship difficulties. But there are so many of these that the story goes nowhere. It's interesting to read, but there's no drive to continue the story, because the first half of the book has little story indeed. In fact it seems to be structured in smallers stories lumped together to form a disjointed novel, with gaps of years in places and few stories threads picked up from the last chunk. Really, it's too much of a good thing - far too much. Why the author didn't incorporate these ideas into a focused series of short stories, for example, and take advantage of them, I have no idea. He instead wastes them in a novel that passes them by immediately, while at the same time managing to slow the actual story to a crawl.It's a shame I never finished this book. I tried. I've only ever failed to finish one other book in all my life, and I'd hoped it would be the only one. I'd only recommend \\"Accelerando\\" if you have a lot of time and a lot of patience. The ideas are truly wonderful, as is the snappy style. It's just a shame it gets in the way of the actual plot."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Charles Stross is full of mindbending ideas, bur in this book they don't translate into a fully rewarding story. In my edition of the book, the publisher didn't bother to say that this is a collection of interconnected short stories - a factoid that I had to learn elsewhere. Furthermore, interconnected short stories (presented as nine chapters here) are fine in themselves, except in this case they are not fully self-contained because Stross has attempted an overall thematic structure for the whole collection. But the whole collection doesn't come together either, because of the imperfect connections between the chapters. This makes the book rather disappointing and exasperating for the reader, because Stross's great ideas zoom by in snippets making up a fractured overall storyline that becomes increasingly incomprehensible as the book chugs along. I had to read the book jacket blurb several times to remind myself of what this book was really about, eventually resorting to outside sources, because the storyline becomes lost under a parade of futurist ideas, bizarre characters, and strange cyberspace settings that zoom by with hard-to-decipher connections to the main point..With those complaints being made, the forward-thinking reader will surely discover in Stross a huge imagination and intellect, with cosmology-sized ideas. In this collection of stories Stross reconstructs the universe as made up of infinite quantities of data processors that operate as a cosmos-wide network, with species intelligence as the lynchpin for awakening the artificial intelligence of supposedly inert matter. Stross also has a collection of intriguing tech-savvy protagonists, especially the heavily wired venture altruist Manfred Macx. With all the great ideas on display here, Stross could have expanded these nine interconnected stories into nine self-contained powerhouse novels, That's probably what he should have done.

Not bad, but not great either, IMHO, so I ignored Stross for a few years.On a whim, because I had heard so much about it, I paged through the start of Accelerando at the library. And ended up checking it out right away. Part 1 reads like a punky, sassy Bruce Sterling, updated to reflect 2005 tech culture and memes. With memorable characters like the despicable IRS dominatrix and the AI cat. Gotta also love a book that openly criticizes the likely impact of us boomers' entitlement programs on near-future economies.Once the Singularity gets truly and well underway, in parts 2 and 3, Accelerando becomes a bit less gripping. Partly because the big-picture techiness is explained more directly and repetitively, rather than inferred from the story. Partly because some things aren't developed very well. For example, what they find in the big cosmic router in the sky was confusing and somewhat of a letdown after all the buildup. I loved Field Circus' imaginative take on interstellar travel though.Nevertheless, the book remains highly readable, has a nice conclusion and some truly interesting ideas. Like, postulating that super-high-tech civilizations will descend into parochial isolationism rather than explore their surroundings. Not sure I buy all of that, but it is logical and well explained. And I appreciate Accelerando's relentless optimism about the future, which is in refreshing contrast to all the copycat dystopian SF out there."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I've never read Stross but I had high hopes going in to this one. I couldn't have been more let down.His writing is so complexly written that it is barely readable. And I don't mean he needed to dumb it down. I mean his sentence structures were convoluted enough to make Accelerando seem worse than it was. A few examples:\\"A standard network of independent companies, instantiated as cellular automata within the Ring Imperium switched legal service environment.\\" (Pg. 206)\\"Economics 2.0 apparently replaces the single-direction layer of conventional money, and the multiple-inderection mappings of options trades, with some kind of insanely baroque object-relational framework based on paramatized desires and subjective experiential values of the players, and as far as the cat is concerned, this makes all the transactions intrinsically untrustworthy. (Pg. 341)\\"\\"...and in this reincarnation-intermediated traditionalist polity for the hopelessly orthohuman, you can score credit for formality. (Pg. 382)\\"Add to that a dizzying amount of \\"ideas\\" for virtually everything, such as suitcases and handbags that have emotions, lobsters that talk, ghosts of yourself everywhere collecting information, spaceships the size of a coke can, or duplicating yourself and having different lives and consciousness. It is all too much and drowns out any possible storyline that is hiding behind all the superfluous ideas.A quote on the back of the book says \\"Stross sizzles with ideas...\\", unfortunately that is all there is to this book. I might try another book of his but it may be a long time coming because of how boring and slow this one was, and if I do it will be with trepidation, knowing that I will probably find the same style of writing. Not a recommend.2.5 stars."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"The three parts of this book don't fit well together AT ALL. The only part of this book I found satisfying to read was Part II. Part I & III I had to push myself to read, and I just wound up skimming Part III to the very end. The visions of the future are quite interesting and thought-compelling, I give the author that. But at the same time, use of words like \\"blog\\", \\"Economics 2.0\\", \\"IP address\\" completely take away from the feeling that this book is supposed to take place in the future, since we all know these terms TODAY, and no doubt these terms will be replaced soon by other things. Knowing in advance the book is a \\"collection\\" of shorter stories at least helps me to understand why it was not a satisying read, as these type of hodge-podge books tend to always feel fragmented.

Strong characterization brings a complex, absorbing world to life."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"For me this is Charles Stross's best book. In a sense though its not a complete book, more a collection of short stories, keeping most of the same characters, at different moments of the future. That's is strength for me, because each story is quite strong and deals with a specific theme, but I can see that others wouldn't like that.Another attraction is wish fulfillment. If the future was like this, I'd be happy :) It's a bit like Bank's Culture novels and wanting to live there - not that this book is anything like the Culture - it's humanity's journey from now to 'post-singularity'.If you want some fascinating speculation on what life will be like for us in the technological future I have to really recommend this.

But those stories are intended to tell an ongoing story.And a fascinating story it is. Following generations of one particular family as they first approach and then survive through the Singularity. Something which turns out to be not nearly as gloriously wonderful for humans as is often projected.I have to admit I preferred the earlier pre-Singularity stories. For the simple reason that they were much easier to relate to. Not only were their motives more obviously human but so were their surroundings.That's not to dismiss the later stories which are playing with some fascinating concepts, but given their short story origins, there's not a lot of time to build the world and flesh out the characters and have something happen.While there are a handful of repeating characters who build up to be fully fleshed, most of the supporting cast don't fair so well. There just isn't enough space to give them depth.A fascinating read certainly, but the lack of a stronger through plot and more fleshed out characterization does hurt it."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I read this book a couple years ago and it stands as one of the greatest sci fi novels that I have ever read. This is the first book I read by Stross and led me to read many others. For me this one stands apart. It takes you on a technological juggernaut that leaves your brain pressed back against the occipital ridge. Obviously, the acceleration has left some readers confused and disoriented. But if you are a true fan of sci fi, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I have been a fan of the authour since reading Singularity Sky some years ago. I would consider the work to be Mr Stross' finest, full of some very original ideas: self aware financial instruments, companies which use sentient beings as currency and an exploration of potentional computational and communication limits which could explain the Fermi paradox.That being said the work is uneven and I found the signal to noise ratio of the first few chapters to be lower than ideal due to the overuse of buzzwords. The rest of the book is in my opinion as good as any science fiction I have ever read.In addition the Kindle version contained some unexpected hyphenation of words which I presume is a carry over from the paper original. Amazon should consider employing additional quality control measures to correct these errors as this is not the first work within which I have encountered them."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I enjoy Stross' style, but the novel seems disjointed.

Acceleration in the rate of change in society itself; to the point where absolutely nothing is static and it becomes impossible to meaningfully participate in the economy without becoming more of a computer than a human. Interesting stuff. Somewhere I picked up the observation that you cannot discern an exponential progression until only a few steps before the end. For example, the algae that doubles every day until it fills the lake; one day before the end half the lake is covered, two days before the end there is a quarter covered, but it takes weeks of patient multiplication before the last few eventful days. To understand this book, one needs to understand the concept of the singularity--the point where available computing power becomes infinite. And, depending upon whose views one adopts, the intellect can be downloaded from the brain. We as a society, it is believed, are approaching the final crucial steps in an exponential progression in computing power; the effects of such power are presently unknown, if not unknowable.Stross simply adopts the furious state of change as the style for his novel and embarks upon a remarkable extrapolation of the development of society. Our penchant for legal manuevering seems to be a favorite of his though it is hard to imagine that petty squabbling will survive into an era of infinite information processing. Economics 2.0 was an interesting idea, as was the necessity of planetary development. I don't know if Stross lifted the idea of Matroshka brains--computers that become infinitely and needlessly complex without goal or purpose--but it was fascinating. (However, even if we haven't outgrown the f-word by now, can't we at least hope for an f-word free future?)But Stross' device comes at a cost in narrative understanding. My old unmodified brain could hardly keep up. One must be prepared for ideas flying fast and furious. But it was a good example of what hard science fiction can be and a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"While I will acknowledge that Stross' depiction of the future is imaginative, this book is devoid of both plot and characterization.

But the author throws out so much confusing technical jargon and ideas and concepts that much of the time I'm left bewildered as to what is actually happening.

I can't so much of the book is disappointing to read."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"This is one of Charles Stross's best books/ Lot of grand ideas and long time frame. Very interesting and a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I just finished reading the book for the 3rd time since it was released. I found the concept utterly fascinating and his world infinitely vast, intellectually and scientifically bright, stimulating and hip. Imagine taking Cory Doctorow, strapping him to a relativistic rocket and seeing what he looks like in a few hundred years of breakneck societal and technological change.Although the book suffers from a little \\"Neal Stephenson ending\\" (where the book is so powerful it becomes impossible to conclude it gracefully) and the character development slows down after the first few chapters, the unbelievable journey it takes you and humanity is worth the price of admission.It's still on the bookshelf of novels I will read again. As a previous reviewer stated, resistance is futile."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Another great novel on the singularity by Stross. If you liked Singularity Sky and Iron Sunrise, you'll like Accelerando. Like his previous work, he's a non-stop idea factory, turning out a new idea every few pages (although this slows down in the second half of the book). But it's not just ideas that are his strong suit, he follows through with the ramifications of a post-human civilization and what could become of it. Great story and interesting characters."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Great story based on some of the latest scientific developments under way and the new possibilities they open.It is a fantastic weird story that touches into the uncomprehensible, but puts a seed into our minds that makes us question where are we heading with the new technologies and makes us see the inevitabillity of the great changes coming our way."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Charles Stross has two different types of science fiction that he writes. One is heavy on the science and invokes a lot of deep thought and contemplation. The other is heavy on the fiction and uses science to support a compelling story. This book is in the former mode while I prefer the latter. If you enjoy books that discuss important issues and make you think then this is the book for you. If you are more like me and read SF for easy reading to relax then give some of Stross' other books a try and they will probably be more to your liking.This is a well written book by a great author but it is not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"This isn't deep-space laser battles between lantern-jawed swashbucklers and tentacled aliens, with a little nanotech and cybertech thrown in to modernize the story.

Stross puts the novel back in novel. This book is dense like star stuff with scientific extrapolation. From self-replicating limited liability corporations to quantum copiers to AI-enhanced post-humans able to make copies of themselves to intelligent planet-dwarfing gas clouds, Stross takes his readers on a wild ride that makes William Gibson look relaxed by comparison. Here's one little taste:\\"Welcome to the fourth decade [of the 21st century]. The thinking mass of the solar system now exceeds one MIPS per gram; it's still pretty dumb, but it's not dumb all over...Human cogitation provides about 10 to the 28th MIPS of the solar system's brainpower. The real thinking is mostly done by a halo of a thousand trillion processors that surround the meat machines with a haze of computation--individually a tenth as powerful as a human brain, collectively they're ten-thousand times more powerful, and thei numbers are doubling every twenty million seconds...although there's still a long way to go before the solar system is fully awake.\\"There's a story here as well--several of them, actually.

The story is alternately a family drama, an adventure story and a space opera. The narrative does tend to fragment a bit at times, with abrupt juxtapositions between the former short stories and the futuristic geek-speak can be a little daunting, but when you've got a robotic cat that has willed himself to obtain sentient consciousness, space-faring lobsters and the dismantling of the solar system, you have one heck of a yarn.

The book itself is so loaded with rapid fire ideas and technological spin-offs that it is in itself an example of its own subject matter. I have a technological background, but there was much here that I had to re-read several times to get the references, and still didn't get it all, I'm sure. This is Science-Fiction which is about as close to the limit of how \\"high bit rate\\" it can become without becoming inaccesable to an audience at all.Like Finnegan's Wake for techno-nerds, it almost needs annotations for the average reader to keep up with all the ideas it spins off- i.e. using sentient beings as currency, reducing the entire mass of the solar system to computronium, self-replicating 3-D printers, star travel as data downloads, and on and on, laced with lots of casual techno-speak, some of it newly minted here. Stross even manages an explanation for Fermi's paradox (If there are advanced civilizations on other worlds, why haven't they come visiting?).People have complained that the characters are flat, and that is true, but this somehow fits with the subject matter. Human beings, such as ourselves, faced with such a constant barrage of future shock are likely to end up stunned and unable to keep up with the characters' intellectual motivations. These people's motivations are very complex as they react to their environment, and often their actions are related to technical issues we may not even understand. Thus it is natural that we don't relate well emotionally to the characters. In this way, the book and its effect on the reader mirrors its subject matter, whether intentionally or otherwise.This book is an amazing achievement but also disturbing in its treatment of Vingean singularity.

People can replicate themselves and live on two different time tracks and the ability to contact alien species is just a heartbeat away.The three generations of the Macx clan have done their best to adjust to a brave new world. Manfred is working tirelessly to get the franchise for uploaded minds while his daughter Amber has sold herself into indentured servitude to get away from her mother who wants her to follow in her footsteps as an unaugmented human. Sirhan, the product of another Amber who didn't go through the wormhole has brought the family together from various incarnations to help them make the history museum on Saturn a reflection of the history of the humans. The Macx family also must find away to pull away from whatever is dismantling the solar system to create a Matrioshke brain that is clearly more brilliant than humans in all their various forms.This novel has appeared as short stories in Asimov's Science Fiction magazine from 2001-2005. Each story has been extended with its own chapter in a seamless plot. The individual members of the Macx family and those who came into their orbit show three generations of technological change and how it affects society.

In addition, there are also a lot of promises made within the text itself about the use of these ideas in creating a cool story. Unfortunately, the book is largely a record of wilted expectations and unfulfilled promises. There's a good example of this in the 7th story, where one character teases the reader by musing about the difficulties of writing a story about the post-human future, where people can \\"fork their identities at random, spend years dead before reappearing on the stage, and have arguments with their relativistically preserved other copy.\\" These possibilities could lead to all sorts of interesting plots and literary devices. It's surprising that none of them are exploited in any meaningful sense. There almost seems to be a deliberate effort to avoid dealing with any of the storytelling potential/challenges of the ideas-for example, on the one occasion when a relatavistically preserved copy could meet a stay at home original or copy , the opportunity is thoroughly ruled out.Instead of exploiting any of these really cool ideas in constructing the plots, \`Accelerando' delivers a strange stew of pointless and stereotypical dramatized scenes embedded in a matrix of flat narrative and sketchy scenes which move the story along. There aren't many attempts to maintain or build any sort of tension or interest even considering the chapters as short stories. Incidents, setbacks and ideas are introduced and summarily resolved within a few pages and most are dismissed within a few sentences or paragraphs. An oft-cited distinguishing feature of the post-human is the exocortex. This stems from the brain's development of expanded capacity as a result of the evolution of direct interfaces with technological and software/informational networks. It's a pretty cool idea. However, in the book the exocortex is generally treated as an occasionally useful fashion/information accessory almost indistinguishable from a Blackberry. The exocortex looms large once, when the character Macx has his interface (a pair of glasses) stolen. Anyway, the resulting mess could easily become the backbone of a whole chapter or three , but the final justification for this maimed and hastily dispatched subplot seems to be making fun of a Scottish accent.\`Accelerando' is remarkable for the amount of direct commentary from the person/s telling the story. A fair amount of the narrative is both unmediated and undramatized, so it has an essay-like or sermony quality. I think that several thousand years of storytelling experience suggest that narrators are most effective in such situations when they assume a character (however tenuous) so that the reader can experience the story with them and take the assertions, judgments and feelings of the narrative voices in the right vein. Another lapse in characterization has to do with the chronicling of the disastrous impact of post-Singularity developments on the population that doesn't want to participate in it. Although the nature of the Singularity is such that neither the people facing it nor we are supposed to be able to understand it, that's no reason to avoid showing how it threatens them and how the threat is perceived by its unwilling victims. Lots of authors have come up with good treatments about people dealing with natural and other types of vast, inevitable and incomprehensible catastrophes, and the disaster takes on a character of its own-case in point \`A Perfect Storm'.In the end, \`Accelerando' seemed like a hodgepodge of material waiting for some big ideas to pull it together into a first draft."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"If Stross speaks the language he writes, he might be your geekiest best friend.

Alas, the surrounding context itself is loaded with geekspeak, so readers have unpleasant options--put up with it; invent your own meanings; or put the book down.Stross offers some interesting plots and subplots here, but the vocabulary noise is so high that I found it a dull burden to slog through to the end."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"This book has received great acclaims for the many ideas and concepts presented in it &mdash; if you trust the raves on the cover.

There is nearly a complete lack of action of even the most basic type. I'd bet 99% of the verbs used are simply dialogue cues like \\"said\\" or \\"replied\\". If it were dialogue between interesting characters that generated some suspense this wouldn't be such a bad thing. But Stross seems to think that describing a \\"day in the life\\" of his characters is a substitute for a plotline.The characters accomplish some amazing things that would have been fascinating to read about--but Stross simply SKIPS these parts to focus instead on the aftermath. It's like watching a football game where somone hits fast forward whenever the ball is snapped and only stops to play the huddles. My recommendation is to get it from a library and skim it for the paragraphs of technological extrapolation conveniently located at the tops of many chapters. It's what I wish I'd had done."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"WOW. What a blast. If you're a fan of singularity theory, hard scifi, or bug-eyed \\"holy f'ing sh**\\" post-drug-like mental burnout, Accelerando is the book for you.In a series of what seem to have originally been anecdotal stories, now tenuously linked together into a single plot, Stross follows three generations of the Macx family, and covers pretty much every piece of amazing technological, scientific, and societal change you can imagine, with nigh-incomprehensibly geeky tidbits being thrown in every other sentence along the way. And the best part? Perfect suspension of disbelief. His piece of fiction sold me on the singularity all by itself - it's just so credible!The whole thing reads like his initial main character's (Manfred Macx) stream of consciousness. Mind-blowing idea after head-hurting concept explodes through the pages like the information streams in the AI-populated depths of the Matrioshka brain his solar system becomes, and by the end I myself felt no small degree of future shock. This stuff is food for intelligence-amplified thought by the 'avabit'. There are some plot twists, drama sequences, and amusing one-liners in there as well, for those who want some literary traits as well.Complaints are few, with the main two being that:a) the little explanatory \\"welcome to decade the xth\\" bits aren't quite integrated enough; you almost at times get the impression that there are alternate possibilities for the same timeline being written about.b) By the end, it seems like things are going backwards. The characters who in earlier parts were the catalysts for the singularity seem to become technosocial conservatives, and it becomes hard to tell whether certain technologies have become so integral that he stops mentioning them, or whether the technologies have been cut back on or partially given up. The new human society at the end has apparently retrogressed, and the sudden reversal of trend causes some confusion.Overall, I wholehearedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"When I first started reading the book, I was more than a bit put off by the over use of early 21st century in the first chapter, but I stuck with it...and the rewards were worth it. Since reading Vinge, Bear, and Gibson, I have been very interested in the idea of uploading a personality and space exploration using uploaded avatars. Stross does a great job of exploring those notions. Even better was his conceptualization of post-human intelligences as limited liability corporations. This was a subtle but compelling idea in the story...that our corporations would take over is a new idea...The book is a lot of fun with interesting ideas, and I highly recommend it it you like \\"cyberpunk\\" types of science fiction. The ending didn't do much for me, but the middle was worth the trip."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"An excellent look at the next century from an author who not only believes in the singularity, but looks beyond to see where it will take us on all levels. Good hard science, but interesting characters too. It's presented as a series of chapters which appear at first almost like a collection of short stories, but in reality they link together seamlessly. This almost put me off when I first saw the structure, but it works brilliantly, and allows him to cover a century in detailed chunks, without having to write a 15-novel saga.If you've enjoyed other Stross novels, or other hard sci-fi writers like Alastair Reynolds, then you will love this book."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I have a hard time disliking Charles Stross. I really do. He writes like someone who's in love with their subject and in a good way. The first book of his that I read, \\"The Atrocity Archives\\", sold me at the first Cthulhu reference. \\"Iron Sunrise\\" was quite enjoyable also.But \\"Accelrando\\"? Oh god. Where to begin?One of the noted qualities of good literature is that it ages well. In other words, a reader can pick up the book fifty years after it was written and find it enjoyable. Some even hit the hundred or multiple hundred year mark (Dante, Shakespeare, etc) and have survived so long because they aged well.If your central character is talking about updating his blog with travel photos and suffering from being Slashdotted in a bar in the very first chapter, you've already dated yourself horribly at this point. Fifty years down the road, people will read this and have a hard time empathizing with it. Hell, three years down the line it's almost making me laugh.The barrage of pop-culture memes and references aren't helping much either.When all of these things are dated, irrelevant, or just plain wrong a few years down the line, the book suffers for it. And it's painful to see a good writer suffer for it too."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"This book managed to come in second in this year's Hugo Award voting. Unfortunately, I don't think it deserved that kind of recognition.This is another entry in the 'hard' sf sub-genre, one that has as its major point of focus the Vingeian Singularity, which assumes that technological progress is on an exponential slope that will eventually lead to a complete breakdown of civilization as we know it, being replaced by artificial intelligences that will consume all the physical resources of the solar system.The book is episodic (which follows naturally from its roots as separate short stories), covering three generations of one family as the world moves from pre-Singularity to post-Singularity times. It also leads to the major problem with this book: none of the characters are particularly well-defined or explored in depth. Many of their reactions to the events of this book do not ring true, do not ring human. Of course, Stross may have been trying for exactly that impression - humans of this future world are not the humans of today. While it is interesting in an intellectual way to see how a normal human will morph into something of much greater thinking capacity as he becomes more and more wired up to external computers, and eventually can become a disembodied intelligence, what is lacking here is any emotional basis for believing in these people. The scientific ideas run rampant over the story and characters, and some of those ideas will be difficult for someone not versed in computer-speak to assimilate and understand, leading to some confusion about just what is really happening at various points in the story.The 'solution' Stross offers to the Fermi paradox (if there are lots of aliens out there, where are they? Why have we seen no evidence of them or had any communications from them?) is plausible, and a lot of the ideas he so casually tosses around are intriguing and stimulating. But without a solid story and strong characters to work within this idea space, the book comes across as more of a scientific treatise than a novel.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Having read many of the Accelerando stories in Asimov magazine, I am anxiously awaiting their collection in this volume. From artificially intelligent lobsters to immortality to human transcendence, the dense strokes that Stross uses to draw out his stories and characters provide a strong futurist portrait of a fantastic (though somewhat plausible) humanity.

Accelerado is a very ambitious and discusses many ideas and concepts that are an excellent and unique view of the future but all the same very difficult to 'get your head around'.

As they did they promised that never again would we have to wait five years for a Windows upgrade. I suspect that for everyone who viewed this promise with joy, at least one other viewed it with dread.And \\"Accelerando\\" deals with the joys and the dreads of runaway tech, as the aliens, \\"The Vile Offspring,\\" take over the solar system, start dismantling the planets, and turn it into a giant computer. Mr. Stross's novel, actually a series of tales linked together in a generation-spanning way, starts out as cyberpunk in its first part, turns into a first-contact story in the middle, and in the end turns into a search for a new home. Each part contains three chapters, each one of which deals with a specific problem and ends up solving it--if only after a fashion.Dazzling at times, showoffy at others, with ideas coming at the reader in rapidfire fashion, the book will either surprise you or annoy you--or maybe it will do both."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Read this book for ideas and ignore most else. The ideas are entertaining ang probably worth the book cost. Most though are vacuous in that they have probabilities of less than -10 to the 33. LOLI would rate the book a 7 for ideas, especially as they relate to the internet culture, but the author failed to write a novel and thus gets a 1 for that. It is actually a loose collection of stories, with a mishmash connectivity to each other. This is not a book where you clearly follow a character or even much of an idea. It jumps erratically and is a hyper elongated material universal view which the author did not support informatively.The author presents the major premise that artificial intelligence will arise from the computational memory that we utilitze and that it will become independent and self-replicating. The early pages of cyber punk are used to show this. It is more illusion than based in substance. The problem is this reliance on AI and it's desire to self-replicate itself ignores the consequences almost immediately. Once nanotechonology is achieved then the small bit self-replicating model of informational computation have no reason not to immediately overrun the Human system. The 'Gray Goo' references are the failures, but their is no reason that Artificial Life would not immediately start to change Earth and humans from the get go. They would be a success and owe nothing to us. End story line before chapter 4.Start chapter 4 and a fun beginning that also is not seriously author supported. Amber is a good character, but the technology she uses would have run amok on it's own course long before they leave for the brown dwarf. The Ring Imperium was good but should have been more deeply developed, especially because when the expedition returns the left behind meat bodies had deviated so much from the expedition members. I loved the coke can spaceship with light sails and the heavy duty laser power system. More, more, and more again needed. The expedition virtual reality society was sub-standard and chaotic. This made it less understandable and brought deep doubt to it's sustainability. Virtual Image humanity is bizarre enough. The Brown Dwarf Inter and Intra-Galactic Router system is also out there. The problem is the working explanation of the author does not support it's creation or utilization. Enough, the ideas are staggering good and the application by the author neolithic.The return is the third section and more a 'deuz ex Machina' than the author says. The outer reality of the unknown is more than Humans could understand and ending the opus opportunity with a cat robot parlaying itself into the greatest god of our creation was too, too much. Yuck The imagery of Super Cat playing with it's mice as a central support for the story is inane or insane.

The prose style (especially early on in the text) felt a bit like Snow Crash; those vivid bits of lurid ephemera, that nearly comic book pacing, every tawdry details competing for your attention right alongside the critical core. And like Cory Doctorow on crystal meth, every ten pages bombards you with some prosaically twisted huge new idea (i.e., what would Islamic scholars have to say about bacon built molecule-by-molecule by nanobots instead of cut from a pig?)Accelerando takes us on a wild ride through a technologically force-fed, self-propelled post-evolutionary end-stage of humanity.

The last half is a massive slog through very boring and seemingly random characters saying and doing fairly ad hoc and meaningless things.At times, it sounds like the author is simply spewing out random ideas through whichever random character he chooses to use at that moment. The character development is absolutely horrendous. By the end, I couldn't care less what happened to any of them -- it was like some bad episode of Lost wherein people just go back and forth on the island, pop out unexpectedly, and say random things to each other...I _hate_ to get into a book and then feel so utterly put off that I don't want to finish it. Unfortunately, that is what happened in this case. Don't bother trying to read this.

I bought this and Glasshouse together to read while recovering from surgery. Thankfully, I had also purchased some other titles because after forcing myself to finish Accelerando I could not bring myself to even start Glasshouse.I enjoy when an author creates their own vocabulary to express new concepts but Stross takes this practice to an uncomfortable extreme. The number of new concepts being presented along with their associated descriptors was disorienting and hard to follow. Somewhere around the middle of the book, I decided to stop trying to understand the details and just focused on finishing the larger story. I was disappointed again. The End did not justify the means.My opinion: Accelerando as a destination is not worth the journey."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. The first half breaks out multiple cool new ideas per page, and that makes for a very interesting read. Recommended."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"This novel covers three generations of the Macx family, and how they cope with technological progress from the years just prior to the Singularity (for those who are unfamiliar with the term Singularity, it just refers to a time of extremely rapid technological development, actually feeding upon itself) to many decades post Singularity. This is really an amazing story that veteran writer Charles Stoss weaves here, mixing the human element in with a future that becomes more difficult to comprehend to mere humans, even ones augmented with mind enhancing devices. Along the way immortally becomes the norm, and transcending ones body is easily done. Non-human artificial intelligences far surpass human abilities, and non-terrestrial intelligences prove to be problematic.Overall, I found this book very well writen, and the ideas and issues presented by Stross will make a thinking person think more. However, I found this novel to be a bit too long and drawn out, and the parts about the computronium converting much of the solar system to more computronium a wee bit far-fetched...as a limited amount of data input will require only a limited amount of processing power to analyze all possible aspects of the data. This is all minor criticisms of a great novel, do yourself a favor and read it."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"This is my first Stross book. It is a fun but disorienting ride.

I have never ever read anybody who tries so hard to show his intellect in every sentence, in every word. If Stross could show how intelligent he is in spaces between words, he would do it. Reading Accelerando demands a portable wikipedia (I think I even spotted an all your base are belong to us reference) a great deal of Egan (who he shamelessly rips, even though he credits Vinge)and a lot of time. Read it at a pace of ten or fifteen pages per day and it will start making sense. Nice way out for the Fermi paradox, would like to see the Matrioshka brains fleshed out some more.

I spend a lot of time thinking about the future, but the breadth and scope of this novel is almost unfathomable.Having said that, I enjoyed the ideas most and the characters least. Some of the speculation about what the future might hold for humanity is simply fascinating. Some of it is slightly uncomfortable, even for a transhumanist like myself. Some of it is just hard to chew on. Perhaps I've been trained by society to demand all my information in edible, easily digestible chunks. Perhaps that diminished my enjoyment of this novel somewhat. Nevertheless, I think most readers of this novel will feel like me. The market for novels read only by scientists and genius futurists is somewhat limited.Characters in Accelerando feel a bit shallow. That could be due to the fact that there is so much jumping around through time and space.I think the book is worth reading merely for the larger ideas contained within. Some of them are absolutely fascinating, if a bit lofty. If you are interested in what technology holds for all of us, spend a few hours perusing Accelerando."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"While characterization and plot is somewhat lacking, it is no worse in those respects than many other hard SF books. Accelerando is THE most realistic novel of the human/transhuman/posthuman transition I have yet encountered.

But here's a case where the lingo actually gave the book its character and made it enjoyable.The story tells of several human generations who are influential during a time in the not-too-distant future when humans expand their consciousness through the use of computer technology. The tale is told in episodic form, so that at first one might think it was a loosely related series of short stories, but as it moves on, the relationship of the episodes becomes clear.Stross sees the world of the future in technical and economic terms and in the first part of the book follows a computer geek who sees his role as helping to reorganize society so that all of its members can take advantage of its huge productivity. One of the tools that that he uses is the embedding of human personality into computer memory. The world that he helps give birth to is known as Economics 1.0. In the second part of the book, his daughter ventures far from the solar system in search of alien intelligence and in the finale the humans escape from the world they made into distant space.What drives the story is not the plot, but rather the continual reference to the computer technology. While I'm certain you might enjoy the book if you knew nothing about how computers work, the more you understand about the innards and reasoning behind data processing the more you will be able to appreciate the tale. On the other hand, even though I consider myself quite familiar with technology, there were several events and characters whose significance I never quite understood because it was so buried in the technical language. Yet the jargon was so much fun that even though I knew I was missing something, I was absorbed by what I did see.Stross gives some neat, humorous and nasty twists to the tale, like the central character who happens to be a masochist (believe it or not, that's not only funny, but sympathy inducing.) or the sarcastic cyber cat who is intimately involved in the story.Stross throws around grand ideas about what the future will look like that invite speculation, even as they seem a little unlikely, but he presents the possibilities in such a way that you never think that he's wandered into fantasy.It was difficult to develop deep feelings for the characters, although the author certainly shows aspects of their internal lives, and I'm not certain how many useful insights into our own lives or society he provided. Instead, he carefully constructed one possible future that he cleverly hung lots of technology on, so that the book was a great deal of fun to read."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Writing style somewhat jerky. Tries to be too clever in places. No unity of time/place.... But this is a story about a jerky, accelerating future, and I find it overcomes those handicaps and fairly rattles along, spewing out thought provoking ideas all over the shop. Recommended for Iain M. Banks, Vernor Vinge, and Greg Egan fans - perhaps not recommended for those who prefer their SF to verge on the techno-thriller."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"The only other writer I've ever read who could fathom a post-singularity civilization was John C. Wright in his Golden Age trilogy. Stross is just gonzo-marvelous. Science and milieu take center stage in this novel. Not that I'm against that, but the story's characters were a bit flat. Especially Sirhan, the last generation of the Macx family at the center of the story. I find Stross's idea concerning the Fermi paradox somewhat plausible, if a bit humanocentric. I don't think he gives the aliens credit for being alien enough. After all, why should we expect aliens to undergo a singularity and convert their entire solar systems into seething giant computational intelligences just because humans might?Seeing the universe as a giant network, while refreshing to most humans, is still a rather human way to look at things. When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.In spite of these criticisms and ruminations, I absolutely loved the book and am very glad to have discovered this author, whom I now count among my favorites. This book really ignited my imagination and feel as though how I look at the world has been permanently altered a bit."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"ACCELERANDO(2001-2004) is actually a series of recently-published short stories, combined into a novel.It took me a few pages to come up to speed with the author's writing style, which reminds me a lot of Harlan Ellison's writing style. Once I got the hang of it, I started blasting through the pages quickly, it was easier to spot the numerous humorous passages, and was easier to keep track of the rapidly-changing technology (the main character from the first chapters uses the Internet to issue new patent applications and front companies at an expanding exponential rate, before his wife's divorce lawyer starts suing his companies using a similar online ruse).I've got to give the author credit for attempting all these short-range predictions... while most may come out looking silly in 15 years, it sure is fun to consider that even some of these technologies might be possible within the next few decades."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"This book was really awesome i liked it a bunch if you like this author you will love this book."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"A little long-winded, but entertaining enough to skip the middle part and read the end to see how it resolved."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I've always been a bit of a science fiction geek, in particular concerning cyberpunk and even more particular-er about the Singularity. So when I randomly came across this book which promised all of that and more, you can bet I was excited. Accelerando is told through the perspective of three consecutive members of the Macx clan. Except kind of not because older members keep coming back and influencing the narratives in other sections and the third generation, Sirhan, didn't really leave that great of an impressions with me.The first story follows Manfred Macx, living in the sort of near-future you could actually sort of imagine, especially now that Google Glass has become a thing. It was here that I first encountered the incredibly dense techno jargon. I consider myself to have a relatively good vocabulary but there were sometimes entire paragraphs where I wasn't quite sure what was happening. If you don't let that slow you down though, it's a very enjoyable story about the lead up to the Singularity.The middle tale is told through Amber Macx, Manfred's daughter, and in my opinion it's probably the most compelling. By the time we get around to Amber the human race is starting to upload their minds into the clouds of nanocomputers that some of the inner Solar System planets have become. I found this section to be particularly interesting because it explored what would become of the human race once resources are infinite and stupidity isn't even a concept anymore. It's also the section with a little less technobabble and a little more understandable story. Really good stuff here.Finally, we have Sirhan Macx, the son of Amber (real, meatspace Amber not uploaded, copied, forked section of existence Amber sent off into space on a thumbdrive), and while this part is still compelling, I couldn't help but feel like the tale had somehow run out of steam at this point. That's sad, as some of the most interesting and exciting bits of post humanistic society are explored here. After humans are essentially banished from the inner Solar System by malevolent AI, we get to see humanity grapple with how to maintain their relevance against their own creations. We also get into how, in a society where everyone has infinite back ups of their minds in the cloud, and human bodies (or anything else) can be reproduced quickly and cheaply, those who choose to let themselves die are considered suicide cases, and murder isn't even a crime. I wish some more time could have been spent on this rather than on dealing with the threat of the \\"Vile Offspring\\" who never really were fully explained though perhaps that was the point.Overall, this is an excellent novel that I highly recommend to anyone interested in the Singularity, or just science fiction in general. I know I'll definitely need to read it at least a few more times to get everything and to decipher more of the jargon. If you're a science fiction fan, and haven't yet read this, then you're definitely missing out."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Almost every book I read has a \\"working title\\" which describes how I feel about it. Gaslight Dogs for instance, is forever known to me as \\"That problematic colonialism book\\". Accelerando came free on my Kobo reader, and apparently it is filed in my head as \\"I like the lobsters best\\".This is a series of linked short stories exploring more and more distant futures of the singularity, when it becomes possible to upload oneself into a computer. Well, there's some debate about what singularity means, but this is a prospect of our cybernetic future.I really enjoyed the first third of the book, and my affection for it decreased with the technological sophistication the culture was dealing with. By the time the grandchild of our original protagonist is raising a clone of said protaganist as a child, I am a little detatched. In fact, I liked the uploaded Lobsters in Space a little better, probably because they are less prone to human frailty.I am an unabashedly character-based reader, and this book was not so much character-driven as technology-driven. It was an extended musing on the extrapolation of our current cultural obsessions and abilities, and what those might look like decades down the line. I was amused by the idea of rogue AI lawyer-companies all suing humanity back to the stone age.Read if: you like thinking about the future-that-may-be, you wonder what the nature of humanity is if we don't have bodies anymore.Skip if: you are going to feel awkward liking unembodied crustaceans better than humankind's continual messing up."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Charles Stross wrote Accelerando while high on meth, I think. Not only is it *densely* packed with author-coined terminology loosely based on the underlying technological innovations, but it's a meandering plotless testament to its own existence.It follows the trials and tribulations of Manfred Macx and his descendants before, during, and after what we can call a technological singularity, when the pace of progress reaches such a pronounced crescendo, it becomes self-sustaining. Stross's writing in this novel is both aggressive and clearly supports the implied exponential flood of progress that eventually leads to semi-sentient corporations that trade intellectual property like currency in a vastly projected version of humanity's current direction.It's that aspect that makes Accelerando most engaging. Stross's game of \\"What If\\" is both intense and absurdly optimistic concerning the unstoppable nature of innovation permeating and transforming society. But that's part of Macx's character, he pushes these things in places where they'd be most useful, hawking his ideas because he's a philanthropist who's abandoned the concept of intellectual property, so he's purposefully undermining it. In this universe, information wants to be free so badly, a genius can learn to trade ideas as a type of goodwill currency, and it works incredibly well for him.But it breaks down in stages. The novel was originally written as a series of short stories, and as we watch the generations of Macx's through the ages, the most potential is reached and wasted in Amber's Ring Imperium. Stross wants us to believe the richest and most advanced example of humanity can break down into the poorest, and this includes the intellectual capability of Amber herself. He wants us to assume the fruits of humanity's labor, our own technology and artificially thinking beings, can never be fully embraced by its creators. At one point, Amber is merged with a moonlet worth of computers, allowing her to live lifetimes in moments, making her a semi-goddess. Yet she somehow succumbs to the most ridiculous of human trappings in the end. I'm convinced this is purely because of the segmented nature of how the story was originally written---no clear goal and several intermissions can change an author's mind.And I'm not sure Stross knew how to end this novel at all. One aspect he explores is virtual beings and what happens when an entity fragments themselves to complete separate tasks. Manfred Macx has an AI cat named Aineko, you see, and after several upgrades, it's not only become sentient, but leveraged itself into a meta-god. Like humanity in the end, it forks and while fragment stays to oversee humanity's last vestiges living among the stars, its other half explores the source of the civilization that created a series of quantum entangled wormholes.And it all ends with the cat wanting to merge its two halves, promising to leave people alone to reach their own fates. But why? What happened to the expedition? Why did Aineko want to join the expedition when it was technically *already there*? What were Aineko machinations concerning Macx and his descendants supposed to accomplish? We never learn. The biggest revelation in the novel---the final destiny of the exploratory voyage and its findings---is never actually shared. All we really find out is that humanity is obsolete, but still infesting the galaxy with its own flavor of quirky tenacity. Did we really need an entire novel to come to that conclusion?I really hope this novel is not indicative of Stross's writing in general. I liked the pacing, and even though the writing style was incredibly dense, I liked his unapologetic embrace of its necessity to provide the breakneck pace Accelerando demanded. But I can't support the lazy conclusion or the schizophrenic behavior of the major cast. With no planned sequel, the story simply has too many loose ends justify the convoluted path Stross chose. This novel worked better as a series of short stories, yet even then, needs one more to truly finish the series."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"When I find an author that I like, I usually buy everything they write and devour it. Very rarely does this fail me, but with Stross I have found him very hit or miss. Singularity Sky was a hit for me. This book was not. I haven't even finished it as the characters are so whimsical and alien to me that I can't really care about their futures.To credit the people who have written positive reviews, it is CLEVER writing. The concepts are unique and interesting, but I just don't care what happens to the characters.In short, I like most of Stross' works, but this one didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"This is the clearest fictional exposition of the Singularitarian and Extropian schools of Transhumanism that I have found, though the final word here seems to belong to the Singularitarians. The reason I read this book, and the reason I would recommend it to you, is to understand the post-human H+ meme. You want your matrioshka brain? Your computronium? Your uploads? It's all here. Every H+ concept you ever wanted and more is packaged together in an often confusing but comprehensive little bundle. Now you can know what all the fuss is about.Do I believe this to be hard SF? No, hardly any of it seems anything more than fantasy. We are far from proving that the human brain can be modeled as a Turing Machine. I very much doubt that the brain is the juice computer that post-biotic transhumanists want it to be. And without that, most of this book falls apart as anything more than space opera. The microprocessor has over-run the imagination of the transhumanist nerdshare as the dominant metaphor for human consciousness. It's really rather sad, when the brain is in fact probably the least understood physical system on this planet, to view it as an overblown iPod.Apart from that, the characters in this novel are wooden and unbelievable. Sexuality is shown from a barely post-pubescent perspective. I think the author might want to steer clear of portraying normal human interactions in future writing. The book's jacket cover has quotes comparing Stross to Sterling and Gibson. What an outrageous comparison - both Gibson and Sterling can write circles around Stross. What Stross does, which the other two do not, is write good computer science extrapolation and speculation. Where Gibson and Sterling care about people, Stross cares about machines.But H+ is an important new religion and this book is a great way to understand key Singularitarian concepts. I am actually looking forward to having my own metacortex."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Yes, Miyazaki is mentioned. So is Dilbert and the lobster nerds reminded me of Dr. Zoidberg from Futurama.Accelerando is a romp through the 21st century and beyond. It is a rollercoaster ride through the Singularity and beyond into the world of post-humans.The story covers three generations from a very dysfunctional family (and friends) - an anarchist genius & cross dresser, his repellent and rapacious dominatrix/ex-wife, his kinky opera-rave-drugs-alcohol loving French girlfriend (perhaps the most \\"normal\\" person in the story!), the kindly and avuncular wealthy Italian communist politician, the wayward daughter who sells herself into slavery in a company set up by her dad and runs away to Jupiter to become a queen, her Islamic nerd boyfriend, her French boyfriend, her nerdy and prudish historian son and, of course, the arrogant, manipulative, swearing cat, Aineko (the real star of the novel). I forgot to mention the star ship the size and shape of a coke can!At the start of the book we meet Manfred Macx, an anarchist entrepreneur who makes strangers he meets on the street rich with business plans he dreams up and then gives away on the spot. He does this with great skill, much to the annoyance of both the conservative capitalists in America and the communists and socialists in Europe....Accelerando is a very full novel, it is almost overflowing with ideas and speculations. It does have some flaws, but none that interrupted my great pleasure in reading this book.The story also poses an interesting question: What if we do meet aliens in the stars and they turn out to be jerks? (Instead of our equals or superiors)Aineko, the wise-guy swearing robot cat, has simply gotta be in another novel!"},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I think I would have been better prepared to enjoy this book if I had known that it was originally published in serial form. In retrospect, it makes sense. Each section stands alone fairly well, but the sections only partially mesh as a whole. My favorite fiction has strong characters. In this format in particular, character development suffers.In Accelerando, humanity speeds to and through the Singularity (the post-human era often called \\"the rapture for nerds\\"). The story follows three different generations of the Manx family through the centuries as serial protagonists. As a result, I had difficulty forming real attachment to any single character. Despite it's depiction of the vast sweep of human future, this book is not likely to move you emotionally. It's telling that the most memorable character in the book is the family's AI cat.Really, though, the characters are secondary to the ideas. The ideas are so fantastic, and they come so frequently (about 1 new concept per paragraph through stretches of the book), that the end result, while not compelling, is still plenty dazzling. So, if you read your SF for the ideas, I think you'll enjoy this. If you prefer your SF as a vehicle to drive human character development, you should probably keep looking."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Where Singularity Sky impressed, Accelerando amazes.Where previously Stross seemed to be exploring the post-Singularity world, here he takes the reader on a full-on ride right thru it. Starting in the recognizable future, and then charting the way to the asymptote.Take an amph'ed up Bruce Sterling and stir in one part Warren Ellis and you've got the recipe for this book."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Where to focus? \\"Accelerondo\\" is series of short stories knit together over a technological Singularity (capital 'S': a very short time period in which massive leaps in technology redefine the world paradigm in such a way that it's difficult, if not impossible, to speculate about the new society that will form). It's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" in the future, where the story is about the evolution of the family, rather than the evolution of the individual. Unfortunately, the future isn't exactly bright... depending on your technological bend.Stross's future sees humanity uploading itself into supercomputers held together in a post-WiFi nanotech boom that explodes into a matter- and energy-mining operation staked out in Dyson spheres around the sun. (Pause and digest that. If you want to read this book, you'll be doing a lot of pausing and digesting--not to mention googling of terms like \\"Dyson spheres\\" and \\"Keith Bottles,\\" unless you're already properly nerdish and are familiar with these terms.) It's a surreal blend of modern cultural momentum and old-fashioned SF. Hard-core SF.The story is amazing in scope; Stross manages to juggle enough math, physics, and computer science to confuse even the nerdiest SF devotees (unless you happen to have a dual degree in some combo of the above fields). And while Geek Canon is madly saluted (with tiny nods to Slashdot, Dilbert, hacker culture, and probably ninjas) the story sacrifices humanity for science: the classic problem with hard SF.Just as you start to actually care about a character (most notably, Manfred, the first protagonist who pops up), the serial ends and you are forced off into deeper head-space with a different protagonist. The only stable element in the story is the AI cat, Ainecko, who deadpans her way through the story with a feline's rare grace and iron-clad wit. Schrodinger would be proud.Bottom line: If you enjoy science-based literature that stands to showcase the SCI at the expense of the Human element, then you'll probably enjoy this book. If you're more concerned with human interaction (and less thrilled with cold tech), go hit some literature like \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" by Audrey Niffenegger, or anything by Ursula K Le Guin (which can border on fantasy). These are softer SF which focus more on the people in the midst of some crisis, rather than focusing on the crisis itself.Not sure if you care about hard SF? Back up and read some staples: Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" series, Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Rama\\" series, and anything Niven touched.If you want to be truly indoctrinated into Geek Canon, start grokking Robert A. Heinlein's (very impressive) body of work, beginning with \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\"; \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" (first read the book, then watch the movie) by Douglas Adams is a must for all true Geeks; pick up a fake religion, such as Discordianism (via the \\"Principia Discordia\\") or Pastafarianism (long live the Flying Spaghetti Monster and his apostle, author Bobby Henderson); and start hacking your own brain."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"Apparently it really is possible to spend too much time with the GNU Manifesto. At least we can take comfort in the knowledge that the personal lubricant industry will do well as the technological singularity approaches.Some observations:- This book isn't bad, but for someone whose lexicon includes all the post-humanist buzzwords (of which a near complete survey is made herein), it's pretty obvious the underlying stories here are a bit weak. The shamelessly heavy obscurantism here doesn't work for anyone with a CompSci degree and who's read all of the transhumanism Wikipedia articles.- Characters suffer from what I like to call \\"post-humanist candy store syndrome\\" where post-human characters in a scifi novel have complete control over their (either real or virtual) environment, and go nuts with overdone immaturity interacting with it (i.e. morphing into ridiculous monsters and living out other childish fantasies). Even modern humans would get bored of this pretty quick.- Obviously written by an OOP fanboi. References to Python and Java are pretty laughable early on in the book. No attempt is made to continue the detail of following programming language development after a few chapters, probably as a result of the author being incapable of speculation in this area.- Along those lines, the hard scifi level of detail gets continuously more sloppy as the book goes on.- Anti-Objectivist/pro-communist propaganda is laced into the early plot in such a heavy-handed fashion as to just be awkward.- Has several \\"well, that's just stupid\\" moments, like killing grey goo with fuel-air explosives bombing and most everything involving the extra-terrestrials encounter.- Exhibits what I'll hereby christen \\"historical gravity well syndrome\\" where a scifi novel tries to fill in back-story in a way that over-emphasizes the history of the decade or so before it was written (i.e. talking about Richard Stallman, George Soros, Noam Chomsky, a thinly-veiled RIAA, etc., yet nearly completely ignoring the history from the present until the beginning of the book). Do humans today spend all their time talking about the 1960s while ignoring everything since then?- Most importantly, the book's universe is basically the myopic worldview of the salivating Linux freetards. This makes for a lot of cringe-worthy scenes and dialog that read more like a Slashdot post than an actual novel.- Despite all the above, it's still nice to see ideas like Matrioshka brains, lightsails, computronium, distributed intelligence, and exocortices come to life, but none of these ideas are original to this book. Hopefully someone less simple-minded will write a better book about them some day."},{"Title":"Accelerando (Singularity)","review":"I found the beginning of this book -- Part 1, \\"Slow Takeoff\\", the first hundred-or-so pages out of the book's four-hundred-plus -- to be thoroughly enjoyable. As befits the book's title, these pages gave me a palpable feeling of rushing headlong into an uncertain, exciting future. The protagonist, Manfred Macx, is the perfect focal point for this rush -- steeped deeply in the spirit of the future, dedicated to staying on the cutting edge of progress, yet still very human, flawed, relatable. The near-future built by Stross in these early pages is both exciting and very convincing: he extrapolates masterfully from existing technologies and trends to create a vision of the world in the coming years and decades that seems astonishing, and yet is still plausible, as we see individuals, countries, economies mutate into something less and less recognizable, yet always something believable.... And then I reached Part 2. Manfred Macx fades into the background, as the story focuses on his descendants and a new circle of characters. None of them are as convincing or remotely as interesting as the characters we meet in the first part of the book. The action moves from Earth into the depths of space: this is a big let-down, because much of the charm of the first part of the book came from seeing our world twisted and changed by runaway progress; it seems that Stross gave up on that, as if he'd grown tired of thinking up new ways for Earth to change, and so we're thrown into the sterile interplanetary void instead. As we read on, the characters only get more and more isolated from the most exciting and fast-moving parts of the Singularity.We no longer get a sense that the future we're seeing is believable: from this point on, the book moves in a series of large time skips, and the new technologies we see, and the ways in which we see them change society, seem totally severed from any sense of continuity with what came before. In fact, the book becomes something very similar to your standard space opera. Spaceships, asteroid mining, interplanetary empires, virtual realities, even wormholes, all make an appearance -- and none of these appearances are built up in a natural, believable, or interesting way. The book seems to degrade into telling, instead of showing: Instead of seeing the changes wrought by the Singularity first-hand as they evolve, we are simply told that the world is changing faster than ever; all the book has to show for it are a few bits of neat-o space-age technology that would be just as comfortable in any number of other science fiction works. After the halfway point of the book or so, from the reader's perspective the world's pretty much changed as much as it's going to: all the key bits of technology have been introduced, and have affected society about as much as they ever will. After that, Stross has to resort to simply telling us that we're seeing the 2.0 or 3.0 versions of gadgets we've already seen. The sense of exciting progress that formed a key part of the setting in the early pages of the book is now entirely missing.The people and society we find in this future are, for the most part, not very interesting either. All the humans who were most closely touched by the singularity have become, we are told, totally incomprehensible and unrelatable, and so we focus instead on people who use brain-machine interfaces, AIs, and immersive virtual realities as if they were playing around with smart-phones and computer games not too different from what we have in the present day. There are some hints of wider implications to these technologies, but for the most part they stay just that -- hints. More cases of \\"tell, don't show\\" -- we'll be told, for example, that a character has been deeply shaped by his ability to split off software \\"copies\\" of his own mind, but we don't actually *see* how this ability affected him; it's merely a part of his past that gets frequently alluded to, but never explored in detail. What we see instead is a mundane, neurotic, unexciting individual.\\"Neurotic\\" and \\"unexciting\\" actually describes most of the people we see in Stross' far future. Manfred Macx' descendants lack his zeal for life, and aren't nearly as much fun to follow as he was. They are less complex characters, simply put -- which makes them seem both more ordinary, and, at the same time, less relatable. One of the few remaining interesting characters is a non-human AI, which is mostly sympathetic because it seems to treat the human characters around it with the same boredom and lack of respect that I felt towards them as a reader. Manfred Macx himself puts in a few appearances here and there, but he seems to have become less interesting as well along the way.The plot is not engrossing. The characters we follow seem able to accurately predict what will happen next, even when they're dealing with super-powerful AIs that, we are told, can think circles around any mundane human. There are no real surprises. Nor are the conflicts interesting, nor is there any real emotional tension to speak of.The ending of the book is the biggest let-down of all. Without giving too much away, suffice it to say that it somewhat cheapens some of the few meaningful and interesting moments from the earlier parts of the book, and what it gives us in return is not worth it at all -- and doesn't really make much logical sense. In another display of \\"tell, don't show,\\" we leave the characters as they themselves argue about whether the events of the ending really make sense or not.Basically, while wading through the last three quarters of Accelerando, I kept wishing that I could instead read a book that followed directly from those first hundred pages -- I wanted to see more of Manfred Macx' life, I wanted to keep following the changes happening on Earth, I wanted to meet more truly interesting characters shaped by, and shaping, the Singularity, living in the thick of things. I think a more exciting story could have been packed into the near-future created by Stross. The far future, it turns out, is boring.Three stars for the excellent opening and the few fun ideas hinted at throughout the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Breakup","review":"This book is a must read for progressive managers.

Born a cripple, he could have been consigned to the rubbish heap but instead and against all odds became a celebrated writer of this Whitbread Book winner, &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; as well as an early book of poems. Without taking anything away from Joseph Meehan (a self portrait of Nolan), he couldn't have overcome his debilitating handicaps to scale the heights he did without the steady support and tender loving care of his family. A father, mother and sister who are such warm and emotionally intelligent human beings anybody would be blessed and proud to have them as family. The school principals, teachers and fellow students who accepted him, nurtured him and gave him the chance to prove himself equal to the best among physically whole human specimens are themselves shining examples of humanity who deserve as much recognition in Nolan's lifestory. Although it has been compared with James Joyce's &quot;Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man&quot;, it is in reality nothing like it. Whereas Joyce's work is for the most part depressing and full of pain and harshness, Nolan's story is so morally uplifting you almost forget its grave subject matter. Nolan's dazzling and inventive writing style is also unique and something to relish. He coins and mints new words which have a yet found a conventional meaning but are so emotionally accurate you know they're right.

This was a book that I read and reviewed back in February, and ever since I have been mystified why the book never seemed to gain the wide acceptance of readers. All of the reviews that have been posted by readers for &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; have been 5 star reviews, and the same is the case for &quot;Under The Eye Of The Clock&quot;.If you read you understand how difficult it is to write anything, much less a full book, and then have it selected for and win a prestigious award. In the case of the book I review now it was the 1987 Whitbred Award that was awarded to Mr. Nolan. All very impressive, but that's just the start.This is an autobiography written by a very young man who next wrote the book &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; and would take 12 years to do so. This is a painfully candid, but uplifting book about a man with the support of a wonderful Family overcomes extreme realities that are his life to become an Author of international renown.Mr. Nolan cannot speak, he can barely move at all. He types with what he calls his &quot;Unicorn Stick&quot; that he wears on his head, and even then his head must be supported while he works.An Autobiography is a courageous work if honestly presented. When you add Mr. Nolan's additional challenges he faces as a writer, and as a person living with his physical issues it becomes an extraordinary autobiographical book.I hope more readers find Mr. Nolan, he is a unique writer of immense talent, and if you pass by his work you deprive yourself of great literature."},{"Title":"Under the Eye of the Clock","review":"Under the Eye of the Clock is the autobiography of Christopher Nolan, the talented young poet with cerebral palsy. He can't walk or talk or write in the usual manner. Since Nolan lacks the use of his hands, this book like Dam-Burst of Dreams, the book of poems that preceded it, was written by means of a typing stick affixed to his head. The book succeeds both as pure artistry and as a window into the world of the disabled. Nolan has re-named himself Joseph Meehan and told his story entirely in the objectivity of the third person. This brilliant stroke allows him to avoid excessive self-pity while making his sufferings and triumphs real and deep. Nolan's use of language had earned him comparisons with James Joyce, Yeats, and Dylan Thomas. Nolan stretches the meanings and implications of words, rearranges their spelling, and even invents new ones to communicate his moods and perceptions and illuminate life, his own and those he observes, with his unique poet's sensibility."},{"Title":"Under the Eye of the Clock","review":"This is a great book!!!

The state of mind of a fully enlightened Buddha is not truly known by many of us in the West; we just don't have living examples among us demonstrating for each living being, the exact same heartfelt love in action that a mother has for her child. In giving this commentary, Geshe Kelsang Gyatso provided the living example one could refer to in oneself becoming a Buddha. Meaningful to Behold is therefore more than an exquisitely clear and precise compilation of method. It is more than a step-by-step manual for the highest personal attainment. It is the expression of pure love expecting nothing in return that inspires us to become the best and happiest people that is possible for us. Nothing inspires us like absolute kindness; this is absolute kindness in its most helpful and instructive form. It shows us how to be happy beyond anything we can now imagine. A very worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Meaningful to Behold: The Bodhisattva's Way of Life","review":"Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has written an incredible commentary to Guide to the Bodhisattva's way of life, extracting the essential meaning of Shantideva's precious text and making it applicable to Western practioners in today's modern world.Geshe Kelsang explains the complete path to enlightenment focusing specific chapters on how to successfully cultivate peaceful states of mind that ensure long-lasting happiness, and how to effectively eradicate negative states of mind that cause suffering and harm to others.He explains in detail how to cultivate bodhichitta, the spontaneous mind that wishes for all living beings to be free from suffering and why that mind is so important for ourselves and others.Geshe Kelsang also describes how to overcome our attachment and increase our love as well as other virtuous minds such as: patience , effort, concentration, and wisdom. He also gives an in-depth analysis of what the ultimate nature of reality is and why if we understand it, we can experience unlimited happiness.This is an advanced text on Buddhist thought and meditation for the serious spiritual practitioner interested in deepening his/her insight into some of the more challenging tenents of Buddhism. It is incredibly inspiring and demonstrates clearly that the author Geshe Kelsang Gyatso is an extraordinary being."},{"Title":"Meaningful to Behold: The Bodhisattva's Way of Life","review":"This book is my favourite of all the books by this author.

It's a definitive text. Interestingly, the Dalai Lama provides commentaries on two somewhat shorter texts (one by Asanga and one by Nagarjuna) on the same subject in his \\"Illuminating the Path to Enlightenment.\\" This is a free book published by Ranjung Yeshe Publications. I have attended a weekend with Kelsang Gyatso including empowerments. It was certainly beneficial. This was the first of his books that I've read. It's one of the best of the 5 I've now read. It does, however, include list after list of entries in a very tightly organized outline-like format. I find such lists rather mythical because I believe the number in the list more important (and symbolic) than the list itself. Frequently such lists vary between authors and the entries don't seem to hang together too well. Nevertheless, this is a a fine commentary to one of (if not THE) classic text on the Bodhisattva Path."},{"Title":"Meaningful to Behold: The Bodhisattva's Way of Life","review":"The reversal in our way of thinking engendered by this book is not be underestimated. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's commentary to Shantideva's Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life inspires me to emulate the actions and reactions of a compassionate being. It is a celebration of the virtues of selflessness.As is often the case in Geshe Kelsang's books, original and often complex Sutras are explained quickly and simply. The original cannot otherwise be understood at all in this latter-day age.You will find reading this is like grasping the ideas of a Buddhist practitioner of 1000yrs ago.

The author of this book is the same rigid character who claims swatting a mosquito in anger will result in eons in the hell realm without any discussion of purification or karma in another one of his books, The New Meditation Handbook. He has a tendency to ignore some sides of an important issue like this.Of note, is the across-the-board 5-star reviews. Where is the critical thinking? The Buddha said to use your wisdom. Did that mean almost cult-like fervor for the author? Remember, the author calls himself a Geshe even though he refused to take the Geshe test when offered. Would you buy a book about medical health self-help from a self-proclaimed \\"doctor\\" without a medical diploma? The same theory applies to the author of this book. Gyatso refused the Geshe test and is not a Geshe, period. Therefore, he is no more an authority on this subject than any other lay person.The presently reviewed title suffers from the same problem. Comparing this interpretation to genuine and authentic Buddhist authors will instantly reveal the inadequacies of this volume. It reads like \\"pop\\" Buddhism for the \\"new age\\" Western Buddhist mind rather than as a serious commentary, which it purports to be.Again, with all the other commentaries available on the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, pick a title written by a genuine and authentic Buddhist author instead of this cloudy book.Postscript: I bought this book by Gyatso (and many others) when deeply into the New Kadampa Tradition. After April 22, 2008 (Google the date and the Dalai Lama), I came to realize the true nature of NKT and walked away from it.UPDATE:Somebody calling him/herself \\"Zombie Hunter Prime\\" writes in the comment section:\\"Screw the Dalai Lama, the little wussy has a bad dream, blah blah, blah...\\"Nice!

As the tital suggests one of those stories is the history of the scientific struggle to understand an animal originally thought to be a chimaera and hoax. The second story is that of the people, preconceptions, and politics surrounding the science of natural history in the decades preceding and immediately following the Darwinian revolution of scientific thought. Moyal, through the narrow lens of a platypus-centralized story tells of the struggles, missteps and transformation of western science from franco/clerical to anglo-colonial/secular domination, and finally to the global excersise it has become today. It is fascinating that many of the greatest names in 18th and 19th century science (Cuvier, Meckel, Home, Geoffrey St-Hilaire, Owen, Darwin) all studied to some degree the anatomy and biology of the platypus!The difficulties in studying the platypus are recreated in the pattern and pace of Moyal's prose. The overall progression of the book is temporal, but the chapters focus on the individuals and many of the chapters begin by backtracking in time to follow the story of another player in the story. This allows Moyal to explore each portion of the story she is telling as a series of mini-biographies, but requires diligence on the part of the reader to keep maintain an orderly timeline.What was even more suprising is the size of the book, 15 chapters covering 205 pages (in an 5 in. X 8 in. format) with glossary (incomplete, but good for non-scientists), references, and index bringing the total to 226 pages. Out of the box my first impression was that is was too short. However, by the end of the book I felt satisfied that Moyal had adequetly, though not exhaustively, recounted the history of the study of the playpus and illuminated the position of this enigmatic creature as a focal point (one of many to be sure) of contention and controversy during a crucial period in the maturation of biological science."},{"Title":"Platypus: The Extraordinary Story of How a Curious Creature Baffled the World","review":"Ann Moyal's portrait of the evolution of science with the Platypus as the centrefold was richly rewarding. The detail is a blessing as is the easy description of scientific terminology. I probably learnt as much about science as I did about the platypus. Complaints ? I don't read fiction so I love this stuff and it was too short. C'mon Ann, what's next ? *****"},{"Title":"Platypus: The Extraordinary Story of How a Curious Creature Baffled the World","review":"Ms. Moyal's book provides a good background into the paradox which the platypus has presented history and biology with.She sets a wonderful stage for the drama of the platypus, and gives many examples to explain how national rivalry and individual competition both helped and hindered the search for the truth of this curious creature. As she presents well, the search for science in the 19th century was dominated by scientists of great egos, and by international conflict, including the napoleonic wars. Ms. Moyal examines many individuals in the search, showing some characters in great depth and others only briefly.This is certainly a baffling creature, and an interesting book. However, though the subject and the mystery both provoke curiousity, one would most likely find the book boring if he or she did not have some special interest in the topic. It is, on the whole, a well written, informative read."},{"Title":"Platypus: The Extraordinary Story of How a Curious Creature Baffled the World","review":"Oviparous, viviparous, or ovoviviparous? That tongue-twisting question is at the center of this book, which relates science's attempt over the centuries to figure out where exactly to place the platypus, one of God's most wondrous (and confusing) creations, on the org chart of life. Central to the taxonomic mystery was the question of whether the platypus lays eggs (is 'oviparous,'), gives birth to live young ('vivi-'), or, like some lizards, hatches eggs within its own body ('ovovivi-').High school biology is not an episode I'm anxious to relive, but Ann Moyal does a good job in this little book of keeping matters from getting too complex. What she wasn't able to do, unfortunately, was keep the middle of the book from dragging somewhat. After several chapters relating scientists' struggles and competing theories on the ovi/vivi question -- and related matters like nipples, sex organs, and the like -- I was more than ready to skip to the end in hopes Holmes or Poirot or someone would step forward and reveal the solution to the puzzle.Things got really interesting again in the final three chapters, where Moyal introduces us to a self-taught biologist known as 'The Platypus Man' (not to be confused with Richard Jeni, who starred in a TV show by that name), to Winston, a platypus who traveled to England to help fight World War Two, and -- most importantly -- to the latest developments in platypus studies. I picked up this book in order to find out more about the platypus, not because taxonomy or the history of natural science are big interests of mine, and so I found these final chapters the most entertaining and rewarding in the book.In 1839, the Tasmanian Society of Natural History adopted the platypus as its emblem, and added the motto 'Quocunque aspicias hic paradoxus erit' -- From wherever you look at it, this will be a paradox. Ann Moyal's book shows how men have sorted out the paradox, and lets us benefit from centuries of effort to know this reclusive, fascinating, and mysterious little creature a little better."},{"Title":"Platypus: The Extraordinary Story of How a Curious Creature Baffled the World","review":"The humble platypus, which few have seen in the wild, created more biological debate in the 19th century than any other animal. In the 20th century, observations led to startling new findings about how the platypus reflects advanced evolutionary development.When I went to Australia, the platypus was on my most-hoped-to-see list. Fortunately, there was a nice habitat in the Sydney zoo that helped me to learn more about them. The platypus uses burrows as its land home, but spends a lot of time in the water. The platypus can consume half its weight a day in live food. To locate that much food, it relies on an advanced electrolocation method involving its duck-like bill. This method is more effective than the sonar-like methods used by other animals.Well, what is a platypus? First, you notice the duck-like bill. Perhaps a bird? Second, you notice the fur. Perhaps a mammal? Third, you see the webbed feet. Back to bird? Fourth, close examination shows that the platypus has mammary glands. Mammal? Fifth, the platypus lays eggs that are like those of reptiles. Reptile?These days, the view is that the platypus is a mammal that lays eggs, along with the echidna. But both animals confounded 19th century naturalists before Darwin when Divine Creation was the dominant theory of evolution. Elaborate classification schemes had been developed that traced everything into one neat family or another. The platypus did not fit.The first specimens were sent back pickled in alcohol to England and later to France, where dissection sparked a continuing debate about whether or not the platypus had mammary glands and whether or not their young could suckle. How the young were born was a complete mystery.The mystery could have been solved much sooner, but Europeans chose to ignore what Aborigines and Australians told them about the platypus. So European naturalists came and slaughtered thousands, looking for pregnant and ovulating female platypuses.Attempts to transport platypuses live failed for a long time, as did attempts to maintain them in captivity.Eventually, observations by European naturalists established the truth. By the time that Darwin wrote The Origin of Species, the platypus had become one of his greatest examples of natural selection. The platypus had kept some reptile-like features while having evolved into a mammal. Little did he know that the bill's sensors would become the strongest evidence for his argument.The book is well illustrated with many drawings and a few photographs that provide helpful perspective on this little-known creature.Ms. Moyal does a fine job of giving us a Down Under view of all this. She combines solid science, explained simply, with a subtle wit about the false speculations and plodding methods of pompous, well-respected scientists. You will enjoy what she has to say.After you finish this fine book, I suggest that you think about where the evidence around you contradicts what you have been told. For example, it is argued that education is very essential for children. What are the things that children learn to do outside of school (like walk, talk, ride a bicycle, develop a moral sense, and sometimes to read) compared to what they learn in school (like sometimes to read, how to use maps, calculate geometry, and do art projects)? What are the implications for how children and adults could learn more?Look for better examples and answers!"},{"Title":"Platypus: The Extraordinary Story of How a Curious Creature Baffled the World","review":"The platypus is such a quiet and secretive creature, it is hard now to comprehend that during the nineteenth century it created a firestorm of controversy, or at least as much of a firestorm as academic biology endures. The extent of the controversy, and the history of science's dealings with the strange creature, are the subjects of _Platypus: The Extraordinary Story of How a Curious Creature Baffled the World_ (Smithsonian Institution Press) by Ann Moyal. If you know little about the creature, you can learn plenty here, but more important is the story of how humans attempted to capture, understand, and classify the animal and how it came to play a role in the great debate over evolution.The platypus was such an oddity that at first no one believed it could actually exist. With an animal that was an amphibian quadruped with webbed feet, fur, and the beak of a duck, it is not surprising that some suspected a hoax. Central to classifying the platypus were the two questions concerning reproduction: did it produce live young, and did it produce milk for them? Richard Owen, the most influential naturalist before Darwin and who had an encyclopedic knowledge of anatomy of many species, was able to confirm the stories that the reclusive platypus did suckle its young, but the question of birth proved more troublesome. The obvious way to settle such a question would be to find a platypus home and see, but the retiring and removed nature of the creature prevented this for decades. Instead of suspending judgement on the question until this could be done, naturalists formed ranks on different sides, and argued over the issue in what seems now a useless and puzzling manner. Owen, originally a friend of Darwin and then a fierce opponent of evolution, tended to examine evidence to show his own view that the platypus had live birth, but it was not until 1884 that a naturalist shot a platypus which had laid an egg and had another coming down the cloaca. The long controversy was ended, and the aging Owen must have heard the news, but unfortunately his views on the discovery are unknown.Moyal's book is beautifully illustrated, with pictures of the platypus as envisioned by naturalists through the centuries. It is full of interesting facts about one of the most peculiar creatures on the Earth, one which has yielded surprising findings even after the big controversies were settled. For instance, although there is no placenta to connect the young with the mother platypus, the egg within the uterus is nourished by absorption into its shell, a process which egg-laying birds and reptiles do not share. Another surprising finding, and this only in the last couple of decades, is that the distinctive bill of the platypus (and it isn't hard like a duck's, but soft and flexible) contains a battery of electroreceptors which are so sensitive they can detect the tiny muscle discharges of the shrimp and worms on which the platypus feeds. The platypus, as revealed in this well-written and admiring volume, is not a primitive throwback as researchers from the nineteenth century believed, but a fully evolved creature of surprising beauties and complexities."},{"Title":"Platypus: The Extraordinary Story of How a Curious Creature Baffled the World","review":"My sister LOVES platypuses.

It is not, and doesn't try to be, a biological look as much as a view of how biology looked at a puzzling paradox. The prose is smooth and highly readable. The book introduces the reader via vivid thumbnails of some of the major scientific minds that tried to figure out just what this animal is and where it fits in the overall scheme of things. Along the way it dishes out platypus lore, legend and enough biology to satisfy and delight an interested layman, such as myself, and, likely, you, too."},{"Title":"Platypus: The Extraordinary Story of How a Curious Creature Baffled the World","review":"This is a little gem of a book. The platypus frustrated naturalists' taxonomic efforts and inspired some creative speculation about how exactly an animal that looks like a mammal might lay an egg like a bird. The scientific study of the platypus inspired heated debates, international posturing, and a surprising amount of awkwardly rhyming poetry. To be fair, this is not a weighty work and it tells more the story of European fascination with the animal than the biology and behavior of the animal itself.Still, this is a charming work of natural history and runs as a nice tangent to the broader fields of the history of science and evolutionary biology. It isn't for everyone, but it is a breezy, fun work of popular science for readers interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Platypus: The Extraordinary Story of How a Curious Creature Baffled the World","review":"This book was an amazing story of how one small creature stumped a bunch of stuffy scientists.

It was like reading a journal of my life over 35 five years ago."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Howard Hughes Revealed","review":"I was very displeased with The Mysterious Howard Hughes Revealed. It becomes very obvious that the author is staying away from the issue of Howard's serious codeine addiction. In fact, the drug use is only very briefly and vaguely mentioned in this book in just a couple of places about how Howard would take more medication than was needed. Nothing is mentioned about how Hughes would inject the codeine himself and that broken needles were found in his arms after he died. It is very evident that the author is staying away from this subject and even his obsessive compulsive disorder and poor hygiene are not really gone into in any detail at all.The main focus of this book is really the life one of Howard's aides, Chuck Waldron and how working with Hughes affected him. It makes for a dull read in my opinion mainly focusing on the logistics of moving Howard from place to place and his business dealings. There are also several flashbacks in this book that discuss lots of the early years. If you are looking for a really well written book on the later years of Howard Hughes get Howard Hughes: The Hidden Years by James Phelan. That is a MUCH better book and very candid about everything.

Here we revisit much of the material covered by Velikovsky in Earth in Upheaval and by other catastrophists in various other publications. Allen and Delair gather much new evidence, and the book in an encyclopaedic collection of this material. Here we encounter again the caves full of the shattered bones of large Pleistocene creatures which could never have made their way into the hidden subterranean recesses where they were found by their own devices. We visit again the frozen \\"muck\\" deposits of Alaska, where the bodies of mammoths and other Pleistocene creatures are found shattered and mixed with uprooted trees, boulders, gravel and clay, in wildly confused and pell mell accumulations. Animals that would never associate in life and creatures from both land and sea, are heaped on top of each other and their bodies smashed and dismembered. Yet the flesh and fur is often perfectly preserved by the cold. Often in their mouths and stomachs, as Allen and Delair inform us, we find the remains of their last meal, which they had not the time to digest. These included buttercups and other flowering plants, in full bloom. In short, these animals must have been grazing in summer temperatures, when some force lifted them, along with uprooted forests and boulders, and thrown them together in wild heaps. The only force which could have done this is a tidal wave - of immense dimensions. Shortly after this, the temperature dropped precipitately, so quickly indeed that the flesh of the animals was perfectly preserved and can still be eaten to this day.It is interesting to note that the one critic of this book who actually appears to have read it, dismisses the whole thing mainly on the \\"old and outdated\\" sources used by the authors. He does not even attempt to address any of the material found therein. Yet Allen and Delair have explained why they were compelled to appeal mainly to older sources: More modern studies tend to actually suppress much of the catastrophist evidence they find, or to \\"reinterpret\\" it in such a way that the reader is left wondering what they are actually trying to describe. Evidence of catastrophes, in short, is simply ignored. I vividly recall a series of BBC documentaries hosted by David Attenborough in 1993 called \\"Life in the Freezer.\\" The topic was life on the Antarctic continent. In one episode, Attenborough was in an area of the continent where the ferocious winds do not even permit the accumulation of snow. There, lying on the rocks, was a frozen seal, perfectly preserved by the cold. This was hundreds of kilometres from the seashore and hundreds of meters above sea level! The obvious question was: How did the seal get there? Did Attenborough ask that question? He did not! He simply noted how the extreme cold had preserved the animal's tissues perfectly.That's why Allen and Delair, my friend, have to use mainly old source material. At least in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, scholars were not afraid to report what they saw, and to ask the appropriate questions.My one criticism of the book is the authors' unquestioning acceptance of conventional dates and dating-systems. In Earth in Upheaval Immanuel Velikovsky traced the development of our notion of a ten-thousand year old Pleistocene, and showed just how suspect and arbitrary that date was. In the process, he presented a great deal of hard evidence placing the end of the Pleistocene no earlier than the time of the first civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia. The very growth of those civilizations, he implied, was closely connected to the terrible cosmic catastrophes so recently witnessed: thus human sacrifice, found amongst all the early literate cultures, would, in Velikovsky's view, have been elicited by the wish to propitiate the cosmic serpent (the dragon, or comet) and to divert its anger away from the world. All the early myths and legends are full of this idea. And pyramid/mound-building, also found throughout the world, would have had its origin in the raised altars (Latin, altus, a high place), upon which were performed these bloody rituals.All of this evidence is ignored by the authors, which is a great pity - though perhaps"},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"This is an amazing book of scientific fact.

Harlen Bretz proposed an outrageous, unbelieveable - but now accepted - interpretation of geological puzzles along the Columbia River as having come from a series of cataclysmic Ice Age floods pouring a flow of water 60 times that of the Amazon River down the Columbia. (See John Allen and Marjorie Burns, CATACLYSMS ON THE COLUMBIA, Timber Press, 1986). Allan and Delair's book does the same with the history of the Earth, gathering new research from diverse fields to show a devastating near-collision with a planet-sized object 11,500 years ago that resulted in world-wide crustal buckling, floods, firestorms, vulcanism and earthquakes. When the dust settles, their ability to think outside the accepted viewpoints to find a valid new understanding is likely to go down in history as epoch-making as that of Bretz. They'll likely be shown wrong in details; further research will refine and adjust, put I've a strong feeling their overall perspective will bring a new understanding."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"I usually enjoy resding this type of book because they are often thought provoking, even where the basic thesis is, at best, highly conjectural.

They pile quote upon quote (all well footnoted) in their attempt to prove thier case. However, they are so selective. Most of their quotes seem to come from obscure professors of about 100 years ago. Haven't they heard that there has been a revolution in geology since then (plate tectonics and all that) of which there is no mention.

Because organizationally the book is a 2-star and the writing in part 1 is hard to understand unless you like reading the encyclopedia. Part 1 is an exhaustive and exhausting history of geological research designed to prove how much the writers know and how bad they are at communicating it. So, unless you are a Ph.D., skip part 1, which I rate as a 1 star, until the end.Second, the book gets a five star for assembling data that is not well known, even today 15 years after publication. Similar to Sitchin or Drunvalo, the writers do a good job of finding data to support what would otherwise be a very exotic theory of global disaster in the recent past.However, the book does only a four star job of convincing the reader of the thesis that it all happened very quickly and dramatically because the dates can only be reduced to a span of time that is 4000 years long (from 10,000 years ago to 14,000 years ago). They use the average of the dates to make the argument that it all happened at once. I would have given this aspect of the book an even lower rating if it wasn't for the fact that they do a very good job of showing broad evidence for global episodes that did significant violence to the biosphere, suggesting that something very sudden and cataclysmic occurred.Finally this book gets a three star for the relevance of the data. While the data is sufficient to support their arguments, they fail to use enough up to data and competing data to make their points stronger. In other words, they cherry pick from the scientific record.In summary, the book is compelling, as the title suggests, but not completely convincing. I am convinced that the ice age did not happen as predominant theories suggest. So they do a good job of debunking predominant theories. But I am not convinced that Earth history enfolded in the way they suggest. For example a period of extensive volcanic activity can explain a good deal of the evidence. If the writers were lawyers arguing their case, they could easily win a civil case where you only need a \\"preponderance of the evidence\\". But the higher standard in criminal cases of \\"beyond a shadow of a doubt\\" is too high a standard for this book.

Much of the evidence of this disaster has been attributed to the affects of the Ice Ages, such as: glacial erratics (large boulders strewn randomly around the world); drift deposits (remains of plants and animals in climates where they supposedly couldn't have lived); the mass extinctions of animals around the same timeframe (9,500 B.C.) such as the mammoth and saber-toothed tigers; recent uplift of mountain ranges; evidence of changing sea levels at some time in our past; and much more.Through mountains of evidence they build a very compelling case that, due to the theory of the Ice Ages that was formed in the 1800s, science to this day has been fitting the evidence around the theory. And in the process they have overlooked the very compelling possibility that instead of being the result of something that occurred over the course of millions of years, much of the striking geological and other scientific evidence in plain sight around the world was in fact the result of one single worldwide catastrophe.The book not only covers evidence from geology, biology, archeology, astronomy and other scientific fields, but also delves into the worldwide \\"myths\\", stories that have been passed from generation to generation in ancient traditions throughout the millennia, all of which tell of a worldwide calamity that affected Earth in our distant (or not so distant, in geologic terms) past.Not only is it a fascinating read and an informative one in terms of all the subjects mentioned above, but it cites thousands of sources across all fields in order to build its case. Although the conclusions they come to may seem extraordinary, it seems there is at least enough evidence that mainstream science needs to take a serious look at whether they've overlooked something that's right in front of their eyes. And it's a conclusion that could completely reshape Earth's history. It wouldn't be the first time that it turned out we didn't know as much as we thought we did, and that a seemingly far-fetched idea turned out to be true."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"Great, excellent, provocative!

(Want to disprove a Global Flood Myth? Ask the !Kung bushmen of the Kalihari desert about their flood myth. The !Kung are myteriously absent from the list of flood myths in this book.) Simple high school physics and astronomy are ignored in the discussion of the (mythical) planet Phaeton's course through the solar system. (Since when did a small chunk of rock called Chiron acheive planetary status? Enquiring minds want to know!) And there are some blatent untruths, such as the 'frozen mammoths' of Siberia having 'warm weather' plants in their stomachs when they were 'flash frozen', and the Sumerians are given credit with naked-eye viewing of astronomical bodies which are difficult to see with relatively powerfull telescopes. (They ate cold weather vegetation, and they weren't 'flash frozen', and the asteroid Chiron wasn't discovered until 1977.) Finally, there is a quote from Dr. Carl Sagan, regarding the Biblical story of Joshua stopping and restarting the earth, which refutes the story. But the book quotes it as evidence to support that the earth DID in fact stop and was restarted! (The least the authors could have done was quote Dr. Sagan out of context, but instead, they quote Dr. Sagan as invalidating their own theory!) Wild new theories should not be dissmissed out of hand, and I read the entire book, going through point by point, to look at the individual premises. &quot;Cataclysm!&quot;'s evidence breaks down rather quickly, when put to the test of science. But don't take my word for it - prove it to yourself.

They show their ignorance by seizing upon well-known items like the asteroid belt or Chiron as evidence, rather than researching items that are not well known which could better support their arguments. The writing of the book is so mixed up that I am not sure just what theory the authors are supporting, and they sometimes appear to be opposing their own theories!

I disagree completely with those who discount human legend as a possible source of information from which to view evidence or start an investigation when indeed the legend has persisted throughout the eons.

Artefacts such as the Antikythera Mechanism demonstrate that people at some point in dim and hoary antiquity possessed technology which would not have been out of place in the early 1900s, and astronomical and mechanical knowledge apparently superior to our own (after a century we still cannot say for sure that we have unravelled all of its secrets). How far back exactly this object dates is not known, and probably impossible to ascertain for certain. Nevertheless, without a shadow of doubt the ancients possessed advanced knowledge of the workings of the heavens and how to track and record the movements of the celestial bodies. Indeed it is now well established that even African tribes such as the Dogon have possessed for millenia astronomical knowledge which has only been confirmed by our modern technology in the past century or so.Yet there is no record of where this knowledge came from, or when it originated. Clearly then, the record of human history is a much disturbed one with certain epochs now probably lost to us forever and others which live on only in the most nebulous of ancient traditions. The doctrine of uniformity is therefore clearly inadequate to explain our past, and the more one studies it the more one realises it is not only inadequate but complete nonsense. There have been cataclysms in the past, cataclysms which came close to ending all life on earth, which raised mountains and sunk continents, which caused massive global vulcanism, and which moved the earth from its orbit and reversed its magnetic poles. Some of these occurred within the memory of modern man. The most complete and compelling treatment of these is undoubtedly that of Immanuel Velikovsky in Worlds in Collision, Earth in Upheaval, In the Beginning (unpublished, available at the Velikovsky Archive) and the Ages in Chaos series.One of the most compelling thing about Cataclysm! however, despite its rather misleading title, is, to my mind, the amazing similarities at times to Velikovsky's work. It actually felt at times like reading a combined and reworded version of Worlds in Collision and Earth in Upheaval together, and I feel quite sure that if this work had been written by someone challenging established beliefs too far, like Velikovsky did, a case for plagiarism would quickly be made, and without a doubt it would stick. Delair and Allan, sadly, do not challenge any beliefs. The theory they serve up is so speculative and so stupendously far-fetched that it discredits itself and, perhaps intentionally, the whole field of catastrophism. The authors also on a number of occasions seek (unsuccessfully) to refute Velikovsky - even to the extent of misrepresenting him. It seemed to me that this was one of the main points of the book, and like all such attempts to debunk Velikovsky's work it is painfully obvious that these authors did not even bother to read Worlds in Collision before misquoting him. This demonstrates their total lack of academic integrity and is but one in a long list of examples of shoddy and incomplete scholarship.Their theory essentially is that a fragment of debris from a supernova in a nearby part of the galaxy, not an asteroid or comet but something new, something no-one has ever thought of before (!) came careening through the Solar System and played pinball with the planets (the author's own words) before falling into the sun. Along the way this object destroyed the odd planet here and there, captured the odd moon or small planet, and produced all the signs which other authors have more compellingly ascribed to other cosmic cataclysms. There was, according to these authors, only one cataclysm in earth history and it was the one they describe. Any evidence to the contrary is simply ignored or misrepresented to fit the picture the authors were clearly desperate to paint right from the start, and their analysis of ancient traditions before fitting them into their thesis is woefully inadequate. With no attempt whatsoever to establish any temporal synchronism they simply insist that any and every historical reference that can possibly be mistranslated or otherwise misrepresented into supporting their theme points to that time.The authors, like all uniformitarians-at-heart, rely heavily on the results of radio-carbon dating, a method of dating which according to its inventor Libby is dependant for its accuracy upon the requirement that the rate at which cosmic rays strike the earth has not changed in the past twenty thousand years or so. Yet the claims advanced in Cataclysm! would necessarily involve massive changes in the number of cosmic rays striking the earth, not to mention changes in the ratios of radioactive and non-radioactive carbons due to increased vulcanism and burning of hydrocarbons on the earth's surface, etc. They therefore choose not to mention this insignificant little detail and indeed act as though completely unaware of it. This would not surprise me too much, except that I find it difficult to believe that such scholars could be ignorant of such widely-known subjects; I can therefore only conclude that they simply choose to ignore anything that might invalidate their claims. Just another example of their non-existent scientific standards. Another related example lies in the fact that they are apparently unaware that Velikovsky himself wrote a very detailed paper, The Pitfalls Of Radio-Carbon Dating, and corresponded at length with Libby (all available online at the Velikovsky Archive); indeed, Velikovsky more than anyone was responsible for highlighting the shortcomings of carbon dating, shortcomings which Libby himself acknowledged yet chose to ignore - as did these authors.Unfortunately, after waiting eagerly for the delivery of this book I was hugely disappointed when I read it. Sadly, to me it read either like a deliberate hatchet job or childishly nonsense, and sometimes both, as well as an exercise at damage limitation: the theories of uniformitarianism have been consistently undermined for so long that it is surely by now apparent to the most conservative of academics that it is no longer possible to cling to all of them. If the damage to the doctrine of uniformity can be limited to accepting the reality of only one cataclysm - too far in the past to learn anything useful from, whilst stressing this was an isolated event and that uniformity is otherwise the norm, then the academic stagnation which is the inevitable result of a status quo such as exists at present will continue and authors such as these can bask in the warm glow of success, fortunately ignorant of the knowledge that the only kind of society in which they could ever be successful is a backward one. They therefore attempt to explain away the Solar System's obviously recently cataclysmic past by lumping all the evidence for all cosmic cataclysms into one holistic but unconvincing theory whilst at the same time apparently trying to discredit any notions of catastrophism - including their own, strangely enough. I could spend the rest of my life pointing out in detail why Cataclysm! is far more the work of pseudo-science than anything Velikovsky and many other \\"catastrophists\\" ever wrote. Suffice to say, however, that their uniformitarian leanings and therefore the real point of the book are best highlighted in the authors' own words:Despite its awesome destructive powers, however, the disaster was essentially a solitary event punctuating the uniformitarian normality of the solar system and which, among other effects, terminated a long and idyllic terrestrial regime anciently remembered as a 'Golden Age'. This had been an excellent expression of Lyellian uniformity on Earth. Now it was shattered and gone. Long aeons would and are to pass before such conditions become general once more. (p.231 - 232)This is not to say that Cataclysm! is completely worthless; indeed, the authors present much irrefutable evidence that there have been cataclysms in the not-too-distant past, actually repeating much that Velikovsky had earlier presented in Earth in Upheaval (see my earlier complaint), and that there does appear to be some evidence pointing to some kind of cataclysm around the time they talk about. However, the method by which they arrived at the exact year this event occurred is perhaps one of the most stunningly speculative pieces of wishful thinking I have ever read in a supposedly scholarly work. This rests on Plato's apparent dating of the fall of Atlantis to nine thousand years before his time, as well as the idea that the Pleistocene epoch ended approximately 11,500 years ago - this, despite the lengths to which they earlier went to point out that, with the discrediting of the theory of ice ages, these geological eras are purely arbitrary and partly non-existent (\\"an icy chimera\\"). This is simply another example of their cherry-picking of evidence and it seemed to me that even they became confused on occasion as to whether they were discrediting or reinforcing the doctrine of uniformity. Incidentally, Velikovsky wrote at length about this earlier cataclysm (and others) and far more convincingly ascribed the events to a collision of some kind between Jupiter and Saturn; the evidence he presents is far more compelling (see In The Beginning), as is his assertion that it is impossible to even guess at the actual dating of the event although he guessed within the last ten thousand years; again the authors seem to be or act as though they are completely ignorant of Velikovsky's work in this area.In short, the whole theory and the method by which it is presented and \\"proved\\" is too fantastic and unbelievable, in my opinion, and is quite obviously a mish-mash of the evidence for a number of different cataclysms all lumped together. I hate to say it, but I really wished I had not wasted the money...."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"This is an amazing book. The amount of time and research put into writing this title had to have been exhaustive, but the results of that research are as compelling and fascinating as anything you will ever read. The authors scoured the entire planet, bringing together countless stories, myths and legends as well as physical evidence of a catastrophic earth event that took place many millennium ago. The scattering of people who managed to survive this unimaginable cataclysm were so traumatized by the events they witnessed, they desperately tried to transmit knowledge of what happened to future generations to warn that it would one day take place again on our planet. Through oral tradition, art work, sculpture and written words, hints of that earth-shattering event are all around us and have become an ingrained part of our cultures. This astonishing book brings all of these hints and evidence together and presents a look back at a terrifying event that has shaped the world as we know it and continues to shape our world and our lives to this very day."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"Some comments about this book:1.) A book with an odd or even incorrect theory can be of enormous utility if it illustrates, documents and footnotes a large number of scientific anomalies. Aside from the many books of William Corliss, this book must be near the top of the heap in that category. You can enjoy this book and even cherish it without accepting the specific theory that the book proposes as an explanation of all the anomalies it reports.2.) The book proposes a cosmic cataclysm about 11,500 BC. In order to get a wonderful primer on how these authors may indeed have the \\"best and last laugh\\" even regarding the essential correctness of their theory..., use Google to find a set of videos on YouTube with these search terms: Comet Catastrophe 12,500 BP (before present). There are seven video segments with almost an hour of material from a recent, (May 2007) meeting of professional geologists (the American Geophysical Union meeting). Watch these video segments, and then buy a copy of Cataclysm! Then also buy the Book by Richard Firestone. If you buy and read both of these books, I think you will agree that some of the reviewers who have slammed Cataclysm may find themselves changing their minds. Yes there were ice ages, but there were also sudden extreme events - such as the one that brought on the so-called Younger Dryas, a 1200 year cold spell before the end of the last ice age.3.) In the 4th segment of YouTube video: Comet Catastrophe, note that one of the scientists answers a question from the audience about whether there were any North American Indian legends that might contain recollections of the event. His answer is yes. And if you buy Cataclysm!, you will be able to read alot of excerpts of such stories. And if those excerpts intrigue you (as they did me), the copious footnotes will help you find the original source materials.What other books should you buy if you find that you like this one? Buy all the books by Irish Dendrochronologist Mike Baillie and his co-authors. These books will introduce you to how long tree-ring chronologies are telling us about several abrupt, global climate disasters in the past 5000 years that may have been caused by impacts or interactions with comets. Buy a used, hardcover copy of Ragnarok by Ignatius Donnelly, wherein you can read a wonderful summary of evidences from human mythologies that led Donnelly to opine (in 1880 !!!) that Earth has been hit by a comet at least once during the tenure and written memory of mankind. (Donnelly was so far ahead of his time, that he is still ahead of ours...) And then familiarize yourself with the wonderful body of work on the K/T boundary through a tome like GSA Special Publication 356 or something like it. The reason for the latter is because Firestone and his colleagues are going to precipitate the same type of revolution in paleontology that Alvarez and his co-workers wrought in the 1980's by hypothesizing and then proving that Earth was struck by a speeding asteroid. Alot of the evidence for the Younger Dryas event is similar, and some of the same investigators who found critical chemical clues in the K/T boundary layers are doing so again in the end-Clovis \\"black mat.\\" Also, I recommend all the books by Clube, Napier and Bailey - most especially Cosmic Winter, Cosmic Serpent and the Origin of Comets.Lastly, keep your eyes open for a Discovery Channel special with a similar title: Comet Catastrophe. This special, which has apparently already aired in Canada, will feature Dr. Dallas Abbott and a colleague Dee Breger in program that will discuss powerful evidence of an Indian Ocean impact about 5000 years ago that left an 18 mile crater under 2.5 miles of water, and a 1/4 mile thick tsunami deposit 45 kilometers across on the southern shores of Madagascar.So what does all this mean? It means that the surface of the Earth is a more dangerous place than most astronomers (especially on this side of the Atlantic) think. It means that there have been significant impact events at least once and perhaps dozens of times during the written memory of men on the Earth. It means that it would be really smart for us to pay attention to all these scientific developments and to respond in thoughtful ways to the warning being delivered by living voices, and also the warnings delivered to us in many myths and legends."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"Previously titled - When the Earth Nearly Died &amp; republished by Bear &amp; Co. under this title. This is an excellent, well-documented book that basically disproves the ice age as it has been believed in the last 200 years. Methodically explores mythology, biology, geology, botony, astronomy and so much more to show there is no scientific proof for a long ice age or series of ice ages and that most of what is blamed on an ice-age and moving glaciers is in error. Shows the probable explanation is that an extraordinary event occured involving some type of body entering our solar system and effecting each planet and ultimately the earth causing major axis shifts, global earthquakes, land upheavals, hurricanes, floods, tidal waves, fires, and so on. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in earth mysteries, sacred sites, mythology, geology and more."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"I am very interested in earth's past and the untold history of our species. And this book surpasses everything I have seen to date. It's erudite, and comprehensive. The author's break new ground in many areas.I can't relate to the debunker's claim of pseudo science. That's become the mantra of dogmatists, of late, those who prefer not to look at the anomalous data. The flowers found in the mouths of the frozen Siberian mammoths and mastodons and other evidence of flora adapted to a temperate climate rules out the possibility that some of the carcasses date to 30-45,000 years. No, 11,500 years BP must be the actual date. The idea they were frozen mummies does not compute with the anecdotal reports that the flesh was fresh enough for humans and dogs to eat. The debunker has attempted to trivialize this extremely important evidence. Also, the debunker fails to understand the distinction between precession and the earth's 23 degree tilt. The two are separate characteristics.But back to the authors: one of their biggest contributions is their provocative suggestion that the earth's axis was more vertical to the ecliptic (the plane of the orbiting planets in the solar system)prior to the cataclysm. They suggest the earth gained its 23 1/2 degree tilt in the encounter with Marduk (Phaeton). This could explain how the polar regions were more temperate before, because a vertical earth (they assert) would have a smaller polar cap. We will have to wait and see if this turns out to be correct.I especially loved the way the authors compare and relate the geological record with the record of the great literary epics, the Edda, the Kalevala, the Avesta, Vedas, Bible, etc. Their understanding of the classics is phenomenal -- and asute. I learned a great deal and will rely on their interpretations in the future.I do have several critical comments. I was disapointed that the authors never discussed Charles Hapgood's contribution regarding the shifting of earth's crust. They mention this as one of the effects of an encounter with Marduk, but no not include adequate discussion. A crustal shift would of course explain why the orientation of the pyramids and ancient sites of meso America are aligned east of north -- a fact no one has ever explained. Obviously, these sites are older than N-S aligned Giza and thus are human testaments that the crust really did move.The authors are in my opinion wrong that all of earth's mountain ranges were low hills before the Phaeton disaster. If this were true, how to explain the alpine flora: wild flowers, liverworts, grasses, mosses and lichens? I agree that much mountain building occurred at this time, but not all.Nor do the authors ever finally succeed in explaining the Greenland ice sheet. It remains a mystery.The author's astutely conclude that a comet could not have caused the Phaeton disaster, because a cube of ice does not have the necessary mass to cause the gravity induced effects. However, Allan and Delair are unaware of scientist Jim McCanney's Plasma Discharge Comert Model, which is in process of revolutionizing our understanding of comets. If McCanney is correct, comets are not dirty snowballs, but are asteroidal and can be extremely large. We will know more next summmer when NASA's Deep Impact space probe causes a collision with the comet Tempel 1 -- an attempt to confirm the ice model. When NASA fails to find the ice, it will be time to junk the current model. No doubt about it, Phaeton was a comet!Despite these criticisms, I heartily recommend this book. We have barely begun to understand the mind boggling power and wonder of the cosmos..."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"The hard evidence that horrendous events did once happen to Earth seems unassailable. Caves packed with violently fractured bones of all sorts of fauna, Alaskan &quot;muck&quot; filled with remains of both tropical and sea animals, whale skeletons found on mountain tops - all these facts should be included in high school and college curricula. The authors present these facts readably and convincingly and in detail. Such evidence is found all around the world and the authors tell you where. However, one can read and accept all of this data and agree that disasters did indeed befall our planet - which the &quot;uniformitarian mainstream&quot; seems to find inconvenient (and tries to supress?)- and yet not quite be convinced of the validity of the exact cause proposed by the authors.

Absolutely. Am I sold on their theory of an interstellar chunk of stellar material playing havoc on the Earth? I have my reasonable doubts, but there was more than enough footnotes for me to check it out for myself. And the more I research, the more I become convinced that *something* happened to this biosphere ~12K years ago. That said, this endeavour has shaken my education to its foundation. Indeed, there are numerous instances that the authors bring to light that make one question what one has been taught in school. As an anthropologist, I believe that myth (and especially the Deluge myth) was founded on reality and filtered through the limited understanding of ancient peoples. Any anthropologist worth his salt realizes that different peoples of tribes, locals, even continents, have myths of remarkably similar themes, these make one wonder WHY the common thread; and WHY is this so easily dismissed? Those who dismiss myth as fantasy ought to remember that history is manipulated thru the perceptions of the author, a modern myth. It's very sad that the modern-day religion of science takes the position of dismissing reasonable factoids on the general principal of &quot;doesn't compute with current theories so talk to the hand.&quot; Read it for yourself.

These type of books are often wonderfully crafted; capable of tricking very intelligent people.Cataclysm! is riddled with flawed logic and pseudoscience. It is impossible to mention all the ignored data, incorrect information, and outright deception in a short review, but what follows is a brief summary.The authors ignore much of the geomorphologic evidence for ice ages. Entire fields of study such as lake sediment cores and deep sea floor drilling are barely mentioned or left out of consideration. Ice core drilling in the major ice caps are ignored except to claim that cores from Greenland go back only 10,000 years. The famous Vostok core of Eastern Antarctica is not mentioned at all in this book. The Vostok core has been established to show a continuous record of the last 160,000 years of the earth's climatic history. Drilling was completed on this core in the early 1980s and it is one of the most discussed pieces of evidence for the earth's climatic history in the Late Pleistocene. Since Cataclysm! was published in 1997, one would think there would be some reference to this important data. Other important evidence for ice ages such as glacial rebound are also ignored. Remarkably, glacial features such as fjords are attributed to faulting (p. 35).The authors provide numerous references for their claims, but many of their references date to the turn of the century and much older. The reader is not told of much more recent writings on the subjects mentioned. Similar treatment is given to plate tectonics and continental drift. Only papers before the mid-1970s, when the idea was still being debated, are mentioned. More recent works on tectonics are ignored. This is a large field of geology in which thousands of articles are published yearly.Questionable data is often presented as if factual. For example the Calavaras skull hoax is presented as factual, even though its fraudulent nature is well-known. Figure 6.3 illustrates what is purported to be a metal chain preserved in sedimentary rock. Most geologists would consider this object to be a concretion that only superficially resembles a chain.Rather disturbing are examples of outright lying to be found in Cataclysm! The authors deny that polishing and striations on rocks are evidence of glaciation, claiming that similar striations exist on rocks blasted by volcanic ash from Mt. Pel&eacute;. This ignores that most examples of rock with glacial striations and polishing are not associated with volcanism. The most outrageous case of outright deception are the glacial grooves from Peru which are claimed to be \\"fault-grooves\\" in Figure 1.5. Similar glacial grooves can be found in the vicinity of the Great Lakes, far from any major faulting.Allan and Delair misrepresent both the age and the preservation of the frozen mammoths of Siberia and Alaska. They claim that all the carcasses are about 11,500 years old and display \\"virtually unimpaired\\" flesh. The reality is that the frozen mammoths date to two periods of time, one ranging from 45,000 to 30,000 years ago and the other from 14,000 to 11,000 years ago. The flesh on frozen mammoths has undergone a desiccation process similar to freezer burn, the term \\"frozen mummies\\" being more appropriate.Other examples of egregious \\"science\\" used by the authors include a sudden detachment and shifting of the earth's crust which is confused with the precession of the earth's axis. They never ask how much energy would be needed to accomplish such a sudden detachment, not to mention how much heat would be released.Using older literature, the authors claim that cave deposits show a mixing of tropical and glacial animal and plant remains. More recent science reveals that these deposits are not mixed, but represent both glacial and warm inter-glacial periods in distinct layers.Cataclysm! assigns the origin of asteroids and meteorites to an exploded planet between Mars and Jupiter. This idea has not been widely accepted since the 1960's. Predictably, they only cite the older literature, ignoring the last 30 years of research.The book's thesis seems to be that the Vela supernova of 11,500 years ago shot a planet-size body into our solar system creating various catastrophes and accounting for almost every anomaly of planetary astronomy. Since the remnants of the Vela supernova are about 1,300 light years away this planet-sized object would have to be moving at relativistic speeds to arrive so soon after the supernova. They fail to ask how much energy would be required to accomplish this voyage.Amusingly, Allan and Delair illustrate an ancient Babylonian cylinder seal (p. 220) and interpret the various dots on it as different planets and the asteroid Chiron. One of the dots is claimed to be Uranus (almost invisible without binoculars). Another is claimed to be Neptune (invisible without a telescope). Chiron is extremely faint, discovered by astronomers using photographs in 1977. Apparently the Babylonians had excellent eyesight.Figure 4.13 (page 228) summarizes the odd thesis. The entire solar system is shown, but unfortunately not to its true scale. The figure depicts planetary pinball as the authors envision the story with most of the planets lined up on one side of the sun so the planetary body from Vela can do its damage. A diagram of the solar system at its true scale would impress upon the reader how unlikely this tale of cosmic catastrophism would be.Modern geology is willing to accept catastrophic events when the evidence is good. Efforts such as this appalling book are not taken seriously because the authors take a pick and choose attitude to the data, playing fast and loose with evidence. Caveat lector."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"Occasionally one can make an educated guess as to the positive worth of a book (prior to reading it) by the simple expedient of reading the negative reviews.

Additionally, at least two negative reviews are by the same person, using two different Amazon iDs (yes, I'm talking to YOU, \\"Daniel Phelps.\\" That's an Amazon no-no - and indicates an axe to grind other than a simple negative review for a book that someone found to be not helpful or just plain wrong.So the next question would be: WHY does a person (or persons) feel they need to construct an organized campaign against this book?That question then leads to the conclusion that there is, perhaps, something of value to be gleaned from this book."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"I found WHEN THE EARTH NEARLY DIED to be a fascinating book. Certainly as a scholarly work it is very well done, exquisitely researched and documented. The authors do present compelling evidence for the hypothesis that one or more great cataclysms have happened to this planet during the tenure of our species upon it, and that these have been memorialized in legend and lore all over the world. Up to that point, I found it an outstanding piece of research, and would have given it five stars -- and _then_ found that a) they had postulated that only _one_ such cataclysm had occurred, that 11,500 years ago; b) &lt;sigh&gt; that it caused an extremely rapid (within days) shift of the Earth's pole of rotation such that areas in the tropics were shifted to the temperate or arctica zones and vice-versa; and c) &lt;double sigh&gt; made a great many mistakes that those well-trained in history and the sciences would not have, such as referring to George Gamow, the great astronomer and cosmologist, one of the pioneering proponents of the Big Bang theory of cosmological evolution, as a &quot;geologist.&quot; Concerning a), there now exists a tremendous amount of hard evidence to show that our planet has been repeatedly bombarded from space by comets and asteroids as well as undergoing atmospheric explosions of really large comets ever since it first began cooling out of its molten phase, at the end of the Hadean Eon, some 4 billion-plus years ago. For example, a barrage of four or more of these was responsible for the end of the Cretaceous Period/Mesozoic Era of Earthly life, 65 million years ago. Another, far larger such barrage was probably the cause, or one cause, of the Permian catastrophe, the largest Great Extinction of life on Earth, which terminated the Paleozoic Era of life, around 250 million years ago. In fact, such barrages, whether large or relatively small, seem, given the cratering that can still be seen on our world as well as corroborating evidence from the fossil record, to have been responsible for most or all of the terminations of various geological periods from the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon of life onward and almost certainly before then, all the way back to the formation of our world, 5 billion years ago. Such terminations occur many times during the Cenozic Period, from 65 million years ago to the present. It would be strange if several, relatively minor such impacts and attendant disasters hadn't occurred numerous times throughout human history and prehistory -- one such may in fact have precipitated the Dark Ages, just 1500 years ago. So why just _one_ such disaster? To fit all the geological and other evidence of multiple cosmic disasters that have happened to our wrold into just one such, and that relatively recently, the authors had to conflate and confabulate their data nearly to death, thus destroying its usefulness. As for b)-- can you say &quot;torque,&quot; children? If the Earth were to suddenly (within a few days or even less time) somehow &quot;tip over&quot; so that its axis of rotation was thereby noticeably shifted from its original position, by at least five degrees, as a result the Earth's crust would be peeled off its mantle like the rind off an orange, and melt down to the mantle in the process, thanks to the phenomenon of &quot;torque,&quot; which is the resistance of a rotating, moving object to any change in angular momentum (which would perforce occur with a pole-tipping of the sort the authors postulate). Nothing would have been left of life on Earth after such a disaster, because the resistance of the Earth to such a change in its movement would liberate so much kinetic energy over such a short time that for a while, at least, what was left of this planet would be a very close approximation of Medieval ideas of the hotter parts of Hell. Obviously that hasn't happened since the Hadean eon; life has hung around here for over 4 billion years, so no such rapid change of the world's axial tilt, or of the positions of its tectonic plates relative to the poles of rotation, could have occurred in all that time. Back to the drawing board, gang . . . And as for c, mistakes such as those make it clear that the people who did such heartbreakingly careful work on their scholastic research weren't well-grounded in scientific method, the various scientific models and hypotheses pertinent to their subject, or important changes in those models since about 1985, when Luis and Walter Alvarez and their associates first revealed the results of their ground-breaking research on the Terminal Cretaceous Event to the world. Nice try, gang, and you certainly deserve an &quot;E&quot; for effort -- but you get a D+ for lack of scientific acumen, education, and awareness."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"Dear readers:This book is a republication of &quot;When the earth nearly died&quot;Just thought you would like to know in case you already have a copy."},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"I take cognizance of the criticism expressed by other reviewers, such as the claim that the authors have ignored the results of more recent scientific research.Even so, this is a fascinating book which makes one think, in the vein of Graham Hancock's \\"Fingerprints of the Gods\\" but with greater emphasis on the natural sciences although mythology and legend are also briefly discussed.It is refreshing to see scientific orthodoxy challenged, and although the authors may err in some of their assumptions, there is still enough here of value to make you think and wonder.Every chapter has an extensive bibliography and the text is amply illuminated with maps, tables and figures.

All the myths refer to great destructions befalling the earth and they most often associate the destructions to a celestial object, most often a planet. That is why the planets were their Gods. Segregating myths is tricky business, but it seems that there may have been 3 or 4 destructions in man's past not just the one referred to here. So, the evidence accumulated may refer to overlapping cataclysms.The evidence provided here is quite good. The authors explain why and how the mammoths were ripped apart in rolling muck and then froze solid before they could decay. The authors explain why the entire arctic region must have frozen at the same time. This clearly happened in the spring of the year, based on flowers that had not yet bloomed found with these animals (Discovery Channel).The idea that mammoths fell in ponds during the ice age and then froze sounds like a fairy tale when all the evidence here is reviewed.Any work of this magnitute is liable to have mistakes in it. Criticizing the author over things like the Calaveras skull is foolish in light of the fact that 300 man made objects came out of the same gravels as the skull.The reading is not real exciting, however, the material is presented in a clear understandable format which unfolds the author's ideas completely.

The authors deserve five stars for assembling such a wealth of multidiscipline information, with the referenced biographies attached to each chapter, about cataclysmic events which ravished our planet during our not so distant past. However, I find it regrettable that the authors did not give sufficient credit to the late Charles H. Hapgood for his contributions to plate tectonics, while leaving it up to the publisher Bear & Co. Inc. to apologize for the authors lack of acknowledging the late Zecharia Sitchin's work and contributions in regards to Sumerian texts detailing certain aspects in the creation of or influence on our solar system utilized by the authors.Nevertheless, this book presents the most comprehensive documentation of this subject I have read in one book, which easily compensates for a few typos and incorrect claim in Appendix D that the prodigious speed of light is 18,284 miles per second. Even though the authors present overwhelming evidence proving that Earth interacted with another significant cosmic body(s) and as a result experienced severe cataclysmic events about 11,500 years ago, I do not share their conclusion that Kingu either whole or in disintegrated form crashed into the Earth at that time. For one, the Sumerian texts seem to indicate that Kingu and our moon are one and the same. Further, Kingu was not just some small asteroid, meteor or comet but rather a significant size satellite of Tiamat. So if indeed some satellite of the size of Kingu collided whole or in broken up pieces with the Earth about 11,500 years ago, we simply would not be here having a discussion about a flood, pole and crust displacements, etc.,. (Just remember what happened when small Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter in 1994)However, the authors certainly have it right that our planet Earth, contrary to Charles Lyell's Theory of Uniformity, had an encounter with at least one substantial cosmic body about 11,500 years ago with catastrophic consequences. Yet, most of our scientific priesthood and governments are either trapped in a world of self-delusion and skepticism, quite similar to the attitude of the religious priesthood and their governments, who at the time refused to look through Galileo's telescope or listen to his reasoning or are they all, then and now, suffering from self-induced amnesia, which the late Immanuel Velikovsky so eloquently addressed in his book, \\"Mankind in Amnesia\\"?"},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"Although the individual details of their hypothesis can be debated, Allan and Delair do an outstanding job of synthesizing data from a number of fields (both hard and soft sciences), continuing and updating the Velikovskian tradition of the influence of extra-solar system bodies on the Earth.

I would add that the reference to prior well developed civilizations may indeed someday point the way towards understanding that a lot of &quot;mythology&quot; was a well conceived plan by well developed people to implant information in the mind of not-so-well-educated folks to carry forward to the day when their educated offspring can understand the true meaning of the &quot;story&quot;"},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","review":"This is an excellent, well-documented book that basicallydisproves the ice age as it has been believed in the last200 years.

The women mumbled a little at low volumes, which didn't work in my large classroom and old tape player. Also, the guys didn't like Algernon's voice, which sounded like a woman's and not at all like the rogue we pictured him to be.

Excised scene from The Importance of Being Earnest [pp. 359-363].First published thus, 2000.ContentsIntroductionA Note on the TextsSelect BibliographyLady Windermere's FanSalomeA Woman of No ImportanceAn Ideal HusbandA Florentine TragedyThe Importance of Being EarnestAppendix: The excised sceneNotes===========================================Now this is what I call a classic: so far as I, personally, am concerned this a book that I pick up with very high expectations, yet they are far surpassed by what I find between the pages. I did expect a lot from Wilde's plays, but I certainly wasn't prepared for so enthralling a read. I cannot but be amused at those people who continue to rant that Oscar Wilde was a perfect example of style over substance, that he never wrote anything serious, or if he did it will be forgotten at expense of his social comedies, and that he was nothing but tons of epigrams. First of all, it doesn't require a brilliant intelligence to realise that most of Wilde's epigrams are dead serious - indeed, that's where their enduring value lies; on the surface it's all fun of course, but just a little below there is a fierce social satire and just about unparalleled insight into human nature. As Bernard Shaw wisely observed once, ''nothing is more serious than great humour.'' He might well have spoken about Oscar. Unfortunately, there are two major disappointments that detract from the value of the book as a whole. But everything in time.The Penguin Classics edition is an almost complete one. It contains six plays written between 1891 and 1895, at the time when Wilde was growing more and more famous as a dramatist, and it omits only his two early attempts from the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists (1880) and The Duchess of Padua (1883). The six plays in this volume fall into two strikingly different categories: four of them are the classical social comedies Oscar Wilde is most famous for, namely Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, whereas Salome and A Florentine Tragedy can be broadly and ineptly described as historical and rather tragic plays. Before going into some detail about the plays themselves, few words about the editorial work.The introduction of Richard Allen Cave is dull and tedious stuff one may skip without fear of missing anything of any importance. It starts promisingly, with the famous dichotomy between Wilde the brilliant wordsmith and Wilde the subversive homosexual, but than Mr Cave unfortunately switched to, and continued to be concerned with until the end, abominably mundane matters like Wilde's stage directions and the spatial relationships between his characters. The best I can say about this introduction is that Mr Cave is certainly very capable of extracting a good deal of tenuous and ultimately unimportant, not to say preposterous, relationships between the visual side of Wilde's plays and their force as social satire. I confess the first time I read this introduction I skipped half of it. But then I was ashamed and read it again, this time completely and conscientiously. I wish I hadn't. Perfect waste of time.Be warned also that the introduction is rife with spoilers and should be read - if at all - only after the plays.A word about the editor's meticulous notes must be made too. It is of course extremely annoying to constantly consult them when they are in the end of the book, but I daresay the notes could not have been printed otherwise: they are much too copious for that. Well, one doesn't really need to consult them; indeed, one must not do this. The notes are sometimes insightful, but more often than not they are concerned with largely irrelevant matters like publication history, revisions of certain passages or long-winded and pompous speculations about Wilde's apparent allusions. Worst of all, the notes often make explicit crucial details of the plots long before Wilde intended to reveal them. To say that such cases spoil the pleasure of Wilde's meticulous craftsmanship is a spectacular understatement. I imagine the best way is to read the plays once without referring to the notes at all and only then, on second reading when one is already reasonably familiar with the plots, one should peruse the plays more carefully together with constant excursions to the end of the book. For all verbose junk they contain, the notes are occasionally highly revealing in terms of specific meaning of some words in the vastly different social context of those times, or elucidating Wilde's elaborate, yet subtle and subversive, network of hints, allusions and metaphors.Salome was my first major disappointment in the volume. Written originally in French in 1891 and later translated into English by Lord Alfred Douglas himself if the dedication is to be believed (actually, scholars now believe, Wilde himself did the job), the play was for many years banned and attacked as immoral, indecent and other such adjectives that are more likely to stimulate audience's interest more than anything else. With its extravagant metaphors, fantastic imagery and verbose repetitions, Salome is more akin to Wilde's second volume of fairy tales, but the play has neither their power nor their affecting quality. The story is the well-known and perfectly gruesome one from the Bible about Salome, the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas, and John the Baptist (here named in Hebrew fashion, Jokanaan). The play has some nice satirical touches, mostly in the character of the very practical Herodias, with her memorable line ''I do not believe in miracles. I have seen too many.'', and there are some hints of serious discussions about religion and God, but on the whole it is a lame sruff and makes a tedious read; fortunately it's one-act affair, and rather short at that. Perhaps I have read it in the wrong mood.A Florentine Tragedy is a very singular piece. It is written in blank verse and apparently set in Renaissance Italy; ''apparently'' because nothing is mentioned in the stage directions and one must rely on subtle hints in the text. Scholars have argued that the play is just a fragment from an unfinished work, but it's perfectly sufficient as it is. I can't say that I find reading blank verse easy, but the play is very short (less than 20 pages) and it makes a very absorbing read indeed. There are but three characters - the merchant Simone, his wife Bianca and the Florentine prince Guido - who form a chilling love triangle that leads, predictably considering the title, to a tragic conclusion. The amazing thing is that Wilde has managed to achieve a very neat twist in the end. In combination with the swift exchange of blunt remarks, the play makes a very enjoyable read.The rest four plays in this book are (mostly) Oscar Wilde at his absolute best as a playwright; I call these superb pieces of drama ''social comedies'' only with trepidation, for they are as much concerned with the individual as with society, and they are far more serious than they are comic. The only exception, regrettably, is the most famous of them. Although each of the plays has a special character, all of them share several remarkable similarities.They are all set in the present, 1890s that is, and the action is limited in time to no more than 24 hours during which dark passions and shady secrets from many past years relentlessly surface. They all contain tons of amusing epigrams as only Oscar Wilde, the scintillating wordsmith, can forge but none of them is on the whole a flippant or superficial affair; as for Wilde's pace of action and sense for dramatic climax, they are invariably well-nigh perfect. Perhaps what impresses me most strongly in these plays is the large diversity of characters that each one of them contains. Virtuous and vicious form a sublime counterpoint here, if I am allowed a musical analogy. Both among the male and the female characters the variety is impressive, if repetitive. Usually there are those who talk almost entirely in epigrams and take a decidedly flippant attitude towards life but in fact turn out to have a more secure grip of it than all other characters; and of course there are also prigs and prudes, moralists and cynics, social climbers and social outcasts, people in love and people in lust: you name it, separately or in various combinations. The verbal skirmish is guaranteed and so is the engrossing entertainment. When it comes to hypocrisy, conceit, shallowness, snobbishness, prejudice or stupidity - social or individual - Oscar Wilde is charmingly witty and devastatingly merciless. In both directions.For the most part Wilde's stage directions are very sparse and consist almost entirely of characters' movements and brief descriptions of the surroundings; usually he also gives the reactions of all participants in the most dramatic scenes, but otherwise there is next to nothing about appearance, clothing or the manner in which certain lines are spoken. Yet the characters come to life with astonishing vividness and verisimilitude, entirely through dialogue. Another amazing thing about these plays: no character speaks out of character, ever. Now that is quite an achievement. Considering the severe stringency of drama, Wilde's character are remarkably complex and alive. Last but not least, actually most important of all, there are always several points of view, often conveyed by different characters but sometimes adroitly combined in one. The awesome collision of values, morals, fears and feelings is absolutely never one-sided, no matter whether one agrees with Wilde's conclusions or not. Unfortunately, I repeat, The Importance of Being Earnest is rather an exception from most of the above.Perhaps the most striking, and surprising, overall conclusion to draw about all four of Wilde's ''social comedies'' is that Oscar is unabashed sentimentalist. Now such an attitude is not exactly my cup of tea, but in this particular case it seems that it doesn't matter a bit. I certainly haven't used it to degrade Wilde's plays and have nothing but contempt for those who do. In conclusion of the general part, it might be worth noting that the plays are printed in the order of their writing but in no way need they be read so; from the very beginning of his four years of theatrical success, Oscar Wilde was a supreme master of his craft. Now let's look more carefully into each of these gems.Lady Windermere's Fan is my greatest favourite. It is superb on all fronts. For once, the blend of wit and wisdom, flippancy and profoundness, is brought to utmost perfection. The play is extremely clever in its construction, with all improbabilities masterfully handled and with simply mind-blowing dramatic climaxes. Oscar certainly knew very well how to pace and construct drama in a most gripping manner. In this play he has also surpassed himself as regards to variety of characters. None of the next three works, fine as they are, may offer so vast a range of completely different personalties, all of them brilliantly conveyed by sparkling dialogue. Nor has Wilde ever again succeeded in creating so convincing a bundle of contradictions as Mrs Erlynne. I can certainly say that she is one of the most charming and lovable characters ever put down on paper in drama, fiction or non-fiction; considerable achievement since in the beginning of the play she is definitely despicable. Her transformation in the course of these four acts is unbelievable - from a heartless creature to one with a golden heart - yet absolutely convincing and deeply affecting. Last but not least, the play has an astounding finale which is in itself a masterpiece: it is neither happy nor unhappy, everybody is sincere and at the same time hiding something behind his or her guilty conscience.A Woman of No Importance has a fabulously disappointing conclusion, appallingly melodramatic and sentimental. Sometimes I do hanker for a more seriously cynical attitude in Wilde's plays; it would have made them so much more real and relevant. But no matter how much I may baulk at Oscar's attitude, I can't find any fault with his integrity even here. His characters act thoroughly in character, bizarre whims and all, and he gives - as usual - a great deal of thought-provoking stuff on both sides of a conundrum. On the one side of the baricade are Mrs. Arbuthnot, her son Gerald and above all the american girl Hester Worsley; they are obviously the virtuous characters with high moral principles, and though they may look somewhat one-dimensional, or even ridiculous, they are as alive as it is possible for any character in drama to be. On the other side are the somewhat cynical, but full of common sense, Mrs. Allonby and above all Lord Illingworth, one of those pleasure-seeking whose only aim in life is to get as much fun of it as possible. The clash is tremendously effective and beautifully executed. One of the greatests assets of the play are the remarkably vivid minor characters such the brutally foolish Lady Stutfield, the kindly class-conscious Lady Hunstanton and mercileslly irreverent Lady Caroline are quite a treat to enjoy; Oscar has done a wonderful job with all of them. Despite the nauseating affectation and rhetoric of the finale, the play is stimulating enough to guarantee unforgettable experience. It will be re-read in future with great pleasure.An Ideal Husband constitutes an interesting exception among Wilde's plays, for it has unusually detailed stage directions ranging from the manner of speaking to complete descriptions of the appearance and the character of the characters. As it might be expected these are stupendous fun to read; imagine a woman looking like ''a work of art, on the whole, but showing the influence of too many schools''. Downright brilliant! The only slightly annoying detail in these descriptions is that Wilde cannot resist the temptation to like any of his characters to those of one painter or another; it looks like cheap show-off of ''culture''. Nevertheless, the plays is a very powerful one, perhaps the darkest and most intense of all. It is a little unusual because it is a variation of ''a man with a past'' theme, rather than the more traditional variant where it is woman who has to hide some ignominious secret from her wild youth. At any rate the play raises a number of profoundly important questions. Is blameless life blemished by a single dishonesty? Should one be judged so harshly because of one's wild youth? Should one love to the point of idealisation? Should one be blind for the faults of the the loved ones? What is the nature of true love? Does it make any sense in this world? Is it powerful enough to overcome pity or moral horror? There are many more such questions in this play - and quite a few answers too.By the way, I take issue with reviewers who label this play as ''sexist''. It is nothing of the kind. Lord Goring does have one or two rather sexist lines but neither his character nor the play on the whole have anything to do with sexism. Indeed, since the last word and the noblest act are saved for one of the main heroines, the play is more like a feminist one actually, or a sexist one reversed if you like. Certainly there are in these four acts a great deal more important things than that.The Importance of Being Earnest is generally considered Wilde's best play. I really don't know why. It is significantly inferior to the three previous ones in a number of aspects. To begin with, it is no comedy but pure farce, which is already a severe limitation. It is by far the most flippant, artificial and improbable of them all, and far less convincing too. Nor does it match any of the other three masterpieces in terms of wit and wisdom. The range of characters and the depth of characterisation cannot hold a candle to any other member of the quartet either. The dialogue is vastly amusing, of course, but the pointless banter often continues for a little too long and it gets tedious; and fun for fun's sake hardly makes any more sense than art for art's sake. The play has a pleasant twist in the end which, however, sounds unpleasantly contrived and unnatural, not to say inane and ridiculous. It is hardly a coincidence that it is the only one in three acts for it is certainly the least substantial of all. I daresay it is a riveting spectacle on the stage but a truly great play surely must be great on paper as well. In short, The Importance of Being Earnest, even if it may pass for a comedy, does lack precisely what makes a great comedy: seriousness. It is a very good play but it is very far from a great one. Alone, it might earn five stars for the deliberately light, though wonderful, entertainment which in fact it is; but compared to the three social comedies, pointless yet inevitable as such comparisons are, it deserves no more than three stars. I understand it is supposed to be the zenith of Oscar's masterpieces for the stage. So far as I am concerned, it is definitely the nadir.That said, The Importance of Being Earnest is a riot to read, if one can somehow detach it from Oscar's great plays of course. It has a lot of swift action and, as might be expected, the embarrassing situations of double-identity mischief are brilliantly handled. I suppose the play looks way better on the stage than on paper, which is, perhaps, how it should be for plays are written to be staged, not read. But I remain convinced, perhaps irrationally, that a truly great play must be great on paper as well. Though in that particular case this is certainly not the case, Oscar's sharp wit shines through and makes it a worthwhile read; alas, it is only occasionally allied to anything like wisdom. Wilde's superb characterisation still reigns supreme, even in his slightest efforts. The young ladies are somewhat colourless, but Lady Bracknell is all but unforgettable. The contrast between the two young man - the bohemian Algie and the priggish Jack - is conveyed as only Oscar Wilde could.When all is said and done, taken as a whole body of work, Wilde's plays only convince me once more in his extraordinary genius, literary and not only. Despite two major flaws, one of them appallingly unexpected, this volume of Wilde's plays is a book to be treasured."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Still very vibrant and still amazingly witty for today.

It was a peak that was to be cut short by the sensational trial that sent him to jail for two years because of homosexual actions. While one does not need to know Wilde's background to enjoy the play, some insight into what certain words might have meant in Victorian slang certainly put a different twist on the play. In the \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" Wilde uses humor to turn conventional relationships and staid Victorian morality on its head.The play centers around two men, Jack and Algernon. Jack wants to propose to Algernon's cousin Gwendolen, but her mother does not think him an eligible bachelor. Not to mention the fact that Gwendolen believes Jack to be named Ernest and that there is a whole slew of things he has keep hidden from her. Algernon tells Jack that he is a Bunburyist, for he pretends to have a brother so he can come up to the city (that would be Ernest) while Algernon pretends to have an invalid friend named Bunbury so that he can escape to the country. When Gwendolen asks Jack for his country address, Algernon overhears and heads out to Jack's house, pretending to be his brother Ernest, so that he can meet Jack's ward, Cecily. The two fall in love, for Cecily always wanted to marry someone named Ernest. This is all to Jack's chagrin when he arrives on the scene and finds he must confess the truth to Gwendolen. Yet the convoluted plot has a way of working out for the best of everyone involved.\\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is an extremely thin plotted play, which allows Wilde's witticisms and humor to shine through. Throughout there is a strand of anti-marriage jokes and unexpected reversals of the expected sayings. There are so many one-liners from this play that have been quoted through the ages which testifies to what a wonderful way Wilde had with words. It is a play that stands the test of time with its laugh-out-loud moments and witty zingers."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This is possibly the most amazing work to come out of English literature and the English language.

Every character in the play is witty, and the jabs, barbs, and puns come fast and furious.The story centers on two somewhat roguish young bachelors who have both created elaborate lies to help them to cover for their mischief. At different points in the play, both gentlemen have assumed the false name of Ernest, which becomes a problem once two women become involved. Two women who are both particularly enamored with the idea of marrying someone named Ernest.The tightly plotted play has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting, and the witty dialogue never lets up.The Avon (a HarperCollins imprint) paperback edition that I read contained a short collection of critical essays, the most interesting being a (mostly negative) review by George Bernard Shaw of the original production of the play, which raises some interesting points about the nature of comedy. I found some good insights into the career of Oscar Wilde in the introduction and the other critical pieces, but those familiar with his life and work would not be missing much by skipping these \\"bonus features\\".The play itself was a really enjoyable work to read, and I'll keep an eye out for a chance to catch a performance of it sometime."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"There is just no reason to not like this play! I've seen it many times, (whenever there is even a high school production I like to support it, and go), so I read this play from time to time, and each time laugh out loud as much as the first time.No need to review Earnest as if its a new book, you already know how good it is, I just wanted to say that I had purchased this new edition for a friends birthday, and I was very happy with it - nice cover, delightful edition!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Even over a hundred years after its original publication, this tale of mistaken identity and silly social farce continues to not only entertain, but you will be laughing out loud! Jack and Algernon are best friends, who amusingly get tangled in the web of being mistaken for Earnest and falling in love with women who are mesmerized by the name Earnest, which as Jack's object of affection Gwendolen puts it: \\"it inspires absolute confidence\\". When the four lovers visit Jack's country home at the same time, the proverbial custard hits the fan. But never fear, a convenient twist resolves matters to everyone's satisfaction all with wit, fun, farce and its hilarious!Just read it! It's just funny, funny, funny!"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I mainly appreciated this version of the play in audio format because of its length. It runs just under 2hrs as compared to one of the other ones that is almost 40 minutes longer. I was having to read the play again (I've read it several times for different theatre classes), and it was a great way to refresh myself with the text and to shine new light on some of the ideas. I enjoyed Lady Bracknell and Jack's performances more than the rest of the company, but overall, I feel it was true to the text of the play itself."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Oscar Wilde gives us in this play one of his best instance of humor, or would I say wit ? Every situation, every word, every piece of this dialogue is full of smartness and intelligence. The only aim of the play is to show us how absurd strict social canons are. Life is extremely more fun than the respect of such rules that destroy any kind of pleasure or happy turns of events. Good society is thus turned upside down and the best instance of such humorous antics is the fact that the son of a general was officially born in a handbag deposited in the cloakroom of Victoria Station, the Brighton Line. How ridiculous ! How funny, ah ah and funny, strange ! Oscar Wilde shows how vain all appearances are because appearances may hide deeper things that are of far more important value than these appearances. This play is thus a constant and perfect example of comedy. But in spite of this light appearance of the play, we can feel the deeper suffering of Oscar Wilde who is very serious about the absurdity of keeping up appearances instead of taking only character into account. In other words, this comedy is a sign of the total decay of such higher society that is nothing but a pretty face with nothing behind, nothing in the head or the brain. It is a call for a real society based on human values like love, truthfulness, faithfulness. All twists in the social fabric create unconceivable embroglios that lead to entanglements and other difficulties. Things would be so simple if men and women could just follow their inclinations and their deep sentiments. We also find in this comedy a deep marivaux-ian influence : Marivaux loved in his play to alter identities, but among girls, to test the love of men. Here it is the men who have altered identities and it leads to testing their ability at sacrificing such entangled situations for the love of a girl. There is also a strong recollection of Shakespeare who enjoyed turning his girls into boys in his comedies, but once again to test the love of men, to see without being seen, for women. Oscar Wilde, in the social setting of a Victorian society, is just as witty and funny as Shakespeare in say As you Like It, or say again A Midsummer Night's Dream. And life turns Aunt Augusta, alias Lady Bracknell into the ass of the fable.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"One thing happens when you read Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\"; you are amazed to remember that this play was authored over 100 years ago. For most plays of that era, the average reader tends to lose references and it tends to be stodgy and irrelevant. Not so Earnest, due to the brilliance and imagination of it's playwright.The Importance of Being Earnest is a tour de force of comedy, misidentifications, and farce. Algernon and Jack are friends, and each has invented an imaginary person as an excuse of getting out of engagements. Jack's person is Ernest, a brother with a wild past. The two conspire to woo the ladies that they love, and through a series of happenstances, must gently deceive to get want they want. The end result is a play of uncomperable quality, chock full of witticisms that are highly quotable out of context. In fact, I dare suggest the entire play is quotable, such its brilliance.Wilde pulled no punches when writing Earnest. Often, when a play is filled with memorable quotes, it takes away from the realism of the scenes because the characters then become merely conduits for the writer's intellect. Not so in Earnest. Wilde manages to make the characters say exactly what they would say in each situation, true to their persona. That alone is quite an accomplishment, one not often seen.Misidentities, witty banter, love, all conspire to one of English's most brilliant comedies ever to have seen the stage. We should be so lucky the world had Oscar Wilde in it, and even more so, that he wrote at all."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People&quot; is one of the first plays written in English since the works of Shakespeare that celebrates the language itself. Oscar Wilde's comedy has one advantage over the classic comedies of the Bard in that &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is as funny today as it was when it was first performed at the St. Jame's Theater in London on February 14, 1895. After all, enjoying Shakespeare requires checking the bottom for footnotes explaining the meaning of those dozens of words that Shakespeare makes up in any one of his plays. But Wilde's brilliant wit, his humor and social satire, remain intact even though he was a writer of the Victorian era.Wilde believed in art for art's own sake, which explains why he emphasized beauty while his contemporaries were dealing with the problems of industrial England. &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is set among the upper class, making fun of their excesses and absurdities while imbuing them with witty banter providing a constant stream of epigrams. The play's situation is simple in its unraveling complexity. Algernon Moncrieff is an upper-class English bachelor who is visited by his friend Jack Worthing, who is known as &quot;Ernest.&quot; Jack has come to town to propose to Gwendolen Fairfax, the daugher of the imposing Lady Bracknell and Algy's first cousin. Jack has a ward named Cecily who lives in the country while Algernon has an imaginary friend named &quot;Bunbury&quot; whom he uses as an excuse to get out of social engagements.Jack proposes to Gwendolen but has two problems. First, Gwendolen is wiling to agree because his name is Ernest, a name that &quot;seems to inspire absolute confidence,&quot; but which, of course, is not his true Christian name. Second, Lady Bracknell objects to Jack as a suitor when she learns he was abandoned by his parents and found in a handbag in Victoria Station by Mr. Thomas Cardew. Meanwhile, Algernon heads off to the country to check out Cecily, to whom he introduces himself as being her guardian Jack's brother Ernest. This meets with Ceclily's approval because in her diary she has been writing about her engagement to a man named Ernest. Then things get really interesting.Wilde proves once and for all time that the pun can indeed be elevated to a high art form. Throughout the entire play we have the double meaning of the word &quot;earnest,&quot; almost to the level of a conceit, since many of the play's twists and turns deal with the efforts of Jack and Algernon to be &quot;Ernest,&quot; by lying, only to discover that circumstances makes honest men of them in the end (and of the women for that matter as well). There is every reason to believe that Wilde was making a point about earnestness being a key ideal of Victorian culture and one worthy of being thoroughly and completely mocked. Granted, some of the puns are really bad, and the discussion of &quot;Bunburying&quot; is so bad it is stands alone in that regard, but there is a sense in which the bad ones only make the good ones so glorious and emphasize that Wilde is at his best while playing games with the English language.But if Wilde's puns are the low road then his epigrams represent the heights of his genius, especially when they are used by the characters in an ironic vein (e.g., &quot;It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal&quot; and &quot;I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance&quot;). Jack is the male lead, but it is Algernon who represents the ideal Wilde character, who insists he is a rebel speaking out against the institutions of society, such as marriage, but with attacks that are so flamboyant and humorous that the cleverness of the humor ends up standing apart from the inherent point.In the end, &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is the wittiest play every written, in English or any other language, and I doubt that anything written in the future will come close. Wilde was essentially a stand-up comedian who managed to create a narrative in which he could get off dozens of classic one-liners given a high-class sheen by being labeled epigrams. Like a comedian he touches on several topics, from the aristocracy, marriage, and the literary world to English manners, women, love, religion, and anything else that came to his fertile mind. But because it is done with such a lighthearted tone that the barbs remain as timely today as they were at the end of the 19th-century and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; will always be at the forefront of the plays of that time which will continue to be produced."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"The Importance of Being Earnest is a fantastic play. It is an easy read, and is not only well thought out, but hilarious.I liked this book of the play especially, because it includes helpful notes in the beginning, but more because it has a glossary of difficult terms in the back. Every time I came to a word that I did not know, it was sure to be defined in the back.If you love theatre, this is a great play to read. I would highly suggest this book."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Wilde's play has taken a turn for the worse in the last 20 years. It appears that people have forgotten how to act comedy. The Importance of Being Earnest has admittedly been cast in the shadow of the famous 1952 movie for all eternity. Edith Evans's lady Bracknell in that movie is a hard act to follow but the eccentric British actress Miriam Margoyles is the only one of the cast in this sorry new recording to understand and be able to play a part in a famous play that is performed in words only.The male characters both whine their words with little understanding of how to make them fall into place and become part of the larger whole in fact it sounds like a recording of a first run through with the scripts.What really kills this recording is the director's decision to have a narrator read the stage directions. As if we are half wits who can't work out what's going on without being told that \\"an electric bell rings\\" when immediately after a character will respond and explain what the noise is and what is signifying - Duh!!!This is not the way to make an audio recording of a play and even though it is the only recording of Earnest on CD this is not the one to have. John Gielgud directed himself and Edith Evans in a classic (but cut) version for EMI in the 1950's which has been occasionally available on cassette and Harper Collins have re-issued the 1960's Caedmon recording on cassette which is also an excellent production. It was a sad event in Caedmon's history when Harper Collins acquired them, the incredible collection of spoken word recordings all but disappeared from sight but now a few have been released on cassette and even a few have seen new life on compact disc. Better wait for the EMI set or look out for the Caedmon, either are better than this pathetic attempt."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I just got finished reading this for class, and it's simply one of the best works I have read in the past year. It was such a joy to read, no dread factor at all (and there was no trouble keeping up with the characters). It is so witty and so well-written, it's just great.

And even better if you read all of it. Which you won't if you buy the Penguin copy with Edith Evans on the front, since this version is heavily abridged. Which is fine except the publishers make no mention of this at all in the volume. And cultural vandalism of this kind should, I feel at least be acknowledged."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This is Wilde's best play, it is fast moving, has wonderful characters (especially the women), and funnily enough is still a pretty accurate observation of society. Perhaps nothing ever really changes! At the core of the play is the name Earnest, and all that it means to the various characters, and how their white lies and complicated lives catch up with them. And the lines - wonderful ones like &quot;I always carry my diary - a lady should always have something scandalous to read on the train&quot;, and &quot;if you are not too long, I shall wait for you forever!&quot;. Be assured, all works out well in the end, and all shall be revealed as to how important it is to be Earnest."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I had no knowledge of Oscar Wilde and had only seen ten minutes of the movie, The Importance of Being Earnest, as I flipped through the cable channels on my television. However, due to a class that I am enrolled in, not only do I now know who he is but I am blessed to have been introduced to his work.The Importance of Being Earnest, makes a very humorous yet profound commentary on money, marriage, status and image as it pertains to the aristocracy of that time. It seems that Oscar Wilde utilized this medium of artistic expression to cleverly expose the twisted way that those with wealth perceived themselves and the lengths they would go to the preserve that perception. It has been referred to as a \\"comedy of manners\\" because so much of what defined or distinguished the aristocracy from the common man was not necessarily the wealth that they actually had but what men and women did to appear like they had it.Ernest, who is the main character in the play, has done all of what is necessary to appear as though he comes from wealth. He wears the clothing, keeps the company and talks the talk of the aristocrat. However what he soon finds out is that all of those whom he is trying to impress and fit in with, have more unresolved issues in their closet than he does. I believe Wilde addresses this social paradox with impeccable wit and an amazing sense of human psychology. He not only challenged those who belonged to the aristocracy to examine what they placed value in, but continues to challenge each reader today, that these superficial values might not stand as valuable at all."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"In Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\", he answers this question in the form of brilliant comedy. The play, full of witty dialogue such as Lady Bracknell's answer to her daughter's suitor saying he does smoke; \\"I am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some kind.\\"; says, yes, it is important to be Earnest.One of the more remarkable details of this play is in the title itself. While attending or reading the play, you learn, that the two heroine's of the piece, Gwendolyn and Cecily, are determined to marry men named Earnest; unfortunately, Jack wants to marry Gwendolyn, and Algernon would like to settle down with Cecily. What is the reasonable solution? To tell them that their name's are Earnest. However, Earnest is not only a name, but also a word meaning: an intensely serious state of mind. Why would Oscar Wilde choose the name Earnest for this seemingly ridiculous play anyway?Why ridiculous you may ask. The answer comes in not only the ingenious dialogue, but in the plot itself. Without giving away the entire story, one can say that the two main characters live, however innocent, deceptive lives and still end up with the fair maiden's in the end. One of them even ends up really being Earnest, to which he answers, \\"... it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but truth...\\"Wilde called his piece, \\"A trivial comedy for serious people.\\" If the word earnest means serious and the play itself is joyfully absurd, this writer imagines that the characters in the play although exceptionally serious about themselves and their lives, they are trivial or ridiculous. In conclusion, I would say that this play is not only suited for the serious mind, this play is uproariously fun for all of us who appreciate good humor."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Oscar Wilde is no less an insightful poet with a sharp wit.

Jack lives in the country but is always going to London to deal with his good-for-nothing brother, Ernest. However, his London friends know him as Ernest, and this \\"brother\\" doesn't actually exist. Algernon, meanwhile, is a London dandy who periodically takes off for the country to visit his dying friend, Bunbury (who also does not exist). When Algernon discoveres Jack's secret, he is anxious to visit Jack at home and meet his young ward, Cecily. He arrives at the estate, claiming to be the scandalous Ernest.Naturally, hijinks ensue. Jack is in love with Algernon's cousin Gwendolyn, who insists she could only ever love a man named Ernest. Cecily is also enamoured with a man of that name. Of course, both men cannot be Ernest. And this is where the comedy lies.The play is very short (my copy clocks in at 90 pages) but it is extremely funny. I'd seen the Colin Firth film version a few years ago and was happy to see that it was fairly faithful to the original text. Gwendolyn's mother, Lady Bracknell, is equally as witty in the book as she is in the film, and Oscar Wilde demonstrates his sharp wit at every turn."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This book was quite a surprise (and a riot).

Second, Lady Bracknell objects to Jack as a suitor when she learns he was abandoned by his parents and found in a handbag in Victoria Station by Mr. Thomas Cardew. Meanwhile, Algernon heads off to the country to check out Cecily, to whom he introduces himself as being her guardian Jack's brother Ernest. This meets with Ceclily's approval because in her diary she has been writing about her engagement to a man named Ernest. Then things get really interesting.Wilde proves once and for all time that the pun can indeed be elevated to a high art form. Throughout the entire play we have the double meaning of the word \\"earnest,\\" almost to the level of a conceit, since many of the play's twists and turns deal with the efforts of Jack and Algernon to be \\"Ernest,\\" by lying, only to discover that circumstances makes honest men of them in the end (and of the women for that matter as well). There is every reason to believe that Wilde was making a point about earnestness being a key ideal of Victorian culture and one worthy of being thoroughly and completely mocked. Granted, some of the puns are really bad, and the discussion of \\"Bunburying\\" is so bad it is stands alone in that regard, but there is a sense in which the bad ones only make the good ones so glorious and emphasize that Wilde is at his best while playing games with the English language.But if Wilde's puns are the low road then his epigrams represent the heights of his genius, especially when they are used by the characters in an ironic vein (e.g., \\"It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal\\" and \\"I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance\\"). Jack is the male lead, but it is Algernon who represents the ideal Wilde character, who insists he is a rebel speaking out against the institutions of society, such as marriage, but with attacks that are so flamboyant and humorous that the cleverness of the humor ends up standing apart from the inherent point.In the end, \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is the wittiest play every written, in English or any other language, and I doubt that anything written in the future will come close. Wilde was essentially a stand-up comedian who managed to create a narrative in which he could get off dozens of classic one-liners given a high-class sheen by being labeled epigrams. Like a comedian he touches on several topics, from the aristocracy, marriage, and the literary world to English manners, women, love, religion, and anything else that came to his fertile mind. But because it is done with such a lighthearted tone that the barbs remain as timely today as they were at the end of the 19th-century and \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" will always be at the forefront of the plays of that time which will continue to be produced."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Witty, sarcastic, laugh out loud in your chair reading. I loved it!!!!"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Oscar Wilde once said that all forms of art are useless. Bearing this in mind, his play \`The Importance of Being Earnest' is one of the most useless pieces ever written. Writing a simple and funny play, the play writer managed to criticize the hypocrisy of the Victorian society in this comedy of manners.The whole story is around the words \`earnest' and \`Ernest'. More than toying with the words and their sound and meaning, Wilde is talking about the \`masks' that people put in their faces by that time. Nobody is really what he/she seems to be. The two main characters Algernon Moncrieff and Algernon Moncrieff create another ego that they pretend to be their brothers-- to such device they call Bunburying hence the name of Algernon's brother.What is very clear with this plot is that Wilde shows how one has to lie in order to succeed. However, in another level, Bunburying is way of describing homosexual liaisons or is a way of escaping from the chains of the marriage. By the way, marriage itself is strongly criticized by the author in this play. The two marriageable girls are interested in men whose names are Ernest, no matter how they look or what they do.All the undertones of the play aside, \`The Importance of Being Ernest' is a quick and funny play, full of great lines that could only come from Oscar Wilde's mind. Just like Lady Braknell says to hurry a marriage: \`I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.' Simply funny, acid and true!"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"The Importance of Being Earnest is probably one of the funniest works I have ever been witness to; it definitely takes the cake when it comes to plays. The witty English humor is practically side splitting when read, so i can imagine how well it works when actually preformed on stage or film. The characters are so perfectly created within their aristocratic society. Lady Bracknell is the epitome of a lady and her humor, though she is not trying to be funny, is classic. The words do all the work. The characters just speak and as long as the lines are taken/given as canversationalthe entire play is nonstop laughs. The satire dealing with issues of class, love, money, and character has probably never been written as subtle or as well as Wilde has done with this play. The plot is humorous in its self. The whole concept of &quot;Burnburying&quot; to get around your obligations as a Gentleman and the problems it causes for Algernon and Jack. The shifty love story that carries the play is at times unbelievable but if you consider the farcicalnature of the play it is easily overlooked. The ending, although I won't give it away, is another classic example of a well written play. The twists and turns along the way that end up confronting the truth make the finish well worth your time. That's not to say that the rest of the play isn't great. If you're a fan of this type of comedy I would highly recommend not only buying this book but seeing it preformed as well."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I loved this! Generally I detest reading plays for some reason, but I enjoyed every minute of this one. The characters were excellent, and the plotline creative. Actually, the plot alone is amusing. The dialogue (ooooh, the dialogue!) is absolutely hilarious. I laughed out loud many, many times while reading this. I found Lady Bracknell to be one of the more entertaining characters, with her stereotypically lopsided priorities. Algernon and Jack's many angry (well, on Jack's part, at least) exchanges were marvelous (the bit with the muffins is an absolute classic, in my opinion). The satirical side of this was well-done and rather interesting for those interested in such things, but \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is, overall, a superb read just for the entertainment value of it."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This is a serious commedy and classic that nobody should miss.Please read it you will have a serious good time laughing and having so much fun you will not be able to put the book down.Wilde is amazing"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This is a serious commedy and classic that nobody should miss.Please red it you will have a serious good time laughing and having so much fun you will not be able to put the book down.Wilde is amazing"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I loved this book!!

GUFFAW. Girl puhleeze. Everybody tripping over this book is on some ish.This is one of the most eye-roll inducing stories I've read in a quick minute.

The ladies have a bizarre hang up on only marrying guys named Earnest and we have no idea why.**SPOILER ALERT**So let me get this straight, it just so happens that John, who really had no reason whatsoever to tell people that his name was \\"Earnest,\\" just so happened to be left in a purse on a train by Aunt Augusta's maid. Magically, he finds out that he's Algernon's brother and his name actually is \\"Earnest John\\" after his father. This is the same father that he shares with Algernon and yet somehow everybody forgot what the father's name was so Oscar Wilde had to spend about a page describing looking up the name in military records. Totally unnecessary and stupid.Anyway, wow, good for John/Earnest that Deus Ex Machina was employed because now he can get married to Gwendolen because she wasn't going to marry him because him name was John... never mind this new turn of events makes them first cousins.

I think it does not earn more stars because you already know at the beginning how this play probably will end. Sometimes I had to wonder about the stupidity of the personnages, I mean they act in such a stupid mannor. I do not like the end because the author did not think about a fitting end before writing the book and so I had the impression that he just invented the end. This play is quite amusing to fill up time, but it is not so good that I would read it twice."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty man. The Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde's most well-known work, is dripping with sharp humor and clever epigrams. But let's face it, it's fluff. The \\"social satire\\" that most reviewers cite to hold this book up as High Art is as pointed as a teaspoon and as sincere as a used-car salesman. Wilde was a libertine dandy who admired the snobbery and elitism of blue-blooded Britons. The Importance of Being Earnest is, in many ways, like MTV--stylish and entertaining, with some pretensions, but ultimately just a vacuous time-killer. If you need to read it for class, or even better want some literary [bathroom] reading, fine. If not, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I have decided that since so many people are obviously blind to how dumb this play is, I should write a review to enlighten anyone that might read it.

I saw the play being recorded at LATW and have purchased the CD to be able to continue to enjoy it. I grew up on the 1950s Edith Evans/John Gielgud/Joan Greenwood version, generally regarded as the gold standard, and I will say that LATW's is the first I have seen or heard to come anywhere near that classic. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This is to my mind the finest production of the most delightful of stage plays.

It is produced thousands of times each year all around the world from school productions to professional acting companies. The play premiered at the St. James Theatre in London on Valentine's Day 1895.The three act comedy stars Jack Worthing and (later to be revealed-his younger brother Algernon Moncrieff). Jack is courting Gwendolyn Fairfax. Algernon is in love with the beautiful young Cecily Cardew. Both of these young dandies have invented doubles. Jack acts like his name is Ernest. Algy has invented Bunbury whose ill health always requires a visit when Algy's pestiferious aunt Augustus Bracknell is in London.After countless bon motes and Wildean witticisims it is learned that Jack is really named Ernest. It is revealed that Cecily's governess Miss Prism had lost Jack when he was a baby by leaving him in a handbag at Victoria Station. Jack is, therefore, really named Ernest. Gwendolyn asserts she could never love any man unless he was named Ernest! She and Jack plan on wedding as does Algernon to the fetching Cecily.This play provides Wilde the opportunity to show off his ability to entertain while at the same time poking fun at the class conscious British aristocracy where what your name and genealogy are counts for a lot in high society.Some of this reviewer's favorite quotes from this eminently quotable play are the following:The truth is rarely pure and never simple\\"Only relatives or creditors ring in that Wagnerian mannerAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.Memory... is the diary that we all carry about with usI never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train.I have also in my possession ...certificates of Miss Cardew's birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration vaccination, confirmation and the measles; both the German and the English varietyI've now learned for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being EarnestOscar Wilde's other great plays including \\"Salome\\"; \\"A Woman of No Importance\\"; \\"The Ideal Husband\\" and \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" are all worth the attention of modern fans of the drama. All are social satires in which Wilde the ultimate Irish, gay outsider slams hard at English social pretensions in late Victorian fin de siecle England.Discover the wonderful world of Oscar Wilde in his plays, short stories, only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" and his essays and poems."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Dr. Gladden provides tremendous insight not only into Oscar Wilde's life as the ultimate dandiacal Victorian writer but also into the Victorians as a people, culture, and era in British history.

This book represents the manifestation of true scholarship at its finest."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"\\"Truth is beautiful, without doubt; but so are lies.\\" ~Ralph Waldo EmersonI didn't know anything about this play going in to it. After reading the first few pages it became evident pretty quickly that this was a comedy, and a pretty good one at that. There is a lot of witty banter and snide remarks throughout that make you laugh out loud. I imagine this is even funnier on the stage with the actors' body language, etc.The play demonstrates how a couple of lies can culminate into a huge quandary. You can see the train wreck coming and the anticipation builds until the train finally comes off it's tracks at the satisfying collision ... I mean culmination.The version of the book I read is full of footnotes that includes changes that have occured in the play over the years and other pertinent information to the play. There is one footnote that I found particularly interesting; it says, Franklin Dyall, who played Merriman (in the play) recalled the effect of one of his lines on the first night, \\"This [announcement] was received with the loudest and most sustained laugh that I have ever experienced, culminating in a round of applause; and as I came off Wilde said to me: 'I'm so glad you got that laugh. It shows they have followed the plot.'\\" Imagine watching your play being acted out for the first time. It must be nerve-wracking to sit there hoping that people will like it and appreciate it. It must also be extremely satisfying to see and hear the positive reactions.My wife noticed what I was reading and told me she had seen the movie and that it starred Rupert Everett as Algernon. I can't think of a more apt actor for that role. I will have to check it out."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"While Oscar Wilde is not Shakespeare unarguably the best playwright, he is incredibly good and all three plays show it. Salome is a short 'biblical' play, Lady Windermere's Fan is a bit longer and with the exception of the naivete suffered by the Lady of the title incredibly well written as well. However, The Importance of Being Earnest is by far the best play in this collection. Two men whom are trying to get away with pulling a fast one on their girlfriends and two women who think they know whats going on. Throw in a misplaced bag with a baby inside, an overbearing British matriarch, and a Governess with a past and you have a laugh out loud comedy.

Basically, a Read-A-Long is a way of conducting an online book club. I wasn't sure if I would like it, and I have been talking to a few friends about starting a digital book club myself, so I thought that I would participate and see how it went.The procedure was to read to a certain point by a specific date, and then comment in response to the person in charge, to post your own opinions, and have a conversation with other people who are also reading the book.I did enjoy the experience, aside from the fact that I had to post by Friday, when I think I'd prefer each post to be &#34;due&#34; on Sundays instead. I also think I'd enjoy commenting and communicating with people I know even more than with random strangers who are reading the book at the same time. It'd be more personal and probably easier to respond.Interested in seeing how the Read-A-Long works?

If you are looking for a short read (free digitally on Kindle, iPad, Nook, etc.) that is humorous, this is the book for you.The book is about two friends, Algernon and Jack, who have alter egos that love to party and get into trouble. Both friends fall head-over-heels in love with women who demand that their mates have the name of Ernest. As impractical and strange as this sounds, the book is funny and filled with ridiculous quotes such as these:Algernon: &#34;The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is pretty, and to someone else, if she is plain.&#34; (p. 17)Jack: &#34;Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely good friends. I'll bet anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister.&#34; Algernon: &#34;Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.&#34; (p. 17)Miss Prism: &#34;No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.&#34; Chasuble: &#34;And often, I've been told, not even to her.&#34; (p. 26)and the last one I will quote so as not to spoil all of them for you. . .Lady Bracknell's opinion of marriage and engagements, which is hilarious: &#34;To speak frankly, I am not in the favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.&#34; (p. 51).*The page numbers are based on my free Kindle edition.It might be silly to say, but I honestly always forget that classic books can be funny, as &#34;The Importance of Being Earnest&#34; so classically is. It's the same with black and white movies. I always seem to think that old, classic movies or books are going to be dull and boring. Then when I read one (or see one) I am surprised at how much I enjoy it and how easy it is to relate to some of the things going on in the books.

I was super impressed by the hilarity and perfection of this story. I laughed out loud at the quirky statements that make these characters who they are. I couldn't help but fall in love with Jack.

And I confirm this feeling with this play I really loved. It's funny to noticethat the play is already 100 years old and still seems like it has been written a few days ago.The style of the dialogues is pitch-perfect. I've never found such a mastery in Wilde's dialoguesin his other plays, maybe except in Salome. It is quite easy to read, and absolutely hilarious fromthe beginning to the end. The author shows with a great sense of humour through a smart use of wordsthe triviality of social conventions during the Victorian period. The irony is often present, as wellas the twists and turns.Maybe can I only regret it was quite short, and I would have appreciated to be immersed a little bit longerin this delightful atmosphere. I really recommend this play for all ages. In particular if you have neverread any play before,this one may definitely convert you to become a theatre lover."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"A highly entertaining comedy even over a hundred years later.

Oscar Wilde had a great talent for dialogue and writing, but the real fun comes in the ingenious plotting and the side-splitting comments. &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is absolutely filled with insightful, humorous barbs that take jabs at society - you'll literally be laughing out loud every page.Not only is the play brilliantly ironic and witty, it's quite cheerful and good-natured. The characters are likable, the plot never takes itself too seriously, and the ending is happy. It seems that Wilde knew exactly what he wanted: to write a light-hearted, amusing play without serious overtones, and he succeeded wildly. This isn't to say that he sacrificed any literary qualities, as the play is recognized for the marvelous writing, but it is considerably more fun and entertaining than many other literary works.In sum, Oscar Wilde's &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is a classic in every sense of the word, and it's tremendously fun to read. I can't recommend any comedy more highly."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This is THE best collection of plays that I've ever read.

Little wonder why The Importance of Being Earnest is still a hit in theatres and cinemas to this day.Any theatre lover or anyone who enjoys a good comedy should read this play. There is a lot of reference to the lifestyle at the time of this plays performance (around the 1800s) and a lot of political and social talk. Throughout the three act play, it shows how funny fooling everyone, then getting caught can be, as well as finding love, and how friends can either help, or hinder your fooling of everyone. I thoroughly recommend this play to anyone who needs a good read and a good laugh.Highly contrasts Oscar Wilde's best work: the novel 'The Portrait of Dorian Gray', but still a very enjoyable script to read"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"You'll be laughing out loud throughout the entire play whether you wish too or not.

There are great quotes and good characters."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Oscar Wilde's &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; is a superb comedy that will keep you wondering what could possibly happen next. Wilde manages to keep the readers entertained while at the same time keeping their feet on the ground. The use of the &quot;old&quot; language helps the readers identify with the characters. The characters themselves constantly have you laughing at their absurd antics. You never know what lie is going to pop up next and you are continually wondering how the characters are going to get out of the pickle they've gotten themselves into. The constant twisting of the plot keeps the reader happy, excited, and surprised. The different settings keep it interesting and the steady flow of new characters keep a person guessing who really is being &quot;earnest.&quot; The dialogue is truly inspired and the choice to have the words &quot;play&quot; on each other manage to keep the play flowing. Oscar Wilde's play is truly brilliant and I would recommend this play to anyone who enjoys a good laugh."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"'The Importance of Being Earnest' is the greatest piece of literature I have ever read. We were forced to read many books in school, but why this play was never mentioned is something I don't understand. Simply, this play is the most clever, witty, and entertaining thing I have ever read in my life, period. You definitely won't find any great meaning or significance in this work, but so what. You'll simply laugh your butt off for most of the 70 to 75 pages."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Oscar Wilde's terrific comedy, The Importance of Being Earnest, jokes on serious human themes, such as love, religion, and truthfulness. This play uses comedy to joke about real life situations; that realistically would be wrong. In the end, a comedy's main purpose is to take a real life concept that ordinarily can not be made fun of, and make it fiction. The reader will be delighted by the comedy's similarity to today's T.V. sitcoms, which, like The Importance of Being Ernest, make fun of serious, real life problems. Nick at Night's new motto is \\"100% sitcoms, 100% unreality T.V.\\" So is The Importance of Being Ernest.The Importance of Being Ernest shows how reality can be made fun of in context of a comedy. Watch as Algernon and Jack create fictional brothers, so they can enjoy the best out of both worlds, and how the woman they fall in love with view their lies. The two woman's ideas on love will astonish the reader. Jack and Algernon mock religion when they use it as a way to impress women. The best part of this book occurs in the end, when Jack finds out who he really is, and how marriage is used as bribery. Even with all the lies and deceptions, the characters never take a thing seriously, and as a result the end of the book has a happy tone.In the end, I strongly recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor, which is basically everybody. It is well written, and there are small parts within the language itself that will make you laugh. It is only 54 pages, so if you're having a rough day, and need a good laugh, pick up a copy of The Importance of Being Ernest, and laugh your head off."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"The Importance of Being Ernest is Oscar's finest work that I have ever read. After sitting through a seemingly unbearable adaptation of The Ideal Husband, it was refreshing to once again discover the wit of Oscar Wilde. All of the social criticism and delightful cynicism that is always prevelant in Wilde's work is masterly employeed in this play. The play was compelling in that it always keeps the reader interested. There is never a dull moment in the story of Algernon Moncrief and John Worthing, two members of the English upper class who get entangled in their own lies. Each man assumes the Identity of Ernest Worthing, a fictional creation used to escape the dreariness of everyday life, an act which catches up to them eventually. These two men are then forced to explain their deceptions to their fiances who know them only as Ernest. The story is filled with clever plot twists that make it a real enjoyment to read. The Importance of Being Ernest is a masterpiece of intelligent comedies. To compare it to anything else would be to do it an injustice. This classic is timeless and I would recommend it to anyone. It makes reading pleasurable and leaves you wanting more which is the importance of great literature."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I really enjoyed reading it, because I think it contents a good portion of humour, and also irony. At first I did not know what to expect from the novel, I did not even understand the title at all. One man\`s name is called \\"Ernest\\" and so I got confused by the name and the adjective \\"to be earnest\\". I must also say, that the beginning is difficult to understand because at first you don\`t really know what the idea of \\"bunburry\\" is. And then the different relationships between the persons are not easey to understand. After I have read the novel, I had the chance to watch also the film. Afterwards I have liked the novel more, the film was too old and you could only guess what the actors were saying, they had a very strong English accent."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"A wonderful collection! One could sit down and read this book from start to finish in one sitting and remain enthralled. You will find yourself quoting Wilde for weeks. By the end, I had a firm grasp of what &quot;the season&quot; was and how polite society functioned from Wilde's point of view. A must-read if you've read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: you will finally understand why Fenchurch is always asked if she was found in a handbasket! Wilde's writing is, as always, witty and beautiful. &quot;You will call me sister, won't you?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This is absolutely the greatest comedy I have ever read! Its humor appeals more to the mind than the slapstick humor of American comedies. It's set in England, in and outside of London, and is a perfect example of a Comedy of Manners play, though written in the mid-1800s. It involves two men who make up a friend or relative that just &quot;happens&quot; to get into a bad situation whenever they want to go to town (or out in the country). Through extenuating circumstances, one comes to be known as Ernest in the town, and the other becomes the very same person out in the country.This is the greatest comedy play ever written, and I would recommend it to anyone who finds Shakespeare too bland at parts, and the farce of the Three Stooges unbearable. It is probably one of the most well-written plays I have read or seen in my life, rising above most Shakespeare plays and such modern plays as &quot;Inherit the Wind.&quot;&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; holds a message behind the satire of the 19th century that crosses all time; it is better to be honest than to be caught as Ernest."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This play is the second I read in my life, but I am sure it is one of the best ever written!It is witty and funny, a social satire everybody should read.Wilde played with words and stereotypes in a wonderful manner.Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"One of Oscar Wilde's most famous works, this play is a must read for anyone that is even remotely interested in English theater at any level.&quot;Comedy of Manners,&quot; Wilde's play is on the very shallow surface, a funny play that is full of some of his greatest epigrams.At a deeper level, this play is full of political commentary, social satire and a look at the upper class British of a hundred years ago.Using his world renound style and wit, Wilde, wrote a play that brought to light the majors flaws of the idle rich and the hypocracy that lived right on the surface of their every day lives.Often immitated but never surpassed, Wilde had a way with words and an ability to get to the heart of matters while protecting himself; by making the people he was pointing his finger at, laugh at themselves.This play should be bought, even if one has seen one of the many film versions, or a live revival of the show. The jokes are piled so thickly on top of each other, that in real time, it is imposible to catch everything, or to digest all of the deeper meanings that this play attempts to expose."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"The Importance of Being Earnest has always been one of my favorite books ever! I read it out in no time again after downloading the Kindle edition which I found well presented. I thoroughly advise anyone to get it."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"\\"We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces,\\" Lady Bracknell remarks in Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance Of Being Earnest.\\" In this delicious, divine comedy of good (and some very bad) manners , Wilde punctured the surface pretentions of upper-class 1895 England with his trademark wit and astringent dialogue. This L.A. Theatre Works production is superb. Director Michael Hackett also offers a gender-bending twist by casting Charles Busch as Lady Augusta Bracknell, with hilarious results. Busch is outstanding in the celebrated role.The topsy-turvy plot springs from a case of deliberate, mistaken identity. Leading a \\"double-life,\\" Jack (James Marsters) finds it useful to be \\"Earnest\\" in town and \\"Jack\\" in the country. Whenever he needs to escape country obligations, he is conveniently called away by his \\"brother Earnest.\\" Jack wishes to wed Gwendolyn (Sarah Zimmerman), but first he must pass inspection by her formidable mother, Lady Bracknell, who is described as \\"a monster without being a myth.\\" When Jack tells Lady Bracknell he knows absolutely nothing, she delightedly replies, \\"I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate, exotic fruit. Touch it, and the bloom is gone.\\" When he mentions he has \\"lost\\" both parents, she reproaches, \\"To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.\\"Complications ensue as the action moves from the town to the country. Jack's flighty friend Algernon (Matthew Wolf) decides to pose as \\"brother Earnest\\" and promptly falls in love with Jack's ward Cecily (Emily Bergl). Soon, Gwendolyn and Cecily believe they are both engaged to \\"Earnest.\\" Their tea and cake scene is a comedy classic. Similarly, Jack and Algernon often quibble over such things as muffins and bread and butter. The conclusion, involving Cecily's governess Miss Prism (Jill Gascoine), a handbag, and a three-volume romance novel, is simultaneously absurd and dramatically sound. Laughter is abundant throughout and Wilde's wit reigns supreme. The L.A. Theatre works production also includes a rather academic interview with director Michael Hackett and producer Susan Loewenberg."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Oscar Wilde made his initial reputation as the master of the epigram: the trenchant and mordant, roughly haiku length flashes of insight into the comic absurdity of the world. No one in English Literature before or since has ever displayed such an effortless mastery of wit. \\"All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.\\"The Importance of Being Earnest not only flaunts Wilde's most inconsequential plot, it is also crammed with his funniest epigrams and wittiest bon mots. This 1895 three-act comedic tour-de-force was an immediate hit in London. The comic word-play was a sensation amongst audiences who flocked to see this brilliant manifestation of Wilde's epicene witticisms. Here was a glittering example of London's avant-garde in the 1890's. Much like the play Hair in the 1960's, it was a signature of the times that no self-respecting sophisticate could miss. Wilde enjoyed himself immensely during this apex of his fame. Unfortunately, his reputation was quickly eclipsed by the scandal that engulfed him and his work. It took several decades for that reputation to be rehabilitated. The Importance of Being Earnest seemed to float above the scandals, never losing its popularity and acquiring a theatrical life of its own as an absolutely iconic work.This Norton Critical Edition contains an annotated version of the play as well as several brilliantly incisive articles. A few of the analysts engage in some scholarly hand-waving, trying to attribute a social commentary and literary symbolism to the play that may not exist. Some of it is quite funny, in fact. I can't help but think that Wilde would appreciate the irony of one critic portraying his comic depiction of the frequently agitated butler Lane as an assault on the English class system. Other articles are quite helpful, however. The essay by Camille Paglia is especially insightful with her brilliant analysis of Wilde's dramatic projection of an ambiguous sexual persona. It is a rare comic play that merits its own Norton Critical Edition. This is one of the few. If you love this play (and the hilarious 1951 Anthony Asquith film) as much as I do, this is the edition to have. Most strongly recommended.Mike Birman"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This is the Theater Guild on the Air condensed version with this great cast, but there is a double LP box set on Angel in America that is perhaps the greatest audio recording of an English comedy, and it should be issued at once.

I'm not surprised now, after reading it, to hear that it was also his very favorite. I was laughing practically non-stop from Jack's originating from a handbag, to the scene where all is discovered about their names. It's witty, charming, and absolutely brilliant.

It is a great companion in times of trouble -- boredom, sadness, Weltschmerz. I saw it first at summer camp in 1968, where we -- a bunch of 15- and 16-year olds -- put it on. I was 13. I fell in love. It was the wittiest thing I had ever seen. More recently (2001) I saw it at the Fleetwood Stage in New Rochelle, New York. Again, it knocked the audience flat, we were laughing so hard. Wilde's silliness, combined with his brilliance and social insight, makes for a kind of humor that is practically inimitable. That he should have suffered in a hard-labor prison is an outrage."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"\\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" seems to start as a play about truth, but quickly becomes a play about the false through the classical \`simple misunderstanding.' The two male leads, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, use imaginary friends they both invent to avoid the boring and weekly family engagements. These imaginary friends lead to eventual confusion between them and the women they love. This Shakespearean misunderstanding is only half the fun though. Wilde, always witty, mocks the ill portrayed English Aristocracy of the late 19th century - poking constant fun at not only their etiquette, but also their stubborn and unpractical tendencies, their immoral behavior, and their exploitation of the lower classes. Very rarely do comedies strike to the heart of the matter and say something meaningful as Oscar Wilde did with this last great play of his."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"The play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; by Oscar Wilde is a very funny play on British society in the late 1800?s and early 1900?s. The verbal barbs and jabs thrown by friends Jack and Algernon are quite amusing and quick-witted throughout the play. The idea that two women would be shallow enough to only want to marry a man named Earnest is just mind boggling, since the word earnest is almost 180 opposite the shallowness of the ladies. The mother is an interesting character in that she will not let her daughter marry the son of a &quot;hand bag&quot;, this adds a little break from the gentlemen?s verbal assault on one another and allows the reader to catch their breath. The ending is quite funny but I will not give it away, you must do yourself a favor and read the play."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is one of the funniest plays that I have ever read. It explores the British upper society at the beginning of the 20th Century. It concerns two best friends and their attempt to marry two women. The only reason that the women want to marry these men is if their first name is Earnest. The main character of the play is Jack. He goes under the assumed name of Earnest because he really does not know who his parents are. The situations and banter between Jack and his friend Algernon is the funniest since Shakespeare. This is interesting in the fact that it is very anti tragic play. It is anti tragic in the fact that by the end of the play, Jack finds out that his name is really Earnest and his is upset about it. Extremely funny play for anyone who knows anything about the British sense of royalty and nobility."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Oscar Wilde is a wonderful playwright--truly a literary genius. Earnest is probably his best play because he has developed past the Problem Play genre and focuses all his talent on pure wit and the criticism of the frivolity of Victorian England. Where his other plays have a touch of serious Melodrama (though they, too, have their wonderful aspects), The Importance of Being Earnest is Melodrama and Comedy of Manners at its height, providing humor for all generations."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This book had me laughing almost the whole time I was reading it. This is a good book, great for older children to adults, and is sure to at least amuse the most humorless individual."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I read this when I took the Comic Vision in school. In all honesty this is a phenomenal piece of literature. Wilde offers comedy of several sorts. The bickering between Jack and Algernon and the bickering between Gwendolen and Cecily is well drawn. Lady Bracknell is a dominating figure in herself. Miss Prism and the Priest are also memorable supporting characters. Wilde also offers a funny repetition of events when first Jack tries to woo Gwendolen under an alias identity and then Algernon tries to woo Cecily under the same alias identity. This makes the scene where they all meet together hilarious! But Wilde DOES NOT stop here! After the 2 men and 2 women bickered with each other, Jack and Algernon team up to win the love of their lives, and Gwendolen and Cecily team up to determine the integrity of Jack and Algernon. The end of this defines dramatic irony! (I don't want to spoil it.) Perhaps the greatest thing about this book is that Wilde skillfully balances subtle humour and major dramatic irony. If you like this book, you MUST see the Paramount Production. Most video stores should have it."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Okay, so Oscar Wilde is never placed in context with the &quot;world view&quot; so many of us have of the Victorian era. This play, probably his finest, is a laugh out loud riot about two young men with a combined four identities, both searching for an honest, compassionate relationship with two equally shallow women.

It is funny-- genuinely funny, without being naughty or &quot;sophisticated&quot; or cynical, without being overly goofy, without being sad at the same time, or profound, or stupid. It is light without making you wish it was deeper or think maybe it is and you missed it somehow.I was forced to read a fair number of comedies throughout English lit classes, and my clearest memory was that most jokes, though alive on stage, are dead on the page. Even in Shakespeare, often. Here, though, I really was laughing, enjoying the wordiness and wit. Makes me really wish and hope to see it performed someday.The word that comes to mind is pure. Like if there really are Platonic forms, essences of things, this is the platonic form of comedy. Or at least approaches it more closely than anything else I've ever read.It's simple. It's short.

The dialogue is full of anecdotes worth citing, and trust me you would return to read this play more than once.Some examples to give you the flavor:ALGERNON The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!or this dialogue:JACK Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.LADY BRACKNELL I am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some kind. There are far too many idle men in London as it is. How old are you?JACK Twenty-nine.LADY BRACKNELL A very good age to be married at. I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing. Which do you know?JACK [After some hesitation.] I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.LADY BRACKNELL I am pleased to hear it. I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square. What is your income?or maybe this one:JACK I have lost both my parents.LADY BRACKNELL To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.or try this:)JACK Well, will you go if I change my clothes?ALGERNON Yes, if you are not too long. I never saw anybody take so long to dress, and with such little result.JACK Well, at any rate, that is better than being always over- dressed as you are.ALGERNON If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being always immensely over-educated."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; by Oscar Wilde, is one of the great comic masterpieces of the theater. According to the introductory note in the Dover edition, the play was first performed in London in 1895. More than a century later, &quot;Importance&quot; is still a sparkling delight. Although I suppose the play is best experienced as a theatrical performance, it also makes a wonderful read.In &quot;Importance&quot; Wilde has fun with the customs and attitudes of well-to-do 19th century English people. As the plot of mistaken identity and romance unfolds, Wilde's characters let loose a string of memorable witticisms and sarcastic comments. One of my favorites: &quot;Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.&quot; Another one: &quot;My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree.&quot;Along the way, Wilde's characters reveal the benefits and drawbacks of being a &quot;Bunburyist&quot; (don't bother looking it up in a dictionary; you have to read the play!). So pour yourself a cup of tea, stuff yourself silly with cucumber sandwiches, and enjoy &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"By looking at the cover I didn't think I would like this book : a dirty brown with an Old English illustration. But once I read the first few pages I was hooked. The book is based on Oscar Wilde's play of the same name, one I only vaguely had heard of. Although the story takes place in 19th century England, the humor transcends time. It starts off when one gentleman meets up with another. Questions arise to the identity of the visiting man, named Ernest, which leads to a mini-mystery. The two men banter humorously throughout the book accompanied by the leading ladies and a very accomodating butler. The reason for the title becomes apparent when the name Ernest is the central cause for the hilarity. I absolutely loved this book! It was a quick read and made me laugh out loud. I was surprised that noone else had written a review for it. I was glad I took a chance with something that, on the surface, didn't look very appealing. You won't be disappointed if you did, too."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Still extremely popular 110 years after being first produced at the St James Theatre.Full of Oscar Wilde's characteristic repartee, sparkling wit and epigrams.The humour is as current today as it was in 1895. Two young man, Jack and Algernon, woo their respective young sweethearts by claming the name of Ernest, creating great confusion.Due to his seemingly dubious birth, Jack is prevented from marrying his beloved Gwendolyn, by her insufferable guardian, Lady Bracknell, while Jack is not quite happy about the debonair Algernon wooing his charge, the charming young Cecily.But all is well that ends well and circumstances; through a remarkable twist work out just fine.One of the best loved works of the master, Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I love Oscar Wilde, so for me is not difficult to like these play, is short, funny and (of course!) satiric."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This play is well phrased and thought out.

There's a great cast, including one of my favourites, James Marsters. All the actors are seasoned professionals and boy, does it show! You really need actors who know what they are doing with Wilde as he can be long-winded, verbose and obsessed with his own genius. No, not my favourite playright.That said, this is a spirited reading and highly enjoyable.i really have to mention LA Theatre Works' complete professionalism from start to finish, with the excellent sales staff who's dedication to their products and customer service is second to none."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"(not a review of the sudio cassette, which I haven't heard) I've read this play many times. It is a great companion in times of trouble -- boredom, sadness, Weltschmerz. I saw it first at summer camp in 1968, where we -- a bunch of 15- and 16-year olds -- put it on. I was 13. I fell in love. It was the wittiest thing I had ever seen. More recently (2001) I saw it at the Fleetwood Stage in New Rochelle, New York. Again, it knocked the audience flat, we were laughing so hard. Wilde's silliness, combined with his brilliance and social insight, makes for a kind of humor that is practically inimitable. That he should have suffered in a hard-labor prison is an outrage."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"\\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" seems to start as a play about truth, but quickly becomes a play about the false through the classical \`simple misunderstanding.' The two male leads, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, use imaginary friends they both invent to avoid the boring and weekly family engagements. These imaginary friends lead to eventual confusion between them and the women they love. This Shakespearean misunderstanding is only half the fun though. Wilde, always witty, mocks the ill portrayed English Aristocracy of the late 19th century - poking constant fun at not only their etiquette, but also their stubborn and unpractical tendencies, their immoral behavior, and their exploitation of the lower classes. Very rarely do comedies strike to the heart of the matter and say something meaningful as Oscar Wilde did with this last great play of his."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"This sparkles with wit that belongs only to Oscar Wilde. The sarcasm is delicious and the twists very intriguing. At first I was highly confused by it but midway, I found my bearings. Great read."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"\\"All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.Is that clever?It's perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in civilized life should be.\\"This is just one of the many jocular exchanges and epigrams in this short but brilliant social satire. Wilde wryly and cleverly gets his claws into the upper caste and its twisted moral etqieuette, romantic relationships, and self-critically the propensity for sententious moral (and aesthetic) self-guidance.Dispensing with politeness and social convention through his farcical dialogue, Wilde unleashes his comic criticism on all types of hypocrisies and spurious norms. The Importance of Being Ernest is always subversive and funny, but never crude or sophomoric."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I love this play; I cannot imagine not having read it, not being able to revel in its insane logic of plot and a script that consists almost entirely of epigrams. Even though the play is given over to a frenzy of wit, the characters are likable and well-drawn, not mere vehicles for gag lines. The only problem with this play is that it is too short."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"I was never a fan of Oscar Wilde's until I read The Importance of Being Earnest. His words crackle and fly off of the page, full of humor and fluency. I was never bored with this text, from its very start to the crazy, chaotic end. Wilde made me writhe in my seat with anticipation, wondering what loony character I'd be introduced to next, and with what sub-plot they'd fit in. The dialogue of The Importance of Being Earnest snaps, addressing social ideas and mores that, in its time, weren't exactly spoken aloud. What a clever and creative man Wilde truly was."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"As a high school student reading this play for educational purposes, my first impression was that it would be long and boring. I was, however, corrected within the first few pages as I encountered the hilarious discussions between Jack and Algernon. The language and wit is so dry its hard not to find something amusing. This line said by Algernon is one worth saving, &quot;The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!&quot; Contrary to popular belief, this play is not one thats difficult to get into. Right from the start there is a conflict that grabs the readers attention and carries them through the mix up of fiances with Cecily and Gwendolen, also a scene that is sure to amuse even the most serious of readers. Lady Bracknell could seemingly be a thorn in the readers side in the beginning, but not to worry, the old woman set in her ways becomes if nothing else a source of comic relief. This play is not only a quick read but also has the perfect combination of characters that makes it delightfully funny."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"It is a brilliant play with joke and charm. From the beginning it is very complex and the relations are mixed up. You never know who is related to whom and figures are very characteristic. You never what will happen next. The play is written for his time very progressive and modern. The women are worried about the name of their engaged men and forget the real worth of human nature. Lady Bracknell wants her children only to marry with persons of higher society and doesn't carry about real love. I can recommend this funny play."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"The story is about the two dandies Algernon and Jack who invented an imaginary person to have an excuse to go to country or to town. Both of them fall in love, but because of the double personality of Algernon and Jack there is a lot of confusion. At the everything clears up and there is a happy ending. We liked to read the book and can recommend it to everyone. It is really very funny. The characters talk a lot of paradoxical things. Oscar Wilde plays with the adjective earnest and the name Ernest. The motto of the play is: &quot;In matters of great importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.&quot; Oscar Wilde said once: &quot; We should treat all the trivial things of life very seriously, and all the serious things of life with sincere and studied triviality.&quot; At the beginning everything they talk about seems to be nonsense, but if you think about it you see that some things they say are quite rig"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Read this eons ago back in high school.

The wit of the dialogues is something that I rarely find in books or movies. The humor has originality, the irony is catching. It makes me laugh when the characters' remarks, upside down from what one would call desirable or normal, are yet so fitting to how a large part of the society thinks. It could be that Wilde intended to severely criticize society, but I remained with an impression of how funny the world is with its inconsistencies, little vices and flaws. Funny in a lovable way. What trouble would we be in if there were nothing to ironise? Perfect reason, perfect honesty, perfect altruism and other such perfections are deeply flawed, firstly for not having anything amusing about them :)."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","review":"Wilde's plays hold up incredibly well and provide some of the most quotable one-liners in literature. A master of satire, in these selections the upper classes and the social conventions they adhered to are skewered through the ingenious use of word play ,mistaken identity and farce.

Very real and vivid mind pictures. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Blackbelly: A Novel","review":"Funny things happen when you face the truth: people begin to feel better about themselves. That's how it is in Blackbelly, a book full of small-town angst. Set in Sweetwater, Idaho, population \\"a long way from a shopping mall,\\" the book's voice and cadence fits the landscape: plainspoken, unassuming and natural. Author Sharfeddin has crafted a compelling story around Chas McPherson, a 41-year-old who wants to be left alone to tend his flock of blackbelly sheep and do the right thing -- which includes helping his dad live out his last days at home. Intimidating as he is fragile, the senior McPherson is dying from late-stage Parkinson's. You can feel sorry for him, but it's not easy to like him. His freakish past as the town's fiery pastor includes calling people out for their sins. Now that he's mute and expressionless, we don't know what he's thinking, but he's apparently more alert than the people able to walk and talk around him. His silence looms large, adding dimension and tension between he and his son, and he and Mattie Holden -- the youngish nurse willing to put up with just about anything. Sharfeddin romanticizes nothing. The old ranch and house are a dump, the sheep are dirty, and the drinking gets hard. Above it all is an earnest sheriff who's trying to figure out who burned down the house of an Iranian-American family that -- good lord -- doesn't celebrate Christmas. Nicely drawn is how the characters' personal certainties unravel. Particularly touching are nurse Mattie's one-way, slightly awkward conversations with the old man, where she keeps him going by talking about everything from 16th-century fashion to random Bible passages, which she knows little about. She works hard. And she puts up with Chas, a small man on the exterior, but a big one inside. Why would a nurse take a job in the middle of nowhere? Why is Chas the town's number-one suspect for the arson? It's why I recommend it. Throw in never-die prejudices and the complexities of political correctness, man-made sins, forgiveness, and Sharfeddin delivers an even-handed novel that touch the truths of remembering too much."},{"Title":"Blackbelly: A Novel","review":"Bigotry, fear, and long, vengeful memories fuel the tension in Sharfeddin's striking debut, but it's her two main characters who capture the imagination and keep the pages turning.Set on a sheep ranch in remote Idaho, the story opens with 41-year-old Chas McPherson answering a phone call. He's advertised for a live-in nurse so he can bring his father home to die, but so far he's had no luck. As he talks it's easy to see why. He's a man too used to his own unwanted company. He's abrupt and blunt, with no social skills.As he talked, \\"He looked around his house at the piles of clutter and filthy dishes....When he hung up, he looked at the mess again, seeing it in a different light, now that someone was actually coming.\\" He worked for three days clearing \\"decades\\" of accumulation, but it wasn't until the prospective nurse arrived that he realized he hadn't cleaned.\\"The house wasn't cluttered now; it was sparse. He'd purged it of trash and memories alike, as if there was no distinction. But he hadn't scrubbed anything. And now, as she approached, he saw the dust, the grit, the coating of neglect on everything.\\"But Mattie Holden, a city girl from Spokane in her mid-30s, takes the job, and moves in immediately. Too relieved to question his luck, Chas quickly moves his father home and Mattie settles in to a lot more of the cleaning and cooking than she'd planned on. Chas' father is helpless and unresponsive, in the last stages of Parkinson's.But there's an aura of strength about him, a presence that grows increasingly ominous. \\"He just seems bigger than he is,\\" Mattie tells Chas. \\"When I turn my head I have this sense that he's enormous. It sounds crazy.\\"Chas, grudgingly attempting to co-exist, tells her how his father once killed a bobcat with his own hands. \\"Illness can't diminish a man like that.\\" Slowly, haltingly, Chas reveals more. His mother ran away when he was 10; his big, powerful sheep-ranching father was a preacher with rigid, unforgiving standards. Chas himself is gruff and hard drinking, but thinks of himself as a man who didn't live up to anyone's standards, even his own.Chas is a complex character, a man who looks just like his father but has none of the old man's rigidity. It doesn't take him long to realize Mattie has secrets, but he doesn't pry. When a valued customer, the only Muslim family in town, can't afford to buy the traditional lamb before Eid, Chas leaves one tethered to their porch and then denies having done so. He refuses to sign a petition banning Christmas trappings from the local school because, he says, it will only give bigots an excuse to lash out at the non-Christians.A few days later the Muslim family's house is torched and Chas is accused of the crime. The sheriff, an outsider, assumes there must be something to it if everyone in town is convinced Chas is guilty.Meanwhile Mattie is having more and more trouble sleeping, convinced Chas' father is haunting her, that he sees into the deepest recesses of her soul and her less than proud past. And maybe there's something to that. Most of Sweetwater thinks he has uncanny powers and hates him for it too, willing to visit all the old man's unforgiving destruction on the son.The town's near-universal willingness to come together in hatred would seem far-fetched if it didn't happen so often in real life. Sharfeddin does a good job of portraying small town insularity and mutual reinforcement and builds the novel to a complex, layered conclusion.Described in the jacket copy as a \\"contemporary Western,\\" \\"Blackbelly\\" has all the elements: the whisky-drinking, principled, misunderstood loner; the troubled, secretive woman who draws him out, and the evil of lesser men, which threatens to destroy his life. But Sharfeddin's treatment of these elements makes them real, with shades of ambiguity throughout, conflicts not easily settled and no simple resolution. A bit battered by life, Mattie and Chas have learned from their mistakes and flaws (Chas more than Mattie), but not overcome them.Sharfeddin, a sheep rancher herself, fleshes out the feel and smell of a sheep ranch. The book's title comes from a special breed of sheep, which the reader learns a fair amount about in the course of the novel, and the rhythm of the work (it's lambing time) creates a structured flow. An impressive first novel from a writer to watch."},{"Title":"Blackbelly: A Novel","review":"I just finished the book.

We are given a hint of what the police officer in the story is like, leaving me wanting to know more about him, although he was not a main character. Chas, the main character, is truly a good and moral soul, despite his flaws. The details are very authentic of rural ranch life in Idaho and painted a full picture that you could simply step into and forget you were reading.

I still think of the characters and wonder how they are and what they are doing. As I was reading the first few pages, I kept thinking how amazing it was that Heather was the writer and that I knew her.

Sharfeddin's prose is spare and beautiful, and her characters are finely drawn. The sense of place, rural Idaho in winter, is cold, snowy, and real. I found myself returning to the sheep ranch of my imagination long after the story finished. I particularly enjoyed the main character Chas, a gruff rancher stuck with a life and legacy he did not choose, accused of a crime he did not commit.This book belongs on the shelf with Ivan Doig, Annie Proulx, and Craig Leslie.

Heather Sharfeddin's prose is straightforward, non-judgmental and honest from first word to last. And her characters, Chas McPherson, the proud loner who wants to do right by his dying father, and Mattie Holden, an unassuming nurse looking for a chance to start fresh, ring as true as any I've encountered--on or off the page--in recent memory. Blackbelly is a story of loneliness, repressed needs, and bigotry in a small town. Sprinkled with a hint of the supernatural, a few bible quotes and a layer of underlying tension, it resonates like a clanging cow bell. We haven't heard the last from this outstanding wordsmith.Salmon Run"},{"Title":"Blackbelly: A Novel","review":"I read Sharfeddin's book between Hemingway and Terry Kay. She more than held her own against these two great writers. From the first chapters I was drawn in and felt like I was a part of the story. I was impressed with Sharfeddin's ability to capture the lead male character so well. How did she get into the mind of a male so well? Maybe I don't want an answer.This is an enjoyable book that reaches deep to capture emotions we all face but often hide from. Through this book we can learn a little more about ourselves, our society, and others. I recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Blackbelly: A Novel","review":"The past will come to light in often the most devastating way possible. \\"Sweetwater Burning\\" tells the tale of the small town of Sweetwater, Idaho as sheep rancher Chas McPherson cares for his livestock as well as his father. Hiring a troubled woman named Mattie Holden to look after his invalid father, Mattie's problems seem to exacerbate the problems between Chas and his father, especially when there is arson afoot in the small town. \\"Sweetwater Burning\\" is an intriguing novel that will prove hard to put down."},{"Title":"Blackbelly: A Novel","review":"I could not put this book down. The story is compelling, the writing is vivid. Sharfeddin immediately pulls you into the characters' lives. As much as I enjoy suspense, I rarely read westerns. I'm glad I made an exception here. Sharfeddin's story is a universal one of family and redemption. You'll learn a lot, think a lot, and be thoroughly entertained. I read 'Sweetwater Burning' in hardcover, when was called 'Blackbelly' - it's the same, wonderful book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Blackbelly: A Novel","review":"I read this as Blackbelly when it was originally published and was looking it up to buy for a book club friend when I realized it had been re-named and released as Sweetwater Burning. Although I like the first title better, I must say that the book itself is searing. I fell in love with Chas, I sympathized with Mattie, and I alternately loved and hated the sheriff and the town. I feel like I've been there (in that house, in that town), and this book took me back in unexpected and beautiful ways. It even had the promise of a happy (or potentially happy?) ending, which I didn't expect.I think this would be a great book club book, and I plan on sharing it with my own book club when we meet again."},{"Title":"Blackbelly: A Novel","review":"In Sweetwater, Idaho, introspective fortyish sheep rancher Chas McPherson prefers being left alone caring for his blackbellies. However, when his dying father Franklin, a fiery brimstone preacher no longer can take care of himself due to advanced Parkinson, Chas places an ad for home care help. Nurse, Mattie Holden responds willing to arrive from Spokane in two days and even help with the cooking.A petition circulates to change the Christmas gala at the public school to an inclusive holiday celebration. Soon afterward, the townsfolk accuse taciturn Chas, as a chip off his dad's burn in hell preaching, of arson because the victims, the Teleghanis, are the only Muslim family in Sweetwater. His refusal to acknowledge the accusations except with the sheriff add to fuel of those who believe he did the deed. Meanwhile, Mattie makes the ranch more humanly livable with small feminine mystiques; she struggles with addiction and her growing fear that her patient can look deep inside a person's soul to witness their sins. As the sheep rancher and the nurse find succor and perhaps love with one another, a reckoning is coming to Sweetwater.This is a strong character driven psychological thriller with a slight flavoring pinch of the paranormal. The story line focuses on the remote locale with readers feeling a strong sense of being in Sweetwater especially at the ranch as Heather Sharfeddin gets inside the minds of the locals after the arson occurs. Although the loving affair between the rancher and the nurse is well written, it seems a forced requirement that subtracts from the lonely existence of ranching in Idaho. Still overall Sweetwater Burning is a powerful rural small town suspense thriller as the sins of the father are bestowed on the son.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blackbelly: A Novel","review":"I bought and read this book based on all the favorable, enthusiastic reviews. I am at a total loss to understand how not one person gave this book less than five stars. It read more like a romance book than a suspense or well-developed novel. The characters changed at the writer's whim. Not believable. People don't change that fast and that frequently. The plot was totally predictable. A disappointing book."},{"Title":"Alexander Calder (Life and Work Of...)","review":"As a whole, Adam Schaefer's \\"The Life and Work Of...\\" series of books on artists, aimed at young readers, is excellent; this particular selection, however, lacked the enthusiasm of most other titles. The best part of the book discusses Calder's work creating circus animal sculptures, and this topic will surely appeal to students. The latter portion of the book, however, is devoted to the artist's abstract sculptures, and considering the audience level for which this book was written, the author does not quite bring the genre to life for a young mind unfamiliar with such terms and concepts. More attention, perhaps, should have been paid to Calder's mobile sculptures and the effect his popularization of this invention had on the world in general."},{"Title":"Cybercounseling and Cyberlearning: Strategies and Resources for the Millennium","review":"This is an excellent book for individuals interested in helping people via technology. The topic is not only about counseling via a distance (not in an office, face to face) but also about the history of learning via technology. Learning and counseling cognitively are very similar and have similar technological uses. The editors do a good job of presenting information on theory, practical issues, phobias against technology use with people in need, as well as implementation issues. A wide variety of topics for people interested in all aspects of distance learning and communication. You can pick and choose the chapters that are relavant to your interests or I recommend reading the whole book to see how other fields are using the same types of technologies for different issues."},{"Title":"Holt Science & Technology National: Student Edition [M] Forces, Motion, and Energy 2007","review":"We were very satisified with our purchase.

I've enjoyed their books on all sorts of different subjects, not only their food books. Therefore, I picked this book up without even looking inside.What I found in this book, more than new material, was the impression that this was a book made up on short notice out of the Sterns's existing files. It was neither as comprehensive or descriptive as earlier food reviews. Certainly nowhere near as comprehensive as Road Food, sort of like a little abridgment. Additionally, a bunch of the eating places in the book aren't in business anymore.I'm looking forward to trying the fried chicken recipe given in the review of the Bon Ton Mini Mart, but this book left me feeling like a hungry man on a diet--satisfying somewhat, but left feeling like something was distinctly missing. I really got the impression that this was a 'quickie', and not up to the standards of their other books.I love reading the Sterns, and seeing them on TV, and hope this isn't the beginning of a trend."},{"Title":"Blue Plate Specials and Blue Ribbon Chefs","review":"If the excellent &quot;Roadfood&quot; can be thought of as the complete guide to America's roadside eateries, &quot;Blue Plate Specials&quot; would be the Greatest Hits collection, at least in the opinion of our tireless guides, Jane and Michael Stern. This book is a fine collection of some of the Sterns' most distinctive and interesting roadside restaurant experiences, along with a memorable recipe (or facsimile of one) from each. Sadly, some of the restaurants discussed here are no longer in business, but the Sterns help keep them living in memory.Personally, I found this title less evocative than &quot;Roadfood.&quot; That book made me want to toss a copy of it in the glove compartment and head out on a cross-country tour, hitting one great-sounding diner or rib shack after another. This book didn't. It was nice to read about the Sterns' experiences in their travels, but I didn't catch the passion of it all like I did with &quot;Roadfood.&quot; Your mileage may vary.Still, if you're a fan of the Sterns, this is a title worth checking out -- not, perhaps, as a guide to your own future travels, but as a good example of &quot;foodie lit&quot; and the vicarious excitement of sitting down and studying a never-before-seen menu."},{"Title":"Blue Plate Specials and Blue Ribbon Chefs","review":"Although there are recipes in this book, it is much more than a cookbook. It is an interesting and entertaining look at America's eateries. Each entry contains a short history or background on the establishment, its food, and the people who work there and eat there, followed by a recipe or two.Anyone who travels and has eaten &quot;roadfood&quot; (or just dreams of it!) will enjoy this well-written book. And for those of us who will never get to visit even a small percentage of the eateries examined, it is a wonderful glimse at these businesses and the people who love working at them and eating at them.Another reviewer stated that some of the places listed are no longer in business. With a book of this nature, that's inevitable. So many small, family-owned businesses are closing up fast. I'm just glad that the Sterns were able to document their existence for us enjoy, if only from the comfort of our easy chairs.

But as with his acting career, he dropped out early, (although I must say I think he was a much better author than an actor). I read Voyage many years ago and went on to read &quot;The Wanderer&quot; his autobiographical work. Voyage is about a sailor and the hardships of the sea in the late 1800s. It also deals with the labor union movements of that era. A victim of McCarthyism which ended his acting career, Sterling Hayden's political agenda, in my opinion, was evident in this book. As a sailor I enjoyed it for its realism of the sea and would compare it to Richard Henry Dana's classic &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;."},{"Title":"Voyage, a Novel of 1896","review":"A story of 1896 written in 1976 by a man with an old soul. I envisioned a gray haired patriarch narrating this tale of a time when a four-masted barque would sail under the horn. The style is rough and heavy handed but you can taste the salt and feel the cold when he speaks of the sea. This is a hard read of a harsh time but well worth the voyage."},{"Title":"Voyage, a Novel of 1896","review":"While reading this huge book, it is easy to imagine Sterling doing the research. First, he would select the year for his opus. 1896 would seem like a good choice, because it was at the end of the tall ships when steam was supplanting sail, and Hayden was a lover of the ships (see his only other book, his autobiography: Wanderer). After he selected the year, he would go to a really good library and start reading the daily newspapers for 1896, jotting down events, dates, names and places. Then having compiled all his data, he would begin to compose this bestselling novel. The main focus of the book is the maiden voyage of \\"Neptune's Car\\" from Maine around the Horn to San Francisco. He has peopled the crew with very interesting and compelling characters, from the hard-driving, yet fair-minded Captain Irons Saul Pendelton, to the brutish first mate Otto Lassiter, to shipmates Harwar the Wrecker, Carmack the Anarch, a cast-a-way plucked from a deserted isle, and the ship's lone passenger MacLeod. Hayden takes the time to develop each of these characters and many others, providing them with a past, and a present, and no hope for the future. As the trip progresses, we get to know each of them personally as we learn of the extraordinarily hard life of the seaman and the futile and dangerous attempts to unionize and improve their lot. Meanwhile, we also follow another excursion: The Neptune Car's owner, Banning Butler Blanchard, sends his daughter and her ne'er-do-well husband with other socialites of the era on a pleasure cruise to Japan to witness a total solar eclipse. The juxtaposition of these two journeys gives an indepth look at the strong class distinctions of the day: the poor working stiff and the idle rich. Meanwhile, Blanchard himself is involved in that year's heated Presidential conflict. He goes to the Democratic Presidential convention in Chicago where the battle rages over whether America should use the gold or silver standard. Again, Hayden makes sure we understand all of the factors that lead to rioting in the streets and over-the-top rallies. And there are interesting sub-plots galore, each character driven, each fitting into the tapestry of the novel like tightly-fitting puzzle pieces. Hayden's strong descriptive abilities make us feel part of every scene, whether it be in the forecastle, on a Hawaiian beach, or a crowded convention hall floor. This is a two-fisted, hard drinking, passion-filled novel and makes me wish that Hayden had written other books. Why only four stars? The book leads us to an anticipated violent climax that just fizzles away on the very last pages. But until then, I could not have asked for more."},{"Title":"Voyage, a Novel of 1896","review":"I read it in the mid-70s, at about the same time as &quot;Ragtime&quot; was published and felt that it was in the same class. Sterling Hayden did amazing things with words in this book and managed to knit together a wide variety of the subcultures which existed in that era. Make the effort to find a copy of this book; you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Voyage, a Novel of 1896","review":"I'm glad to see that other reviewers thought as much of this book as I do. As the title states, this book is a novel of 1896. The year 1896 is pivotal (as is every other year, every other day, every other moment)in this country's history. Hayden creates a tableau of this pivotal time which surrounds and captures and includes the reader. He highlights the vast differences between the rich and the poor. He paints the east coast and the west coast; the nascent labor movement and the robber barons; American pride and American comtempt for fellow Americans. This book is a wonderful historical novel and certainly ranks in stature with historical novels by Dos Passos and Vidal.As the title also states, this book is about a voyage; rather, many voyages. The book focuses on the voyage of the 'Neptune's Car', a large barque on a voyage from New York to San Francisco via Cape Horn. The barque's voyage is contrasted with the comfortably posh voyage of the Cuttings of New York by private train car and crewed yacht to observe the eclipse of the sun in the northwestern Pacific. The characters are vivid and visceral. Like cross waves in a big swell the voyages of the individuals are traced and examined. Their actions are believable and their interactions sometimes explode like the storms around Cape Horn.This book is nothing short of wonderful. It is a sea story, an American story, a compelling historical novel, and a timeless story of human voyages and ships that pass in the night."},{"Title":"Voyage, a Novel of 1896","review":"Sterling Hayden is an excellent writer - especially when he is writing about subjects with which he has a lot of familiarity.

It is always new and exciting. If you can find it, read it, you won't be sorry"},{"Title":"Voyage, a Novel of 1896","review":"I like epic novels. This one looked big enough to be written by Michener or Tolstoy. However, it lacked the character definition and storyline of a good novel and was not a satisfying read.Voyage was disappointing in three regards. First, while many of the characters had the potential to be well-developed protagonists, the reader is left with only a superficial understanding of Pendleton, MacLeod, Harwar, and Blanchard. Their motivations remain only shallowly understood, even after nearly 700 pages. Second is the philosophy of the book -- the idealists dream of Marxist Utopia while the capitalists clutch their wealth and status... a simplistic theme, and yet with such poorly drawn characters, the reader is certainly _not_ swept up in the struggle. Third was the plot itself. The reader waiting for developments is finally rewarded on page 400 with a promising plot twist, bringing the action to a boil, but the excitement is left to fade back into a tepid simmer. While this was not the worst book I have read this year, I would not recommend it, even to someone who loved tales of the high seas."},{"Title":"Voyage, a Novel of 1896","review":"Maverick actor Sterling Hayden's first book was &quot;Wanderer&quot;, the tale of how he took his children and escaped to sea. His lifelong love of sailing and his great knowledge of the sea fill the pages of &quot;Voyage&quot;. But &quot;Voyage&quot; is not so much a sea story as a snapshot of America at an important, even a major turning point: the election of 1896. In that year, the Democratic party was captured by the Populist left, led by William Jennings Bryan, and was defeated in the general election by McKinley and the Republicans, thereby setting American politics on a conservative course which has lasted to our own day.But &quot;Voyage&quot; doesn't talk much about the politics of the times so much as the people who lived in those times. Above all, they were hard people.On the one hand are the working stiffs. Shanghaied into the crew of the great four-masted barques, poor brutal men who have no control over their lives, well aware how badly they are used, capable of huge tenderness and sensitivity, and immensely skilled at fighting their ships through the world's worst weather around Cape Horn. On the other hand are the great capitalists who build the ships and the railways and the banking empires, and the tough-minded captains and mates who do their work for them.All of them are strong in their way, with a kind of iron toughness that has pretty well vanished nowadays, and they fight out their story across 704 pages of great adventure and conflict.Hayden surprised people with this book. He took a stab at a huge important story filled with colorful, exciting characters in all their strengths and weaknesses. &quot;Voyage&quot; is important, and exciting, and is as close to the mythical &quot;Great American Novel&quot; as anything ever attempted."},{"Title":"Voyage, a Novel of 1896","review":"I picked this book up at my library's book sale a few years ago for $1.00 and got so engrossed in it that I'd stay awake reading until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning when I finally told myself \\"you've got to go to work tomorrow\\"!

The overall storyline is engrossing enough, if a little truncated (more on that later), and seems to be going in an epic direction. Its the relationship between the characters that really make the book, though, especially between the main two (Stamford and Darlana). You'll probably find yourself rooting for those two to get together more than anything in the book. The ending is rather abrubt and it is obvious that the writers were forced to end it earlier than they wanted to, which is a pity since you will want to know what happens next, especially between the characters. Be advised that the prologue is a bit rough to slog through and isn't indicative of what you'll find through the rest of the book - its likely that it was put there for reasons involving cut material at the end. Overall, a fun read."},{"Title":"Weapons of the Gods: The Shield of Pallas","review":"Mike and Charly's novel: first. HOORAY!!!!!!!(hip-hop) HOORAY!!!!!!!!I am very proud of them for getting their work out there and keeping it out there until it's published. Robert Heinlein said that that's what makes a writer.However, the novel has serious problems in at least three areas. Mike and I talked about them the other day, and here is my considered review.Weapons of the Gods is a series, which begins with the present novel, The Shield of Pallas. It is a novelization of the D&D; module The Keep on the Borderlands combined with a romance between Sir Stamford, the knight whom Mike played, and the barbarian warrior, Darlanna, played by Charly (which is pronounced \\"Sharlee\\", for those who don't know her). Mike and Charly dealt with a print-on-demand company who limited the page length of the novel severely, resulting in the strange cut-off plot. Therefore, some of the oddness of this novel is not their fault.The first problem is that the novel wasn't copy-edited for spelling, grammar, and syntax. This leads to awful, awful abortions of language such as \\"fowl things\\" for \\"foul things\\", \\"a couple men\\" for \\"a couple of men\\", \\"misshaped\\" for \\"misshapen\\" and \\"stogy\\" for \\"stodgy\\". In a world (ours) with Microsoft Word, there's no reason to use apostrophes for plurals and misspell a word such as \\"pristine\\". The writing also bristles with tell-rather-than-show clumsiness as well as weird failures of comprehension: a waterfall of \\"still\\" water where the knight \\"mediates\\". Huh?The second serious area of problems is in the setting. The characters' names are an obvious D&D; game mixture of Christian names, in a world without Christianity, (a problem Tolkein avoided) made-up names such as Darlanna, and names \\"translated\\" from languages that weren't worked up in the world-building: we have a Stareyed Rover together with an Eve and a Jack. How do huge monsters exist all over the place where there is no herbivore base for them to eat? What is the basis of the hobgoblin's \\"economy\\"? Where is the food coming from if there is no cultivated land around the fort? Where are the peasants that this warrior class is oppressing, or \\"protecting\\"? If they don't exist, why is the keep even there, except that it was in an old D&D; module?Why is Stamford worshipping a Greek goddess (\\"Pallas\\") with the personal piety of a Christian? In a world where Greece doesn't exist? His home society, Safehold, is an unbelieveable fantasy: a society of shapeshifters who oppress and forbid sex to anyone not born able to change shape, yet arm and train them for battle. I don't mean to be nasty, but this society would last till the first full moon, whereupon the soldiers would wipe out the shapeshifters and then live happily ever after. What is the \\"reward\\" for being an oppressed celibate? It's never stated. The celibate clergy of Earth's Middle Ages were rewarded with personal, social and political power, aiding others while being told that their refusal of sex was a blessing. Stamford moans about how he is \\"accursed\\", years after he's left this incomprehensible made-up society. There is no reward in sight, no reason to deny human nature for these people. Why even bother? And who is washing the dishes on this werewolf island?Military history is a major shortfall. Mike gives us a world in which shield walls coexist with cavalry jousting with plate mail and couched lances. This is like having an army of archers fight an army with machine guns: it could simply never happen. Mike explained to me that he meant for the setting to resemble the Norman Conquest, but it doesn't: it's 1450-era knights with 600-era shield walls. Why would a flying ship have sails? Wouldn't the wind blow it around like a balloon?The hobbits (\\"fenlings\\") are totally unbelieveable as \\"archers\\". How could a three-foot creature with arms less than two feet long pull even a 15-lb bow? Bows below 40lb are almost useless in medieval warfare, and short self bows (made of one piece of wood, that is) are toys for kids hunting birds. It was the Welsh longbow that changed the face of warfare and eliminated the mounted knight as a force on the battlefield, but these were six-to-seven-foot staves of yew wielded by tall men who drilled weekly after church.(I also hated the hobbit character Gilro; he isn't funny.)Darlanna's \\"refusal to wear armor\\" is absolutely ridiculous save as a self-insertion sexual fantasy. There is no way that this character would survive even one battle. And if she's a despised outcast, why was she trained in arms? That's just silly. The scenes in which she is \\"jousting\\" in a fur bikini betray ignorance of military history and even of how jousting (which several friends of mine do; it's the Maryland state sport) actually works.In a preindustrial society clothes are very, very expensive and dyed fabric is worn by the rich. Given the gold coins they fling around that have such a ludicrously low value, I can almost believe that the characters can afford the modern wardrobes that they wear, but they're always looking for money. What is going on here, except failure to worldbuild?The third problem is the moral failure of the novel's characters. Stamford offers bounties for the genocidal slaughter of the \\"hobgoblins\\" who surround his Keep with evil on all sides, just as the early settlers of California offered five dollars for Indian scalps and two dollars for ears. The Evil Master of Galachon's legions are \\"copper-skinned men of dubious de[s]cent with swarthy features and beady black eyes\\", while our heroes are all white; even Darlanna is auburn-haired and six feet tall despite being a \\"mongol\\". Aren't we past this, in writing? Can't we transcend Lewis' Narnia, where the good guys are all white and the wicked Calormenes are brown? Or the work of a white man born in the nineteenth century in South Africa (Tolkein) who had a Fellowship of white men fighting orcs with broad flat swart faces? It's not that the characters see non-white and non-\\"human\\" beings as worthy only of slaughter. That's been the norm for all of human history, till a couple of lifetimes ago. It's that the authors show no reflection at all on the genocide and racism that their \\"good\\" characters see as normal.Heinlein was campaigning violently against racism fifty years ago in his novels. Why can't we have at least the acknowledgement that birth in a \\"despised\\" race (other than \\"despised\\" white males who are nevertheless trained in arms) fits anyone for anything save to be nameless swordfodder? What is the point of \\"adventurers\\" other than them killing everything which the game designates as \\"evil\\" in order to get experience points?Pallas gives her followers the means to commit genocide on ugly \\"non-humans\\", and gives her warriors armor, but never sees fit to give the common people the soybean? She never gives anyone the potato? Or a better loom? Or a better plow? Or coerces her were-beast upper class into treating the human lower class any better? I confess to a problem with any world where the \\"gods\\" make War and don't see fit to give humans, say, a toilet. Or a moral code which doesn't make anyone who reads it want to vomit.Of course, we never see the peasant class anyway, so it's not as though they matter. There is the hint of a plot concerning the unity of Pallas with Pelura, but it's quickly forgotten.All in all, this novel has huge problems from beginning to end, coming largely from the authors' failure to world-build with the material that they had. It's unoriginal, poorly written and morally has serious problems. Mike and Charly need to work hard on these problems for the next novel in the series, as this detracts seriously from the readability of the work. I am hoping for better from them next time.Seven years have passed since, and the sequel is not here. I guess it was not written. I'm sorry about that.This fan novelization of *Keep on the Borderlands* was unauthorized, but well-meant."},{"Title":"Weapons of the Gods: The Shield of Pallas","review":"WEAPONS OF THE GODS by Charly Branch and Michael Brown is a tale told well. I ended up caring about the main characters and felt I got to known them. I was particularly drawn to Darlanna Lostblood, the outsider who struggles with her own doubts as well as her enemies. I also appreciated how spirituality and religion were central to the story and the characters in it. Serious thought was evident in how Darlanna encountered and grew in her journey as a warrior and a person of faith. The best thing I can say about the book is that the ending left me wanting to know what happens next to Darlanna and crew."},{"Title":"Weapons of the Gods: The Shield of Pallas","review":"Wonderfull for a first book. While the storytelling seems a bit uneven at times, as if the author duo have yet to find a common rhythm, there are moments of pure brilliance and emotional depth one would expect from a much more seasoned writer. While most fantasy novels rely on fufilling young male fantasies of swordplay and winsome damsels, this much more balanced, character driven tale will win fans with it's rich epic landscape and timeless story of forbidden love.While the pitfalls awaiting first-time authors may have trapped Brown and Bench in places, the potential of this duo is obvious as is the potential of the dynamic universe they've created. I hope to see the next volume soon. Check it out. This one won't win awards, it is definatly a sign of great things to come."},{"Title":"Software","review":"All Hail Happy Cloak!

After all, God made man in His image, why can't man make robots in thier image"},{"Title":"Software","review":"This is Rucker's short, whacky cyberpunk take. The protagonist is an aging genius, more interested in the beach and booze these days than anything else.Robots basically now run the joint, and the bigger robots want to take over all the little robots. Get the picture? The little robots aren't a fan of this, and a metal acquaintance of our drunk dude offers to digitise him."},{"Title":"Software","review":"Florida has been donated to aging hippies. In this pension, Cobb Anderson knows he has only two years until his heart comes to an end. His pockets are empty: he can't afford new artificial heart to replace his failing, secondhand one. Time for few drinks. And few more. Cobb remembers when he was responsible for creating self-aware robots on the moon. A great achievement until the robot Ralph Numbers led an independence movement. Good old days. \\"what would you think if you could get immortality\\", whispers a man -- man with his face?This is a story about how robots are fighting for their rights after liberating their Asimovian programming and take over the world: assimilate all human minds into ONE. Humans couldn't develop full self-concious robots, so Cobb included selection and mutation to make the robots evolve. They were designed to build copies of themselves, but they had to fight over parts. Natural selection and cosmic rays to jigger their programs. And Cobb, the designer, is okay if his brains are dried out to become software in artificial body. But what happens when his conscious is stored elsewhere: Is Me a real Me? The sequel isWetware(1988).One (1) star. Written in 1982 this book won P. K. Dick Award by Philadelphia Science Fiction Society in the same year. Overall an admirable effort to open the cyberpunk genre at the time; before Willian Gibson's famousNeuromancer(1984). Unfortunately the story hasn't aged well. The technology aspects are outdated, the drug junkie hero is a mess, the brain eating gang is more hilarious than horrific, and dialogue is abrupt, quirky and not surrealistic enough to be humorous. A dusted cyberpunk read."},{"Title":"Software","review":"Revolted robots, okay. Old hippies have taken over Florida, great. A government that's given Florida to said old hippies, still pretty funny. An old boozer genius, still good. Sta Hi, what a hoot. Immortality and nosy cops too, fabulous. Mix all of these elements together and all this promise gets tangled up in the cords and falls flat.

It was readable but nothing like you would expect something that has been labeled cyberpunk to be. It is nothing like brunner or Gibson's work. I think this is little more than a text-based D.C. comic. It has interesting concepts but nothing to write home about.Go read or re-read a William Gibson book instead."},{"Title":"Software","review":"I blew through this book for two reasons:1. It was short2. It was addictiveThis book is an interesting mix of &quot;modern&quot; cyberpunk type writing and content with older Heinlein style creativity. It has some of the hard edge of cyberpunk but I couldn't help feel that I was reading an updated &quot;boy's adventure&quot; style sci-fi story where we are taken on a ride and shown wondrous things without much background explanation.I'm looking forward to reading some of the other books by this author but I'm hoping for more content since it definitely needs an increase in density."},{"Title":"Software","review":"I don't want to scare anyone off, but this book changed the way I look at life. Hidden amidst the funky robots, improbable drugs and far-out 21st Century slang is a fascinating argument for the actual, real-life existence of immortality. The closest writer I can think of to Rucker is Philip K. Dick--his vision of the future is decidedly goofy, but the ideas--both philosophic and scientific, in regards to artificial intelligence--can be taken seriously. If you want to, you're under no obligation. Highly recommended either way."},{"Title":"Software","review":"Rudy Rucker's novel, Software, was published in 1982, two years before the novel that would become the flagship of Cyberpunk Science Fiction, Neuromancer, was published. However, Software is considered to be one of the novels that is part of the Cyberpunk canon. Its narrative shows the scientific and philosopical education of the author (Wikipedia informs that Rudy Rucker is the grand-grandson of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel). Briefly put, it is a story about robots that acquire conscience and autonomy, and under the pretext of showing gratitude to their creator they promise to make him inmortal. The said creator, Cobb Anderson, is an aging hippie secluded in a sort of \\"reservation\\" the government has set up for aging and non conformist population. He accepts the offer without asking for explanation about how the robots pretend to do that. In the end it turns out that the \\"mechanic children of men\\" want to fulfill the evolution dream....! I will not give further details in order not to spoil the pleasure of the potential readers. Well, the novel is well written, with some spots of surrealist writing, and compared to Gibson's Neuromancer, it is a much more softer read than Neuromancer, that for me, in spite of its high literary status within the science fiction genre,turned out to be a very hard to read novel. At times I did not know if I was reading a film script draft, or a William Burroughs non-linear narrative. I certainly did not find that lack of continuity in Software, which flowed easily through its different passages and philosophical ruminations. Software might not have as high an status as Neuromancer, but you will not be dissapointed by it. No wonder it was the first novel granted with the Philip K. Dick Award in 1983, an award Gibson's Neuromancer would get two years later."},{"Title":"Software","review":"Forget Gibson. Forget all the other cyberpunk.

With all the books out there, and only so much time to live, I am -sure- there are better to choose from."},{"Title":"Software","review":"I'd never heard of Rudy Rucker until I found (tattered, on the sidewalk, by complete chance!) a volume with a short story of his in it. The story blew me away--it was so juvenile and refreshing and irreverent and yet dealt with some pretty serious and interesting higher brow concepts. I immediately ordered a copy of Software and was not disappointed. Software is playful and serious at the same time and a great starting point for anyone interested in reading Rucker's fiction. He reminds of some Stanislaw Lem or Philip Dick (yeah, I know everyone says that). I could not put this book down and devoured the sequels just as quickly. I recommend Rucker to everyone I know that has a smidgeon of good taste."},{"Title":"Software","review":"Maybe the rave reviews I heard made me expect too much, but the actual book was kind of a let-down. It just didn't, I don't know, _romp_. Very cool concepts, well executed, but seemed kind of pointless in the end.

The book provides a good overview of deer hunting strategy and tactics, and excellent information about Mule Deer behavior and habitat. Prothero's discussion of hunting tactics, particularly tracking, are also right on the mark, but the reading gets a bit tiresome as the author provides many examples that always seem to end with a huge running buck being brought down by a heroic shot. If you can handle the chest thumping, it's a good read."},{"Title":"Stalking Trophy Mule Deer","review":"This was a very informative book.

This is not just a book for the avid sailor. I have never been on a sailboat or even had the vaguest desire to do so, but I enjoyed this book because of its descriptions of Hawaii and I am still pondering the fact that geologists claim that the entire Sierra Nevada range could fit in the crater of the volcano Mauna Loa. Steve Dixon incorporates his sailing experiences with his own life experiences and also the history and culture of the islands. I read this book straight through at one sitting and then began to reread several passages that had intrigued me. I can't even imagine what a thrill it must be for someone who understands the intricacies of sailing to read a book like this one."},{"Title":"The Hawaiian Voyages of the Ono Jimmy (Vol 1)","review":"Don't be put off by the heavy self-promotion (you do what you got to do to survive both at sea and in the realm of publishing...) If you plan on cruising the Hawaiian islands there is much to learn from this book; in fact I would urge the first-time Hawaiian sailor to read this book as you go or before you leave. (We keep a copy on our Hawaii-based sailboat.) If you like a little human interest with your facts and helpful hints, this book has plenty of it. Dixon tells tales on himself and humbly admits when he screws up, which makes the book not only valuable but endearing. There is a little soul-searching done too, but that is one reason we go to sea, is it not? To discover who we are (and why the hell we are doing this!) Without a little humanity, self-effacing humour, and cockpit philosophy, one sea story is much like the next. If you don't like reading a little autobiography with your sailing books, skip this and get a how-to book. But if you want a sampling of one man's invaluable experiences and a taste of real life sailing -- philosophy and all -- by all means get this book."},{"Title":"The Hawaiian Voyages of the Ono Jimmy (Vol 1)","review":"This book has it all adventure, romance, history and of course it is very informative for any one wanting to sail the Hawaiian Islands.

Ordinarily it is not one I would have chosen. As it turns out, this favor to a friend ended up with my total absorption in the novel. I was riveted by the intensity of the emotion of Sara, her frustration as she sought her firstborn, her tension as she waited for that fateful call, her joy as she found at last her long lost daughter, her anger at herself and the birthfather for the decision she made so long ago.Sara is simply a survivor. She is one of those strong, intelligent women who would, in another time, have been a pioneer woman struggling across the long Oregon Trail to California, never for a moment doubting that she would finally succeed in her quest. This is a book written by such a woman, for such women, but one that should be read by every man who has ever loved such a woman.Bill Pugh"},{"Title":"All the missing pieces","review":"All the Missing Pieces\\" is the story of Sara, a young woman who falls pregnant to her lover, but decides that marriage under these circumstances is impossible. She leaves her boyfriend, family and familiar surroundings to move to a strange city, where she has her baby and gives it up for adoption.I follow Sara as she courageously exposes her thoughts and feelings of this great personal loss, both from her perspective as a young girl, and in present time. She has been married and divorced, had 3 fine sons, which she raised alone after her marriage ended, and has now married again. Sara has also searched for and found her first born daughter.The excitement mounts as the reunion approaches. Other issues arise. Sara has also found the address and phone number of her first love, her daughter's father. The dynamics of all the complications of relationships and feelings these events uncover in Sara's life, and that of the other people involved, weave a rich, enthralling tapestry.Alexandra Daye manages to make me feel as if I am walking beside her through her personal adventure. Even though at times, she moves through disquietening scenarios that threaten her marriage and equilibrium, her honesty, as she charts her emotions, is impressive and insightful.As a birthmother, I found \\"All the Missing Pieces\\" to be very relevant to the problems arising from the relinquishment of a child to adoption. The reunion of mother and child, the coming together of not always compatible people, linked only by the child conceived and then adopted out, and the subsequent roller coaster of emotions and twists of fate that accompany such complicated human relationships, are all well represented in this gem of a book.Sincerely, Lina Eve, (Civil Marriage Celebrant, Adoption Counsellor and Birthmother)"},{"Title":"Perilous Guard","review":"&quot;The Perilous Guard&quot; by Elizabeth Marie Pope was a thrilling read that i could not put down from the moment i picked it up.This book combines wonderfully the traights of historical fiction, a romance, mystery, and of course, magic.The story is about unremakable Kate sutton who is banshed by Queen Mary Tudor to the dismal castle Perilous Guard. There Kate must uncover the dreadful secret that haunts the castle and its woods, while finding the power within her to outsmart the cold hearted Queen of the fairies and save the man she loves from commiting the ultimate sacrifice, to right the wrong he commited years ago...The characthers in the book are well developed and you feel something for each of them from the witty and brave Kate, to the dark and troubled Christopher.

The dialogue between the main characters was especially well crafted, and in the end, I sat in my driveway refusing to go inside until the very end of the story. \\"The Perilous Guard\\" is a story about the Faery Folk of England and takes place during the reigns of Queens Mary and Elizabeth. The historic aspect made it fun, and the portrayal of the Faery Folk was interesting. I'm giving this book to my mom for Mother's Day, confident she'll love it.

I find the hero and his brother both fascinating.Randall was very endearing as the bard, I wanted to put my arms around him and tell what a good job he did. The last scene with the fairy queen was wonderful, her attempt to have revenge in such a subtle way was superb!And when she knelt to Kate in the queen's salute I felt like crying too!

The trek to the remote North England resort is not fun, but Bill expects a luxurious relaxing few days spent with his daughter. However, director David Morland wants to hire Billy to quietly investigate the recent poisoning of employees. Billy says no wanting to just R&amp;R with Kirsty and not impact his work waiting for his return home.A nasty storm strands the occupants of Forestcrag. When the corpse of payroll manager Eric Salkeld is found hanging, Billy calls the local police, who cannot easily get to the death scene. Though it appears a simple suicide, the locals ask Billy as a former cop to conduct a preliminary investigation and to contain the scene until they arrive. He also receives a warning from the police that someone he once arrested has escaped and is in the area. Meanwhile Billy notices marks on the body making him conclude the so-called suicide is a cover up of a murder.Fans of suspense laden investigation thrillers will feel they gained much PAYBACK from Alan Dunn's novel that reads somewhat like a police procedural once the first of several murders occur. The story line is very exciting so much so that the well-written climax seems weak by comparison. Still, Billy is a delightful lead character and those close to him accentuate the audience's ability to understand the hero's preference of non-involvement. When all is said and done, readers will appreciate PAYBACK and look for more novels from this British author.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Careers in Health Care","review":"Not a lot of detail, but a good first step to help you focus on what you may want to look at in more depth."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"Exciting.

These are a few of the dreams that I will long remember from Bova's book. Yes, I will read more of Mr. Bova's books. Thanks, Ben."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"I'll mention here that I'm attempting to read all 17 of \\"The Grand Tour\\" series books in the chronological order the author has suggested. Moonrise is the 4th book in the series, taking place (chronologically) just before the book \\"Mars.\\"There are parts of Moonrise that warrant four or possibly five stars. There are some good suspense scenes; the \\"wow\\" factor of a race against Yamagata Corporation to claim vital territory on moon during the effects of a solar flare, a race through Moonbase to stop a madman from killing everyone with great action and suspense, Paul Stravenger's frantic attempt to outrun the effects of killer nano-machines. Unfortunatly, a lot of this is undone by flaws, many of them typical of Ben Bova.Moonrise is presented in three sections, with about twenty years separating the first two. In section one, we meet Dan Randolph...I mean Paul Stravenger. For those who have read earlier or later books in the series, you'll recognize Dan Randolph as the multi-millionaire, womanizing, fast talking, charismatic star of the several Bova books. Paul Stravenger is the same character (except he's Africa-American). Rich, womanizing, charismatic...Stravenger checks off all the same, fairly uninteresting boxes as many Bova protagonists. In section one, we're taken back and forth between a real-time account of Paul on the moon as he struggles to avoid an assassination attempt by his step-son Greg, who, along with Paul and Paul's wife Joanne (mother of Greg) sit on the board of directors of Masterson Aerospace. While this part of the book is more techno-thriller than anything else, it's not that thrilling because we find out that Greg is behind a series of murders (in addition to trying to kill his step-father) long before the characters find out, which leaves things in a pretty anticlimactic state.Leap forward twenty years. We meet Doug Stravenger, son of Paul and Joanne (and half brother of Greg). After many years of intense therapy Greg has recovered from the issues that led him to try and kill his step-father and despite the fact that his mother is well aware the he's murdered several people, she has continued to support him in Masterson Corp. In fact, she's recommended that he become the new director of Moonbase. Doug Stravenger has - like his father - fallen in love with the moon. Greg, on the other hand, wants to become director so he can recommend after his year long tenure that Moonbase be closed, as it is a financial drain on the corporation. We're also introduced to The New Morality, a combination of religious groups set on turning the world in to a fundamentalist's dream. Nanotechology - used to create and sustain the Moonbase - is being phased out through religious and political preassure from the New Morality...and it's here that a piece of the puzzle is missing.There's never any discussion of what caused the New Morality to begin. Halfway through the 2nd part of the book, it's just introduced as if a major religious fundamental movement that includes the worst elements of fundamentalist Christianity, Judaism and Islam is likely to just pop into existence. There's no back story, no gradual build up to the New Morality's main stream acceptance...it just shows up and suddenly has massive influence from politics to education to moral law. We're also never told why the New Morality hates nanotech so much, they just do...and boy do they!In the final section of the book, Greg and Doug butt heads over the fate of Moonbase. Greg determined to close the facility. Doug determined to keep it open. After sustaining a massive dose of radiation that required nano-therapy to fix in the second section of the book, Doug can't return to Earth thanks to a ban on nanotechnology. Despite the fact that Doug has shown how to make Moonbase profitable, Greg refuses to change his outlook. We also find out that one more person knows about Greg's previous murders - his ex-girlfriend whom he spited twenty years ago. She has managed to make her way to Moonbase to confront Greg about his past. When she does, all hell breaks loose as Greg snaps and along with his former girlfriend, attempt to vent the atmosphere in Moondbase and kill everyone.Overall, there were some good, even great sections of Moonrise. They're all held back by the flaws though. As with many Bova books, I can overlook the overt sexism (all the male characters can't help but sneak a look at the butt of every girl they pass, most of the female characters have no ability to resist the sexual advances of any character with more than a handful of wealth or power), and even some of the strange choices of the characters (which are often akin to the \\"smart people doing stupid things\\" depicted in so many modern horror movies. However, too much of the book just felt like being railroaded. Why develop a back story for why things on Earth are the way they are when you can just create the New Morality and toss it out there, Dues Ex Machina style?Not the best of \\"The Grand Tour\\" series."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"I think I have read almost every book by Bova. It is all pretty similar. If you like this kind of writing then you will probably like this book. He doesn't stray far from his formula. It is a pretty light and fast read. It is like going to see an action movie. You don't expect much depth, just to be mildly entertained for a while. The characters are not that memorable but while reading the book you do get drawn into their dramas. The plot is passable, sometimes a bit outlandish, but you accept it because you weren't expecting more. If you are looking for a light read to entertain away some time, sure, pick up a couple of Bova's books."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"The only issue I have with this book is its use of nanotech as a magic wand to solve a lot of the problems in the plot, but the book is interesting enough that I can suspend my belief and enjoy it. The part about life on moonbase is very well written, and I think it's the best part of the book."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"Controlled by Masterson Corporation, Moonbase has been set up as an advance research facility crewed by researchers and scientists. However, Paul Stavenger has greater dreams for Moonbase; he sees it as becoming its own self-sufficient community in space, totally non-dependent on anything from Earth. But, beneath this lofty goal, trouble has been brewing. Paul has been having an affair with Joanna Masterson, who happens to be the wife of Greg Masterson II, the head of Masterson Corporation. To make matters worse, Greg II is found dead, the victim of an apparent suicide; or is it? Now, it appeared that Joanna's son, Greg III, would be in prime position to take over as head of the corporation. However, Joanna manages to shock everyone on the Board of Directors by nominating Paul, her new husband, to become the new CEO. Paul is elected, and Greg III is left shocked. But. Greg III intends to shut down Moonbase, no matter who or what gets in his way.Soon, Joanna discovers that she is pregnant with Paul's son, but much worse things are about to happen. Nanotechnology is used on the moon for a variety of reasons. Paul has gone to the moon to study the uses of nanotechnology, but Greg has gotten wind of Paul's plans. He has inserted \\"gobblers\\"; visciuos nanobugs, into the batch of nanomachines Paul is working with. These Gobblers somehow managed to work themselves into Paul's suit and destroy it. Paul and two other workers are killed by the gobblers.Fast-forward 18 years. Doug Stavenger, now a young man, has become interested in keeping his father's dream of transforming Moonbase into its own community. Meanwhile, Greg III has spent years in therapy trying to come to terms with what he did to Paul. Joanna, now CEO of Masterson, has decided that Greg will take over as Moonbase director. But, this decision proves to be fatal as events play out over the rest of the story. Will Doug and Greg be able to co-exist, or will their simmering lack of trust threaten to boil over?I thought this was a very good book. I thought the character development was good, especially Paul and Greg III. However, I did feel that some of the characters were more shallow than some of the others. I did enjoy the action that took place at Moonbase more than that of what occurred on Earth. I made the mistake of reading \\"Moonwar\\", the sequel to \\"Moonrise\\", first so I kind of knew beforehand how this book would end. Nevertheless, I did enjoy reading this book.I recommend \\"Moonrise\\" very highly. Although I feel that this is not Ben Bova's best work, it is till worth reading. Highly recommended for science fiction fans."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"This book was excellent, I couldn't put it down. I'm in the middle of reading the sequel, which I am thus far unable to put down as well. I was amazed at the end of this book and found myself disappointed that I'd finished it, because that meant I wasn't reading it anymore. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was I thought the characterization could be a little better. I tried really hard to like Paul Stavenger, I really did, but I just didn't find his character to be all that sympathetic. I liked him just fine until he cheated on his wife with Melissa and it all went downhill from there. Doug was more sympathetic than Paul, but he really had the opposite problem. Paul was at least real to me, even if I didnt like his personal life. Doug is a great guy and all, but jeez, give this guy some flaws already! No one is THAT perfect. But despite the character issues, it was still a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"Moonrise is a great read in spite of the predictability. Ben Bova is very good at drawing the reader into the story. I wish that \\"Nanobugs\\" did exist. They would revolutionize the world. Paul and Doug show great courage in this story ... they have inspired me to take more risks. Here is my favorite quote from this book: \\"I'd rather wear out than rust out.\\" -- Thus far my favorite SciFi book is still \\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"This is a must read if you prefer hard science fiction - that is to say - believeable science fiction. No super plasma guns here, just great visualization of where present technological developments might lead if we have the foresight to pursue them.

A good read - and you'll learn a thing or two also. Highly recommeded."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"Ben Bova hits another homerun for Science Fantasy readers. His grand epic, Moonrise, would do James A. proud in the finely-detailed characterizations of the protagonist as well as the ancillary figures. The book was such a riveting read that I devoured it in two sittings; you really can't put it down! Although I had previously read works by Bova, they had all been of the non-fiction genre . . . all of which were as cleanly written and engaging. I'm looking forward to jumping into the sequel, Moonwar. Do yourself a favor, read Bova's MARS epic as well!"},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"\\"Moonrise\\" is my first Ben Bova book and I have to say I will be looking for more of his work. His descriptions of life building an outpost on the moon I believe are quite accurate to what the real explorers may one day encounter. Their attempts to live off the land by extracting materials from the regolith (lunar soil) is how I envision colonization will eventually be done. The only real plot point requiring any substantial \\"suspension of disbelief\\" is in the development of virus-sized nanomachines to build things atom by atom."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"I read both of the 'Moon' books sequentially and was thoroughly entertained. I believe that religious fundamentalism will be a major threat into the millenium, and the portrayal of the New Morality et al was chillingly real."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"I shall write of both \\"Moonrise\\" and \\"Moonwar.\\"These are the stories of Moonbase, a permanent lunar settlement built by an American corporation in the mid-21st century. These tales chronicle the political and societal tension wrought by unpopular scientific endeavors, and the unforeseen consequences thereof. The books portray a future wherein a new fascism creeps across the entire globe, embraced by a superstitious public, and at dire odds with the free-thinking scientists living on the Moon--men and women who journeyed there to escape the shackles of Earthside ignorance and fear. You will find intrigue, betrayal, villainy, sexual bartering, rugged individualism, and even love within these books' pages.But Ben Bova's vocabulary is disappointing. His dialog is often uninspired and even predictable. His narrative, his pacing, his exposition, his character development, and even his plot development are all very Saturday matinee. Even worse, his understanding of relationships is shallow.But what gets these books off the ground and keeps the reader till their last pages is Ben Bova's love of space exploration. The man fervently believes that space exploration will benefit all of mankind, and not just the bureaucrats or big business. When Ben Bova describes an exclusively astronomical scene, his passion is undeniable. In the first book, there's a scene wherein an 18-year-old walks upon the lunar surface for the first time, and it borders on epiphanous. Ben Bova brings the Moon's unique beauty into sharp focus; sometimes, you can actually feel the regolith beneath your boots. It's this passion, I believe, that makes these books worth reading--in spite of their shortfalls."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"I was expecting great things from my first Ben Bova novel, but I'm afraid the dialog is too corny for me! I'm used to reading Dan Simmons and Ian M. Banks, and I guess I was expecting a little more flair... the plot and ideas are good, but it just didn't cut the mustard for me as a novel. I just didn't find myself believing the characters were for real... as one reviewer put it - made-for-TV. On the plus side, there are quite a few tense moments that are well-crafted. But not enough to sustain the momentum for such a long book... in the end I didn't really care what happened to the characters. In summary: look elsewhere for deep characters and thought-provoking prose..."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"I read this book because I really liked the premise of it. It would be great to put the idea of a moon base back into the mind of the general public. Unforunately, this book really does read like a TV-movie. I didn't have much sympathy for any of the characters and the villians were cardboard cut-outs as well. I won't be wasting my time with the sequel."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"After reading Icehenge and Moving Mars, Bova's characters are paper thin and unbelievable. The plot pace jerks along from one implausible situation to the next. This book and the sequel, Moonwar are a great disappointment to those of us who like 'realism' in their science fiction."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"I was in a mood for some \\"hard\\" science fiction when I was in the bookstore the other day. Remembering how much I liked Ben Bova's stuff in the past, I started looking through his newer stuff and settled on \\"Moonrise.\\" Moon colonies and nanotechnology! What could be better?Unfortunately, Bova manages to suffocate every ounce of suspense and mystery from these potentially thrilling topics with stilted dialog, boring board-room politics, contrived behaviors, and repetitive narrative.- The first third of the book switches back and forth between the moon and earth without any obvious literary purpose, and I found this to be terribly annoying and even tedious.- You know very soon that Greg is a murderer, so nothing he does is surprising. The only shocking aspect is how everyone lets him get away with it. For example,- Joanna is supposed to be a savvy and disciplined corporate woman who is strong enough to edge her unbalanced son Greg out of the top position at the family aerospace corporation -- but not strong enough to do anything about the seven or eight people he's admitted killing by page 150. Then she practically lets Greg babysit her younger son Doug (the \\"good\\" one). You know, the one about whom Greg said, \\"Abort it!\\" and \\"Get rid of that monster you're carrying in your belly!\\" and so on. Joanna is not a \\"complex\\" characterization, just mind-numbingly random.- Booze and sex are sprinkled throughout awkwardly as if some editor said, \\"make this PG-13.\\" All female characters are described primarilly by how attractive they are to men. The liquor \\"still\\" on the moon is referred to in the same cut-and-paste way every time.- What I *was* looking for -- the \\"geek porn\\" of in-depth discussion of nanotechnology and the science of making a moon base -- was there in only the most stingy quantities, like chocolate syrup on a Weight Watcher's cookie.- The whole anti-nanomachine movement is presented like the characters in the book: mono-dimensionally, with precious little explanation or discussion of their rationale. They oppose the technology because, well, they're ignorant luddites, what do you expect they would do? This isn't really thought-provoking at all, just shallow politician-bashing and religion -baiting.Some reviewers found this book hard to put down. I found it hard to continue to the end."},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"100 years ago,we couldn't even fly.50 years ago,any satellite or computer was pure science fiction.

Both end up fighting over the future of the family corporation: to save the moonbase, or destroy it. It's a pat set-up, and entirely unconvincing, but once you get to the action on the moon, the story gets as good as it gets. Saving yourself from a solar flare where there's hardly any protection -- a cliched space scene, but well done in this case.This book should have been categorized under juvenile fiction. Bova seemed to have an idea about what action he wanted to have happen, and he forced the characters to make stupid and unlikely decisions, just so he could make the action happen. Once you get over the idea that the characters should be believable, it's an action-packed book, perfect for a made-for-tv movie.But if you want sympathetic characters, get another book. I wish I'd bought it at Amazon, instead of paying full price at my local store.

The plot thickens with each chapter and it's hard to guess which direction he'll lead you. The science in this book is not far from becoming reality as humanity's knowledge ever increases.

I have seen Bova tackle many levels of science fiction from near possibility to distant future. Even some are a bit of a flight of fancy such as his Orion Saga. One element remains constant throughout all his books: they are all base on hard core science theory...theory that may soon be reality. Of all his books, I've noticed a re-occurance of a couple of themes that this particular book refines and improves upon. Foremost is Bova's love for writing about Moonbase. This place has been a centerpiece for many of his works. Secondly is the field of nanotech. The first series I remember him introducing this in was the Voyager series. This particular topic has recieved the most improvement out of them all. This book above all others adequately describes what is more than likely to be feasible applications of nanotech. Furthermore, this book also discusses the dangers the world faces should the ultra conservative Luddites gain control. In conlusion, this book deserves no less than 5 stars because Bova once again ties together elements of science and philosophy and wirtes them together in a believeable plot that works on many levels"},{"Title":"Moonrise","review":"In Moonrise, Ben Bova writes a good story of what could be on the Moon in the future. While it is somewhat predictable, it's still a good story.Masterson Corperation is working on exploring and mining the Lunar surface for solar power and other minerals, and it is the dream of Paul Stavenger, retired astronout and designer of one of the compainies most profitable products, the Clippership which makes travel around the world possible in less than an hour by ships which work above the atmosphere in low orbit.The company is in turmoil as Gregory Masterson the second dies sudenly and under questionable circumstances, and Gregory Masterson the third expects to take his place as President of the company. However, the wife of the late president nominates Paul Stavenger, her lover and fiance to the position, setting forces in motion which could tear the company apart as Gregory the second rages and plots to regain his rightfull place.The trials and triumpsh of Moonbase, and of Nanotechnology are closly linked. Nanotechnology is opposed by an extremist religious movement which organises protests and terrorism against any who use it, Moonbase becomes the last place where it is safe to use nanites. However, even this is in danger.Joanna Masterson/Stavenger must walk a tightrope between her son, and doing what is best for him, and her new husband, and protecting him, and later her second son, Doug Stavenger, son of Paul, from the plots of her criminally insane elder son.

I would recomend it to anybody who is intrested in history or loves graphic novels."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Joe Sacco lived in Palestine for 2 months, living and conversing with Palestinians about the horrors of Israeli occupation. He shows visually what Human Rights reports can only give in statistics: the shame and inhumanity of arbitrary checkpoints, the immense grief of losing a son or daughter to blatant Israelis aggression and Chauvinism, the deadening effect of a life fully controlled by a racist occupying force in one's own country, and the stoic resolve with which innocent Palestinians (women, children, men) are tortured by Israeli Shin Bet.Israeli apologists and closet bigots will ironically (and predictably) call this book \\"propaganda\\" and \\"lies\\". Unfortunately for them, truth does not conform to the subjective imaginings of a flawed and hypocritical ideology. Zionism is founded on the exploitation and suffering of the Palestinians, and no amount of prevarication, sophistry, and lies can change this fact.Sacco's artwork is unique and eye-catching, meticulous and quirky. The images are worth the price alone. A must-read."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"I read this book a few weeks before going and seeing the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories for myself.

It will inspire you to go and see the situation there for what it is.Since pro-Israel reviewers are concerned about one-sidedness (funny how they always are when we start telling the truth!)I want to say that his portrayals of Israelis and their fears are also quite accurate.I say, read this book and go for yourself.

I know very little about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, so I'm doing as much research and reading-up as I can before my trip. I was so excited to read Sacco's comic -- and ended up disappointed. If you're expecting this comic to feature historical/political commentary, forget about it. Sacco just shows brutality after brutality...which was important for me to see, but ...after a while I got the point. Even Sacco gets bored of sitting in another room drinking overly-sweetened tea hearing Palestinian men tell \\"tales of woe\\" (pretty sure those are his words). So why does this comic go on and on? Because Sacco just wanted to write a comic. Which leads me to my next point...The most bothersome part of this comic is Joe Sacco, the cartoon version if not the man himself. He is Disgustingly, Nauseatingly Arrogant.Example: \\"I eat like a king in refugee camps, they pull out all the stops, I blow kisses in the direction of the invisible womenfolk.\\"Example 2: \\"Another authentic refugee camp experience...good for the comic, maybe a splash page.\\"Example 3: \\"I love the now-and-then intimacies with fellow passengers...the shared anecdotes about prisons and beatings.\\"Seriously? Does Sacco realize that these stories are more than fodder for his comic? These are people's lives, and they continue long after the conversations and interviews end. If this is all meant to come off as ironic...as a commentary on the insensitive nature of journalism perhaps?...it is poorly, poorly executed.On the upside, Sacco is innovative with his arrangement and use of narrative text boxes, and he has a great sense of rhythm. He does things with the comic form that I have not seen other comic artists do -- but that's the extent of my praise."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"The potent combination of text and the \\"graphic parts\\" in this novel give us a total picture of the specific story Sacco is trying to tell us: that the Israeli occupation causes immense Palestinian suffering. History books use pictures, text, and captions as well, but their function is to teach us about an era, event, or personality in history, often with some lean or perspective but, in the case of any self-respecting work of nonfiction, there is a decided lack of judgmental bias on the outer sides of the quotation marks. Palestine demonstrates the shortcomings of the graphic novel when scrutinized as a historical text.Palestine talks about the suffering of a people in the current day and age. What it does not give us, however, is an overall picture, lacking sound references on the origins of the Palestinian nation, the history of their plight, and the overall factors that actually affect their lives.Instead, Sacco chooses to convey to us what he sees as the Palestinian experience: the day to day life of a resident in Ramallah, Israeli soldiers on patrol, imprisonment and interrogation of the innocent.Palestine gives us no dialogue towards the complicated and ongoing debate on such issues, serving only as an incendiary text in its coarseness and deliberate lack of context. He utterly fails on the count of objectivity, showing himself as a biased narrator through and through.The fact that his caricaturized pictures try to \\"speak for themselves\\" demonstrate this book's existence as an antithesis to history books, which give sources and include true variation in the aspects and contributing factors of the situations they describe.This book also exists as an antithesis to what journalists do. Journalists seek to inform, to enlighten and empower their audiences with the information they have obtained that sheds light on an issue. Sacco, in his inclusion of pictures and personal (as well as gripping) stories, but no true historical or sourced context, utterly fails at this task. He leaves us full of grief and empathy but only a false sense, if at all, of understanding. The exclusion of such trivia is the gift of the comic and the graphic novel to propagandists everywhere.What Sacco does include, however, is random inserts of what he considers to be \\"historical context\\"-- for example, a quote by Golda Meir that he interprets-without-bothering-to-interpret as racist, a list of casualties in Hebron over the course of twenty years that fails to specify which were civilians and which were militants-- scream either bias after his own extensive research, or (as I strongly suspect) his already biased sources of information.Because of the nature of the graphic novel, and in contrast to a historical, objective text, Sacco is not required to provide references to the sources for his information, nor is he required to fill in the gaps between his leaps of logic, as he knows his reader is less likely to question what he sees.But why is a reader less likely to question what he sees? Why is a reader so ready to assume that Sacco knows that an Israeli leader had such audacity and spite as to dehumanize an entire nation of people, with just one sentence? Why, as the \\"R\\" word is uttered by the mouth of one of his interviewees, do we swallow the idea that a curfew in a refugee camp can be accurately described by the international community, by us, as \\"a racist curfew?\\"I would argue that it is not only the pictorial or essentially biased nature of the graphic novel that helps us quiet our inner skeptic, but the intellectual attitude one takes as he or she reads one of these texts. Comics (or even \\"commix\\") are still not widely accepted in the intellectual, academic world, and we don't take this medium seriously as a source of information the way we would view BBC or the New York Times. Palestine is neither subject to public scrutiny nor a reader's dissection the way would be a book by Pat Buchanan, Michael Moore, or Noam Chomsky. Yet we are affected by this text nonetheless.A history book, it is true, may contain biased statements about what it considers to be true evil. However, rarely will it fail to give you a total perspective on the alleged victims, including the enumeration of all those who were responsible for the suffering that took place. Mr. Sacco, let's give some credit to the Palestinian leaders, the Palestinian organizations, the entire \\"pre-occupationally\\" anti-Jewish Arab/Islamic Middle East, for the tragedy which you say is the everyday suffering of the Palestinian people. Can the tragedy of it be told in black and white with glaring omissions, if a text's readers may choose to forgo such trivialities? Maybe so. After all, it's just a comic book."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"In a few cartoon pages he describes the most complex human issue in the world"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This is a bleak, sober and dramatic graphic novel that presents the life and outlook of the current Palestinian people. I am not a particular fan of this form of literature, so I am less sure as to how to accept the book's style. This is not a book for a quick read unless one is fairly unemotional. The author is seeking to extract a strong reaction and he is hardly subtle about it.Those who strongly favor the Israeli views will stay away from this book. Those who have a pro-Palestinian position will readily purchase it. My concern is for those of us who can sympathize with both views of the non-militant factions.The author/illustrator's presentation is too depressing and heavy handed. I am not arguing with his facts, although, his work is apparently based on less than a 60 day visit to the Palestine area. I think that his presentation would have benefited from a more extensive stay that could have allowed for more reflection. The book is like a movie with the hero facing death every five minutes. It doesn't allow the audience to relax and independently develop opinions.According to what I recall about social science research in persuasion, heavy handed messages tend to be dismissed by the neutral listener. That is my problem with the book. I think the message is very important, and the author well intended, but who will he persuade that is not already in agreement with him?Contrast the book's style with ,for example, the movie \\"Schindler's List,\\" since I think that a graphic novel is more like a film than literature. The film, \\"Schindler\\", subject matter was certainly as grave a topic as ever known. The movie was emotional, but it respected the audience's ability to think and not dictate what the presenter wants them to know. This is precisely where \\"Palestine\\" fails. It is emotional, but ultimately will reach only the choir. I should also mention that this is not a book for children except mature, older teens."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Joe Sacco is no doubt a talented illustrator, and based on Palestine he proves himself to be an adequate but one-sided journalist. A lot of the publicity for this book came from the fact that someone had shed light on a topic rarely covered in the US, and had a also done it in a creative fashion.Yet after reading the book, it seemed strangely pointless. If Sacco wanted to show the plight of the Palestinians, he did not do a good job of reporting. Were this not in comic book form, no one would have picked up the book. There is nothing really new in this book, just a new presentation. Also, Sacco casts himself as an unedacated American interested in learning more about Palestine, but his agenda is clear. The Palestinians are portrayed positively while the Jews are made out to be rich and arrogant. Certainly there is some truth in what he reports and there are human rights abuses, but they are much more nuanced in real life than they are in this book.The illustrations are good, but as mentioned, they serve more as a gimmick than anything else. I don't think that Sacco takes advantage of the format, and mostly uses it to show irate Isreali soldiers and crying, miserable Palestinians. He is able to capture his own feelings, but I was still left wondering what he really was personally struggling with.I have no clue what Sacco's goal was when he wrote this book. Did he want to report on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? He does, but subjectively and unoriginally. Did he want to show his own anxieties? He does this sporadically. He straddles the fence, leaving the book as a poor journalistic account and a half-baked examination of Sacco's own feeling. Would someone really write a book dealing with the history of the Israeli crisis while inserting their own thoughts about how, during an interview, they had to pee really badly?Sure the drawings are good, but I never really understood why this book had to be done in comic book. The drawings, while quite skilled, amount to a diversion from the fact that Sacco really doesn't have a good book at all."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"If you seek to understand the Middle East, this is one you MUST read.

Seldom do we, anymore, find courageous and humane people who try to deliver a message on behalf of the victims.Watching the nightly news in the USA, you think that the Palestinians are the ones with Fighter Jets and Tanks, and the Israelis are the victims. Never before had a truth been so twisted to where the victim apperas to be the victimizer. If it isn't for Joe, I would've never known that Palestine/Gaza are so underdeveloped, compared to the Tel-Avivs and other Israeli cities, in part thanks to our US Dollars . Who tell us anymore how many dollar$$ are given to Israel every day by the US?!It is ironic, the same money that isn't available to keep school teachers in Michigan and Los Angeles, is being sent to help Israel pay for their fighter jets and IDF forces to kill the civilans in Palestine/Gaza.!Joe gave an insight to a problem that is shoved under the rocks. If we, the American Public, knew what is happening in Palestine, I am positive we will try to help the Palestinians. Sacco's work is one step in that direction.Thanks a million Joe for the great artistic education"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Bravo Joe Sacco. This book is one of the very very rare instances in which the Palestinian side of the story is told. Unfortunately a drop in the ocean as compared to the 50+ years of Israeli propaganda and revisionist history (not to mention its on going brutal & illegal occupation). If this changes the opinion of a hand full of people, Joe can raise his head high. It is fairly unique piece of work."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This book collects all nine issues of a comic book series written and drawn by Sacco after he spent two months in the Occupied Territories in the winter of 1991 - 92.This is an important book. It gives a view of the Palestinian situation that we do not often see in the U.S. Any ambivalence I feel about this work must be put down to the ambivalence I feel about the political situation, where both sides are right and both sides are wrong, both have justice on their side and both act and feel unjustly towards the other. One would like to have hope, but it is difficult.What is it like to lose your land, to have your home bulldozed, your olive trees uprooted, your livelihood taken away, your children killed? Can we even imagine?Sacco does not pretend to have a solution, and, although the book focuses on the Palestinian point of view, he is clear-eyed enough to distrust easy sloganeering.I was struck by a number of parallels to the United States. For example, there is a section where Sacco meets members of the Palestinian Federation of Women's Action Committees. In the course of that discussion, one woman says, \\"If we get a state, do we retreat back to the way things were, or do we change things? Will economic development be considered priority and women's issues left behind?\\" The whole question of where the women's movement fits into a movement for radical social change is one that all social revolutions have faced.The organizations within the refugee camps, teaching children, making sure food is equitably shared, reminded me of the Black Panther Party's free breakfast programs and other social programs. The behavior of the Israeli soldiers reminded me in many ways of the behavior of police in this country in the ghettos. \\"I'm numbed by so many accounts of incarceration that the sort of thing that raises my brow is a male in his mid-20's who hasn't been arrested . . .\\" I could not read that without thinking of the number of black men in this country who are under the control of our criminal \\"justice\\" system.You will, perhaps, when you read about \\"moderate pressure\\" be reminded of the current scandal of Abu Ghraib, and understand why it is not credible that it was not policy.A difficult, but necessary, book."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Joe Sacco travelled through the West Bank and Gaza, seeking the day-to-day details of life under the occupation, then faithfully rendering them in this impressive graphic novel. He writes in the venerable tradition of Art Speigelman's Maus series, creating a work of art as well as journalism.I don't think that Sacco is trying for \\"objectivity\\" in the Israeli-Palestinian debacle. As he admits, he sees Israelis in the book, but primarily through the eyes of Palestinians-- the Israelis become solely settlers and soldiers. I was reminded of the recent film \\"Paradise Now,\\" which also does not strive to be objective about the situation, but captures the feeling of life in occupied Palestine extremely well.The truth is that we generally see the Israeli perspective in the U.S., as we are more aligned in interest. As Chomsky says, we see the constant agitation and bloodshed, but in many cases we don't see the historical context of the struggle-- it becomes stripped of meaning. This graphic novel helps to fill in some of those absences.What we are left with is the dire poverty of the Palestinians, the constant suspicion and aggression directed towards them, their displacement. The helpless rage of the youth, the thrown rocks, the suicide bombers. Perhaps a dysfunctional response to the occupation, but nonetheless one of very few options open to them.Now that the U.S. has its own Mideast occupation, this graphic novel is more timely and relevant than ever. I would like to see a work by Sacco about Iraq."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Fantastic, eye-opening, hilarious at times and yet fundamentally disturbing. A priceless primer on the roots of Palestinian dispossession. His descriptions of Israeli torture techniques and the methods used to humiliate and control a subject population eerily echo the events recently publicized regarding present American methods in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib prisons."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict in comic book form. In this landmark of journalism and the art form of comics, Joe Sacco gives us insightful reportage at he front lines. He interviewed and encountered prisoners. refugees, protesters, wounded children, farmers and families torn apart by this conflict. Winner of the American Book Award. (His graphic novel, Safe Area Gorazde, about his time in Bosnia, won the Will Eisner Award for Best Original Graphic Novel in 2001.) He's also contributed graphic journalism to Time magazine, Washington Monthly, and Harper's.Teachers/Librarians: 7th grade to adult. Its comicbook style will be of high interest level for many of our students!"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This is a really great book. All I can say to you is, whoever you are, you should read it right now if you haven't already. I'm a pretty well-educated guy and, previously, had traveled to Israel (twice) and read pretty extensively on the \\"conflict.\\" I knew about the expulsion of the Palestinians in 1948, and knew also that they had technically been \\"occupied\\" since 1967. But I didn't really have a good idea of what that meant, of the horrors of life under occupation, and of the utter monstrosity of claiming a symmetry of suffering between Israelis and Palestinians. Reading this book will, if you're a human, make you weep and, even if you're a secular Jew like me, probably also pray that your fellow tribesmen open up and try to understand what they're doing. It's probably the saddest book I've ever read, but also one that, more than any of the leftist pamphlets that I had previously read and (in retrospect, rather stupidly) dismissed, has endowed me with conviction to speak my mind about what's going on. Whether or not you have the same experience, if you're interested in what's going on in Israel/Palestine, I feel strongly that this is a book you have to confront.One final point: There are a couple of comments here that write that this book is \\"out of date.\\" In fact, I was struck--and depressingly so--by how relevant and current it seemed. It seems that the discourse around Israel/Palestine in the Western press has not noticeably changed in the past 15 years. You still hear all the same slogans that Sacco mentions--about the \\"only democracy in the Middle East\\"--you still see the settlements expanding, and the settlers walking with machine guns through the streets of Hebron, and you still see only racist cliches about the Palestinians being a backwards, rage-infused people. This book gives a portrait of life under occupation that you *have not* seen, not now, not even 15+ years after it was written. Believe me, it will be news for you."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"It provides a wonderful insight into the lives of Palestinians in the occupied territories. The comic book medium works perfects for Sacco because he can tell the story he is trying to bring to the world and at the same time show everyone what he saw and experienced."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"I'm not a big fan of comic books, but I am extremely interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, so I bought this book based on that. I was not at all disappointed. The Palestinian experience is shown first hand through Sacco's interactions with them. The way they live their lives is heartbreaking, especially if you live in a free country like the U.S. The Palestinian people's resilience shines through at times, but unfortunately injustice and humiliation command most of the pages. Anyone with a respect for human rights should read this amazing book, whether you are Pro-Palestinian or Pro-Israeli."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"I got to know Joe Sacco's work only lately, though I know the subject personally from birth. I was born in Israel and grew up there, in a family that has always fought for a bi-national state. even as a child I was participating in demos for equal rights, and After 1967, aged only 12, i was already active in anti-occupation movements. About 6 years ago i left Israel feeling betrayed by my country, as well as by my Palestinian friends who have turned away from a peaceful/political solution in favor of armed struggle which we all know they will loose. Reading Joe Sacco's books I found nothing new to me as to facts, but something was missing. I needed to find a trace of an effort to give a more balanced description and at least an attempt to go beyond the stories related to him. No trace of doubt (and we know that stories become more colorful with time, and we also know of a possibility of lying- As in the A-Durra affair where the Israeli army was accused of killing a little boy in the Gaza strip, and later it was proved that the boy is still alive and the whole affair was a propaganda story organized by Palestinians).... I feel that Sacco was innocently doing a a bad job that makes it hard for people like me to accept his message. For me, even if you filter the stories and accept only 10%, it is terrible. I Think I have enough of lies, from both sides. I left Israel because I couldn't go on living with the lies the system has fed me with, but I don't prefer the lies of the occupied Palestinians either. Would Joe Sacco understand that There are victims on both sides, victims of their own politicians mainly( but not only), and victimizers are too on both sides, people greedy for power and money who send others to die for their own personal causes disguised as national ones."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Still a definite recommendation but slightly long and redundant. It's really one-sided (as intended) and should be taken with some balancing perspective. Artwork and the story-telling are both solid for the most part."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Joe Sacco has tried to put a very complex issue in to a comic book which is a challenge by its on and he got it.Although the book is far from objective he is giving a clear and \\"\\"kind\\"\\" of true view of realty through Palestinians eyes.Except for one comic relief (The joke about the 3 secret agents) there are not much of happy moment in the book which make it some kind depressing and make you thing is this really reality?I think not but then again who am I?Still i would recommend this book for people who are not familiar with the situation and would like to know a bit more about it.I have also bought \\"Exit wounds\\" by Rutu Modan as a comic book from the other side of the conflict. It is something totally different but still worth a try.See my review on it under the title.Cheers.-S-"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Palestine puts a very human face on the ongoing tragedy of the people living in their own country, specifically those areas that have not been claimed by Israel. It's not about who's right or wrong, it's about how to deal with the challenge of simply living under very difficult, often fatal, circumstances. There's a sad parallel with the situation faced by native Americans, where even self-imposed exile failed to accommodate the intrusive settlements."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"I'd just like to echo what so many other reviewers have said - such as how people will gain a deeper understanding of the Palestinian's struggle, and that we should buy two copies of \\"Palestine\\" and give one away. I actually bought an additional copy that's in Spanish and sent it to a library in Mexico.The way Joe Sacco describes life and his own experience in the Occupied Territories is captivating, and the drawings are fantastic.When he came out with this graphic novel, there were very few voices who would dare to say something sympathetic toward Palestinians. Now, with books like Jimmy Carter's \\"Palestine: Peace not Apartheid\\" and the work of Noam Chomsky reaching a global audience, Sacco's compassion is more mainstream.For analysis of how the Palestinian's struggle was mischaracterized for so long, I'd suggest the DVD \\"Peace, Propaganda, and the Promised Land.\\"And for people who are interested in the \\"graphic\\" novel format, I'd also highly recommend \\"Wobblies!: A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World\\" edited by Paul Buhle and Nicole Schulman."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Highy entertaining, visually rich and very thought provoking.Throughout our lives we have heard the cause of Israel, but rarely we get such an intimate potrait of the vicitms, the sufferers, and the consequence of the occupation. Joe Sacco takes us on this rare journey through the refuge slums of Palestine to the high life of Tel Aviv painting a contrasting, sometimes deeply moving, othertimes hopeless picture of the situation.A recommended must for anybody who wants to understand the dynamics of the mid east conflict and put themselves in the position of the victims not the politics."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"When I ordered Joe Sacco's Palestine from Amazon.ca (Chapter's appears to be too pro-Isreal to carry it), I had no idea that I was ordering a comic book. So when I opened it for the first time and saw a bunch of illustrations with a few words, I almost returned it. However, after reading the foreword by Edward Said, I decided to give it chance. What I discovered was that this book was much better than I could have ever imagined, and the method chosen by the artist to tell his stories is not only effective, but extremely enlightening and entertaining.Most times I did not want to put this book down. There was much attention paid to detail, and a lot of research put into it. Every comic cell is a masterpiece of it's own. The book basically follows around the main character, Joe, on his explorations through Palestine and it seems to be a very authentic account of the way people live there from day-to-day. Most of the comics are visual accounts of stories being told by people as Joe sits down with different groups and families throughout Palestine.The lack of one specific storyline or goal, and the way the author jumps from place to place and from story to story works with great success, making the reader feel almost as though it was he that was living amongst these people and meeting with them.Unfortunately, because of the very real accounts of the plight of the Palestinians, and the idiotic personal politics of certain people with the power to censor what we read, it can be difficult to find this work of genius, so you may have to look hard to find it at your local bookstore. Fortunately, however, it is available through Amazon.ca and most likely can be ordered through an independent bookseller.This is a strongly recommended read to try and gain some sort of understanding about what is happening around the world, and to get another point of view from the one that is constantly served to us by the media."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This book is amazing. I have seen documentaries like \\"Jenin, Jenin\\" that defend Palestinians and show the reppression of the Israeli occupation, but this packs more punch than any of those movies. I'm an American, and I went to a school in a neighborhood with quite a large Jewish community. Growing up all I ever learned about this conflict came from those that supported Israel 100%. It's unfortunate that more Americans don't read books like this. They'd have a much more balanced understanding of the Middle East if they did."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Reading \\"Palestine\\" was a real education. Joe Sacco takes you to the people of Palestine and shows you their sad, desperate plight all while managing not to be preachy in the least. I couldn't put it down, I bought 10 copies for friends, and rushed to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) Website to make a donation. Now that's the power of literature!"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"What makes this work valuable is the focus on the views of the Palestinian without even attempting to explain the history and events that lead to their plight. Sacco just suspends the why's.What we see is a dark, depressed and oppressed people who unfortunately harbour a growing hatred and resentment towards the Israelis. It does not leave you hopeful for a peaceful solution anytime soon.It is biased, but does not pretend to be anything else. It is also enlightening. The comic style makes it an easy way to get a picture of the Palestinian Viewpoint; it turns a narrative into a picture.For those of us in the west looking for another viewpoint it is worthwhile."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"You have to read Palestine carefully, especially if you are either strongly sympathetic or hostile to Israel. It would be easy to see the book as condemning Israel. It is not, but since Sacco's intention was to get to know the community that we in the US don't know well, the Palestinians, the book shows mainly their experiences and interpretations of them. (It would have been a good idea to include a timeline of the historical events related to the Israel/Palestine tragedy, so that people who do not know the facts could put into perspective the versions of history that Sacco's Palestinian interviewees have.)I emphasize that this is not the book to turn to in order to figure out whether to side with the Israelis or the Palestinians. It does not give that kind of information, and there are other books for that (Thomas Friedman's From Beirut to Jerusalem is a good one). For the most part there are no terrorists or major political figures interviewed and there is no survey of the historical background, the mistakes and crimes that have left both peoples in this mess. What I saw in this brilliant piece of comic journalism is an on the ground look at what is going on with people caught in the storm.Palestine is about the human spirit, often humorous and courageous. It is also about the tragedy that is what happens when people suffer at each other's hands, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, as well as physically, and lose the ability to see the human face.Victims turn into villains. The scenes of the settlers attacking the Arab villages at night reminded me chillingly of Kristalnacht. A 16 year old Palestinian terrorist-in-training is chilling as he describes his recruitment at 13, his loss of interest in anything but the violence, and the version of history that he believes in. Sixteen year old settlers strutting through town with their Uzis are just as chilling. You are appalled by them all, and by the societies that have turned children into murderers. And you are touched by the crowd scenes, where you see tiny figures of men and women in the background, hurrying their children away, keeping them away from the stone throwing crowds.You see the mythologies that both sides, though mainly (because of the nature of the book) the Palestinians, have created in order to give themselves pride and explain all the pain. You see that these mythologies are not going to save anyone.Sacco does not idolize his Palestinian subjects, though he is very sympathetic to most of them. He shows the irrational hatred, the elevation of victimhood to almost divine status, and the self-destructiveness of some of the people he interviewed. He really likes the children, especially inquisitive little girls, but he shows that there are some nasty kids too. I emphasize that he likes these people, despite their human failings. Their errors do not mean they are to be dismissed, just as their suffering does not mean that the lines on which Arab politicians have chosen to explain the situation are right. It was Sacco's irony, actually, that allowed me to trust his observations of life in an occupied region, with all that \\"occupied\\" implies.The most troubling part to the book, therefore, was the portrayal of the Israeli soldiers. I wish that he had interviewed Israeli soldiers, since they (and settlers) are the only Israelis present in the Palestian refugee camps, and the soldiers come off looking brutal much of the time. But in looking through the book a second time, I noticed that many of the soldiers looked terrified. This terror coupled with the brutality throws another light on the tragedy afflicting both Israelis and Palestinians.I've been left haunted by one particular image, the depressed face of his last guide, an educated, unemployed volunteer with a school for the handicapped. It is not a dramatic, self dramatizing depression. Sacco's skill is impressive here, as he shows the man's face change, subtly, according to what is going on (sad tales, checkpoints, the charming chatter of a 10 year old girl)--he has other feelings, but his hopelessness has smothered the intensity."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"I do not have much to contribute that has not already been stated by other customer reviewers but I would like to add to the overwhelming consensus that this is an excellent book and, since it is done in comic book style, I would recommend it as an effective tool for adolescent readers in our high schools. Saccco's book was written before the most recent wave of Palestinian suicide bombings which has wreaked havoc both to Israel and to outside sympathy for the Palestinian cause. However, this book should give all open-minded readers insight into the despair that has led so many Palestinians to support terrorism. Sacco's disarmingly informal writing style and his powerful artwork convey both the constant systematic and randomly unsystematic injustice that Israel, its soldiers, settlers and other citizens have directed at the Palestinians. Sacco exposes the economic discrimination that gives incentives to West Bank Jewish settlers and imposes taxes and other bureacratic and physical barriers on Palestinian attempts to earn a living: Palestinian agricultural produce left on the docks to spoil before it is shipped to European customers, the denial of adequate water and permits to drill deeper wells, cutting down groves of olive trees, etc. Sacco also takes us inside hospitals where Israeli soldiers intimidate and beat patients, nurses, and doctors, disrupting surgeries, treatments, etc. Individual Palestinians recount their prison experiences: the psychological and physical torture and the inhuman living conditions, abuses of the legal system, etc. There is much more in this new edition--printed in 2001 and again in 2002--at roughly 300 pages, this is nearly double the size of an earlier edition. Everyone with an interest in the Middle East Crisis or terrorism should read this book. This book is pro-Palestinian but it is not anti-Semitic or against the existence of an Israeli state. It is also recommended by Art Spiegelman, the great cartoonist and author of the Jewish Holocaust comic classics, Maus I and II. For more great info on the plight of the Palestinians, I recommend regular reading of Tikkun, an excellent, liberal Jewish-American bi-monthly periodical."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Joe Sacco's \\"Palestine\\" provides the western world with a powerful account of the Palestinian perspective of their conflict with Israel. Sacco's path takes him through much of the West Bank, Gaza, Jerusalem and parts of Israel. He tells the stories of the people he meets and through them paints a picture of the brutality and injustice they endure under the apartheid policies of Israel. With the media coverage of the conflict being what it is, the accessibility of the graphic novel format makes \\"Palestine\\" a singularly important work. By communicating the truth, perhaps a lasting solution to this conflict can be found.Although the journalistic content of \\"Palestine\\" is its primary value, it also stands on its own aesthetically. Sacco also writes well and the narrative flows smoothly from one part of his journey to another."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"It may be the case that in the United States the issues of the Middle East are presented in a very subjective manner (pro-Israeli) through mainstream media. This is not the case where I live now, where there is a pro-Palestinian sentiment, expressed again in a subjective manner.The value of this book is relative to the exposure one has already had on the subject. If you do not know much about it, and especially if you have lived in an environment which portrays Palestinians as bad and Israelis as good, then this is a good book for you, that will open your eyes to the other side of the story.However, you should not then regard this book as the truth. It is subjective as well in its own manner. Its subjectivity lies not so much on the presentation of non-truths, or its certain exagerations, but rather on its omission of truths which support the other side. For example, when the name \\"Golda Meier\\" comes up, the book mentions statements she made about the Palestinians which are ridiculous and cruel: and she did make such statements. However, when the name Nasser comes up, he appears only as someone who \\"symbolises Arab nationalism and unity,\\" which is a great injustice to history and to the reader. Moreover, the coverage of the Israeli side of the story is so superficial, that it would be better if it had been omitted altogether.Therefore, you should follow up in quest for knowledge on the subject with more material, from both sides. (try not to spend time looking for something \\"objective!\\" It does not exist.Finally, if you have already been exposed to the various sides of the debate, this book may prove a good way to remind yourself that, after all the analysis of whose fault was what, and who is historically to blame, and what the legal issues are and the technicalities, there is alot of human suffering involved. I, personally, have experienced the human suffering from the Israeli side, and can venture to assert that it can reach similar levels. Afterall, if you start debating on moral issues by counting body bags, and comparing who suffers more, and who deserves it more, then you have lost the plot.(The most disturbing aspect of this book is the portrayal of the place of women in society - the west vs. Palestine.)"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"If it were possible to give a book 10 stars, then this book would get them from me, I was awed by it. I've not read a graphic book since Maus, and would not have picked this up if a dozen friends hadn't recommended it to me. Joe Sacco's Palestine (and his later book on Bosnia called Safe Area Gorazde), is a miracle of observation, compassion and humanity. It does what most books, most newspapers fail to do, illustrate the plight of Palestinian people, show us why they are angry, and why some are driven to terrifying acts of suicide. It should be read in schools."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Sacco never preaches, he just reports. And the reporting gave me all sorts of insight into what our media never seems to touch: the lives of ordinary Palestinians, day-to-day. It is astounding. And Sacco is not an apologist for terrorism; in fact he doesn't even discuss Palestinian terrorists. He just talks about what he saw: regular people. Sometimes intelligent and noble, sometimes small-minded and misguided. Just like people everywhere else. But when you think that SO many Palestinians have lived under these contitions their whole lives- have never travelled, and every Jew they have ever met has been a settler or a soldier- you start to understand why this is a no-win situation for anyone."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"One of the most captivating books I have recently read. I feel bad that I only discovered it by chance. I wonder if the book was ever advertized appropriately. What a loss! This is a gem of a book and I am buying 5 copies to give away.Don't let the comic style of the book or the design of its cover desuade you from buying it. It is a very serious book. I was shocked by the facts as shown. One can read volumes in the eyes of the people as sketched, particularly those of the elderly. One sees despair, indignation, genuinity and all the while the generosity of those who have so little to spare. The author is very adapt at showing the inhumane conditions in the Palestinian camps he visited, sentiments that are echoed by other authors who visited the camps, though not as eloquently (Kate Halsell \\"Journey to Jerusalem\\" and Wendy Orange \\"Coming Home to Jerusalem\\"). No doubt about it, the book is very timely and a good source for readers who know little about the plight of the Palestinians, and a good reference for those who feel they know it all."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This book on Palestine from Joe Sacco, is an incredibly powerful medium to relay the events in the occupied territories, in a style that everyone can understand. Unlike most other books written on the topic -in dry and boring terms that seem to only elicit the interest of historians or those involved in the conflict in one way or another- this book captivates the reader in its spell, from cover to end.Sacco does an amazing job at covering a wide range of issues that represent life under occupation, in addition to delving slightly into the history behind it to give one a comprehensive view. In his coverage, he keenly pays attention to the smallest of details, from capturing the emotions on one's face, to the markings on a wall in a refugee camp.Throughout it all, he masterfully provokes a wide range of emotions in the reader.What comes through above all however, is the brutal honesty that Sacco strikes his readers with, in conveying his own fears and sarcasm simultaneously.It is no wonder therefore, that the nine-issue comic series this book collected under one cover, won a 1996 American Book Award.For anyone who was ever curious about the situation in Palestine today, or wanted to know more about the Israeli occupation and why the Middle East is such a boiling point, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Joe Sacco headed off to to the Palestinian refugee camps with a few bucks in his pocket, a sketchpad, a little training in how to draw comic books, a rarely used camera (film was too expensive) and a curious mind. Sacco interviewed Palestinians and asked them about all sorts of aspects of their lives: jobs, the intifada, women's rights, Land for Peace, and much more. Sacco turned those interviews into this graphic novel (although Sacco does not like that term much - instead he prefers \\"comic book journalist\\").There is no traditional narrative to this book. Sacco does not turn these interviews into a large over-arching history of the Palestininan people. Instead, it is like reading a series of illustrated interviews. This gives the reader the feeling that he or she is there sitting right there with Sacco talking and drinking green tea in the camps. In a way, the story would be better if he had tried to make an illustrated history, but, in the end, I think this is a more powerful presentation. Imagine \\"based on real events\\" movie vs. a documentary and you get the idea.Sacco occassional touches on the topic of who is right and who is wrong in this book. It does carry a pro-Palestinian slant (it was designed to be that way - I have no idea where Sacco's real sympathies lie), but it does not hammer on those issues.Not a fun book, but an important one. Strongly recommended for anyone interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, no matter which side you come down on."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Joe Sacco's collection of stories that he witnessed first-hand while living in Palestine will move you and break your heart. You're not human if you don't feel moved by the constant fear and humiliation the Palestinians live under. Joe Sacco presents all the players from Israeli peaceniks who never seem to make an impact to the IDF with its varied ranks from despicably draconian sadists to hesitant Israeli soldiers just following orders and the aggressively antagonist settlers. The focus is on the Palestinians though. How they have to check with big brother just to move from city to city and sometimes from block to block in their own country. How the settlers can do no wrong and can act with impunity against the Palestinians. How Palestinians can be jailed, abused, and tortured on the slightest pretext. How children can be detained and tortured for throwing rocks. Joe Sacco will also make you laugh at times such as how he has to drink tea drowned in sugar for the umpteenth time so as to not offend his hosts. The Israeli occupiers and settlers aren't the only antagonists involved though. We also get a look at Hamas and we see how they attempt to enforce Islamic fundamentalism, but find that they cannot. We also see the struggle within a struggle as the varied landscape of Palestinian women is analyzed. The stories and accounts are so similar that one can't help but see the truth in them. Most of the Palestinians are innocent civilians who merely seek to make a living and just exist, but find their every move under scrutiny. It's nothing short of outrageous to witness a man being jailed without evidence and then kept in prison for months without trial or evidence just because the prosecution is working with the jailors to get a coerced confession through the use of torture, sleep deprivation, and lies. Joe Sacco's work gives us insights into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in ways that you won't see on tv. Sacco's work is about the everyday people who live and die under this brutal occupation. Sacco makes it clear that sure there are worse places, but those places don't claim to be noble democracies like Israel. What we get in this graphic report is a multi-layered series of events involving ordinary Palestinians who are not involved in any insidious activity. We learn a great deal from Sacco's reports about what is going on and how most Americans either don't know or don't care about the facts on the ground. There are sprinkles of hope though. We watch as some Palestinians express a desire to share the land with Israelis in some measure of peace and equality and we hear an Israeli wish for a state that is not based upon religion or ethnicity, but is a multi-cultural state like the US. What moved me most was why the Palestinians don't all just leave because it's obvious that the occupation is designed to coerce into leaving the territories so that the Israelis can implant an artificial majority of Jewish settlers. It's a testament to their spirit and strength that they don't give in to tyranny and injustice and simply keep holding on in the hopes that the occupation will end some day. It's not surprising that this book comes from Fantagraphics by the way. They've been putting out great work since Love and Rockets and this is no exception. Palestine is a huge book and you won't be able to read it in sitting unless you read all day. Considering the power of this piece you might end up doing just that though."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Palestinians have suffered, but just blaming Israel for everything means they will never get peace, never have a decent economy because they think Israel owes them something and will keep trying to destroy Israel.Palestinian leaders' corruption, indoctrination against Israel in schools and media breeds only hatred of Israel for no benefit.Palestinians must learn to live with Israel in Peace and stop exploding bombs on buses, firing missiles into Israel, to stop using knives such as on the Fogel family living in the ancient jewish homelands of Judea and Samaria. 2 terrorists came into their house, stabbed and shot the parents and children and cut off the baby's head.Comic books such as this distort the picture, and make peace harder to obtain."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"It is not suprising that the conflict in the middle east lends itself to distortion and hyperbole, after all not everyone can visit the region and few understand the size of things being fought over. If the region was as proportional to the world as presented in the media it would be the size of Asia rather than .001% of it.This comic looks at a person travelling to Israel and subseuqently going to the Palestinian territories and seing the 'truth'. But there is one truth here. When in Israel he wears a skullkap or Yarmluke(Kippah) a sign of being Jewish, in the territories he does not. Why? Because he could die for it. This might be a worthwhile litmus test for tolerance, it clearly shows what 'tolerance' really means in Palestine. If you can die for being religious, that doesnt point to the liberal tolerance Edward Said claims to exist.However there is one blatent lie in the drawings here. The Jewish houses in the settlements are accused of looking 'foreign' while the Arab ones are said to be 'indigenous'. Somehow this is hard to beleive given the fact that 95% of Arab homes in Palestine are constructed of concrete, and are two stories. THos 'native' houses the author refers to, and depicts, existed as mud huts in the 1800s, todays rich Palestinian elite have Mercedes and 3 story houses, ten times larger than the trailors and single bedroom homes of the 'bad' settlers. But distortion can be forgiven, it is a critical view of how Israel is bad and Palestine good.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"More of Sacco's single-minded obsession with placing all of the blame on the Israelis for the Arab-Israeli conflict.This book has nothing to do with a genuine search for historical truth and everything to do with anti-Israel bias.Sacco's use of crude pictures to tell a one-sided story of Jewish evil will, no doubt, remind some readers of similarly crude anti-Semitic graphics employed by the Nazis and indeed, by the Palestinians themselves. We need not linger on this obvious comparison to dismiss Sacco's comic books as the nastiest sort of polemic that sheds little light on either the origins of the current conflict or the nature of war. At a time when anti-Israel invective and Jew-hatred is on the rise around the world, the publication of works like this only encourages more hate; it does nothing to disseminate it."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This is a comic book by a man sympathetic to pawns in a 100+ year conflict. The facts are few if any and the lies are plentiful. Theforeword of this book was written by Edward Said an American propagandist who once admitted &quot;the whole of Palestinian nationalism was based on driving all Jews out&quot;. This is a fact that cannot be disputed.Little known facts not mentioned in the comic book:In 1997 40% of the PA budget was reported &quot;missing&quot; due to corruption and outright theft by Yasser Arafat and his gang.After starting 3 wars displacing Palestinians, Arab leaders denied them citizenship, restricted their access to housing, jobs, schools, and health care in Arab countries. They also introduced UN resolutions to prevent Palestinians from permanently resettling in Arab ocuntries and rejected UN funds to build them better housing.Under Palestinian jurisdiction Gaza income dropped 35% in Gaza and unemployment rose to more than 20% between 1992-1996.Yasser arafat planned this recent war against Israeli civilians before the end of the Camp David meeting in 2000 and long before Ariel Sharon walked at the Temple Mount.Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia, a nation hostile to Israel, blamed the entire mess on Arafat saying, &quot;It is a crime against Palestinians, in fact the entire region."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Palestine is melodramatic propaganda.It tows the PLO party line and does not provide any solutions."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This book was written by a man who supported deadly terrorist attacks against ISraeli and Jewish civilians.

Waste of time &amp; energy. Complete fiction."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"What a waste. Sacco could reach a much wider audience if he had written essays. But, wait...does he have the talent to write essays? Being \\"cool & edgy\\" apparently has more meaning to him than making a legitimate difference in the world, in general, and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically. Additionally, he is both biased and sexist in his writing."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This book is freaking amazing! Comics seem to be everywhere these days, so why not comic journalism? Well, Sacco is the master of this entertaining genre, and in this book he puts forth a powerful message about Palestine, the people who live there, and the mentalities within the Palestinian/Israeli conflicts. One of the things I like most about this book is how Sacco uses crazy, chaotic paneling to depict crazy, chaotic street scenes. This is to say that this book is drawn in ways that bring the message of the journalism to life. (Similarly, calm moments in the text are presented with calm, regular sequences of panels and pages.) Another thing that is incredibly clever about this book is the way that Sacco puts his own perspective as a journalist on display. In some pages, you'll see how he draws photos he's taken on top of what are depicted as \\"real\\" images of daily life. By doing this, he comes clean and shows the reader that what you find in this book is just his own interpretation. Anyway: this is an awesome, thoughtful book. I totally love it."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Palestine does what a graphic novel should do -- it uses the pictures to tell the part of the story that you don't get from news reports. Sacco tells us repeatedly that he's not a particularly political person or a hero, just a guy trying to tell a human story. It's a sad, sad story he tells, but a convincingly first hand one."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"There are 2 different stories of the same middle east crisis. The palestinian story belived by people in Islamic and Arab world. The israeli story believed by most of the rest of the world. We both have been told the story as it reached us through the media.Joe Sacco told us the story as he lived it through the streets of arab cities and refuge camps as Tel Aviv. He provided us with the living story told to him by the average man/woman who lived the story and facing the crisis daily, not by a politician sitting in his office as they are the usual story tellers . He put it in a comics to make sure that the right picture will reach our minds, through houses in bad state and streets in terrible and dirty conditions. He didnt tell us directly about his opinion on the peace process thier but he gave us ideas so we can reach the conclusions alone.Worth valued comics, for both comics follower or Middle east crisis followers."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"I'm not quite sure where to begin with this one... Sacco's work is amazing, bordering on briliant. He exposes the harsh realities of life within the Palestinian refugee camps like nothing else I've seen. Sacco needs to be commended for his ability to catch so many different shades of Arab opinion in such a small number of pages. Sacco does not, however, make a significant attempt write about the Israeli perspective (he does devote a few pages to this). But that is not a problem. As Sacco says, he (as well as the whole world) have been receiving the Israeli perspective for over 50 years. His goal was not to give their point of view, thats been done a thousand times.Additionally, the artwork is absolutely stunning! In the pictures alone he captures the life of a typical Palestinian Arab. The despair he paints on their face matches the horrible experience they've been through. Amazing...Please pick this sentimental roller coaster up to supplement your historical and academic reading on the subject. You won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"I am not a big fan of comic books, so this book was a stretch for me. However after seeing some of the art online, I was impressed, and you will be too. Despite the fact that it's in a comic book style, the faces and landscape are actually drawn with both insight and accuracy. It's like looking through someone's brain. Sacco's writing style is also like this, leading you through his thought processes while at the same time rendering very realistic 'recordings' of the people he spoke with.Journalism and art mix perfectly in this amazing book. Buy it and pass it on, just about anyone will be both mentally engaged and artistically satisfied."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"I am not nearly knowledgeable enough to judge Sacco's grasp of the overall political situation in the Middle East; however, PALESTINE is not a book about overall situations. It's a series of vignettes and snapshots of individual lives in the occupied territories, and Sacco tells those stories very well. He is clearly sympathetic to the Palestinians, but even though he portrays them as victims, he also depicts their anger, their violence, their conflicts with each other . . . all the things that make them real people, and all the things that, frankly, can lead one into despair over the prospects for anything but war and conflict in the region for a long time to come.Sacco is a skilled journalist, getting his interview subjects to talk about their lives and experiences in detail. As a comic artist, he brings those stories to life. His people often seem to have larger-than-life, exaggerated features -- all the better to convey emotion -- while he draws the world they live in in great detail. The contrast of the combination works very well.Throughout the story, Sacco provides a running narration of his own thoughts as he moves from place to place chasing the story, while also filling in historical details where he feels it necessary. The narration gives an added dimension to the book, since it also becomes a story of Sacco's adjustments to conditions in the territories and his own mixed feelings about his ability to do anything about them -- feelings that readers will likely share when they finish reading this book."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This new one volume edition of Joe Sacco's Palestine comics evokes my first trip to the occupied Palestinian territories in 1989 a couple of years before Sacco's first visit from 1991-1992. His book faithfully represents the contradictions and striking images of the conflict, and being a graphic novel/comic book renders them visually and powerfully.I couldn't think of a better medium to explain the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to someone than this book, which stands out as an honest account of one man's attempt to make sense of it all, as well as a work of art in its own right.Powerfully-told stories are laced with well-researched facts, all couched in Sacco's humanity and disbelief at the people he meets and the events he sees. Particularly chilling is the account of a Palestinian father's torture experience. The book covers a wide variety of other topics, including refugees, Israeli attitudes, life inside prison, and more, introducing these issues (along with the atmosphere of a visit to Palestine) through Sacco's walk through the West Bank and Gaza, talking to people there.The second half of Sacco's book opens up more of the conflict, this time in the setting of Gaza, but should be considered as indivisible from the first half, as the two halves represent the complete collection of &quot;Palestine&quot; comics originally published as individual magazines, then as a two volume edition.The visual imagery is almost photographically faithful to the actual landscapes and cityscapes of Palestine, and accounts such as Sacco's taxi ride to Nablus will elicit delighted cries of recognition and wry laughter from those who have visited the country.This book is a 'must have' that you will definitely not be disappointed with if you're buying them for yourself, and should be considered a necessary part of your standard tools to explain the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict to others. In the absense of a Palestinian &quot;Cry Freedom&quot;, this is the next best thing.Nigel Parry"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"If you know absolutely nothing about where all the trouble began then this is a must read. Sacco is incredibly good at breaking complexities down; not only making them understandable but making it personal. You would think that 'graphic literature' would allow you to remain safely detached from the illustrated events but Mr Sacco's offerings have quite the opposite effect. It is impossible to properly describe the experience; bit like taking a picture of the Grand Canyon instead of standing on the lip of a thousand foot precipice. Once you're read one you'll be hooked, addicted; one won't be enough."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Away from Sacco's great illustration and story telling and the great humour of incidents. How he captured the case of the palestinian ppl and how he mingled with them and the type of people he interviewed is just amazing. You can tell that Sacco is neutral he didn't go to defend a certain side, he just went to see what is really happening on the holy land. This book is a must to all people who sympathize with the Israeli Government, and see Palestinians as terrorists, who have no right to the land."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This is probably the best book out there that'll make you understand what you never understood before , A true Graphic novel that captured what other artists haven't .. 10\\\\10 You can't live without reading this, Just give it a chance ..

In America, all we hear are negatives about Palestinians, and never about why they do the things they are \\"accused\\" of. This book is brilliant in opening our eyes to the horrors behind the \\"curtain\\" and has great visual images depicting horrific scenes. One doesn't say to believe everything you read, but this is an enjoyable book to read!"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Journalist and comic book artist Joe Sacco has been rightly praised for this intense account of his time in the Palestinian territories during the first Intifada. Sacco decided from the start to tell the Palestinian side of the story -- not to aim for the false balance of much of modern journalism. His graphic novel is primarily a series of interviews with Palestinians, some arranged in advance and some on the spur of the moment.If you enjoyed Art Spiegelman's MAUS books, you'll probably like Sacco's work.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Hard to not bring one's biases to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If you don't have biases, you just don't care and you wouldn't be interested in this book in the first place. Joe Sacco is obviously skewed towards the Palestinians, but he only has a few terrible moments of omission - such as the Golda Meir quote without context or stating the fact of Israel expansion in 1967 and 1948 without the context of Israel being attacked.Beyond that he does try earnestly to be evenhanded. He portrays the Palestinians as foolish, angry, noble and scary depending on the context. He portrays the Israelis as either leftist leaning or sick of the situation. But mostly he betrays the frustrations, the anger, the conflicts and the ambiguity that come with a decades long unresolved conflict (and he was writing this pre-Oslo) and to his credit he does not get too wrapped up in polemics.One of the key moments comes later in the book when he quotes an Israeli as saying that two-state vs. one-state isn't the issue. The issue is whether Palestinians and Israelis can co-exist and then he flashes to a young boy being bullied by Israeli soldiers. The boy might be a suspect. He might be innocent but he's going to resent that treatment. And that's going to cause more pain in the future than a thousand terrorist assassinations.Even if you are rabidly Zionist (like me) you should read this book as it gives the other side of the story without dipping into asinine polemics like most pro-Palestinian texts."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This book is simply amazing. I'm a second-year college student and it is required reading in my Comp Lit class. It shows you the side of an issue mainstream media doesn't want you to see, and those who refuse to see the side of Palestinians will, even after reading this book, deny the truth. Joe Sacco is brilliant, as his evidence is first hand, his writing realistic, and drawings eye-opening. For anyone who is sick of seeing the issue of Palestine from the view of money hungry media people, this is the book to get. You'll cry. I guarantee, because Sacco will show you the truth as you aren't supposed to see it."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This books is not anti-semetic as many people have written. It hardly contains anything about jews. Its about palestinian lives ruined by 50 years of occupation by israel, nothing directed at jews in general, but rather the country israel, and techniques used by Israel to occupy. Some people I know living in Israel never realized such a thing could be going on just under their noses.But that's not the reason I have it 5 stars. Each time I opened the book to read it, I felt I was walking with the author around town. It's like it happens in cartoons, you open the book and you go into the book, you actually live through all the experiences he goes through. Even though the author could write stuff so beautifully, I wonder how this all would be seen through the eyes of children living in that occupation.I still wonder how people can migrate and take over a country and change its demographics.The book pretty much gives views of both sides on occupied terrotories."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Totally eye-opening. Read it, it will change your opinion on whats going on over there almost immediately. It is very similar to Maus, if you've ever read that. You probably have. I think everyone and their mother has read Maus at some point.Sacco is truely one of the greats. May he continue to travel the world and bring us these stories."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Starting with a typical attitude of \\"Who cares?\\" Sacco shows us how his visit to the West Bank and Gaza in the early 1990s transformed him completely. Palestinians have much against them in todays world, not least the stereotypes of \\"supporting terror\\" etc, etc that the Israeli propaganda machine heaps on them every day. These stereotypes create a formidable barrier between the Palestinian people and Americans. Americans do not feel like they should even pay attention to these \\"insignificant terrorists\\" - and that is precisely the goal of the propagandists in the first place: to silence the Palestinians and prevent their very HUMANITY (let alone their message) from being recognized.Enter Joe Sacco, with master strokes of a cartoonists pencil, he succeeds singlehandedly in shattering those barriers. For the first time in an American puclication, you actually SEE Palestinians as people, you enter their households, you talk to them, you listen to their problems, and you think about it. Well, so what?If you always thought that the middle east problem is \\"too complicated\\" or \\"has been going on for too long\\" to be able to understand it, it is time to get out your credit card and BUY THIS BOOK. In the most enjoyable cartoon style that makes it hard for you to let go of the book, you will see things like you've never witnessed them before. This is the raw human story, not the clinically sterilized CNN version of events, or the dry history book polemics.

A good piece of art is that which changes a person's life for the better, no matter how small this change is. A bad piece of art is that which changes a person's life for the worse, no matter how small this change is. All the rest simply don't count. Based on this classification, Joe Sacco's \\"Palestine\\" is a good piece of art.What is \\"Palestine\\"? It is a comic book. It is political journalism. It is a synergetic combination of both, and the whole is greater than the sum. And it could be considered to be a pioneering work in cartoon journalism. It predates Kubert's \\"Fax from Sarajevo\\".\\"Palestine\\" has been brought out by Fantagraphics as a 9 issue series. The first five issues of the series have been brought out recently in a trade paperback titled \\"Palestine Book One: A Nation Occupied\\".The comic starts with Joe Sacco's visit to Palestine, and it continues from there about his diverse experiences in a ravaged land. It shows, in as stark terms as possible, the plight of an occupied people. It lays bare strange facets of characters of the people involved.That then is the subject - and the presentation media is a comic book, written and drawn by Joe Sacco. The writing is terse, clipped, almost subliminal. About the writing, Kathleen Bennet wrote in \\"Stranger\\": \\"Disjointed phrases of text are scattered across the page... leading the reader into the staccato of interior monologue\\".Here is a sample passage:-------------------------------------------------------------But if 1948 is no secret, it's all but a non-issue, dismissed entirely by Prime Minister Golda Meir: \\"It was not as though there was a Palestinian people considering itself as a Palestinian people and we came and threw them out and took their country away from them. They did not exist\\". But they did exist, and they do, and here they are... and their children, and their children's children... and still they are refugees...-------------------------------------------------------------And the art? It is pure Sacco: clear outlines, moody cross-hatchings, panels showing utter disregard for borders. And of course the angles - the strange, unfamiliar angles. Sometimes the reader looks at a scene from the bird's eye-view which suddenly shifts and changes into a worm's eye-view. The overall effect is sheer - I cannot think of any other word - art.Another important aspect of the comic is the lettering, used with consummate skill. The usage of underlines is unique and effective.\\"Palestine\\" recently won the \\"American Book Award\\" offered by the \\"Before Columbus Foundation\\". In the honored tradition of Henry Root, to the Before Columbus Foundation I say: Well Done! However, this comics writer and artist from Portland deserves much more. If things were up to me, I would nominate Joe Sacco for the Nobel Prize. After all, Nobel Prize for literature is supposed to be offered for idealistic literary works, and in recent years, I have not come across many works more idealistic and more literary than Palestine.(...)"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Excellent depiction of daily life. An intense portrayal of persons and circumstances, with an amazing ability to stay in observer role.I highly recommend this book for any interested party."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"I am not a fan of graphic novels, at least not normally. But Joe Sacco's \\"Palestine\\" stands out as the exception.Sacco shows us what everyday Palestinians experience through his interviews and his simple yet powerful drawings. It is not \\"propaganda\\" as some would suggest. It simply shows what people experience under the Israeli occupation.It's unfortunate that the critics of this book go after Sacco (and the positive reviewers) because they love Israel or defend its right to exist. \\"Palestine\\" is mostly about what Israel has done to the Palestinian people. That is fact. It is equally factual that some Palestinians have committed horrendous acts of terrorism. To point out the former does not mean you defend the latter. To suggest it does is nothing less than childish arrogance.My major beef with Sacco is his lack of aggressiveness on the issue women's rights and Islam. He gives us a few pages on the topic but these offer very little logic in showing what is ultimately a morally indefensible position - the subjugation of women for religious reasons.Despite this one criticism, and despite the wishes of Sacco's critics, \\"Palestine\\" will likely stand the test of time. It's one of those books that will be read and talked about 50 years from now when, hopefully, the Palestinians and Israelis will both have their own peaceful homeland."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Sacco paints the situation realistically and lets his characters speak for themselves. Sacco is himself among the characters, treated objectively like the rest. This is a plain record of a visit to the territories occupied by Israel since their victory in the Six Day War. It is Sacco's intent, clearly, to portray the physical suffering and mental anguish suffered by all the participants. Among those participants are several Israelis. They are treated with just as much sympathy as the Palestinians. Those who claim that this book is \\"biased\\" have not read it or are themselves bigots of the sort that would embarrass millions of enlightened Israelis.The reviewers of July 25th and May 13th 2004 are writing from an agenda no better than that of a Klansman or a Marxist. They watch American television, rather than reading books. Can you see any evidence that they read Sacco's book?"},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Using the graphic novel format, Joe Sacco provides his readers with an excellent way of telling a deeply disturbing story. The point of view is wholly that of the Arabs displaced from their former homes in what is now the state of Israel. The drawings are remarkable--the detail and accuracy of the landscape, the facial expressions and garb of the individuals, the difficult living conditions, even the effects of the weather on the people and environment.I think that, by the author presenting himself within the context of the story, the book itself becomes more readable. The character of Joe the journalist provides not only some comic relief, but also keeps the reader more engaged in the story by making it more of a travelogue rather than simply a list of grievances.Although this book is presented entirely from the anti-Israel (anti-Jewish) point of view, it is sometimes necessary to see the human side of the enemy. No conflict can be resolved without really hearing what the other side has to say and how it feels. I cannot say it is unbiased, but I do know the feelings expressed in the books are the truths as Palestinians know them. I can only hope this evocative and important piece of literature is used creatively and in a positive way to show there are two sides to every story."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Along with all other books that need to have special editions such asThe Complete Maus: A Survivor's Talethis wonderful dialouge between man and history, between artist and struggle and between activist and history calls for a special edition.

He has a fantastic feel for the interplay of words and pictures in the graphic novel form, and importantly, he knows when to let the pictures do the talking. I recommend all his books.Remember, though, he's not trying to give an anchorman's-eye-view of the conflict in Palestine; he's telling the intimate and evocative story of his own experience there and the experiences of some of the people he met.One of my favorite aspects of his writing is how he injects just enough of himself and his own self-reflection into the stories to let you know that he's aware of his own viewpoint, self-doubts, and biases. And yet this never overwhelms the other stories he's relating. In fact, it gives you more confidence in them because you build a relationship with the storyteller himself."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Starting with a typical attitude of \\"Who cares?\\" Sacco shows us how his visit to the West Bank and Gaza in the early 1990s transformed him completely.

Nonetheless, in today's climate, it is important to remember that the vast majority of Palestinians have dreams, lives, and difficulties that aren't represented by the stereotypical suicide bomber's farewell video.I don't pretend to represent that this one perspective is the only book you should read to fully understand the complex realities, plural, of the Middle East. The tale is told with a certain point of view. However, every story has a point of view, whether explicit or implicit. Joe Sacco merely makes his explicit.In addition to being an important story, it is also well told. As mere entertainment or as education, \\"Palestine\\" is an important and fascinating work."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Great read, shows very detailed hardships of Palestinian prisoners and their challenges and mis-treatment while incarcerated this book taught me a lot and made me aware of things that the media keeps from us which is the &#34;TRUTH&#34;."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"The book came properly packaged and arrived quickly which was good. The book itself made me uneasy and kind of left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"*** I must fully disclose that I do not read Joe Sacco's books for the political agenda... but to view his art!!***I was introduced to Joe Sacco's work, and \\"Palestine\\", by my art professor (who was trying to teach me a little something about pen and ink drawing). I became so inthralled by his work that I now have a collection of (what I call) \\"Artistic Graphic Novels\\" including \\"The Fixer and Other Stories\\", \\"Palestine\\", \\"The Book of Genesis Illustrated\\" by R. Crumb, \\"Maus\\" by Art Spiegelman... etc.While I find the war reporting to be interesting, I have intentionally left out my opinions on the conflicts he reports on. Whether I agree or disagree with his portrayal of a conflict, I truly just enjoy the artistic rendering he is capable of and the unique way he reports his stories.If you are looking for a bit more insight into the conflicts in the Middle East, this is probably a good read (as long as you understand its limitations and one sided view point). However, for anyone interested in looking at beautifully thought out, and rendered, pen and ink illustrations... you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Being on a tight budget is synonymous with being a college freshman, so it's no wonder that I chose to buy this book from Amazon as opposed to other retailers, especially after I researched the prices other retailers were offering. Even though it was \\"used\\" it came looking and feeling like brand new with no highlighting/markings in it. Not to mention the book itself is one of the best books you'll ever read."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This comic book made the plight of the Palestinian people real to me in a way no other book, or even documentary film, ever has. What makes the comic format so well suited for this story is that unlike other formats such as documentary film or prose, Sacco is able to graphically illustrate the stories that his interview subjects tell him, so we get to see, for example, what its like inside Ansar III prison, or at an Israeli &quot;interrogation&quot; of a Palestinian stone-thrower. He is a gifted illustrator-- his mastery of displaying subtle human emotions through facial expression is breathtaking.This book series will probably be criticized for being &quot;one sided,&quot; and it definitely is (not one bad thing happens to an Israeli in the book.) Yet, as the narrator replies when an Israeli woman in the comic says, &quot;You should hear our side of the story,&quot;.... &quot;I've heard nothing but the Israeli side most of my life.&quot; Here is a gripping view from the other side of the line."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"My intent in reading this book was to try and learn what motivates the Palestinian people to hate Israel and also, people like myself who are Jewish. This is a one sided book and that was exactly what I was looking for. To truly research a subject as complex as Israel and the Palestinians, one must perform a synoptical reading of many books to get closer to the \\"truth\\". This book provided for me a deeper understanding as to why I am hated by so many Palestinians.I recommend this book for all Jews and Palestinians who are interested in learning about themselves and others. There are many disturbing facts mentioned in this book which I intend to research the validity of. Whether these are accurate facts or not, this book will blantantly allow anyone to understand why Israel and Jews are hated by many Palestinians."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"A riveting and eye-opening work about the miserable realities of life for Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Joe Sacco's incisive observations and artistry provides a necessary balance to the pro-Israeli bias in American media and politics. Unflinching but also containing healthy doses of irony and humor, the book eloquently reaffirms that peace will finally come only when we are able to recognize the humanity of the other side."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Joe Sacco brilliantly gives voices and faces to the masses of \`invisible' Palestinians and in sharing their stories Sacco has created an incredibly personal and emotionally powerful historical document of an endangered people. Sacco gives humanity and dignity to the overlooked victims, as well as providing historical and political context to their struggle. Joe Sacco also brilliantly interweaves himself into the comic frames, as he is not just looking in from the outside but revealing from the inside, adding further strength to his work.By far, this is the best treatment of the Middle East conflict that I have read and I guarantee you will not be able to put it down until you get to the last page and then you'll want to start all over again! A keeper to be shared with as many as possible.I commend the publishers for their courageous efforts."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"We have been able to access information on the Israel-Palestine conflict from the media. However, the readily-available information seemed one-sided, with the other side always being branded as the 'evil' side or 'terrorists'. This book shows the conflict from the Palestinian point of view, which is very rare."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"I had to read this book for a course I was taking in a Human Rights/Media course. I wasn't sure at first, never having enjoyed comic books and certainly nervous of the issue at hand. I thought that there was too much to be said, that the conflict was too old and too big to be confined in the pages and drawings of a book.Then I read it.It took all the incorporeal arguements and gave them form. It put the conflict in my face. I saw it. I heard it. I understood it. It made all these foreign places and people REAL, and not so incredibly different than the people I see day to day (despite the huge difference in lifestyles).Furthermore, Sacco's character's attitude is very Western, and he subtly critiques that attitude, but also shows how it is mostly the product of ignorance. (which may not sound so nice, but which truly helped me identify with that character and in so doing, be just as transformed by the end of the book as that character was.)For those who are interested in Ireland and its struggles - you will be shocked to hear that a very similar struggle is going on now, and in the Middle East.Sacco spoke to all facets of Palestinian society, and created a chilling and unforgetable image of what life could be like - what it is like, for Palestinians. He didn't sympathize excessively with the Palestinians - he allows room for the reader to look at the news and fit what is there into the picture, and see many sides of the Palestinians. And though the view of the Israelis is harsh, it modifies toward the end of the book when he realizes how much he has changed (how he views things the way Palestinians do), and spends time talking with 2 Israeli women, bringing their voices into the book.Read it - you will never forget it. It will change you and make you better. It will help you understand what is happening over there."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Three-and-a-half stars, actually.I enjoyed Joe Sacco's books on the war in Bosnia, and picked up Palestine with interest. This book is the collected edition of his nine Palestine comicsFirst off, Sacco is a great storyteller who is quite expert at expressing the humanity of the people in his stories. He also presents an excellent picture of the daily life of Palestinians, giving them a human face that is not often portrayed in the West. Sacco allows the people to tell the story themselves, rather than interjecting his thoughts and opinions more than is necessary.However, on the other hand, I found Palestine to be more tedious than Sacco's Bosnian work. The stories often became repetitive, and I found the same points being made again and again. In the book's defense, what else would one expect from people who live such a limited life? As well, why should someone's suffering be entertaining? On the other hand, I feel that the message being conveyed is lost if the reader's interest lags.As for the issue that always seems to come up in negative reviews, I have to admit that I did find the book a little one-sided. I do feel that the Palestinians are more wronged in the conflict, but the way Sacco presented the situation did more to solely present the Palestinian side rather than achieve greater understanding. However, while some may feel this is wrong or even anti-Semitic (A ridiculous charge) I feel that it is completely necessary. How can you understand and begin to resolve anything if you don't hear all points of view? I think that anyone interested in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict should read Sacco's book because it is one of the best ways to understand the emotions and perspectives of the Palestinians. You can disagree with it, but you can't dismiss or ignore it."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"This book is seriously flawed in that it doesn't show the Israeli side of events, but Joe Sacco openly admits that he's showing a certain point of view from his personal experience and makes no apologies.As such I have to say this is a terrific piece of art and opinion-journalism from a major talent. Joe builds a whole world that is utterly foreign and unknown to the American mentality. It's an eye - opener, even knowing that the story is larger than Joe's deft and expert snapshot of these lives. Another part of the story is about poverty, which is endemic in Arab middle east and not always related to the occupation, but there's still a lot going on here.Surely the Palestinians are a suffering tribe.. To other countries they're all tainted as potential terrorists or troublemakers.. They can't even leave, even if they wanted to. The world has conspired against them and now they're swallowed up into events they cannot control. Nothing I say makes any difference, but surely young people who are born into this mess are blameless and deserve a better life. I hope things improve.Sacco's art is very stylized. The people are not beautiful and take a little getting used to. I'm more interested in other details, such as 'camera' angles, attention to fine detail, continuity, emotional expression and so on. On these measures Joe has a rare gift. I enjoyed the book & look forward to picking up his other work sometime."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Joe Sacco is as good an artist as anyone drawing graphic novels today. What sets him apart is that his novels are not novels: they're journalism, accounts of his travels into grim and unhappy places. Elsewhere he has visited war zones. Here he visits Palestinian refugee camps. He records a series of Palestinians' points of view, doing what he can to portray what they tell him, and portraying what he sees himself.The book has to work against a perpetual weight of monotony, which Sacco describes as one of the most depressing qualities of life in the camps. As a spectator who can go in and out, he is aware of his special status, but in both text and drawing he comes forth as a modest guy who just happens to draw exceedingly well, and who, lucky for us, has the courage to put himself in places most of us would dread to enter.Sacco is especially good at drawing scenes. He is master of his medium, using panels of varying sizes to keep the eye moving, or to arrest it with a telling detail or complex panorama. But even better than that, he is marvelous at making human connections, and presenting them with a matter-of-factness that persuades as deeply as any drama can. The book pulsates with all kinds of feeling: fear, hope, anger, suspicion, sorrow, friendship, and more than a little love.A welcome feature of this edition is its description of Sacco's working methods, particularly his use of photographs."},{"Title":"Palestine","review":"Too much coverage of the Israeli-Palestine conflict limits itself to the (almost boring by now) daily Ruters action-reaction of militant activity and IDF reprisal. Forgotten is the fact that millions of regular, normal human beings have to endure occupation in the name of nationalism and religion, backed by military might.Joe Sacco shows us that there are Palestinian men, women, teenagers, grandmothers, farmers, cab drivers, fruit sellers, and many, many other HUMANS that suffer quietly behind fences, tanks, bars, blindfolds in the face of overwhelming military might. His entire mission is to listen to stories of occupation, and he devotes many pages to stories that will make your skin crawl. He'll remind you that most Palestinian men have been to an Israeli prison, most Palestinian men have been beaten, many Palestinian men have endured torture, and that most Palestinians endure humiliation on a daily basis.If you do pick up this book (and you should), I'd urge you to keep in mind the whole time you're reading it that it takes place over a decade ago. Try and imagine if innocent lives have changed for the better. Remind yourself that mass punishment of an entire people is a war crime. Above all, remember that millions of Palestinians are not all suicide bombers as we are led to believe in the media, and those innocents caught up do in fact have aspirations of education, travel, love and freedom.And then the bulldozers came."},{"Title":"Mathematics Core Course for a Level","review":"This was a core text for many British A-Level Mathematics students. It is a well written and easy to follow text book. The major flaw in an otherwise super text is that it has several typos and the occasional incorrect answer to self-test questions. These errors can hinder a student's understanding of a concept.However, over a decade and a half after completing my A-level studies I still refer to this text when helping students grasp pure math concepts."},{"Title":"Mathematics Core Course for a Level","review":"Well, A-level is for High School, not really for college level. I agree with Adel Douba that the book doesn't point out necessary information, but most of the college text books in US never mention what you have pointed out! Hey, for high school, it is a pretty good book, don't you agree? You don't see any high school book mentions anything about log(-8)[base -2] has no meaning, neither any of them mentions the unequality of a with 1. This is for college level!!! Again, A-level is just for Grade 9-12 in most of the other countries."},{"Title":"Mathematics Core Course for a Level","review":"This text was a great asset coming out of high-school level maths and entering into college-level calculus. It covers necessary previous topics briefly and efficiently, providing an excellent reference in case you forget something or skipped it in your previous studies. The examples are useful and to the point; sections are brief and incredibly effective. This book has a more complete overview of algebra, trig, and calculus than my entire high-school education. It's very easy to look up a subject and quickly understand it, which is essential when working through multi-faceted problems later. There are several problems in the text which have inaccurate solutions, but that's fairly minor for the vast resource this book has been to me. This was my father's A-level book (in England) and I'm proud to say that it's now finding use once again.Most college texts are $200. For $1? Buy it! I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Mathematics Core Course for a Level","review":"Item was in great condition, almost as good as a brand new book. Great value for money.Totally satisfied with the purchase.Thumbs up."},{"Title":"Mathematics Core Course for a Level","review":"Why philosophizing? Exercise 10 page 503 tells you that three vectors a, b, and c are such that no two of which are equal and all are different from the zero vector. In part (b) it gives you the further condition that (a.b)c = (b.c)a(the . signifies the dot product of vectors), then it asks you to &quot;show that c and a are parallel&quot;. Obviously this is absurd as the following counterexample amply testifies:take a, b, c to be respectively the i, j, k.Notice here that i, j, and k are mutually different and none is the zero vector as required. Also, a.b = i.j = 0 , and b.c = j.k = 0 and consequently (a.b)c = (b.c)a = 0 , yet c and a are not parallel being k and i which are rather perpendicular. WHAT a SHAME !!!On page 27 the authors &quot;define&quot; the logarithm in the following way:log b (base a) = c &lt;==&gt; b = a to the power of c and nothing is mentioned about the positivity of a and b and the unequality of a with 1, niether in the body of the definition nor in the preceding discussion, nor afterwards.We all know that -2 to the power of 3 is -8, but we also know that log -8 (base -2) has no meaning!!

Somehow, John Peatman has pulled it off, producing a book that is complete and detailed in every way. He completely describes the new, juicy, full-featured PIC18F452 and does it well. Two years ago, I wrote a disparaging review of Peatman's \\"Design With Pic Microcontrollers,\\" feeling it was sketchy and lacking examples. Now, in \\"Embedded Design,\\" he has produced a clear, well-written and complete package. Each chapter has a nice set of problems at the end, for those who will use it as a text. Appendices describe an inexpensive demo board and free debugging software. He shows you what to buy to set up a development lab and how to use it. .... If you want to buy one book that contains everything you need to learn about PIC chips, buy this one!"},{"Title":"Embedded Design with the PIC18F452","review":"Although some material in the book can be read from spec sheets found on the net, the book really helps to sort through a lot of the clutter in spec sheets. A major benefit of this book is that it provides plenty of detailed illustrations to help you understand the facilities of the PIC instead of simply giving you page after page of techical specs. It also provides plenty of &quot;template&quot; code to help you get up and running if you're kind of new to microcontroller assembly.If you do the sample projects throughout the book, they really help you better understand most of the facilities of the PIC.One thing to note is that the book is written for a semester long college course though I think it's doable for self-study if you have at least some background with PICs. It even provides a PCB on the back cover whereby you can build your own board (I think you can order a package from digikey that has all the parts you need to build one) to run your code on."},{"Title":"Embedded Design with the PIC18F452","review":"John's book is a great follow on to his original book, \\"Design with PIC Microcontrollers. The book is not a cut and paste solution (As are two other good books \\"Easy PIC'n\\" and \\"PIC'n Up The Pace\\") and is intended to teach the student how to best use the architecture. The intent of the book is to give the student enough theory to use the PIC18F452 and understand the design philosophy of the architecture. The book is a great compliment to the Microchip datasheet service as a \\"user's guide\\". Great examples of how the 18F452 architecture can be best utilized, well organized diagrams (Which, by the way do not require \\"flicking back and forth\\" any more that a typical technical book I've read ). The subject material covers all of the highlights of the PIC18F452, giving examples for typical usages of LCD displays, A/D, Interrupts, I/O pin considerations, timers, math subroutines, I2C/SMBus usage, UART, etc. There are supporting code template designed to suggest possible code organization. The book develops a very useful utility (SASM) to preprocess PIC assembly in an attempt to make assembly language more structured. The utility IS NOT required and the rest of the book may be read without using the utility. I had no problem obtaining the components for the included circuit board (All required parts can be purchased as a kit from Digi-Key at a discount) and found it very comparable to Microchip's own demo boards."},{"Title":"Embedded Design with the PIC18F452","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to the PIC18F452 microcontroller.

Live many of Shute's books the feelings he invokes are beautiful and powerful, all coming from rather controlled, unemotional characters. \\"The Rainbow and the Rose\\" is about lives twined and brought around in a full-circle effect. There are no surprises in the plot, but there doesn't need to be. It works even as you know what's coming. There is a great deal of detail on flying and airplanes that may or may not appeal to you--I enjoyed it. Shute writes those sorts of technical details very smoothly so they integrate into the characters' traits. Not Shute's best novel, but decidedly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Rainbow And The Rose","review":"I read The Rainbow and The Rose , along with most of Nevil Shute's novels, many years ago. Interestingly, I've never read On The Beach. I have, however, recently begun buying copies of Shute's novels for rereading. I wish to see if my sixty year old personna interprets them differently than I did as an eighteen year old.At the time I first read The Rainbow and The Rose, I thought it as good as A Town Like Alice. I could not wait for Ron Clarke to become airborne once again, as he made his way across Australia, so that he would continue to experience the visions that were some sort of gift to help him sort out his feelings toward the woman he once loved and the man who'd won her heart so many years ago.I thought back then, and I think today that the book would make a wonderful movie, if done correctly and with the right people.I urge anyone with even a passing interest in Shute's work to read The Rainbow and The Rose."},{"Title":"The Rainbow And The Rose","review":"This novel has a somber tone to it as it tells the life of a pioneer aviator. Much of the story is told in dream sequences as the lead character, an Australian airline pilot, tries to fly a mercy mission to evacuate or deliver a doctor to treat his old friend who has crashed on a similar mercy mission. Johnny Pascoe was a World War I fighter pilot and, after the war, works as a flying instructor for a small flying club in England. During the war, he marries a beautiful girl and she has a child while he is off at war. When he comes back, she has an offer to go to Hollywood as an actress and she divorces him taking their daughter to America. While working as a flying instructor, he meets another beautiful woman who is married to a wealthy man who is confined to a mental hospital. She learns to fly and they slowly fall in love. Eventually, they decide to marry if she can convince her husband to divorce her. She become pregnant but the husband balks at the divorce and she goes to France to have the baby. Eventually, she becomes distraught at the stalemate with the husband who has escaped from the mental hospital and her inability to reconcile the circumstances with her sense of duty. She crashes her plane committing suicide.Johnny Pascoe then leaves for India and becomes an airline pilot for the next 30 years. At the time of the story, he is nearing retirement and he meets a stewardess who has become his senior stewardess on his regular flight. They become quite close and eventually he learns a shocking secret. The story is somber but like several others of Shute's novels is a pleasure to read. It resembles \\"In the Wet\\" in its dream sequences in which the story is told. It resembles \\"Requiem for a Wren\\" in the somber tone of the story. There is similarity to \\"Pastoral\\" in the flying sequences. It is an outstanding example of Shute at his best."},{"Title":"The Rainbow And The Rose","review":"Wonderful to read this book again.

It's a lovely volume, and has plenty of dramatic and artsy images to show off to your friends who ask &quot;What the heck is this Burning Man thing?&quot;What's missing however, are many aspects of individual challenge and participation that are central to life on the Playa. The Camps, the communities, the building and the clean up, and the daily life issues we all face living on a blank canvas in the desert are largely ignored in favor of the art aspect of the event. There are very few images of the Burn, the moment of release, and that makes it feel incomplete.Now, don't get me wrong! This is a lovely book, well-photograped and well-made, it just feels to me more like a slick representation rather than an access point to the whole event.

I was opposed to its existance purely on principal. \\"Wired is trying to make money off of Burning Man,\\" I thought, incredulous. And the Burning Man people actually approved!

Flipping through the book, there seems to be a good representative sampling of Black Rock City culture circa 1990-1996: Clich&eacute;d images of naked, painted bodies dancing. That goddamned Java Cow. Art cars. Colorfully-costumed participants. Moody black-and-whites of the Man. The usual pics of naked people caked with mud. It's even presented in somewhat of an order, with all the daytime images slowly leading into photos taken at dusk. Then there's the requisite sixteen pages of editorial pontificating, before heading off into the book's \\"climax,\\" which mirrors the climax of the event itself with its final eighteen photos all taken during Burn night.The images, for the most part, are stunning--although anyone can tell you that it seems damn near impossible to take a bad photo out on the playa. I especially liked Barbara Traub's very artful, often-posed, black-and-whites. Instead of merely documenting the event, she seems to use the playa as her own photography studio, producing incredibly unique images.As for the editorial content, it makes for a good, hour-long read. Naturally, everyone tries to explain what Burning Man is, without ever really nailing it down. Such is the nature of the event. Larry Harvey spells it all out in his oral history of Burning Man. Bruce Sterling describes his family's vacation at Burning Man, in his hysterical, and ultimately heartwarming piece, \\"Variation On a Theme Park (Taking the Kids to Burning Man)\\" Erik Davis' \\"Here is Post-Modern Space\\" is alternately intellectual jabbering and snarky commentary. But far and away my favorite piece was \\"Me, I Didn't Burn A Thing,\\" a refreshingly different perspective of Burning Man from Janelle Brown. She tells it like it is, writing: \\"I'm stuck in a limbo-land of exhaustion: I can't sleep because I've hardly moved all day, and I can't move because I've hardly slept. I lie in the eerie blue shade of our plastic tarpualin in a semi-lucid state, spray bottle in one hand, gin and tonic in the other.\\" That is so it.While certainly it's a great conversation piece for suckering in friends to go out with you to Burning Man next year, the biggest reason I like the book is because it functions as sort of a high school yearbook for all the freaks who went to Burning Man in the early to mid '90s."},{"Title":"Burning Man (Hardwired)","review":"I've been to the event-- first as a citizen and later as part of the volunteer labor force, and I own this book. It's true (as other reviewers have stated) it is not &quot;complete&quot;-- in the sense that its focus is primarily visual. (There is so much more to Burning Man!) But it does a marvelous job with those visuals! Each page turned elicits one of the following thoughts: &quot;Gad! I didn't see that! How could I possibly have missed that?&quot; or something like &quot;Ahhhh, I remember that evening on the Promenade-- and how mysterious the light was...&quot;The reader who found the images too &quot;extreme,&quot; &quot;surreal,&quot; and &quot;fringe&quot; has not been there-- or he/she forgot to look around, because this is what you will see if you venture out of your tent...

Go ahead, whet your appetite..."},{"Title":"Burning Man (Hardwired)","review":"Perhaps because I had such high hopes for this book, I was rather underwhelmed when I finally saw it. There are some nice individual photos and it's good to have all the essays in one place, but taken as a whole it's less than stellar. I think another reviewer was on-target by pointing out the problems with the layout and presentation -- it tends to detract from the actual content.Still, it's nice to have on hand when people ask you &quot;what's that Burning Man thing you went to?&quot;"},{"Title":"Burning Man (Hardwired)","review":"I love owning this book. I love showing it to friends who want to know more about Burning Man. Although you can never understand the event until you experience it, it is great to have such a beautiful book filled with such compelling images. I really enjoyed the essays as well. How each person found something different at Burning Man is the heart of the whole festival. Now is a great time of year to look at the book to get yourself psyched for the big event at the end of August. See you there!"},{"Title":"Burning Man (Hardwired)","review":"The pictures are good but the layout looks more like 1960's Life magazine.

In doing so he presents one of the clearest and most even handed views of pilgrimage and these shrines that I have ever read. He gives the history for each place, which includes Lourdes, Chartres, and Fatima. We then share his experiences in current day surroundings and see the many types of pilgrims that also are at these shrines. Atheist or not, Ward has an excellent understanding of the Catholic Church's view and is more open minded in many cases than some Catholics I know. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On The Way Home","review":"(...)In 1990 Anne Fishbein traveled to the Russian city of Yaroslavl, northeast of Moscow along the Volga river, to work as a still photographer on an independent film. What began as a mere short term assignment proved a major inspiration for the artist, as she returned every year to photograph the city and its inhabitants. Now, 10 visits and 13 years later we have the marvelous fruits of her labors in On the Way Home (Perceval Press, 2003), a handsome volume of more than fifty black and white photographs culled from this project.The photographs are imbued with a sense of wonder and discovery. They document a Russian city's awakening from the slumber of seven decades of relative isolation to a modern world that has come to visit, this time in the form of an artist and her camera. The varied subjects of Fishbein's pictures, nurses in a hospital, bakers, children in fields, soldiers on guard, a bride and groom in a park, often stand motionless, absorbed in a contemplative stillness. They gaze calmly and intently at each other and the viewer, just as the artist's penetrating eye focuses patiently on them. Her subjects seem fully at ease with themselves, and the artist's unusual presence within their environment, even for not appearing to know the world she has come from. Unafraid of the camera without being unsophisticated, they are at once innocent and self possessed.Fishbein's photographs are not intended as journalistic efforts, specific to both a time and a location, as are most bodies of documentary work made after the fall of the Soviet Union. These photographs are rather the timeless story of a culture which seems of another century to us in the West. The pictures reach past the city limits, and come to signify a larger sense of place. Together they form a harmony of voices that we Westerners do not recognize, have not heard. Somehow we name it as Russia, and simply because Fishbein has told us with conviction that this is not merely a locale, or a decade, but an entire world that she has witnessed. They also remember how that older world was photographed. There are resonant echoes, for example, of August Sander, who encyclopedically chronicled the faces of German society as it transformed in between the two World Wars, as well as of more recent artists, such as Diane Arbus.It is in this more vague, mysterious depiction of a people that the pictures display their greatest strength. Portraiture can often seem iconic and static, devoid of a sense of action and time; subjects are isolated and uprooted, deprived of a context. Anne Fishbein's photographs instead infuse the genre with a sense of epic; they make manifest her desire to record a sense of history. It is precisely her subjects' lack of movement, their dreamlike gaze that belies not only who they are, but also where they have come from. Their enveloping silence speaks of a long, rich and melancholy journey, its precise details unknown, but its existence palpably felt nonetheless. Their stillness is larger, and their tranquil stare longer than what we know in our world, one comprised more of short and fleeting moments. Their simplicity and tender composure, no longer familiar to most of us, appear almost monumental.The photographs are a record of the meeting of two realities. One is the modern world of the American artist, which thrives on shedding its past, but ultimately comes to look yearningly across to this older place that refuses, or perhaps is unable to abandon its history. As a tool of modernity, the photograph lives in a world where continuity has been broken, and searches instead for what has somehow remained whole. Photography such as that of Anne Fishbein seeks a past that is still alive, often in order to take its confession before it dies.The encounter is to some extent autobiographical. Fishbein is of Lithuanian extraction, and although her connection to her geographical roots had been heavily filtered through several generations of immigration, her travels to Russia allowed her to rediscover and reinterpret the world of her ancestors. Memory and invention have fused in her travels towards these people, which are a journey towards a sense of home and origin.The book is beautifully designed and printed. The two introductions both provide thoughtful context for the work. Otherwise it is a purely visually driven narrative, one which lets the photographs alone explain, or merely suggest. There is not so much as a page number to distract one from the forceful, wordless logic of the images. The book is the perfect expression of her utmost dedication to the medium at the expense of any notion of profit or other form of self advancement.Anne Fishbein graduated from Exeter in 1976, and went on to Northwestern for her BA, and then Yale for her MFA in photography. Her work is in the permanent collections of major museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, and the National Museum in Ottawa, Canada. In 1994 a portion of this work was exhibited at the Academy in the Lamont Gallery. She currently lives and works in Los Angeles, dividing her time between a variety of documentary, editorial and teaching pursuits."},{"Title":"On The Way Home","review":"Certain places in the world call out to the soul, and keep a person fascinated by the atmosphere and people. And something in the Russian city of Yaroslavl called out to Anna Fishbein, whose yearly visits to that place are chronicled in the quietly poignant &quot;On the Way Home.&quot;In 1990, Anna Fishbein made her first visit to Yaroslavl, while doing photographic work on an indie movie. In the years since then, she has returned to photograph the people and places of Yaroslavl -- jaded children with cigarettes in their mouths, newlyweds standing quietly beside one another, workers and businessmen caught during quiet moments on leafy streets.Looking at the photos of &quot;On the Way Home&quot; is like watching a sleeping giant slowly coming back to wakefulness. And not just in Yaroslavl either -- you get the feeling of timeless unity in her pictures, as if you could see these people anywhere in Russia, anywhere in time. Maybe even anywhere in the world, if that part of the world was slowly rising from its own ashes.The simple black-and-white photos have a sort of solid, quiet appeal. They're a little too gritty to be really beautiful, but instead they have a sort of peace ingrained in each picture. The people in them tend to appear solemn and calm, usually thoughtful; they stand on leafy streets, in parks, hospitals, and other ordinary places. They quietly look at the camera, or at each other, without ever looking self-conscious.Quiet and introspective, &quot;On the Way Home&quot; lets us have a peek at the people of Yaroslavl through Anna Fishbein's eyes. The latest of Perceval Press's excellent books is definitely worth a look."},{"Title":"Only Dad","review":"This is a delightful story about a father and daughter attempting to overcome their grief after the loss of a loved one. Tom Drummond and his daughter, Tally, seemed to have it all until their family holiday in Tuscany when they were touched by tragedy. From the heights of joy and contentment they were plunged, disbelieving into a world of shock and deep depression. They then have to help each other pull themselves out again and get their lives back to normal somehow.Alan Titchmarsh presents a wonderful story that can almost be termed a fairy tale. It provides the reader an opportunity to almost completely escape into his world as the story unfolds around you. As you would expect from the presenter of Gardener's World and Ground Force, he adds a smattering of gardening references extolling the virtues of enjoying a nice garden. The main character, Tom, even erects a garden shed, a la Ground Force (although it takes him 3 days and not the requisite 2).For pure entertainment and escapism value, this is a nice story that gives the reader a feeling of contentment upon finishing."},{"Title":"Only Dad","review":"I bought this book because the author is so engaging on the television and his comments are often close to poetry. I did not expect to have the story sneak up on me so that when the crisis came, I burst into tears and had to put the book down for a while. More importantly, as Tom Drummond and his daughter, Tally, work through their grief and rebuild their lives, I was lifted out of my surrogate grief and could really enjoy how their lives became rebuilt. If you like ordinary people conquering extraordinary challenges by means of ordinary steadfastness and decency, you will enjoy Only Dad. It is enjoyable to be surprised with literary power from a book you only expected to provide a pleasant diversion. Some may think this book lacks drama and action, but the drama of the heart and the actions of love drive this masterful character study."},{"Title":"Only Dad","review":"shortly after their tragic return from Italy. The set-up just didn't get me interested; it seemed, at times, too Harlequin-esque (UK: Mills & Boon). The new sous-chef seemed quite interesting, but I didn't care enough about Tom and Tally to carry on. I give these comments not to dissuade folks from reading the book, but to let others who find it rough going know they weren't the only ones."},{"Title":"Lavender and Old Lace.","review":"Although the book was in good condition, it did not look like the picture of the book shown. Instead of beige and brown binding, it was in lavender. So for buyers who buy for the aesthetics as well as the literary content, this should be a warning. I think 1 or 2 pages were missing, but overall this was a fair purchase."},{"Title":"Soul of the Fire (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I have been an avid fantasy reader for many years. I started with J. R. R. Tolkein, progressed to Terry Brooks, Madeline L'Engle, Stephen Donaldson, David Eddings, and Robert Jordan. I voraciously read Terry Goodkind's Soul of the Fire, and was thouroughly pleased with the outcome. The book enhances what we have learned in the rest of the series as well as increasing the play of other characters in the story. This series has many facets in the fight of good versus evil, and shows us that just because you have cleaned house, doesn't mean you have taken out the garbage. In this book Richard is learning more of how to use his powers, and we are learning more about the Dreamwalker. Mr. Goodkind's plot, storyline and readabilty are incredible. I read one customer review that said that this series was a takeoff of Tolkein and many other fantasy stories. In my opinion, if you look back at all of them, they all have the same basic plot. Good vs. Evil. It is how the writer brings this battle to light that captures our attention and keeps us reading. I await Mr. Goodkind's next book with bated breath. Please write faster."},{"Title":"Soul of the Fire (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book was a little dissapointing from the previous 4, It does enlarge the understanding of how the Midlands and its people think and feel, but I felt that these things could have been explained during the story told of Richard and Kahlen, instead of the reverse. The story is about political intrigue and one of the small nations of the Midlands with a secret power not quite understood. It is the first real battleground in the New World fought between Jagang and Richard, through diplomacy and intrigue."},{"Title":"Soul of the Fire (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I've read 6 of the SoT books. And I've enjoyed all of them, some more and some less, but Soul of the Fire had to be the worst out of all of them. It still goes at a fast pace, and it is bearable to read (though some would disagree) but compared to the rest of his series its pretty bad.I agree with an earlier comment, that he leaves out all the characters we fell in love with in the past; like, Gratch, Verna, Warren, Nathan (my favorite), Scarlet, etc. He spends way too much time building up characters you end up hating and end up dying needless deaths that serve no purpose to the overall plot. Basically, if they weren't really in the story it wouldn't have changed it much. The story could have been told in 200 pages rather than his 500 pages. It just feels like Goodkind needed something to write, and to write fast and it just sort of all was sloppily put together. Certain scenes are funny though, like when Cara is around. But overall, you should read it if you want to continue the series. If you want an awesome book, I would suggest looking elsewhere. I'm a Goodkind fan, but what did Terry do with this book?!Paul"},{"Title":"Soul of the Fire (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"&quot;Soul of Fire&quot; was an interesting read. Richard, Khalan, and Zed are back, and are finally reuinited with eachother. Although Goodkind showed his usual inventive imagination about Richard Cypher's ever-growing abilities, this chapter in the &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; saga lacked in areas. There is too, much enfacise on the book's new characters and not enough on the heros. When is he going to deal with the Imperial Army? Jagang, the chief nemesis of both the &quot;New World&quot; and the &quot;Old World&quot; has not been given proper time again. In summary: It was a very interesting book. It's well written and has enough information to keep the die-hard &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; fans involved in the adventure. As compared to the first three books, &quot;Soul of Fire&quot; lacks certain elements. It is about as good as &quot;Temple of Winds&quot;. It is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Soul of the Fire (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"After reading _Temple of the Winds_ I was really looking forward to reading the next installment of Goodkind's Sword of Truth series. What I read was as exciting as watching the grass grow. In all of his previous books there was magic, maniacs, and mayhem, but with _Soul of the Fire_ it gets completly boring with all of the politcal jumble and what not. The most boring part was the story of Beata. He (Goodkind) could have filled up the empty space with something more attractive to the senses. I definatly hope that the next book will be much better than its predecessor."},{"Title":"Soul of the Fire (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"While enjoyable and well written, I found this book to be sub-standard for Goodkind. He devotes too much time to peripheral characters that end up doing nothing in the end, and the majority of the plot is incredibly predictable. There is no real development of the main characters in this one. Still, it makes for some light, entertaining reading."},{"Title":"Soul of the Fire (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Another great book to add to the series, but after just finishing George R.R.

Terry Goodkind is indeed a talented author. The Audio Version brings true light to each character with distint personalities so that you become truly invovled in each series that he has written. The &quot;Truth Series&quot; has been great. You will cheer Richard Kahl and the Mother Confessor and will look forward to the next adventure that Terry Goodkind has in mind for the two.

Hopefully it is in progress."},{"Title":"Soul of the Fire (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Until about one and a half years ago, I had never even heard of Terry Goodkind, then my sister-in-law introduced me to his first book, Wizard's First Rule, and from there on I was hooked, Each book kept getting better and better and ever since I read the fifth, I have been looking forward to another, which I now here is on it's way. The only word that comes to mind to describe Terry Goodkind is Genius. It is rare to see the ammount of detail put into a book that he manages to. His characters act like real people instead of archetypical characters found in most other books. The saga has been one continous story since the beginning, instead of being broken up into seperate stories, which makes for a much more captivating story. I cannot reccomend this book enough for any fan of fantasy, or even if you're not a fan of fantasy books, this is definitely a good book to look at."},{"Title":"Soul of the Fire (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I am sure the book is wonderful, however the reader Buck Schirner is the worst audio book reader I have ever heard.

A friend of mine and I have often compared the pros and cons of both authors. In some ways I like Goodkind better, in some Jordan. I feel more of a companionship with Goodkind's characters (I've only cried once for a bad situation in Jordan's series, of which I have read all 8 of the books that are currently out but I've cried countless times in Goodkind's). He has excellent character development and an intriguing plotline that keeps me wanting more but Jordan has an incredibly intriguing plotline as well. Normally, when a story drags on and on like a soap opera I get irritated and impatient but with Jordan it's different. He keeps me constantly intrigued and hungry for his next novel. Goodkind keeps me wanting more in a different way. I'm more patient with the next book in Goodkind's series (I guess b/c sometimes they actually work as stand-alones, whereas Jordan's do not by any means) but with Jordan I'm ravenous for his next book.

Approaching an important perspective of his philosophy, if we can say that.But it deceived, the book is not well structured. It is just divided into three parts.1-Rational and Will-Based Metaphysics2-Existencial Metaphysics3-Postmetaphysical PhilosophyThe author is repetitive about his conclusions, and does not worry about ordinary readers.The entire book follows Philosopher, Commentator and Krishnamurti statements.Besides that the book is inexpensive and missed important references about early works about J.Krishnamurti Philosophy, the author should have considered at least&quot;Philosophy of J.Krishnamurti: A sytematic Study&quot; from R.K.Shringy or&quot;Insight and Religious Mind:An Analysis of Krishnamurti's Thought from Hillary RodriguesJ.Krishnamurti Philosophy is very important nowadays, his wisdom contains the entire humanity wisdom, naked from cultural aspects or divisions. And his metaphysics is easily seem in his main statement from the core of the teachings:'Truth is a Pathless Land'. Man cannot come to it through any organization, through any creed, through any dogma, priest or ritual, not through any philosophic knowledge or psychological technique.Note: He made a distinction between the Truth and Reality. Reality is world as it appears to be, usually perceived by thought. Truth is the world as it really is, independent of thought.So J.Krishnamurti warns again about knowledge approach, as a long time ago did Pythagoras. That is why people were initiated, to not to take a wrong path. Historically we observe that the main direction of modern philosophy has been knowledge, which is epistemology. And maybe this a result that Western Philosophy always tried to dissociated of the Eastern Philosophy or wisdom, thing that even the greeks have not discarted. Even though philosophers nowadays talk about metaphysics, they do not risk to approach truth, here it is where J.Krishnamurti comes in to rescue that, by negative approach:&quot;Total negation is the essence of the positive. When there is negation of all those things that thought has brought about psychologically, only then is there love, which is compassion and intelligence&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","review":"The Bungalow Mystery by Carolyn Keene was a well-written book. It is a good length considering the plot, one hundred and eighty pages. However, there was a lot packed into the last twenty pages. The author described the setting very well. It is summer in River Height and Twin Lakes. The confict of the story was defiantly Person vs. Person. (For Example, Laura vs. Aborns, Nancy vs. Suspects, Nancy vs. Aborns) Nancy always finds herself in a conflict with someone, or something.There were many characters, but I think the two main characters were Nancy Drew and Laura Pendleton. Nancy Drew is a teenage detective, who has strawberry-blonde hair. She was on vacation with her friend Helen Corning, when they decided to got on their boat on Twin Lakes. Then a big, nasty storm came and they start yelling, \\"Help!\\" A nice girl named Laura Pendleton comes to the rescue. Laura is an orphan and could not let them die because she knew how it felt to have someone who she cared about die. Laura told them about her new guardians, the Aborns. Nancy knew them and told Laura that they were very nice people. However, later on in the book Laura does not think that they are so nice. Therefore, she runs away from them and finds Nancy. Nancy lets her stay in her house in River Heights so she and her mom's jewels were safe. Nancy decides to investigate. Nevertheless, if you want to know the twist to the story, you have to read. Many surprises await you.In every book, there are always more than on message. However, it is always hard to choose the most important on. In this book, the most important message is if you help a friend, they will always help you when you are in need of it. I highly recommend that you read, The Bungalow Mystery By: Carolyn Keene."},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","review":"As a student in middle school, one of our first assignments was to read \\"The Bungalow Mystery\\". When we were given the assignment, I primarily thought it was a book for girls. I also had the impression that it might be below my reading level, until I found myself looking up words I did not understand. From the very first sentence, I was hooked and enjoyed it until I finished, even though there were a few slow moving parts. Because this was the first Nancy Drew Mystery I ever read, I didn't understand some of the allusions the characters were referring to in previous books.

The book is about how Miss Nancy is going to right the wrong as she untangles the numerous machinations of the villains--in this case, the Dowds. There is considerable melodrama but that only adds to the excitement--each chapter ending with a cliffhanger.

It shows her desire to help those in need, and resourcefulness in hunting down criminals, more than her attorney father had. Nancy was justified in being suspicious of Laua Pendelton's supposed guardian, though Laura said that Jacob Aborn and Mrs. Pendleton, who had died recently, were schoolmates. When Laura ran away (and helped Nancy move a downed tree so they could get to River Heights), she told Nancy how mean Jacob Aborn had been. Nancy's investigation started NOT at the bungalow on Melrose Lake but at a deserted shack; she learned, after she had sneaked into Laura's legal residence, that Laura had come under control of a professional crook who called himself Stumpy-- a gangsterly name if ever there were one! When he went to sleep, she returned to the abandoned shack and found the REAL Jacob Aborn chained and half-starved!

It kept you interested and it makes you wonder what will happen to the bad guys in the end. It a good series if you want a light read series. Sure the series is about or around forty books, but from I know they are all about 180 pages. I can read one of these books in a couple of hours. They may not be long, but the author definitely did not waste any page space by boring you with unnecessary details.

I ended up not reading every day because I couldn't seem to get into it. Towards the end, like most Nancy Drew books, I got into it and finished it.In this one, Nancy and her friend, Helen Corning, go on a vacation and go on a motorboat ride. A terrible storm comes and wrecks their boat. They almost die when a sixteen year old girl saves them. Her name is Laura and she's an orphan. Her new guardians are mean to her and instantly try to get her jewels. Laura escapes from them and goes to Nancy's house and stays with Hannah while Nancy tries to help her. Towards the end, this book gets way better!"},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","review":"This review concerns the original 1930 edition and the revised 1960 edition which follows a similar plot to the original, with a few changes. Nancy becomes friends with an orphaned girl named Laura when she rescues Nancy and her friend Helen after their motorboat sinks during a violent storm. Upon meeting Laura's new gaurdian, Nancy immediately dislikes him. After Laura runs away from him, Nancy's suspicions of him are aroused even more. Nancy goes to confront the man only to discover that Laura's gaurdian is not who he seems to be. It's unfortunate that this book has the title that it does because I imagine that very few people were enticed to read the book based on its title. Those that passed over this book missed a very interesting and original story for either this series or the Hardy Boys. The book is very well-written (the original version, anyway) and from chapter 10 onwards is hard to put down. Something that I particularly liked about this book was that Nancy actively had a hand in capturing the criminal (criminals in the revised edition). Don't passover reading this book because of its blah title. I believe that most people who read this book will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","review":"You'll love this book!

The book kicks into action around page 70 and is non-stop suspense from there on. Its actually one of the few books that has a good mystery in the story and the cliff hangers at the end of each chapter are well thought out. In my opinion most of the Nancy Drew books were awful. The set is over rated. Of the original 56 books, about 25 of them are good. Half the set. This ranks in at #2 with me."},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","review":"Originally written by Mildred Wirt Benson from outlines by Edward Stratemeyer, the Nancy Drew series was first published in 1930s. THE BUNGALOW MYSTERY was the third book in the series, and it and those that followed presented its heroine as a rich, headstrong, and distinctly reckless teenager who sometimes carried a pistol and who wasn't above breaking the law when it suited her purposes.As the series progressed and other writers began to generate Nancy Drew novels, the character changed and Nancy was \\"toned down;\\" instead of flatly rich, she became reasonably affluent; recklessness was replaced by commonsense caution; and while she might be willing to bend the law a bit she would never knowingly break it. In the 1950s and 1960s the earlier novels were re-written to reflect this change in character.THE BUNGALOW MYSTERY opens with Nancy and friend Helen aboard a small boat--which begins to sink in a sudden storm. Helen is hurt, and although Nancy is a strong swimmer they are soon in danger of their lives. Fortunately, they are rescued by Laura, a recently orphaned teenager who is in the area to meet her new guardians. Nancy soon becomes suspicious of Laura's guardians and determines to investigate the matter; at the same time her father, attorney Carson Drew, is investigating the theift of bonds from a local bank. As is the way of Nancy Drew stories, these two plots soon link, and Nancy finds herself facing a ruthless gang of kidnappers and con artists.The book is very much of its era: you will not find any cell phones, computers, or similar modern gadgets between its covers. Nancy herself is the \\"perfect good girl\\" according to the standards of the day: she tends toward skirts and jackets, wears gloves for social occasion, and is never too busy to whip up a quick luncheon (chicken salad always seems to be a favorite) for family or friends. And she is always prepared, even to the extent of having an overnight bag in the trunk of her car complete with two changes of clothing and a swim suit, just in case!The Nancy Drew books are not great literature by any stretch of the imagination--they are too distinctly formula for that--but they are competently written, literate, and never talk down to their target audience. They are also good \\"comfort reading\\" for grown-ups who recall their childhood reading fondly.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","review":"I read quite a few of the Nancy Drew Mysteries as a child. I have retained only five of those books in my personal library, so I recently decided to start collecting them again and, of course, to re-read them. My mom gave me three this Christmas, one of which was the facsimile edition of the Bungalow Mystery from Applewood Books. This book is somewhat longer than the more common Grosset & Dunlap editions (the yellow hardcover books). Having read reviews on the facsimile editions, I was expecting something quite different than what I was used to. Upon reading the book, I did not find it (the story) to be very much different from the modernized editions. The illustrations, however, are very different and better. The quality of the book is much better, as well. Of the two editions, I would recommend the facsimile over the re-edited versions."},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","review":"See if you can get the \\"Bungalow Mystery\\" in an Applegate edition, which preserves the original language and attitudes of the 30s. The updated versions are fine too, but the originals, although fixed in an earlier period, are remarkable for their descriptive, exact language.Carefully plotted and deftly written, the \\"Bungalow Mystery\\" finds Nancy coming to the aid of a new friend who has rescued her during a storm on the lake near her summer camp. There is the trademark Carolyn Keene blend of exciting situations and Nancy's remarkable resourcefulness. I recommend all the NancyDrew yarns to the girls of my piano studio. Wholesome and winsome, Nancy has aged well, and continues to delight young readers."},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","review":"I am really enjoying reading the original Nancy Drew books that Applewood Publishers has been turning out.The illustrations by Russell Tandy are great!I read the whole series 20 years ago in grade school.Now I'm a teacher and getting a kick out of collecting these books and rereading them!The language from the 30's is hilarious.The language is dated, but a scream to read these books. A real piece of Americana.If you loved these books as a child, reread the originals, they are far superior."},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","review":"This Nancy Drew mystery moves fairly quickly, there is regular action and suspense. It begins with Nancy and her friend Helen boating on a lake when a storm comes up. Their boat strikes a log and quickly sinks. Teenage Laura Pendleton comes to their rescue, saving their lives. Laura is a girl with a problem; her parents have recently died, leaving her a wealthy girl.In the event of such a situation, Laura's parents have arranged for a married couple called the Aborns to be named her guardians. However, when Laura meets them, they turn out to be greedy and conniving people. They treat Laura as a virtual prisoner, steal some of her assets and demand even more. Nancy gets on the case, tracking down the criminals and discovering that the people claiming to be the Aborns are in fact imposters. After several adventures and some time in captivity, Nancy is able to chase down the imposters and their cohorts when they crash a car. The chivalrous Nancy and her group risk danger to rescue the criminals before their car explodes.I grew up reading the Hardy Boys series of adventure books and occasionally amuse myself by rereading them. My particular interest is in how the tone, content and presentation of the stories have changed over time. In a similar vein I occasionally read a book in the Nancy Drew series. This story was originally written in 1930 and was updated for the 1988 publication. While some modernization has been done, this is still essentially a story for the 1930's. Nancy is still extremely curious and intelligent, yet in many ways still a member of what was at that time considered \\"the weaker sex.\\""},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","review":"I read the 1930 version of this book.

When Mike Resnick created the future history which serves as the background to so many of his novels, he did it in a way which would earn him extra money: he wrote a book. Birthright: The Book of Man tells the history of human exploration and expansion throughout the galaxy. Originally published in 1982, Alexander Books has recently republished Resnick's novel with a forward by Raymond Feist and a timeline of all Resnick's published works which fit into Birthright's framework.Birthright isn't quite a novel in the traditional sense, nor is it a collection of short stories. Rather, the twenty-six chapters of Birthright form a series of vignettes which, taken together, form something which is much more than the sum of is parts. In total, Birthright is a fable of European conquest, setting the tone for many other fables and allegories Resnick has created based on the histories of Zimbabwe, Kenya and other countries.The scope of Resnick's book means that he can not focus on a single character. Rather than focus on a family throughout the timeline in a Micheneresque manner, Resnick elected to have each of his vignettes star separate individuals. Although each of these individuals are given distinct personal characteristics, they form a conglomerate character, highlighting the various personality traits which Resnick views as Man.Resnick's Man is shaped by an understanding of the history of European colonialism. Man has the need to feel superior to alien races he comes into contact with, either subjugating them outright or reducing them to remnants of their former glory. Like a street dog, none of the other alien races can be permitted to stand shoulder to shoulder with Man. Similarly like a street dog, Man must continue to fight when he is no longer at the top of the heap.While many of Resnick's novels are filled with individuals who are larger than life (Santiago, Jefferson Nighthawk, Koriba) few of the characters in Birthright manage to acquire the same mythic proportions. However, because of Birthright's format, characters of this type are not necessary and would probably detract from the work as a whole.As originally published, Birthright was a good and interesting book on its own. Republished now after being out of print for 15 years, Birthright provides an interesting look at Resnick's early career and the ideas which he originally wanted to explore. His history is large enough in scope that it can easily accomodate, without conflict, the many and varied stories he has chosen to set among the same background.Birthright is a good starting place for those who are not familiar with Resnick's work. At the same time, it serves as a recap for those who have already read significant amounts of Resnick's writings. While Alexander Books generally publishes Resnick's non-fiction &quot;Library of African Adventure&quot; reprint series (itself worthwhile), it is nice to see them bringing some of Resnick's older works back into print."},{"Title":"Birthright: The Book of Man","review":"I think this is my first amazon review ever and I chose my all time favorite sci-fi book \\"Birthright: the book of man\\" to finally break my silence *grin*I read this as a kid when it came out in the early 80's and again when i was an adult. Each chapter is a different short story of characters and situations and taking place at different periods of time in the future and different worlds all over the galaxy.This is suitable for pre-teens and above. If you have a child that is interested in reading or interested in sci-fi, give them this book, most of the short chapters are enthralling sci-fi stories! My favorite was the human olympic athlete competing against the alien on the alien's homeworld in a footrace being broadcast across the galaxy. No 'man' had ever lost against any of the alien species in any sport, *ever*, so this human had the weight of the entire human race on his shoulders. The question was: would this be the event that man was shown to be no better than the rest of the galaxy's species? *grin*"},{"Title":"Birthright: The Book of Man","review":"I'm not sure why this book was out of print for so long.

I guess for this reason alone, I would make it one of my favorite books. Epic story told in small snapshots over the ages. It is not a terribly complex book. Each chapter is a short story within the bigger story. In the end, the chapters tell the complete story of man's conquest of the galaxy. While it was written years ago, it is not dated in the least."},{"Title":"Birthright: The Book of Man","review":"The other reviewers have done a good job of explaining why they think this is a good book and I'm not going to disagree with them. The primary reason I'm writing this review is because I don't think the other reviewers have given a completely accurate view of the book. I've just finished the book and have very mixed feelings about it which I don't think the other reviewers give justice.My first and biggest argument with the book is that it is completely based on the mankind-exploits-everything viewpoint. A quick look at our collective history does not disagree with that viewpoint, but a more detailed look at history does. Mankind has been evolving as a social critter at a fantastic rate for the last 600 years or so. Things that came naturally in the Dark and Middle Ages in Europe such as witch-burning and stoning people to death are now viewed with total revulsion. Cynics (pragmatists?) will argue that these barbaric methods of repression have been replaced by more effective forms of repression. I'd like to think that they are not looking at the long term history of humanity.This book, on the other hand, covers the long term very nicely , 17,000+ years of human history running from the near future to the total extermination of humanity by tens of thousands of enraged alien races. The 26 short stories that cover this era give you plenty to think about regarding the human race. Every possible human virtue and sin is in full display here as humanity strives to achieve total domination of the galaxy and then fritters away every last advantage in wanton stupidity and cruelty when we finally succeed. I'm not saying that it isn't reasonable, I'm just saying that I'd like to think that some faction of humanity would survive, that ever-adaptable humanity would find some way to avoid getting totally exterminated.My other major problem is that the stories are only loosely linked together. We get to meet hundreds of individuals, know them briefly, and then never see them again. This is a natural result of trying to tell 26 very different stores in about 300 pages but the result feels like reading an encyclopedia by reading one paragraph of one entry per letter of the alphabet. You are left with the feeling that there is an extraordinary amount of interesting material all around you that you are never going to be allowed to see. Very frustrating for me personally.If you feel that I'm trashing the book, please consider the fact that I gave it 3 stars. All I'm saying is that this is not a book that can or should be consumed in one sitting and don't be surprised if you have some very strong emotions when you are done."},{"Title":"Birthright: The Book of Man","review":"Do you belong to the race of man?

Very easy going, simple and poetic. The novel written by Yaacoub depicts an alluring plot between two persons living in two different countries with two different mentalities. Through their e-mails and chats, they connect almost daily, telling each other what happened through the day. The interesting part is when it gets beyond that, thus making the reader connect with them too. Each seems to be looking for the right person but none is able to give up their philosophy and ideals. It is partly poetic and partly down to earth. I liked especially the part where Wolf, one of the main characters, writes his ideas in a poetic manner (in italic).Yaacoub is trying to get his readers edgily to the last four days, the last pages of the book.

Thank you!"},{"Title":"U. S. Elite Counterterrorist Forces (Power)","review":"One must take into account that the book is after all, 1997...there were only a few terrorist activities that happened to the United States at that time.I find this book to be a good primer to other aspects of CT forces. Its only equal is Concord's &quot;Special Operations Journal&quot; which as of 3/1/2001 is in Volume 13. However, each SOJ is about the price of this book and you need to buy 3-4 SOJs to have the units contained here.The book doesn't really cover the military CT groups like Delta or SEALs (Douglas Waller's &quot;Commandos&quot; does better) but FBI HRT, US Marshals, and CT forces against super-terrorism.Stephen F. Tomajczyk did speak the truth when he said he visited these units and the photos show training exercises. Of course given the nature of their top-secret work, real mission photos aren't included...same applies to Concord Special Ops. Photos are mainly of training and the text is about unit history and terrorist events up to 1997.For the size and price, I think this is a great valuable book and the first of its kind. Surely other future authors can provide more detailed text or photos but you won't find such value, blueprints, diagrams, color photos, descriptions, and true life stories of SEVERAL units in just one book or just one journal of Concord &quot;Special Ops.&quot; And if you do, chances are the price will be a lot higher than this book."},{"Title":"U.

Elite Counterterrorist Forces (Power)","review":"This book is definately an excellent source for the layman, however totally skips over a certain set of individuals of which there are photos of in the book itself, but no mention in text. Air Force Security Police (Security Forces) are pictured in the book twice, yet no mention of them at all. Security Forces were also rated in the top five most hated organizations by terrorists in the world, ranked with British SAS, Delta, and others mentioned in this book. They are pictured as the individual inspecting the undercarriage of a vehicle with a mirror, and the K-9 handler in the 'Secret Service' section. One should research a little more before placing pictures with organizations they are not a part of. Security Forces deploy all over the world in almost every country to protect U.S. Armed Forces from the threats of terrorism and work often with organizations in this book. Please understand this book is for layman only, and some information is vague, especially for military organizations."},{"Title":"U. S.

I read this book from cover to cover, and was pleased to be able to make many notes for my future lessons. Some of the activities are actually quite common, and perhaps most teachers would be aware of them, but there were many good ones that I'd never come across, including a few gems. Some are literally five-minute fillers, while others are worthy of spending maybe a whole lesson on. If I had to make a tentative criticism, it'd be that many of the suggestions have students generating language that would never be heard beyond the walls of an EFL classroom. For example, &quot;A pencil is thinner than an elephant.&quot; I have mixed feelings about whether this is such a bad thing or not. On the one hand, students can practice structurally correct forms of language and learn whilst having fun. On the other hand, Five-minute Activities doesn't really present them with many opportunities to practise for situations in the real world, which may, of course, not be as fun. Also, I felt that there was a bias for activities that focused on self-disclosure, or competing to be the best in the class. Great, perhaps, for European or South American students of English, but not quite so good for students at my secondary school here in Japan. Overall, I'm pleased to have this book for reference, and I'd recommend it to most of my colleagues, even if some of the suggestions reminded me of what it used to be like as a pupil at a British elementary school."},{"Title":"Five-Minute Activities: A Resource Book of Short Activities (Cambridge Handbooks for Language Teachers)","review":"I've had a copy of this book since 1995.

The only thing that I might have liked to see (and this is just to spoil me) is have the book broken down into their categories in the front of the book, instead of just the index...and by level.

That being said, I did find it useful for, if nothing else, getting my own ideas rolling. I would also like to add that it's rather pricey for a flimsy little book, but I'm sure that if my situation were different it would have been well worth the money.

I have used this book in my own clincal practice and as a reference in preparing lectures for students. I have found it to be extremely useful. It provides brief, accessible, clinically relevant reviews of the questions and issues that confront busy clinicians in the outpatient clinic. The format makes it useful as a clinical tool in contrast to those volumes that one plans to get around to reading later."},{"Title":"Outpatient Medicine, 2e","review":"This book's liberal use of tables and algorithms provide excellent overview of the concise, up-to-date text. It is perfect for briefly reviewing current standards in clinical assessment and diagnostic testing between patient visits in a busy outpatient clinic.

He does a great job of setting the context in the first parts of the book, which help get a larger vision of the fabliaux, and throughout his work, he remains very interesting and informative. Burrows is a very rich source for those of you who wish to do more research on the priest, as he lists a ton of references on a constant basis, and redirects us all the time to other works about this or that topic in particular.I absolutely recommend this book for this given topic in fabliaux. The only negative thing I'd have to say is that unless you speak all of the following languages: French, Old French, German, Latin, Italian, and maybe other languages I forget; you will have to skip entire quotations, like I had to do, because no translations are offered for any of these. For a second edition, that would be really nice, because few people are fluent in *all* of these languages!"},{"Title":"A Brief Guide to Beliefs: Ideas, Theologies, Mysteries, and Movements","review":"I have read several books that compare religions and beliefs.

When I embarked on my first boatbuilding project armed with my hobbyist's furniture building skills and a set of boat plans, I nearly gave up in frusteration. After reading this book, everything makes so much more sense. He explains the terminology, the woods, the tools, the glues, and all the little pitfalls you will encounter along the way.

A legendary teacher at the WoodenBoat School, Greg Rossel uses his years of experience to take the reader through the whole process of constructing a wooden boat. The chapter on lofting alone is worth the price of the whole book. One might consider Chapelle's \\"Boatbuilding\\" to be Old Testament: accurate, certainly, but with many references which today the reader would find archaic. Rossel, however, is decidedly New Testament. He is a cheerful, witty, and knowlegeable companion who takes you from selecting a set of plans to finishing the brightwork. Highly recommended.Gordon H.Hafner"},{"Title":"Building Small Boats","review":"I loved the clear way the author explains the process of building wooden boats. His pictures were fantastic. His sailboat is beautiful. The only thing that threw me at first was the chapter on lofting, (drawing out the boat parts full scale on paper from grid measurements).

A reader might read one of the other authors' chapter on lofting to further understand the process, which I did."},{"Title":"Building Small Boats","review":"Covers it all with wit and wisdom.

The description of the lofting process is a masterpiece. I took every book on boatbuilding out of the library and this book is the only one that could adequately describe this confusing and complicated process. I'm an inexperienced boatbuilder and I'm building a pretty complicated John Gardner boat, from \\"Building Classic Small Craft.\\" There are no full plans, just the dimensions in the offset table. If not for this book, it all would have remained hopelessly confusing."},{"Title":"Building Small Boats","review":"I had the pleasure of taking Greg Rossel's \\"Lofting\\" class at the WoodenBoat School in Maine some years ago. Lofting is the very exacting process of taking a numeric description of a specific hull shape and converting that information to actual construction diagrams, from which you can build that hull. If you just want a quick-built boat, skip learning lofting. But if you want to understand the process that master wooden boat and ship builders went through hundreds of years ago (for example, as upstairs in the huge \\"lofts\\" of Dutch sailing ship building yard sheds) and still go through even today, then you do want to learn to loft. Either way, with or without lofting, \\"Building Small Boats\\" is absolute required reading for any small boat builder, novice or experienced. Greg is recognized as being one of the leading small wooden boat builders/instructors on the planet today. He combines an amazing mind, with precise exactness, with extremely simple to follow instructions, with the best possible hand-drawn (no less!) diagrams, with an uproarious sense of humor! Want to learn the secrets of the master small boat builder, all the way from thinking about a boat to putting it on the water? Take \\"Lofting\\" and \\"Fundamentals\\" at the WoodenBoat School from Greg. Second best?

It gives a general survey of modal propositional and even modal predicate logic (this latter is pretty difficult and rarely presented in introductory books). There is one feature of this book that I really love: the authors try to present everything without supposing anything on the part of the readers. I really suffer when I get a book that supposes that strange type of pre-requisite that appears to be everything minus the subject that is being presented - and sometimes the author even supposes that you have already met his subject before! Hughes and Cresswell write in a pleasant pace, sometimes repeating themselves, but this is good for educational purposes. I like their analogies: the presentation of K-validity as a modal game is really superb. They do not exagerate with mathematical formalisms, using only when indispensable, and this is good for the non-mathematician. I recommend it for every reader interested in logic in general, mathematicians or philosophers."},{"Title":"A New Introduction to Modal Logic","review":"This is the best introduction to modal logic for all but very experienced logic students.

I am ordering a used copy since it is out of print. Basically the book is a copy of a kind of souvineer scrapbook made by someone on the staff of the notorious camp. It is mostly pictures by the camp official photographer. The pictures are actually quite prosaic & even nostalgic. It documents the various phases of the camp operation. The pictures of the dead & their disposal are not included but this actually heightens the effect. Pictures of groups of ordinary people most of whom were dead an hour after their picture was taken. The book was found by a camp survivor, became a famous artifact & rare document of the holocaust. The book is designed to simulate the original scrapbook. The pictures are accompanied by quotes from accounts from other books & captions which illuminate what is going on beneath the almost tranquil surface. I worked in a military film archives years ago which had footage taken during the camp liberation. This is far more disturbing."},{"Title":"The Auschwitz Album: A Book Based Upon an Album Discovered by a Concentration Camp Survivor, Lili Meier","review":"My 1st exposure to this book was nearly 20 years ago and I have never forgotten it. The majority of survivors of that era are now gone and it falls upon us to remember and to bear witness. This is an unforgetable book that should grace every person's library. The collection resembles any photo album one might find in anyone's home, save for the stark reality and deep tragedy it portrays. Seen through the photographer's and the viewer's eye there is a certain neutrality that allows us to understand on our own what this place must have been like. While it never shows the macabre, It lays like a prophecy in the eyes of the innocents who step off the trains and into their respective lines. This book is out of print - we need to treasure and circulate it.Own it, show it to the people around you. If we can react to it and learn from it, we may make the world a better place to live."},{"Title":"The Auschwitz Album: A Book Based Upon an Album Discovered by a Concentration Camp Survivor, Lili Meier","review":"This unique book contains plenty of photographs that you will not find on the internet, but not of the graphic visuals usually peppered throughout sites - it is of the processes bringing inmates into the camp. Shipments of Jews unloading from the trains after a torturous journey, the selection at the Judenrampe (a particularly famous shot: [...] ), and various other steps along the way to either what could be called an existence in the camp or one's immediate processing. They do indeed show images of old and very young sitting in the Birch Alley (Birkenau) outside the first gaskammer awaiting the cleaning of the inside for their turn.This is not merely a scrapbook, the photos are accompanied with descriptions and excerpts from other books to enhance and explain what you are seeing. One of the best pages documented an image with hundreds of people viewed from the vantage point of a man standing on top of a boxcar - and one woman from the train shipment is seen conversing secretly and directly with a striped prisoner - which was forbidden. Perhaps he was passing on life-saving information, like to try as best as she can to go RIGHT! Sneak if you must! The accompanying commentary on the opposite page will often point things like this out to provoke very serious consideration as to what's happening or going through their heads in each shot. It's just a great experience.The real frightening thing is, which order allowed this SS man to take these photos? Nothing was allowed to witness these events, the Nazis went to painstaking lengths to conceal their crimes until it all blew up in their face. Which member of the upper NSDAP ordered this official to collect the scenes so flagrantly and freely? Of their most destructive and despicable 'Aktions' no less!

No Matter What Everyone Else Thinks","review":"I ordered this book on the advice of a friend who read it while she was pregnant. Before I read it, she told me she had an idea of which birthing experience she thought I'd prefer. Well, I've read it, and she was right!I liked (what seemed to me) the unbiased descriptions of all the different birth methods listed in the book. I think it helped to read the opinions of mothers who have experienced - good and bad - each birth method. It never felt that one method was being promoted over another.I am not due for several months, but assuming everything goes well, I feel more confident about the birth experience I want to have. And, thanks to this book, if it doesn't go according to my plan, as long as the baby is OK, I'll be OK with it!"},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . . No Matter What Everyone Else Thinks","review":"I'll say it upfront - I've never had children - so I can't review this book within that context. However, as a woman of childbearing age who's begun to do some research into different ways of having my baby (eventually), I really appreciated this book. Many of the other childbirth books I've read had definite agendas. This book covered pretty much every kind of birth experience, and showed how each could be a wonderful experience, while emphasizing that the most important thing is that the mother does what she thinks is right for her and her child. Very refreshing. The writing is great too."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . . No Matter What Everyone Else Thinks","review":"I'm one of the \\"extreme\\" women Cohen profiles in the book (I had both my kids at home). And I found Deliver This refreshing. There are few resources out there that are not pushing an agenda; few books that I could hand to a person that wasn't already in the home birth camp that wouldn't make me feel like I was pressuring them to do things my way.I don't love all the birth options Cohen profiles, nor do I agree with all her conclusions, but that's precisely the point: I felt like she did her best to give women a chance to hear the pros and cons of each birth option, so they can make up their own minds. I feel like I could hand the book to a pregnant friend and know that I was empowering them--not adding extra judgement to all the crap that society already gives pregnant moms.I agree that this book does not go into detail about _how_ to make each birth choice a reality. But I think the honest appraisal of the options might help each reader to do more research about the choice they end up making. If women can truly make informed choices about their birth options, rather than accepting whatever the medical establishment/friends/society has for them, we'll all be better off."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . .

I liked being able to preview it so thoroughly online before buying it."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . . No Matter What Everyone Else Thinks","review":"\\"Deliver This!\\" was an easy read that exposed me to the many various birthing options available to a pregnant woman today. I had an idea about most of them but this book provided me with some additional information from a non-prejudice point of view, as well as a few more details previously unknown to me.The best part of the book were the stories shared from other birth moms about their labor experience. I still want more, though. Upon finishing \\"Deliver This!\\" I did not feel that I had concrete information to choose the best birth option for me. Each birthing option chapter only seems to delve slightly into the facts, myths, and stories. I need more knowledge and facts before I can choose the option best for me. What I am able to do is exclude a few options from reading this book and then focus on the ones that interest me most."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . .

The wide variety of experiences and stories shared by women of all \\"types\\" are informative, honest and motivational. I hope it finds its way into every pregnant woman's hands."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . . No Matter What Everyone Else Thinks","review":"What I like about this book is that it spells out the different options for childbirth in a modern world. It is a broad, simple overview for someone just starting to think about her choices. That is about the only thing I liked about this book. The author spends way too much time dealing with concerns over how your childbirth choice will be viewed by others (relatives, friends, other mothers, even strangers). Although I realize that other people's concerns and criticisms can impact our decisions, is this really the basis for making such a personal and mometous decision? After all, no matter what path you choose, it is ultimately your own body. I also noticed that the author somehow links veganism and home-birth advocates in a negative light, such as the following statement on page 54, which describes people who chose to have a home birth: \\"And while these women did not fit the vegan, hippie stereotypes I had imagined, there definitely was a noncomformist vibe to the group.\\" Later in the book (page 150) she claims that mothers who chose to have epidurals (the author includes herself in this group) view health concerns over the possible side effects the drugs may have on the baby \\"in the same category with vaccination alarmists and radical veganism.\\" For a book that claims to be judgment-free and supportive of all women's reproductive choices, I guess anyone with vaccination concerns, or god forbid, a vegan, might be kind of left out in the cold.This book is marketed as a book that is about each person finding the best choice for herself (as the back cover reassures the reader). Don't fall for it. The author uses reductionism and generalizations about a whole group of people to get her point across. If you are vegetarian/ vegan/ holistic / a yogi / a noncomformist / concerned about vaccines / a hippie / a thinker - this book should come with a label: warning, this book may offend you."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . .

There's really nothing else like it out there. And now I even know what a post-partum doula is! I will be miles ahead of all the other fathers-to-be at child birth class.

I had no idea how many options were out there, and it was interesting to read from all different perspectives. I also enjoyed the writing of Marisa Cohen -- easy to read, easy to relate to.

This book helps you sort out your options by using witty, judgement-free story telling as well as examining how and why women make the choices they make. Deliver This! is the perfect example of presuming that every woman is smart enough to follow her heart, gather the information or stories she needs to make her decision, and then decide what is best for her and her family. Marisa Cohen is an excellent writer and is able to take a values and judgement-laden topic and deliver her information without, well, values and judgement. Nice wit and humor as well. Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . . No Matter What Everyone Else Thinks","review":"I bought this book when I was starting to think about and plan for labor. It does a great job reinforcing that a successful birth is one that results in a healthy baby. I had been reading books on natural child birth and so many of them seem to have the bias that a medicated birth or a C-section is a lesser experience.Reading this book prepared me to expect the unexpected during labor and to not feel bad for asking for drugs or feel devastated in the event of a C-section.The personal stories from women who have had babies all sorts of ways are a great resource when one is sorting through all the material out there."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . . No Matter What Everyone Else Thinks","review":"Since I am expecting, I figured I should figure out how I want labor to go. As far as I could find, this was the only book out there on childbirth options. The book was funny, I esp. enjoyed when the author told us she hissed like a demon at her husband before she got the epidural. She educates you about the options - the arguments for and against the options and reasures you that all will be ok. She also gives helpful tips about how and what to discuss with your Doctor, midwife, doula, etc."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . . No Matter What Everyone Else Thinks","review":"Having worked with childbearing women for over 20 years, I was unpleasantly surprised by the entire tenor of this book. It had an abundance of whining and drama, making me think most of what was written was designed to sell the book, not instruct or gain perspective. An example: the author notes how her membranes ruptured \\"after the creme brulee was cleared\\", how she walked the halls in early labor showing off her \\"fashionable new leopard print slippers to the nurses\\". Her bedridden medicalized labor and birth was justified by her description of early labor as 'a rusty knife' twisting into her back, In the next sentence she notes that her husband fell asleep during all of this. Research has clearly documented the myriad of benefits of physical labor support to women. Apparently she had none. In her case, the full complement of medications, machines and immobility early on in her labor was probably welcomed as a way of coping alone.To be fair, other birth stories are presented, however the pithy tone of the book tried too hard to be clever (unsuccessfully) and was draining to read page after page. Other books cover birth options with more depth and most importantly, with more research based documentation.No doubt, all labors are different, what women need during childbirth can be different (though there are some universal needs), and women cope with childbirth in different ways. However, all ways of coping are not equal, and just saying that routine application of birth technology is just the same for women as birth with technology only as indicated will not make it so. Money would be better spent buying another book if one is seeking to be informed about childbirth choices."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . . No Matter What Everyone Else Thinks","review":"I just finished this book, and I absolutely loved it. I plan on recommending it to every pregnant woman I know. This book gives the reader insider and outsider views of each delivery option while balancing the seriousness of the topic with lightheartedness. It is written informally, so you get to see the original and changed opinions of the writer, the views of women who delivered each way, and the views of women who had never experienced the delivery choice.Most of all, I believe the author wants women to understand that no matter what choice you make, if you make the choice to meet your (the mother, the partner/family, and the baby) needs to the best of your ability, then it is right choice no matter what TV/movies, your mother-in-law/sister/aunt, or nosy neighbor says. This book showed me birthing options that I previously considered \\"wrong\\" and gave me insight in how they may be wrong for me, but might be just right for another woman and her baby.Don't expect to set this book down and have a birth plan. I still haven't made my delivery choice, but I do feel much more in control of my options than I did before reading the book. The list of questions to ask yourself to help discover your delivery needs (at the end of the book) is also excellent.Even if you are dead-set on giving birth one way, you should read this book. At the least, it may help women quit being so judgmental on this topic. It may also mentally prepare you to plan for the unexpected. Who knows when the woman expecting the C-section will deliver naturally on the way to the hospital or the woman expecting the home birth will need a C-section."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . . No Matter What Everyone Else Thinks","review":"This was the first, and only, book I found on birthing choices that was non-judgmental. I don't care what you think about my birthing choice, I just want to know the facts. I decided to go with the elective c-section choice (& I'm a vegetarian who tires to live a healthy, natural lifestyle, gasp!) and this was the only book that didn't try to make me feel like I was going to \\"harm\\" myself or child by my choice. The author does try to make it light and funny at times which I guess could offend some. But I've passed this book on to all my girlfriends, who have all delivered every way possible, and everyone loved it. When I was pregnant I was disgusted how so many women treated other women when their pregnancy, birth, and/or child-rearing choices were different. If anything this booked showed me how much alike the \\"hippy\\" home-birth mom was like the \\"selfish\\" elective c-section mom. (humor) All that matters is a healthy baby, and this book will help you feel confident on your birthing choice. Happy birthing."},{"Title":"Deliver This!: Make the Childbirth Choice That's Right for You . . .

I couldn't have asked for a better, gentler shattering of the walls of denial I built around myself..:) Beyond the practical advise, the clearly laid out information and the compassion towards all women and choices, I take with me the most powerful tool - humor. Don't get me wrong - I am still terrified, but the book empowered me to consider going natural, re-assured me it's ok to beg for the drugs, and all in all, just made me feel better about the whole thing.

I had ordered it based on the outstanding reviews it had received. My first thumbing through left me wondering if it was going to be at all useful. It certainly is!I was impressed that the book included several hiking recommendations, it's something I've found lacking in other guides and something that attracted me to this book. The recommendations include maps, route details such as time, accomodation, and the difficulty of the hike. I would in fact have liked to see more hikes, and more maps. On a few occasions they suggested picking up leaflets, which I'm sure is quite practical, except when you're actually trying to plan your trip!!Unlike some guide books, &quot;SCOTLAND for backpackers&quot; didn't praise or recommend everything. They're not reluctant to say an something is overpriced, or to recommend ducking attractions. When your time and budget are limited this is a definite must in terms of determining the quality of a guide.Keep in mind that this is a backpackers guide, it's probably the only guide book you'll read that includes listings of where to purchase second hand clothes or use crap as an adjective. One amusing section on hitch hiking recommends: &quot;guys, be clean shaven, unless you've got a really impressive beard. Smile, but not menacingly.&quot; Can they be serious?I was disappointed with the way the book was organized. All the information that you usually find at the start of a guide came last: the history, general information, anbd some of the imformation isn't well covered. In the treatment of the Trossachs they claim &quot;this area can't be rated highly enough&quot; and then go on to give it less space than they've allocated to discos. In trying to cover everything they end up watering down several important places and the writing just isn't strong enough to make up for it.Still, there's a lot of charm to this book and if you're interested in hosteling, hiking, and looking for good value I'd recommend you purchasing this book."},{"Title":"Scotland for Backpackers","review":"Never been to Scotland?

Hadamard, a world-class mathematician best known for his proof of the prime number theorem in 1896, wrote this in the 40's, basing it on correspondence with many of the great living mathematicians of his time. The actual questions he posed are preserved in an appendix.Most of his respondents were mathematicians (and he limited his correspondence to the best minds in the field), but he did get information from several other fields, and cites data about physicists (a letter from Einstein forms another appendix), chemists, physiologists, metaphysicians, and so on. What he is trying to examine is a slippery subject, perhaps best explained by a quote. Here is a discussion of Sidgwick, an economist: &quot;His reasonings on economic questions were almost always accompanied by images, and the images were often curiously arbitrary and sometimes almost undecipherably symbolic. For example, it took him a long time to discover that an odd symbolic image which accompanied the word 'value' was a faint, partial image of a man putting something on a scale.&quot;Hadamard gives his own mental images that accompany his following through the steps of Euclid's famous proof of the infinitude of primes. I won't reproduce that here for space reasons, but the contrast with Sidgwick's--and with other reports of mental activity--is fascinating. Many other examples are given, from Mozart to Polya to Galton to Poincare. Hadamard makes it clear that language and thought are not the same thing, contrary to a commonly expressed view among linguists. He cites Max Muller's comments equating thought and language, and acknowledges that for Muller it may be so, but convincingly demonstrates, by quoting numerous other mathematicians, that it is not true for everyone. The further conclusion, that the process of creative thought, while following similar patterns in similar discipline, can vary dramatically, is as far as Hadamard can go with the data he has.One other note: this book was retitled &quot;The Mathematician's Mind&quot; and republished in the Princeton Science Library series; it's not immediately clear from the Amazon page that this is so. The Dover edition is substantially cheaper.A fascinating and informative book."},{"Title":"An essay on the psychology of invention in the mathematical field","review":"Not only is this book fascinating, it's the only one of it's kind. The book has also proved very useful to me in life. As a graduate student I used Poincar&eacute;'s implicit \`advice' (described in the book) in the following way. In electrodynamics we had a long problem sheet to hand in every two weeks. I started by writing down answers to all problems that I knew. Then, I thought about the next-easiest problem each day walking twice to and from the University (about 1 1/2 hours altogether). When the answer came I wrote it down and iterated the process. Before the end of two weeks most of the problems (from Jackson) had been solved. Poincari's advice is very good about giving the unconscious a chance to work. Phooey and double phooey on the silly, uncreative skinner-box types and other behaviorists who don't recognize the unconscious as the source of creativity!"},{"Title":"An essay on the psychology of invention in the mathematical field","review":"The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field is a study on how research mathematicians go about the business of advancing their field. Jacques Hadamard, a prominent mathematician, wrote this psychology text over 50 years ago, after having done his best work 50 years prior. Although in some ways dated, both in content and in writing style, the book provides an interesting examination of the role of the conscious and subconscious in solving a problem, particularly the process of incubation and (seemingly) sudden inspiration. He brings up the roles intuition and logic play in the way various mathematicians go about their business. Hadamard also examines the influence of aesthetics in not just choosing a problem, but in solving it. He studies the choice of research direction, with the interesting comment that Hadamard himself avoided areas of research where there was already a great deal of activity.The book is short enough that if the subject interests you, it is worth your time.The text is also published under the title &quot;The Mathematician's Mind.&quot;"},{"Title":"An essay on the psychology of invention in the mathematical field","review":"Well, the work is clearly outdated in many parts: that was inevitable. It is even a bit tedious, sometimes; and written in what sounded to me \\"a strange English\\"; after further reading I realized that it was not a translation, but it was Hadamard himself writing English...The most interesting parts of the book are, obviously, the \\"case studies\\" presented by Hadamard (including, of course, himself). I found this parade of minds very interesting because it helped me to understand a bit more my own way of thinking and my own (little) creativity.There is another most interesting point in this little book. Many mathematicians (perhaps all the true mathematicians) have a Platonic conception of an ideal world of numbers and mathematical concepts; in the course of their research they just \\"discover\\" these pre-existing, eternal truths. As a layman interested in many things, I have always agreed with this conception, but I have often wondered how and why such a Platonic view holds even today, against the recurrent blows of neopositivism and formalism, and so on.Reading Penrose's books I saw some clues, but this book suggests a clear answer: true mathematicians really see glimpses of this ideal world.One may argue that this could be just a way of our mind, so this ideal world is just an illusion cast by our mind (or I should say by the kind of mind which can develope into a mathematic mind). But there are many reasons to think that mathematics is a very real world which we can explore and discover. This is a very profound subject, involving the nature of our mind and that of the world around us, its being understandable, and the mysterious connections between the abstract world of pure mathematics and the physical world."},{"Title":"An essay on the psychology of invention in the mathematical field","review":"I give it 5 stars because it is unique. I.e. although not perfect, there is to my knowledge no better book on the difficult and elusive topic of how to come up with new ideas and insights on unsolved problems.Even though Hadamard restricted his survey to great minds of his and earlier time, I have found that the lessons described there apply also to the rest of us.As described well above, the mora is to \\"prepare the mind\\", that one must think and study a problem as hard as one can for a long time, and then the mind will often reveal the solution.I myself have tried hard to solve problems unsuccessfully, then gone to bed and awakened in the night with a sense of mental energy. I have learned it is prudent to arise and see what is forthcoming, and occasionally have obtained the solution of my problem.After being told otherwise by my linguistics professors, it was also reassuring that my way of thinking about problems, in pictures and vague shapes, not words, was shared by famous scientists.I was also piqued as a young student by Hadamard's quote from a mathematics professor asking a student wanting a thesis problem if, in all his studies, he had not noticed anything needing further investigation. This habit of attempting to \\"find problems\\" is essential to research, but seldom mentioned in class.(I have been a research mathematician now for some 30 years since reading this book in 1970.)"},{"Title":"An essay on the psychology of invention in the mathematical field","review":"It just talks about how great minds thought about their own thinking process and also about how the author thinks about psychology of invention. It does not help people like me who like to figure out how to become more creative and think more like a mathematician. The title of the book is misleading. It is even more misleading to note that this book is a very popular one. I do not understand why though."},{"Title":"An essay on the psychology of invention in the mathematical field","review":"I found in this book important information on the power of the unconscious mind in the creation of new mathematics.The author Jacques Hadamard's experience of suddenly getting a solution at the moment of waking from sleep and his testimony to the effectiveness of abandoning a problem and the resuming it later on aligns with my experience (on modest problems).The inclusion of Henri Poincare's account of the sudden mathematical insight relating to fuchsian functions (that occurred to him just as he stepped on a bus) was evidence of the unconscious at work.The book in effect discusses the four stages of thought (after Helmholtz and Poincare) of: Preparation (conscious work setting up the problem and trying to solve it); incubation (no conscious work on the problem) ; illumination (the fruits of incubation where an insight is received) and finally verification (consciously testing and verifying the insight).The style of writing is a little hard to read but the contents repay the effort."},{"Title":"An essay on the psychology of invention in the mathematical field","review":"All humans are subject to the \\"aha moment\\" phenomenon, when a solution to a problem suddenly appears in your mind. In most instances, it is the sudden remembering of a name or a phone number, the rediscovery of something previously encountered and with nothing added. What is of most interest is when such a moment takes place and there is more there than there was before. This is what creativity is all about and it is one of the most difficult human activities to understand and predict.Mathematics is very different from other fields, in that while new abstract ideas are built from old ones, the new idea is often quite different. Furthermore, it is sometimes not possible to use concrete representations such as diagrams to explain the idea. Hadamard refers to several mathematicians describing how their ideas came to them. From his evidence, mathematical inspiration is largely due to having a prepared mind. While the idea seems to appear fully formed in an instant, generally there was an extensive period of preparation to understand the background material. Once this was done, there was some significant mental effort that appeared to yield nothing, a time of relaxation and then suddenly the solution appeared. This is followed by the verification of the idea and the transliteration into a formal form for communication to others.The three middle chapters, \\"The Unconscious and Discovery\\", \\"The Preparation Stage\\", \\"The Later Conscious Work\\" and \\"Discovery as a Synthesis: The Help of Signs\\" outline this sequence of events. In reading this book, it is clear that creativity is a skill that can be acquired and honed, at least to some extent. It was interesting to read the book and get the views of creative mathematicians on how they managed to invent new ideas.Published in the recreational mathematics e-mail newsletter, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"An essay on the psychology of invention in the mathematical field","review":"Hadamard was one of the productive mathematicians of the late 19th and early/mid 20th century. Maybe his name isn't as broadly known as Gauss or many others. Still, the Hadamard matrices appear in modern error correcting codes among other places, and his name is known in other contexts. This is someone whose creative work is still an active field of study, over a century after some of it was originated.When someone of his stature decides to write about creativity, I am interested. He centers his inquiry on the thought processes of invention. That includes the place of sub-conscious thought, in several forms, and of abstract or verbal thought vs. imagery.This study is wholly descriptive, not prescriptive. It simply relates the introspective sensation of Hadamard's thought process, and that of many others including Einstein and Mozart. There is little here about the the process of cultivating a creative talent, just description of how creators perceive their own talent in operation.Although interesting, I found it somewhat dry. He cites many other studies of creativity, some of which are now hard to find. Many, however, come from an angle that I find un-helpful: the view a psychologist might take, rather than that of a mathematician or artist.This brief book may be of historical interest, but probably won't benefit the working creative professional.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Medieval Theatre","review":"I chose this book as a reference for an essay I had write for my college course of Western Theatre.

At times the technical descriptions were laborious and needlessly in-depth. Much of the story has the main character, Jake Grafton, a likable if predictable character, struggling with the meaning of life. Much angst over whether to stay in the service and whether or not to marry. At about a third of the way in I began skimming pages because the pace was so slow. The sidekick character, Flap LeBleu, was far more entertaining and would be a good main character. All in all, I was disappointed in this book. Far too little story hidden among technical descriptions as exciting as an owners manual and whiny self-absorbed introspective blather from Grafton. Hard core fans of the Grafton series may appreciate the character insights but the uninitiated will likely find this a boring travail."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"A truly enjoyable military techno-thriller starring Coonts' Jake Grafton. I use \\"starring\\" deliberately, because the book is conceived cinematically. Set in 1973 the plot is a string of episodic flying trials that Jake and his masterfully comic BN \\"Flap Le Beau must survive, culminating in a James Bondish final brush with some really bad guys. The plot is really secondary to the character development, however, which is very well done. It has the genuine feel of 1973 while Jake tries to figure out just who he is and what he wants to do with his life, and Le Beau, as with all great sidekick creations, seems to go on after the book ends with a life of his own. Only once does Coonts really go overboard with the catalog of then current jet technology--after all, we don't really need to know how to fly one of these things--and that passage is easily skimmed. The heart of the novel is the relationship between Grafton and Le Beau, where Coonts shows far greater novelistic skill than his higher profile rival Tom Clancy.

I didn't get the feeling that Jake was much of a mentor. Jake was one hell of a good pilot, but other than giving some briefings on how to operate an A6 in a carrier environment, I couldn't tell that Jake was helping the Marines adapt all that much. In fact, one pilot died as a result of not checking something that Jake checked before every flight. Jake thought all pilots knew about this important check, but it's something the Marines had no knowledge of. Oops!

Exciting, realistic and very entertaining. A definite must read."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"\\"The Intruders\\" is one of the 10 books in Stephen Coonts' very good series of thrillers about Jake Grafton of the U.S. Navy.Exactly where \\"The Intruders\\" fits into the Jake Grafton series depends on how you look at it. Judged by the year when the story takes place, \\"The Intruders\\" is book number two, following \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", Stephen Coonts' first book.But Stephen Coonts did not write this book immediately following \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", published in 1986. Instead, \\"The Intruders\\" was published in 1994 following the publishing of four other Jake Grafton books: \\"Final Flight\\" (1988), \\"The Minotaur\\" (1989), \\"Under Siege\\" (1990) and \\"The Red Horseman\\" (1993).\\"Flight of the Intruder\\" was set in 1972 during the last part of the Vietnam War, while \\"The Intruders\\" is set in 1973, shortly after the end of the Vietnam War. (All of the remaining Jake Grafton books are set in contemporary time, i.e., around the time when they were published.)So what we have here is a young Jake Grafton who has done his stint in the Vietnam War and is still in the U.S. Navy. He's very unsure about what he should do with his life. He's courting Callie McKenzie (mostly by writing letters to her), but fears that he will not win her hand. He feels that he is not in control of his life, that the Navy is making all the decisions for him.Unlike all of the other Jake Grafton books (except to some extent \\"Flight of the Intruder\\") this book does not have any real story. A lot of things happen, but they are isolated episodes spanning an eight-month period, not a single continuous plot.Actually, the main story in this book is simply the story of Jake Grafton finding himself and making decisions about his life. Plus the story about his relationship with Callie, with its ups and downs.One of the things I liked best about \\"The Intruders\\" were the many descriptions of how naval aviation works. Flying high-performance planes from the deck of an aircraft carrier is a very exciting and dangerous endeavor, and Stephen Coonts describes it all in detail. The only slightly negative point is that these descriptions are somewhat dated now, since the aircraft have changed since 1973, and presumably the procedures too, to some extent.Stephen Coonts writes with wit and intelligence, and some parts of the book, where Jake and his buddies talk about life and death, are quite philosophical. There are also touching passages about what love really is, and interesting insights into the concept of leadership.Highly recommended. The lack of the fifth star is due to the silly adventure in the last five chapters, presumably added because the author or the editor or the publisher didn't think the rest of the book was exciting enough to be a Jake Grafton story.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"If you are into NavAir, read this book.

Jake Grafton the main character is interesting and at times reflects upon himself to see whether or not to get out of the navy of not, marriage with his sweetheart Callie is on his mind. Flap Le beau his Bombardier/Nav. puts a bit of fun and flare into the story. Although I'm not a pilot but an enthusiast, Coonts puts a lot of emphasis on what the pilots are thinking of while in the cockpit, no matter at night or during the day, as a reader you get to feel what the pilot and his Navigator are really feeling at the time.THIS STORY WOULD MAKE A GREAT MOVIE about the life for an aviator living on an aircraft carrier, we have enough movies about the grunts on the ground,here is a chance to make a movie about aviators on aircraft carriers as they are America's long arm of Foreign Policy."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Being a veteran of the 1st Cavalry Division in 1972, I was in Vietnam when Stephen Coonts was flying missions off carriers.

We were just young, American kids who answered our country's call, as in every war that we have ever fought. Stephen takes the reader right into the cockpits, and the minds of the fliers. I am forever in his debt."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"This book doesn't have that much plot, but great character development keeps it moving. That's why I ended up liking it even better than the first novel in the Grafton series, \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", which dragged at times.At the outset, Jake Grafton is stationed stateside in 1973, a few months after the events described in the previous book. The aftertaste of the Vietnam War is still bitter in veterans' mouths. A barroom brawl earns Grafton reposting to a carrier, in the (to squids) undesirable company of jarheads (Marine pilots) whom Grafton must teach the fine and dangerous art of carrier takeoffs and landings.Grafton's copilot is the obnoxious, jive-talking Flap LeBeau, an African-American with a serious attitude. But Grafton learns the surface is deceptive and there is far more to LeBeau, also a combat vet.Grafton endures the monotony of carrier life while agonizing over his future with Callie McKenzie. He is about to propose, but leaves for the sea on awkward terms following a tiff with her antiwar father. The long ensuing silence forces him to reexamine his life and goals.The action climax of the book is more realistic than that of the first book. There, Grafton's unauthorized bombing run over North Vietnam strained plausibility. This one doesn't. And the book still has all the harrowing realism of a carrier pilot's dangerous existence. It's well worth your time. I got into the Grafton series through the later books based on espionage and spookery, but must say I enjoy Jake Grafton's character much more in these earlier books."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I got suckered into buying this book at a huge clearance sale.

I recommend this book but I would read Flight of the Intruder first."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Being a veteran of two WestPac cruises on an aircraft carrier during peace time, I found this book to reflect my experiences aboard ship, albeit with a LOT more spice. Stephen Coonts tells it like it really is during flight operations and doesn't leave much out. The only difference is that he relates just about every mishap that could ever happen to a naval pilot and his BN all happening within an eight month deployment - quite unrealistic, but definitely an engaging read. If everything in this book happened to a real pilot during a twenty year career, much less one eight month deployment, he'd likely lose his mind. If this is what peacetime is like on a carrier, I'd say bring back the war. It was much less dangerous in \\"Flight of the Intruder\\"."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"\\"Intruders\\", another of Coonts' books based on the misadventures of naval aviator Jake Grafton, takes place right after Grafton's debut in \\"Flight of the Intruder\\".Finding himself stateside in the immediate aftermath of the war in Vietnam, Grafton feels a growing malaise, hamstrung to win the hand of Callie Mackenzie. (Though Grafton fans know the romance turns out okay, Coonts shows us how far from certain the romance was). As punishment for getting into a bar fight, Grafton is shipped to sea so he can tutor a new generation of aviators in flying the new generation of Intruder, the A-6E. Though he'd jump at the chance to fly the new plane, the fliers themselves are Marines - considered ham-handed apes not up to flying complex hardware. To add to the mix is Grafton's new commander, an ernest type hungry for action. With no airstrikes to keep them occupied, the new CAG spends his time planning attacks against soviet ships (Coonts makes the point that air-launched anti-ship missiles have not yet made it to American inventories, requiring planners and fliers to fall back on more reckless tactics). Is the new CAG in control or does he have an itchy trigger finger? And can Grafton get his cadets up to speed?Unfortunately, while episodic takes that drive \\"Intruders\\" worked on \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", there isn't a central story to bring it together as that older book had. Planes crash, men die, carrier ops is just the most damgerous job in the world. Also, the green marines are cardboard characters who are not only less capable at flying then the characters of \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", but simply less interesting as well - like Razor, Boxman (who died in that older book), Cole and Cowboy (who lost his life years later in \\"Final Flight\\"). Even the postwar setting seems to work more against the novel then for it - there's no war to add to the dynamism of the situation. But at sea, there isn't any sense of the relief or shame or anything for the sacrifices of the war and its perceived results. Coonts wraps things up with an completely implausible tale involving a showdown with modern day pirates. This really kills the book which had started out as a return to the seeming homespun honesty (for a technothriller) of the first book - eschewing the villains, plots and schemes, and hidden agendas of Dale Brown, Clive Cussler and the latter Grafton books. Still closer to that spirit of the original \\"Flight\\" than Coonts' other books, and still well ahead of any competitors."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"My husband and I both agreed that this was a suspenseful, knuckle chewing read.

Even his cynical Bombardier-Navigator is employed as a very obvious timeline to his acceptance in the squadron.Worth reading if you like technical detail, or are just a Jake Grafton fan, but as a coherent novel it is clumsy indeed."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I bought this book, thinking it was a mystery. It isn't. It's about navy flying, and it is good. I don't fly, but I went to ground school and planned to get my license. This book was so instructive about flying off ships in all kinds of weather. The author has done a fine job with the narrative. The story is exciting and keeps you reading far into the night."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"NO REAL STORY LINE HERE.

You will have improbable adventures and face your fears as you deal with an aircraft carrier&#8217;s powerful machines. I loved the technical description of the aircraft carrier and the description of the comradeship between men facing danger."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"You have to want to be a navy pilot and know all the details of flying off a carrier.

Well written yarn that explains life and procedure on an aircraft carrier clearly enough for civilians"},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Great descriptions of life as a carrier pilot. Not such a good &#34;story line&#34;. Coonts does a great job of describing the technical and engineering marvels of carrier aviation, and the finely honed skills of a first-rate carrier pilot.

Just like being being in the cockpit with him. Can't wait to give to a friend that flew a6's off a carrier."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"With lots of aerial action and detail this is a great vintage Stephen Coonts about life on an aircraft carrier. \\"The Intruders\\" is set in 1973, shortly after the end of the Vietnam War and tells the story of Jake Grafton's experience after the stresses of Vietnam. Actually this is a bit of a 'prequel' because it was written out of sequence (it should have been book 2 after \\"Flight of the Intruder\\" but was written as book 5 after \\"The Red Horseman\\").The main story is about Jake Grafton adjusting to a degree of normality after the stresses of Vietnam and his life as a carrier pilot. We also revisit Grafton's budding relationship with and love for Callie McKenzie that carries through strongly in later books. The book contains some memorable words about his first contact with his future father-in-law:\\"You....drop...bombs?\\" His face was blank, incredulous. \\"And shoot missiles.\\" Jake said firmly....\\"Doesn't it bother you? Dropping bombs?\\" \\"Only when the bad guys are trying to kill me.\\"A lot of the book is taken up with Coonts detailed description of shipboard life for a carrier pilot, how naval aviation worked at that time (things have changed a bit since then) and the action and excitement of flying in a dangerous environment.If you like that kind of thing then you will love this book. Otherwise wait till later books when Grafton matures and gets promoted into an environment of world shattering responsibilities."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I absolutely loved this book, and it was a fantastic follow-up to \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", one of the greatest flying yarns ever published on Naval Aviation. It has a great many sea stories, about flying off carrier decks at the end of the Vietnam War, and Jake Grafton's personal triumphs or tribulations as well. But the best, funniest part was when the ship crossed the Equator and King Neptune and his Shellbacks inducted all the lowly 'Wogs' into the fraternity of those who have sailed on a ship that crosses the Equator, and those who haven't. The dialogue during this hilarious ritual had me laughing out loud, sometimes while commuting to work onboard an airline flight. It brought back fond memories, and was extremely entertaining. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"It is a very interesting book. It showed an amazing knowledge of subject matter and kept the story line going."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"You'd have to be a pilot to appreciate this book. All of the flying minutia and acronyms destroy the reading. While there are some sequences that are engaging, the rest of the book is pretty boring."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Typical Coonts, exciting, lots of action and great characters. An amazingly good read from end to end that will keep you fully engaged in the exploits of the early Jake Grafton."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"extreme detail on the operation of an A6 Intruder, especially carier landings. Great input about interactions of the carrier crews. As close to being there without actually being on board."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I always enjoy Stephen Coonts writing and this book lives up to expectations. I have encountered the Grafton character in other Coonts books and it is nice to get the early background."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I believe that this is Stephen Coonts first novel and a good one indeed. I have read several of Coont's novels and The Intruders will compare well with all of his later ones."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"This is Coonts at his best. From start to finish, this was an edge-of-the-chair page-turner . This is obviosly a compilation of many incidents that happened to somebody on/near a carrier but compressed into a six month space. Fortunately, Coonts makes in work."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Jake Grafton Novels are always a good read. We like these books. Stephen Coonts is one of our favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"This novel gives the reader an insight into the world of carrier flying operations. You get a feel for the technical challenges of not only taking off from the deck of a moving ship, but also the difficult task of landing on one---especially at night in rough seas. It also defines the relationship between the Intruder pilot and his weapons system operator, who is an integral part of the flight team. The one aspect of the story line that I found unrealistic was Jake Grafton's penchant for getting into trouble and avoiding serious consequences. I am a retired Air Force officer and pilot. Had I been involved in some of the stunts that he was involved in, I would have had an early termination to my career."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"It was good to re-visit an old friend in his early years. The Grafton hero has become a familiar character through the years and reading &#34;Intruders&#34; was like looking back on 'our' past together. Thanks for the nostalgic journey."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"This book was not at all what I expected. There is no plot here, just a lot of endless detail about flying. I forced myself to read the first 100 pages and now I give up. Huge disappointment."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Boring, boring, boring...unless you are into fighter pilots or flying planes. After reading half of the book I could probably fly a plane. There is little plot, the description of planes, is the bulk of the tale. I could not force myself to finish the book.I feel cheated, in that the description does not match the actual writing ( what the book is really about...flying planes). I was excited thinking I had found a new series to read, how very dismal reality was."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"This is a good book. Stephen Coonts does a great job depicting life on a MARINE aircraft carrier. He goes into great detail about how things work on the aircraft carrier. The way that the book is written you can get a good visual picture of what is happening. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes anything that has to do with airplanes or warfare"},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I read 'Flight of the Intruder' some ten years ago, and it was with some anticipation that I picked up 'The Intruders.' There are few books that deal with the period immediately after Vietnam, and although this is fiction, this depicts in brutal clarity the way Vietnam had changed America, both inside and outside of its military. 'The Intruders' is a thinker's book, in spite of its action. I recommend it highly - there are few that equal its insight and focus for what it covers"},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"The Intruders follows Jake Grafton shortly after the end of Flight of the Intruder, to 1973 on a cruise on the U.S.S. Columbia flying A-6E Intruders. In this book Grafton flies with a Marine captain Bombadier/Navigator (BN) named &quot;Flap&quot; Le Beau, who is ex-Marine Recon, and has some very interesting jungle/guerilla warfare skills, as well as an assortment of custom-made slashing and thrownig knives (&quot;What are you, a walking cutlery store?&quot; Jake asks at one point). There is not too much action for the first while, just mainly a series of carrier accidents and mishaps, but there IS some action and plotting toward the last 80 or so pages where Le Beau is truly in his element, along with Grafton. A must-read for all fans of Stephen Coonts and carrier aviation"},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"1973. The Vietnam war is over, but for Lt. Jake Grafton,USN, freshly returned from two victorious combat cruises, his own country seems almost as hostile.

As a navy boy, working with marines with no carrier experience, Jake Grafton is about to discover a new world of hell"},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I remember walking down the aisles of a bookstore and I literally chanced upon this book. Was this a sequel to \\"Flight of the Intruder\\"? It was a dream come true! However much I liked Coonts' follow-up Grafton novels, they lacked the original book's magic. And since I'm a sucker for marketing, I thought the cover wasn't half bad either.There are plenty of reviews here that will tell you what the book's about. Seems to me most people don't care all that much for it. I wasn't looking for something incredible. I just wanted young Grafton again, and I got him. The flying, the power, the wind... I was happy.Ever wonder who does those covers? In this case, it's Dru Blair who paints aircraft, tanks, helicopters, eagles, and Star Trek book covers of all things!\\"Intruders\\" was commissioned for the cover of this book (sadly his own website gets the title wrong): http://www.drublair.com/portintruder.html\\"Intruders\\" was exactly what I was looking for: a fast read, fun, slick, and Coonts as I grew up knowing."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"What a great book. Action packed. Never a dull moment with Jake Grafton. He always keeps you on your toes."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Reading this book was like reading a technical manual about how to launch and retrieve a jet from an aircraft carrier.Long on tech and short on story.The title really throws you off. It has nothing to do with intruders.Steven Coonts really disappointed me on this one"},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I've been a Stephen Coonts fan for years and have enjoyed reading all his books. As an ex-military combat pilot I can really get into his world. I love the strories, the people he creats in his stories and look forward to more reads from Stephen. I count him as one of my favorite authors. Well done, Sir!"},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I truly love this character, love the series.

I was in the Navy and had been in some of the places in the book. The names were bang on. Once started, it is hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I've flown in the Intruder with pilots like Jake Grafton. He captures the spirit and mindset of these brave men. They are a breed apart from the rest of us. If you wonder what life is like aboard the modern aircraft carrier, this is as good a description as I've seen.

Testosterone filled post-Vietnam military. More than a few situations or statements that will cause a quick smile."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"A page turner ,enjoyed mainly because of the fine details the author used in discribing what went on in the cockpit."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Having learned more than I ever wanted to know about aircraft carriers in the first portion of the book, I decided to spend my reading time elsewhere. Very descriptive concerning mechanicial things and the life on-board a carrier. It felt more like a traing manual. The story line was slow moving. A good book for the right audience."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Being a veteran of the 1st Cavalry Division in 1972, I was in Vietnam when Stephen Coonts was flying missions off carriers. Many times the Navy was there to help our missions.I like reading Stephen's novels, because he tells it like it is, and like it was. Too many have misperceptions about our war. we were just young, American kids who answered our country's call, as in every war that we have ever fought. Stephen takes the reader right into the cockpits, and the minds of the fliers. I am forever in his debt."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"More than anything else The Intruders tells long-time Jake Grafton fans what happened to him after Vietnam. The action is quick-paced and tightly written, but learning about how he and Callie finally came together was a great sidebar. I have one request for Mr. Coontz. Where is Flap LeBeua. I think he should be Commandant of the Marine Corps by now and fit in quite well with Admiral, soon to be CNO."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Throughout this one, Jake struggles with the meaning of life and fatalism. Amazinginly (but not realistically) he manages to never even consider including God in this equation. Thus, by the end of the book he still has no answers to his questions. Plane after plane is dumped in the ocean - about half of them by Jake. Some good flight sequences in this one."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Too much flying! Too little plot. This book just fills in some details missing from other books in the series. Fill. That's it. It was an enjoyable read, but only because I had read (and enjoyed, more or less) the other books in the series."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Excellent book - well written !!"},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"I am very happy with this purchase.

Enjoy reading his current novels."},{"Title":"The Intruders","review":"Please. This is a manual for flying jet plane off of a carrier.

The stiry is light less filing and fun."},{"Title":"A Golden Tapestry","review":"I was captivated with T J Richards' story from the start. She writes in a beautifully literary manner as she captures the texture of the human dimension through the rich lives of her ordinary characters. Her writing style is beautiful. The story is poignant and compelling. She utilizes her wonderful craft as she weaves tales of the intertwining lives of her characters with insight and compassion.It is the story of a elderly woman named Clara who is reminiscing on the eve of going into a retirement home. She had always wanted to die in her own home, but she has sadly resigned herself to a different fate. One by one, she recalls the lives that have touched hers. As she does so, she realizes the fullness of experience that she has shared with those from her past.What is wonderful about the book is how T J Richards weaves the stories of each of these individuals who Clara recalls. In so doing, she captures the essence of their individual and mutual pasts in a brilliant manner that speaks to the strength of the human spirit. As the author of a spiritually-themed book, I especially loved this aspect of the book. TJ Richards obviously has a deep spiritual understanding that is translated throughout the pages of this tenderly written book.The story will open windows of understanding for the plight of the elderly. It will especially be illuminating for adult children who may be considering what might be best for their elderly parents. I give this book a resounding thumbs up. It is a story that you will never forget.Davis Aujourd'huiauthor of The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude"},{"Title":"A Golden Tapestry","review":"A very touching look into the life of Anywoman, USA, and those who have touched her life. The story, however, is more than a flip through an old photo album. As each character fades in and out of the story, as people so often fade in and out of our lives, their own secrets are revealed. Some are at peace with the course their life has taken, some are not.The story isn't only about its main character, Clara. As she faces her fears of leaving the only home she has ever known, those she cares about are facing their own travails. Truly, the story is not about Clara, but about the evolution of the human experience, and all its facets---from hopes and dreams to fears, uncertainties, and regret."},{"Title":"A Golden Tapestry","review":"This book really touched my heart. It is richly written and makes one look at the relationships in his or her life in a thoughtful way. It also showed the diversity in the way people age and look at life. I've given my copy to my daughter and recommend it for anyone who values the people in their life. It was very emotional in parts but fulfilling. I wish there were move books written like this now days."},{"Title":"Adopting In Russia: Your Rights and the Law","review":"A must read for anyone adopting from Russia.From the introduction of the book: &quot;This book has been written in order to provide the reader with basic and helpful information pertaining to Russian adoptions and Russian adoption law.&quot; There is no doubt that Irina O'Rear has managed to accomplish this in her recently published book.Pre adoptive parents have many questions and MS O'Rear has managed to consolidate most of the answers to these questions into one book. A family going through the adoption process would be turning to this book daily to get valuable information. Some of this information can only be found in this book.The book starts out with a general discussion on making a decision to adopt and specifically why to adopt from Russia. From there the author describes what to expect in Russia. This covers everything from how to dress, what to expect in the court hearing, and generally what to expect while sight seeing. There is a good description of the adoption process form the Russian side, which lets the parents know what is happening while they are anxiously awaiting an invitation to travel.There is one section of the book, and I feel the most valuable section, where MS O'Rear translates excerpts of the Russian family law that pertains to adoptions. She also provides her expert commentary on each section of the law. In my work with Families for Russian and Ukrainian Adoption (FURA) I have repeat idly heard parents ask what the Russian laws says on certain issues. Now I have a resource that I can point them to for answers.Besides the unique section on Russian law the author provides another unique section of useful words and phrases. Nowhere else have I seen a list like this. It is in English word order and the Russian translation is done using the English phonetic alphabet instead of the Russian Cyrillic. This is most helpful to those who don't know the Cyrillic alphabet.For people looking for a resource and reference guide to help with a Russian adoption then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Adopting In Russia: Your Rights and the Law","review":"For anyone who is interested in an indepth understanding of Russian Law and how it related to international Russian adoption, this is the book to read! Well written, well thought out, easy to use and very informative! Irina O'Rear has written an outstanding book that explains in detail how the law works in Russia and how it applies to adoption.Did you know adoption in Russia is free? Did you know that the Russian Law DOES NOT require two trips? Did you know there is an appeals process for adoptions that are turned down by the judge? Do you want to know if you can request a specific child in a specific area, from a specific orpahage? Irina explains the whys and wherefores of the law, and how it applies to various adoption situations. She explains the adoption process, gives a list of documents commonly needed for a Russian dossier, and explains what is involved in the court hearing.A well written, concise, and thorough book. A must read for anyone interested in adopting from Russia. A great place to get the right answers to some tough adoption questions."},{"Title":"Adopting In Russia: Your Rights and the Law","review":"This book is excellent. Especially for PreAdoptive Parents. Anyone who has already went to Russia can relate to much of this book. Whether you are using an Agency or Adopting Independently you should read this book. It tells all about what to expect from the laws and your dossier to what to expect while in Russia and Court. There is alot of information in it that I was not able to find anywhere else. The Laws of Russia are always confusing and the book explains them very well. If you are using an agency this book will help you answer some questions. You will have much more knowledge on what questions to ask your agency and what to expect. It helps make learning Russian words and phrases easy. If you want to learn anymore about the children in Russia this book is definitely for you. And let's not forget all the FAQ's, there all there, and we've all asked them. Good Luck and God Bless you on your Adoption."},{"Title":"Adopting In Russia: Your Rights and the Law","review":"This book is a very clear account of the adoption process in Russia. The part that I liked was the translation of the laws in Russia about adoption and the information about where children come from how they are placed in the orphanages, what type of services and education they receive and other items about Russian life in an orphanage. It covers the process from start to finish.All adoptions in Russia are FREE you need to understand what fees you will be paying and to whom. This book will make that clear.IF you plan to adopt from Russian using an adoption agency or independent you should read this book.Mary MooneyThe Adoption Guide, Inc. ..."},{"Title":"Adopting In Russia: Your Rights and the Law","review":"This is a must have book for adoption in Russia. It is well supportive of independent adoption. It covers the process of adoption in Russia in detail. The book also has a large section of Russian law, translated and explained, that is very helpful to adoptive parents. An excellent travel tool for Russian adoption."},{"Title":"Adopting In Russia: Your Rights and the Law","review":"As a parent wading through the murky waters of an Independent Russian adoption, this book answered many of my questions. It is thorough, easy to read, well organized, and does an exceptional job of outlining the process and steps of adoption both in the USA and Russia. My questions that adoption agencies were unable or unwilling to answer have all been addressed in this book. Ms. O'Rear comes well recommended from other Independent Adoptive families who have used her considerable skill, knowledge and experience to complete difficult Russian adoptions. For anyone considering saving thousands of dollars by a do-it-yourself Independent Adoption, this book contains vital information that will help you along this process. Thank You to Ms. O'Rear for writing this book."},{"Title":"Adopting In Russia: Your Rights and the Law","review":"I wish this book had been available when I started my adoption journey! The book provides a great deal of valuable information about the somewhat daunting process of adopting from Russia. It also dispells some of the misinformation that seems to be rampant. If you are looking for a clear, straight-foward and comprehensive outline of the adoption process in Russia, this book is for you. Read it carefully...it could save you a lot of money, too."},{"Title":"Adopting In Russia: Your Rights and the Law","review":"This book is a MUST to read!! You will REALLY see where your money goes after reading it! I was quite amazed. However, compared to the other reviewers, I ended up using Alaska Adoption Agency. (Excellent company by the way!) We did a 2 trip region. (Khabarovsk) Was a great overall experience. For more info on adoption, I used to go to www.adoptionforums.com Great source for MORE updated info on what's going on with the adoptions these days!"},{"Title":"Adopting In Russia: Your Rights and the Law","review":"When my husband and I adopted two children in Russia, I had this book with me. Honestly, I did not read it all, but there was a big comfort knowing I had this information as we travelled and went through the adoption process. I found nothing else like it."},{"Title":"Men Beyond the Law: A Western Trio (Five Star Western Series)","review":"I just love the old Max Brand westerns. They are based in &#34;nowhereland&#34; meaning the cities and locations are not anywhere near or are they even real places in the U.S., but they could have been. The characters are realistic and usually provide a good moral story if you are in to that. The main character of the first story for instance is confronted by a man that he has no alternative but to shoot and kill. Then he is confronted by the dead man's older brother known for his killing abilities. He turns coward and runs, but is met by an old Indian that makes him think of his cowardlyness and he then is confronted by the killer and he stands up to him and faces the reality and overcomes his fears and wins the battle by shooting the killer brother. He then is exhaulted by his family and becomes known as a brave member of the family again even though he didn't believe that he was in the beginning."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"Having read numerous true crime books, I can say that this is the finest out there. Not only is it head-and-shoulders above other true crime texts (including In Cold Blood), but it is also superb literature in its own right. The pages turn themselves. You will be shocked, repulsed, and finally relieved by what you read here. Buy this book and ensure that the same mistakes aren't made by the authorities in your town!"},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"Olsen takes the fascinating story of Arthur Shawcross and weaves a narrative that seldom slows down and offers insight into the serial killer's mind without sounding pedantic."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"We lost one of the finest true crime journalists when Olsen died. He was a genuine master, and this, in my opinion, is one of his better books. One could never fault Olsen for going light on research. He always more than did his homework, and it showed more than ever in this volume. Arthur Shawcross is so evil that when you read that the law enforcement community released him from prison you begin ranting at the walls in sheer panic. Why he wasn't surveilled more closely after his prison release is confusing. Surely a detective could have gone down in the annals of law enforcement if he had caught Shawcross before he murdered so many more individuals. In any case, I have to hand it to Olsen on this one: a superior expose on a hidden monster."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"I investigated pyroluria and found this at Wikipedia.\\"Pyroluria was initially described by Abram Hoffer, a pioneer in orthomolecular medicine and orthomolecular psychiatry. Proponents claim that pyroluria is relatively common, but few, if any, mainstream medical experts regard the condition as genuine, with few or no articles on pyroluria found in modern medical literature.\\""},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"Author Jack Olsen does a brilliant job in creating for us a terrifying portrait of a murdering psychopath--and the breath-taking race of detectives trying to find and stop his killing. Arthur Shawcross was a terrifying killer machine. He brutally tortured and killed two young children in his first cycle of death. Detectives worked night and day to find him and after excrutiating failure, they finally got lucky. But what happened next enraged the community and especially the police when a district attorney permitted Shawcross to plea bargain his sentence so that he was released after serving only l2 years. The DA was deservedly ruined by this plea bargain because Shawcross then began his second cycle of brutal murders--this time of prostitutes. Once more, you're treated to the heroic efforts of two detectives who went without sleep and food in their race to stop and capture the killer. It's like following a fascinating jig-saw puzzle. Piece by piece, the detectives began collecting enough clues to finally capture the mad man. My only criticism is that the book is much too long. I could have done without the numerous oral histories and the many pages devoted to psychiatric evaluations. Another major complaint is that there were no photographs of either the killer or the detectives or the victims. In a stor y this big, I think you really need to see pictures of evil and its aftermath. Perhaps photos were added to the paperback edition. Other than that, though, this book will keep you riveted as if it were a novel. The killer is one you'll never forget."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"Jack Olsen's book is an exceptional review of serial killer, Arthur Shawcross. The book is difficult to put down once you get started and get past the first few narratives. I have two complaints about the book: no footnotes or index ; no prologue which sets up the narrative style of the book.The book begins with a narrative from Mary Blake, mother of the boy killed by Shawcross. Not knowing the history of the case, I assumed it was Shawcross's mother in the narrative. So, I had to go back and re-read the narrative knowing now that it was Blake's mother talking about her deceased son. A prologue would have helped to explain that Olsen was going to use this narrative style.Nevertheless, the book is an exceptional read. I found it amazing that even the psychiatrists couldn't really put their finger on why Shawcross killed. One court appointed psychiatrist, mentioned at the conclusion of the book, provided an interesting diagnosis. Richard Kraus suggested that Shawcross had elevated levels of kryptopyrole and his chromosones were listed as 47,XYY. He suggested that people with this make-up have a higher proclivity towards violence, but that many of the medical community thinks this is bogus. Kraus's explanation does add quite a bit to the story of Shawcross. Olsen should have used him more in the book, rather than at the end."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"It's very diversified as the author periodicly changes to the view and quotes of the involved persons. I read some true crime books in the past and most of them started to get pretty boring after 2/3 due to the describtion of the trial. The author Jack Olsen doesn't waste the readers time by dragin out the methodics of the lawyers. Instead you receive very interesting stories from different people with different points of view. And most important: you even start to think knowing Arthur Shawcross after a while. The only negative aspect I have to denounce is the &quot;impious&quot; -so to say -lack of any photographic material. The matter of the fact is; All sick puppies outthere, looking for these strange kind of literature about serial killers, HAVE to read this, guaran-damn-ted!"},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"Arthur Shawcross 6/6/45 to 11/10/2008Shawcross was arrested and locked up for the murders of 2 children. He should have been in prison for the rest of his life. The criminal justice system let the people of the Genesee River area down when they released him early to kill and kill again and again. TWELVE women died because Justice was truly blind to them.Shawcross looks retarded to me but he was able to marry several times and always had women in his life even when he was a poor provider and poor sexual partner. As a child he was abusive to animals and a bully. He was known to be ODD. He had no friends and did not have the love of his mother. His father was a weakling.He was in the army and stationed at FT. SILL in Oklahoma (my home state) and I have always wondered if the Army and Lawton PD ever investigated murders that might have been committed by him in the area once he came to national attention.I'am willing to bet that he did kill in Oklahoma. I am sure he used and abused prostitutes in the area. His then wife says he acted very strange when they lived there.The Genesee killings were vicious and cruel. It took 12 murders to long for the police to catch him. He died in prison. I'am sorry he lived so long.Jack Olsen was a great author. He was one of the best true crime writers around. You should try and read ALL his books. I plan too. Most of the people he writes about have no heart and soul -- so he takes you into their thoughts and minds.bette/okc"},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON opens with an account of the too-short life and frightening death of eleven year old Jack Blake, whose mother conceived him as the result of an extramarital affair. Just days before he disappeared, Mary Blake confessed the truth to him, that he was a \\"misbegotten son.\\"Jack died at the hand of another \\"misbegotten son,\\" one infinitely more vile, Arthur J. Shawcross. Shawcross came from one of the oldest North Country families in New York State (and was related to Nuremberg Trials prosecutor, Sir Hartley Shawcross). The boy was marked out as peculiar almost from the beginning, and was called \\"Oddie\\" by schoolmates, who mocked him and ostracized him. As a result, Arthur Shawcross developed a rich but bizarre fantasy life. A continuing fantasy revolved around his Vietnam experiences. He claimed to be a Rambo-type soldier, who singlehandedly engaged in lurid acts of torture against enemy combatants (usually women); Army records show he was a supply clerk.Starting his 'career' as a petty criminal, he rapidly graduated to more and more dramatic crimes, which culminated in the murders of two children, Jack Blake and Karen Hill, both of whom were sexually assaulted post-mortem. A lack of evidence resulted in his incarceration for only fifteen years. He was paroled despite very strong recommendations to the contrary.As soon as Shawcross was released, he began trolling for victims again, in Rochester, New York, this time focusing on prostitutes. He killed at least fifteen women between 1988 and 1990, once again engaging in necrophilia, and then cannibalism. The rash of murders led to an odd alliance between prostitutes, pimps, and the police, as the community sought to protect its working girls. Shawcross killed with frightening efficiency---one time, a cop warned a girl to \\"be careful\\" as she walked down the street. He was the last person to see her alive. Shawcross killed her scant minutes later, virtually under the officer's nose.When caught, Shawcross was found to be an exceptionally banal man of quite ordinary mien. He lacked the predatory air of Ted Bundy and the freakishness of Jeffrey Dahmer, despite his crimes. He was not truly sociopathic, as he often expressed remorse for his acts, though he admitted he would readily kill again given the opportunity. Tests showed he suffered from 47,XYY, a genetic disorder that often results in increased aggression. He also suffered from Pyloria, a metabolic disorder which affected the level of \\"aggression\\" chemicals in his bloodstream. Still, biochemistry and genetics do not tell the whole tale---we still don't really know what made Arthur Shawcross tick.Jack Olsen does a great job of telling the story of Arthur Shawcross in a balanced and fair way. He never veers, as some True Crime authors do, into glamorizing Shawcross' gratutious violence or providing florid or titillating descriptions of Shawcross' sex crimes. This is a honest portrait of a very dangerous man.In the end, despite his crimes, I found that I didn't hate Shawcross. I neither liked him, nor sympathized with him, but I saw him as a person not as a monster. And that's an indication of how well written THE MISBEGOTTEN SON really is."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"\\"Misbegotten Son\\" is the true story of Arthur Shawcross, a serial killer in New York state.Jack Olsen researched Shawcross from childhood to his incarceration for his serial murders. He included excerpts of the psychological/psychiatric interviews and the confessions.He was diagnosed as \\"mentally ill\\" at a young age. He tortured animals and exhibited other behavior believed to be indicators for potential serial killers. He was also diagnosed as \\"borderline retarded\\" and never seemed to have a conscience, sought attention frequently, had a violent temper, and was troubled in general.His first two murders were ghastly with children as his victims. He largely got off easily. Jack Olsen describes the circumstances that led to Shawcross not being charged for both murders. The D.A. rightfully lost his job over it.Mr. Olsen follows Shawcross's trail after parole where he eventually settled in Rochester,N.Y. That trail is an easy one to follow strewn with female corpses of his 11 victims. Shawcross brags that he cannibalized some of the bodies. He is a psycho-sexual sociopath that always had an excuse for something that triggered his murderous rage. The author readily disbunks the many mythical excuses upon investigation.Jack Olsen covered all of the angles from the killer, his family, wives and girlfriends, the victims and their survivors. Not least of the characters are some law enforcement personnel from Watertown and Rochester who worked hard pursuing justice in their cases.\\"Misbegotten Son\\" is a very good true crime book that will probably leave the reader scratching his or her head and asking the unanswered question-Why?"},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"I believe Jack Olsen is one of the best true crime authors I've read. The Misbegotten Son is an extremely well done chronicle of Arthur Shawcross and his crimes as seen through the eyes of Shawcross himself and others close to him. Shawcross murdered two children in the 1970s, and through a plea agreement and good behavior was out of prison in 14 years. Shawcross, like other sociopaths, was not rehabilitated, but began killing again soon after being paroled. What is frightening is that his anger and reaction to a perceived provocation was so quick, many of his victims did not have defensive wounds. Much of the time Shawcross was easy-going and those who never saw his dark side would not believe he could murder. Particularly interesting to me was the evaluation done by Dr. Kraus. Kraus wasn't satisfied with a superficial diagnosis, and for months researched probable causes of Shawcross' sociopathic behavior. For reasons not explained, Kraus was not asked to testify during the trial, but I believe Kraus' diagnosis was right on target. Not that it made Shawcross someone to be pitied, but perhaps better understood. I also appreciated that Olsen didn't forget how the deaths of the children affected the families, nor how Shawcross devastated his own family. This is a book I'd definitely recommend."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"A fasincating insight into the psychology of a psychopathic killer. Detailed, well, written and gribbing, I read this book in two sittings. The only other book I can think of that comes close to providing such a comprehensive overview of the development of a serial killer is Morton Bain's Psychopath!, writtien by a diagnosed psychopath."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"The Arthur Shawcross story is yet another example of how unique one serial killer can be from the next. First arrested and convicted in 1972 for killing two children, upon his release Art Shawcross completely changed his M.O. and began killing prostitutes. This action alone allowed him to reign terror upon the skid row of Rochester, New York for close to two years.The author, Jack Olsen, would be more aptly described as the compiler. He chose a unique style of presenting the book by using the statements of various individuals to tell the story. Olsen interviewed friends, family, paramours, police, victims, family of victims and more. By putting all of their statements together in a timeline Olsen was able to recount the travesties of Art Shawcross like never before.Olsen even went one step further by introducing very detailed research from a defense psychiatrist. Of course, whenever the defense retains a psychiatrist it is for the purposes of proving that their client is legally insane. This Psychiatrist, Richard Kraus, wasn't able to definitively say that Shawcross was insane, but he did drudge up some other very useful physiological information about Shawcross; namely that he was a 47,XYY (or super-male as they are sometimes called) and that he suffered from a very rare and lesser known debilitation known as &#34;kryptopyrole&#34;. Even though these were strong factors contributing to Shawcross' strange and violent behavior, Kraus still duly noted that the public must be protected from him.The book made very interesting reading beyond the crimes themselves. There were some very interesting &#34;characters&#34; documented in the book that gave the book a splash of flavor. Jack Olsen did a bang up job and deserves the acclaims printed on the jacket."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"Having been born and raised in Rochester, New York, and having lived there while the prostitute killings were happening, I could not wait to get my hands on this book. I still have old newspaper clipping from The Democrat & Chronicle. This book was excellently written. The author tells in depth not only about Arthur Shawcross, but the families of the victims, and the police in Watertown and Rochester. I was beyond disgusted what he did to Jack Blake, and still feel immense sadness to his family. I named my cat Jack, for that reason. And then, far past disgusted what he did to Karen Ann Hill. HOW did he serve such little time? For rape and death of 2 children! The prosecutor in Watertown thought there wasn't enough evidence- well, hindsight is 20-20.As for when he is paroled to Rochester, I was delighted to hear streets and restaurants I have been to. Then, the killings. And it is so unfair to the victim's families that he continued to lie, lie, lie! He had an excuse for why he killed each one. One went for his wallet, one bit him, one called him \\"little man\\". What a true piece of trash. I mean, you're already caught, never going to get out- maybe tell the truth- that you simply wanted to kill them. He had a heart attack a few years ago and died- I think we all know where he is. If Satan will even let him in.The only thing I did not like- there were no pictures. Maybe I'm a little twisted- but I like to see crime scene photos that go with the story. But it is still probably the best true crime book I own, and I own many."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"Olsen is the dean of true-crime authors. His research is thorough to a fault, his presentation powerful and often spell-binding. His subject, Arthur Shawcross, is fascinating because in many ways he didn't fit the FBI's typical profile of a serial killer and thus eluded detection. Olsen presents him without hyperbole or moral interjections, which makes this tale all the more frightening. Readers who want to know how real serial killers exist in the world should definitely read this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE BEST TRUE CRIME BOOKS I HAVE READ FOR AWHILE. SOMETIMES I KEPT THINKING , IF MR.

From the time he was a child, he knew he was \\"different,\\" but never knew why, nor did he receive any insights by family or counselors. Shawcross grew up in a tiny village in upstate New York, quit school in the 9th grade after being held back twice, served in the Army and then his life fell apart. He brutally murdered 10-year old Jack Blake, for which he was suspected but never arrested. He subsequently murdered 8-year old Karen Hill and was convicted. After plea-bargaining, he received a 25-year sentence of which he served 14+ years and was released on parole.Why was he released? Basically because he was cunning and shrewd. He did everything he could to be a model prisoner, and none of the mental health team could diagnose him. Though a few psychologists thought he should never be allowed to live in an open society, there was little they could do to hold him beyond 15 years. Shortly after his release, he began a two-year killing spree, murdering 11 prostitutes before being captured. I had the strong feeling there were many more murders that we will never know about.Jack Olsen takes us through Arthur's life via an oral history and taped Q and A interview with Shawcross. The book is brilliant. By letting the people closest to Shawcross tell their stories in their own words, interwoven with dispassionate analysis, the author rivets our attention and interest. At the conclusion, a dogged psychiatrist finally uncovers that Arthur has a severe biological impairment, an extra Y chromosome and a little known compound that is a marker for violent behavior. The two together were biological dynamite.Arthur Shawcross's story is fascinating. It brings to the forefront \\"nature vs. nurture\\" arguments. It appears Arthur would have been no different regardless of where and how he had been raised. Mr. Olson brings Arthur, his family and friends, and his victims brilliantly to life."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"...one of the best books, period! Jack Olson gathered an enormous amount of first person inteviews with victims, families, psychiatrists, and Shawcross himself. Instead of getting fancy with the order of events (a la Don Lasseter), he logically lays it out for the reader. Shawcross is one sick pup and you'll get to know him real well by th time you put this book down. Only drawback--no pictures! Check out one the the cable companies' serial killer profiles to see what Shawcross looks like and his venues of murder."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"I found this book very disturbing and I have read many books on serial killers. I thought Arthur Shawcross was one of the most fascinating serial killers until I read this book. It is very well written and unfortunatley you get to know the families / friends of the victims which makes it very difficult to read without becoming emotional, especially concerning his child victims - God rest their souls - I take my hat off to Jack Olsen and the way he wrote a brilliant account, with victims and families in mind, of one very sick individual. Be ready to have your world rocked and faith in humanity almost lost. I will never read anything on Arthur Shawcross again - maybe this is in respect to his victims or just plain disgust with one man who was let loose on society thanks to an overcrowded prison system and parol officers who did not have enough information to make such a decision. You really feel for the victims in this one - very upsetting. A really, really good read."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"The book is magistrally planned and written and kept me involved from page 1 to page 592.Jack Olsen is surely worth all the 5 stars for his professional style and knowledge.

Every other book I read, I hold up in comparison. None have outshone it. The descriptions of the lives and times of the people in the book are so enlivening, you begin to feel you know them in a most authentic way. The book touched and moved me, educated me in the sick ways of a serial killer as well as the sick ways of a society that turns them loose. I strongly recommend, no, I INSIST people read this book. You will not be disappointed! And if you've never read Jack Olsen before, start now."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"Jack Olsen's ability to capture that incredible time of fear and disbelief ( as one who lived there when this horror unfolded )was beyond my wildest expectations. Often when writers focus on a small town, and a huge story within it, many of the details of the city and its denizens are lost to the story's villian, not so in &quot;The Misbegotten Son&quot;.I felt as though I was actually walking the streets of Watertown, NY as I did growing up in that pleasant community so many years ago. The names of the town officials, attorneys, and law enforcement were so startling accurate, it made the hunt for this serial killer renewed, and as frightening as it was those many years ago.I would recommend this book to anyone who is prepared for a shocking look into the mind of a demented and lost soul. If you love a ghoulish look into human-kind, &quot;The Misbegotten Son&quot; is a must Read!"},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"Raising as many questions as it answers, allowing its characters to speak in their own words/voices, and unflinchingly looking into the very worst of human behavior, Jack Olsen's The Misbegotten Son rings like Dostoevsky plopped down in upstate New York and in the presence of Arthur Shawcross. Olsen died recently, stripping true crime of a master bringer of news about murderers and rapists who, as it turns out, are always and despite their atrocities, human beings more similar to you and me than different. Olsen is a demon researcher and dug up a ton of first-person narratives having to do with the dozens of women and children Shawcross killed. Besides the words of Shawcross himself--whose pathology baffled plenty of shrinks--Olsen lets us hear from victims' relatives, cops, doctors, Shawcross's wives and girlfriends. Then Olsen arranges the material so that we never lose sight of those destroyed by Shawcross and, at the same time, spend a lot of time in Art's presence and listening to him and the women who loved him talk about things from their points of view. Olsen is too good to reduce evil to a single-shot cause--lousy childhood, no \\"role models,\\" neuropathology--what's being turned over and meditated on in The Misbegotten Son is far more mysterious and complex and important to be turned into a pop-psych conclusion. Instead he takes us as far as he and we can go into the specifics of the horror, gives us what he knows to be worth some thought, and leaves it to us to draw lessons if we can. A tremendous book judged on any terms."},{"Title":"THE MISBEGOTTEN SON","review":"This is the finest crime/mystery book I have ever read. This book is chilling!

What has frustrated me about most of these books is that they don't go very deeply into the WHY's and HOW's---Why did this happen? How did this guy get this way? This book, The Misbegotten Son, not only delves deeply into all that, it does so, eventually, at the molecular-genetic level (literally). Plus, the extensive research that also went into the lives and backgrounds of all parties involved is absolutely amazing. I hate to use such a banal phrase, but I really could not put this book down; I stayed awake for two days straight, savoring every word. The only \\"bad\\" thing about this book is that it has probably spoiled me...I can't imagine any future book coming close.

The bibliography alone has led to me several other books on the topic, which is appreciated. Really brought the city to life, and made you want to search out the street corners in question. I found myself asking older acquaintances if they ever met Richie Morrison.However I have to say the publishers did not do their job here. This book is poorly edited, suffering from simple errors such as misspellings (it's ward heeler, not ward healer), and in general confusing to those of us unfamiliar with the arcane characters filling the pages.

Richard C. Lindberg obtained his Master of Arts degree and adapted his research materials into the first comprehensive history of the Chicago Police Department to be published in the decades (an earlier informal history was really undertaken as a fundraising effort for a policemen's benevolent and fraternal society).There is a wealth of information (with a detailed bibliography and footnotes) contained in this book about the rise of the police department as the successor to the system of town constables and watchmen, nativist resistance to the growing number of Irish immigrants employed by the police department and the constant interference of venal politicians seeking to protect their business allies and favored criminal enterprises from prosecution for ordinance violations prohibiting gambling, prostitution and after hours drinking while using the force as a political patronage army.There is a cornucopia of different stories covered in this book from the Haymarket Riot to the Summerdale Burglary Scandal. There are numerous attempts to professionalize and reform the department and constant efforts undertaken by the West Side Bloc to frustrate any significant changes that would upset the divvying up of vice profits with corrupt politicians. The reader will be introduced to a cast of characters which includes such noted police chiefs as Francis O'Neill, Michael Hughes, Orlando Wilson, Frederick Ebersold and so many more!This book helped launch the professional writing career of one of Chicago's most prolific and often quoted local historians.

Discussions of limitations due to polymer chain linkage deterioration with time and under stress provide insight in to limitations that must be considered for comparitive selection of pipes and understanding the performance life limitations. Construction techniques that may enhance performance or cause accelerated failure provide important guidance for installation specification requirements."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"St. Thomas Aquinas was not a man short of words. The depth of his thinking, and the sheer volume of his texts, makes his thinking both profound and difficult. But most of all, the aspiring student of Thomas' work may be afraid to face the daunting task of diving into the vast ocean of Thomas' words.For them, this volume is exactly what they need.By gathering up some of the top Aquinas scholars in the field, this volume presents the major topics of Aquinas' work in a lucid, considered, and (most importantly) easily understood way. While certainly not comprehensive (that is not its aim, and after all, the book would be another 500 pages at least), any potential Thomist scholar would be greatly served by this volume. Not only do the various authors give the reader a general overview of Thomas' thought and development, they also introduce some of the disputes going on within academic Thomistic studies. As such, this volume is a good starting point for those interested in Aquinas, be it an academic interest or an desire to learn about the life and thought of a Doctor of the Church.Admittedly, one should not try and delve into this book with no previous background into Thomas' thought. It does presume some level of familiarity with the terminology Aquinas gained from Aristotle, as well as from the Church Fathers and others. Given this, a general background in philosophy and/or patristic/scholastic theology should suffice for most of the work.If you want to understand Aquinas, but are just starting out, you should have this book on your shelf. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"Aquinas stands along with Augustine, Duns Scotus and Ockam as the greatest Christian theologian-philosophers of the medieval period. Yet quite often Aquinas's thought is overlooked in most philosophy courses which skip from Plato and Aristotle to Descartes. This volume helps remedy the situation by giving a rigorous and up to date precis of Aquinas's philosophical thought, from his metaphysics, theory of mind and cognition, ethics, and his relation to theology. The volume is edited with contributions from Stump and Kretzmann, who themselves are leading experts on medieval philosophy.This book is a must have for any serious student of Aquinas and medieval philosophy."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"This is a nice piece. It gathers fine articles written by well-known scholars of Thomas Aquinas. The themes are very well chosen inasmuch as they go thru all the most important aspects of the philosophy of this great thinker. It gives you, at the same time, a just idea of the relation of Thomas' thought with that of Aristotle an also its independence, its uniqueness. It makes you want to dive into Thomas Aquinas' system. Don't hesitate: just buy it."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"The cover states the book is for &quot;students and nonspecialist&quot;, which I found to be not true.

American and English children's books are grouped by genre in this largely visual overview of mostly Victorian-era children's books with the colorful illustrations which made them so popular with mothers and children in their day and also of continuing interest to contemporary collectors. The illustrations are reproduced to retain their distinctive 19th-century tones and textures, most of these as chromolithographs. The varied, fetching illustrations are accompanied by Weinsteins's informative annotations containing remarks on the illustrations, characters, story, etc. of the particular book and its place in the field of Victorian children's literature. In brief introductions to each of the main genres, she refers to its influences, conventions, and aims; e. g., the moral tone of the cautionary tales and many other children's books was influenced by the 18th-century French philosopher Rousseau, \\"who theorized that children were imbued with an innate virtue\\" that could be fostered for exemplary obedience, a love of nature, and respect for reason. McLoughlin Brothers, the publisher of many of the most sought-after collectible children's books began by concentrating on small religious works for children as well as adults. The noticeable influence of German fairy tales on the American and English children's literature is cited too. Weinstein is a curator at the New York Historical Society who has done an exhibition of toys for the Museum of the City of New York. \\"Once Upon A Time\\" is an illustrated overview of the popular English-language Victorian children's books with fundamental factual information on the field. With its categorization of the different types of literature and plentiful representative illustrations, it's a good start for someone wanting to get filled in on the basics of this field."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Time: Illustrations from Fairytales, Fables, Primers, Pop-Ups, and Other Children's Books","review":"Amy Weinstein's Once Upon A Time: Illustrations From Fairytales, Fables, Primers, Pop-Ups And Other Children's Books is based upon an art exhibition of the same name and uses colorful images from Victorian-era illustrated books by Ellen Liman and her husband Arthur to provide a review of striking art objects and the rise of children's literature.

Mr Powell has done a very good job inclearly explaining some of the oracle features frequently used in a Data Warehouse like Star Queries, Star Query Transformations, Materialized Views, Dimensions objects. He has given very practical hints and performance recommendation as to when to use some of these features and how they can be tuned. The best thing I liked whether you are a new/intermediate/advanced developer/DBA, the book is loaded with examples showing how small changes affect the cost of some queries using oracle built in explain plan features. Other good feature of the book is the most of topics covered like Bitmap Indexing, Materialized view, etc. he has explained the potential pitfalls of those features and when not to use them, giving the developer/architect of the Data Warehouse system to help choosing proper design/implementation.He has also covered the partioning and parallel processing a very essential for data warehouse tuning, however you may find this particular topic in other books.The new features like model clause and how optimizer rewrites the query are well explained. Loading and extraction a key portion of Data Warehouse Architecture is covered.He does cover the Tuning Hardware Resources of Data Warehousing, but as the author mentions in the preface he gives lot better information on tuning the application/query and architecture in the book rather than tuning the hardware underneath and if we use those concepts correctly tuning of hardware resources should be the last thing we may have to do.Where ever needed he has explained how this feature is behaved in 10g and sometimes compared with previous version.I do like and agree with his tuning approach and intutively used it myself at my job all the time, where I tune my database application on a low grade machine where resources are not state of the art, where I can see maximum benefit of my tuning, rather than tuning my application on high grade machine where my application's performance shortcoming will be hidden. I think this book will be very useful for data modeler/developers/DBA or whoever is already using Data Warehouse application or are planning to use/develop a Data Warehouse system. I thank Mr Powell for sharing the knowledge and experience he has gained in this field with other developers/DBAs etc."},{"Title":"Oracle Data Warehouse Tuning for 10g","review":"I bought this book with the expectation that the author would be able to provide some insight.

My attention was captured by each woman's experience ...and I found myself not wanting to put the book down. The author lays out a blueprint for the reader, women or men, \`a track to run on' to guide you to becoming Victorious in your life journey. I highly recommend this book..... it will create new awareness's and insights for you to help you grow."},{"Title":"Victorious Woman! Shaping Life's Challenges into Personal Victories","review":"This is a book I would recommend for any woman to read, and especially women in difficult life situations. Annemarie Kelly has shared true accounts of women who have overcome difficult situations and has provided a resource that can be used as a means of support and encouragement. I picked this book up for that reason, and it's one I would buy as a gift for a friend rather than just loaning my copy out.Kelly herself is a victorious woman, not only as an author but also as a motivational speaker and advocate for women. If you haven't visited her website at www.victoriouswoman.com, you should take the time to do that as well.Shannon Albertson AmyEditor"},{"Title":"Victorious Woman! Shaping Life's Challenges into Personal Victories","review":"This is a wonderful book about ordinary women who have found a way to move from feeling like a victim in their own lives to becoming a victorious woman! It is filled with fascinating stories of women in all walks of life who have overcome their circumstances and moved on to success. Not only is it inspiring and encouraging, but Annmarie also presents a practical model for helping all women identify and move through the steps necessary to create their own successes in their life. She offers thought provoking questions and exercises at the end of each chapter that make this an invaluable book for anyone interested in improving their life."},{"Title":"Victorious Woman!

After each story the author includes a section on steps and tips to overcome the same or similar problems in your life. These are inspiring real stories of real success in rising up against the odds and against all obstacles to reclaim your life. The advice is consistent with current therapeutic techniques and helps the reader see how to overcome tough situations. Victorious Woman is a recommended read for anyone who needs to rise to victory over life problems."},{"Title":"Victorious Woman! Shaping Life's Challenges into Personal Victories","review":"In the first few pages, Annmarie introduces us to two women facing that dreaded battle with cancer. Both eventually succumb to the disease, but only one did so as a victorious woman. One gave up the war without entering the battle. The other lived her life with gusto until the very end. Even though both eventually passed, Annmarie wondered what it took for one to live victoriously until the last breath. This was one catalyst that prompted her to begin the writer's journey that became \\"Victorious Woman!\\".Each chapter contains the story of one woman, follows her through the choices she made that resulted in her particular trial, how she decided to face the trial, and then ultimately what it took to overcome that chain-reaction, downward spiral to become victorious.It was hard for me to pick any favorites, but I'd have to say that I was struck most poignantly by Nancy's and Maureen's stories. One left an abusive situation at a time when women just didn't typically leave their husbands, especially with children in tow. The other was left suddenly for a secret lover, alone with five children and no means to survive. Now that I think of it, I have to also mention Tekki, a woman suffering from dwarfism and how her body image infected her entire life until she decided to face it head-on.Some stories may not resonate with you - that's okay, because the chapters focus on one individual and her particular situation. If needed, you can always skip that person's story and move on to another. But I have to say, I don't recommend it. Several times a person's story took a turn I didn't expect and I would have missed out on the treasure their full story provided.The end of each chapter offered an overview of the aforementioned individual, questions to get you thinking about how your situation might relate, and then what practical steps you could take to begin or continue your own victory journey. I really liked this and thought it worked well for the individual reader to glean helpful information, to dig a little deeper into their own psyche, but it also would work well to utilize in a group setting to spur discussion.The final chapter defined the different stages, or \\"stepping stones\\" of where you might be in your journey and then practical methods to move you from each step toward the \\"Victorious Woman!\\" model: the Victim, the Surviving, the Advancing, and then the Victorious. The step reveals details defining each to help you determine where you may be at the present time, with suggestions to help you identify how to move forward.If you're like me, you've struggled with what Annmarie describes as the \\"good girl\\" syndrome, doing what others expect of you, for their approval, and putting aside what you want and watching a part of you die inside. Like Annmarie, maybe this will be the catalyst that helps break you from that desire to please everyone all the time and learn to be true to yourself.So if you're in need of inspiration, or you feel stuck somewhere in your life goals or relationships, I can recommend \\"Victorious Woman!\\" to assist in propelling you forward.I received a copy of this book to review as part of a blog tour and was neither paid nor compensated for my honest review."},{"Title":"Victorious Woman! Shaping Life's Challenges into Personal Victories","review":"Lillian went through emotionally (and probably physically) abusive relationships. Maureen got hit with a divorce out of the blue and had to work two jobs to help support herself and her five children with no child support coming from her ex-husband. Kathleen wound up in a failed marriage and had to pick herself back up again. Toni battled food-related health issues (along with her daughter) and had to make a decision on whether or not to put herself first. Nancy, an African-American woman in the 1950s, decided to leave an abusive marriage and raise her four sons on her own. Pattie was diagnosed with not just one cancer, but a possibility of three different cancers ... all at the same time. Alisa risked losing it all in order to do what she loved. Mary (aka Tekki) deals with dwarfism and had a hugely negative self-image.All of the women mentioned above have one thing in common: they didn't give up. Each one figured out what it was she needed to do in order to overcome her obstacles. Reading about their stories had me looking at my life trying to figure out if I was unhappy in any area and, if so, what changes I needed to make in order to overcome them.Each chapter has, what I call, a reflection section at the end themed on what was discussed in the chapter. The reflection section present questions to the reader about past and current situations. The answers are to be written in a journal.Victorious Woman! is set up to inspire women as well as motivate them all at the same time. It really is a wonderful book to have in one's possession, especially if you need that extra boost to self-start your victorious path."},{"Title":"Victorious Woman!

That means waiting for several hours while being tossed to and fro from office to office.These kind of days really do test your patience. Some times we have to remember that while waiting is hard it is a great time to get right inside yourself. I was able to really take in the ideas that Annmarie planted in Victorious Woman!

Shaping Life's Challenges into Personal Victories","review":"I always find that self help books are hard to review without sounding preachy or just plain tacky. I think the book either moves and helps the reader, or it doesn't. It really is up to the individual reading it.I found Victorious Woman! to be a nice, uplifting read. I usually read self-help books slowly, taking my time to reflect on the book. As soon as I began reading this book, I found myself breezing right through it.Author Annmarie Kelly writes this book in hopes of challenging women to become their strongest selves. The book shares the stories of nine different women. Each has overcome obstacles and not only survived, but became victorious in the end.I also found it a nice idea that Annmarie Kelly suggests the reader keep a journal handy, to log thoughts in daily while reading.As I read these women's stories, I was not only inspired by them, but I was also humbled. These women overcame illness, abuse and poverty and in the end survived and made something of themselves.Lilly, married an abusive man at a young age and after many years of putting up with his abuse, she finally decided to leave him and take custody of their children. Nancy, who left a toxic marriage to wind up living with her three children on welfare worked her way up at a bank to a supervisory position.Annmarie Kelly includes 'Stepping Stones to Victory' at the end of each story. There's a set of questions pertaining to the story. These questions and exercises are meant to be logged into your journal.I liked this practice especially:\\"For the next thirty days, practice radical happiness. Write down two ways you can do this during the next month. For example, list the ten best days or moments of your life. When you catch yourself worrying, being resentful, or thinking negatively, consciously stop this thought process and shift your thoughts to one of those special moments. Allow two to five minutes to dwell on your happy event.\\"p. 153, Victorious Woman!Another idea I thought was really good, was writing your life story. You write your story, as long or short as you want to, and look back on different decisions you have made. The idea is to reflect on the good choices verses the bad ones. Who you've become now and who you were back then. How far you have come and how much further you want to go.The author ends the book with the stepping stones to success. How some of us are victims, then survivors, then shape life's challenges to finally become victorious. She touches on so many topics and issues in this book. Everything from being a people pleaser and being passive-aggressive, to having low self esteem and letting others walk all over you.\\"Many, many of us are more victorious than we, and the world, give us credit for being.\\"p.20, Victorious Woman!I found some sound advice and helpful exercises within these pages. I recommend Victorious Woman! to those looking to be inspired, reflect on life and become motivated."},{"Title":"Victorious Woman!

Shaping Life's Challenges into Personal Victories","review":"Annmarie Kelly has given us a well-written, inspiring book for all women (you men might benefit as well) who are tired of being victims. She walks us through the depths of despair that the women profiled in this book find themselves. These are women who didn't choose to be in untenable situations, but nonetheless, there they are. Do they have a pity party? Maybe, but not for long. Annmarie spotlights how these women take a bad situation and turn it into a positive one, from hard work, belief and perseverance.This is a hard book to put down and all the while reading it you wonder, \\"Could I handle that situation and turn it around as well as she did?\\" Once finishing it, you will know without a doubt that through these woman's stories and the exercises Annmarie gives the reader in the 'Stepping Stones to Victory,' you will not only live through a crisis, you will emerge Victorious.

Tulku Thondup, who has lived in the U.S. since 1980, provides a solid overview of the various types of treasures, how they are concealed and discovered, details on the so-called dakini script in which they are written, and insights into the tertons, or treasure discoverers, themselves.

I cannot say that I found this book to be \\"enrapturing\\" or \\"dull.\\" It sort of fell in the middle. So it goes. Vonnegut's writing style is light and quick-paced, which helped me finish it very quickly and he had very unusual subplots going on all the time. I like the aspect of time and the lack of chronology in the book. As muddled as the timeline is, I can't say I found it confusing.I would have to say that Catch 22 in many ways was better. I compare it to Catch 22 because both are about WWII and both are satirical in nature, being anti-war books. I didn't especially like Catch 22, but the sense of an underlying theme was stronger than in this book. All Vonnegut was trying to do in this book (as I see it) was to make people see the ridiculousness of war and do so by treating it lightly. He makes many things that are important (like death) more trivial. So it goes. I don't mind this, but it got boring after a while. I like light books that aren't overly dense about things this touchy, but because of it I can't call this book a masterpiece. It is hard for me to take a book too seriously that doesn't take its subject matter that seriously.Interesting read, though. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The ideas and themes of this book are excellent and well thought-out. However, the manner in which they are presented leaves something to be desired. This being an anti-war novel, much of the book consists of war anecdotes condemning any kind of killing whatsoever. The fictional planet of Tralfamadore is also present, displaying another world where war is accepted as an unavoidable force, and is ultimately ignored in time. This represents a good descrpition of this book's ideals. When the main character, Blly Pilgrim, lives different parts of his life throughout the book, is where the novel takes a rather unappealing turn. It seems we read too much of his later life, and what we read gives no representation of who Billy Pilgrim actually is. As another reviewer points out, Billy is treated as a pawn, with no real personality. And because this book unremittingly goes against killing off any sort of life, in any capacity, it seems that treating Pilgrim as just another life is inappropriate. Overall, I wasn't totally pleased with the book, but would still reccomend it nonetheless."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is an intersting book which gives science fiction a neat twist. The plot is very hard to follow because of the main characters time traveling. This stream of consiousness book makes you think about life now and after death. But if you are looking for a no brainer easy read this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5 is seen as his best work and a modern classic although, having completed it, I'm left wondering why. Blending science fiction with his memoirs Vonnegut has created a meta-fictional novel where time travel is a primary plot device; one that allows him the freedom to dismiss chronology in the telling of his tale.Billy Pilgrim is a war veteran, having been a prisoner of war in a converted abattoir in Dresden. Years after the war he is involved in a plane crash which causes him to become \\"unstuck in time\\"; a strange condition that allows him to travel to any point in his life, or even to the planet Tralfamadore where the aliens that live there view life as a single representation of every moment. Through his frequent travels in time, Billy Pilgrim gets to relive many points of his life such as Dresden, his marriage, and even his death; all of these combine to show Billy's attempt at making sense of the world, his fatalist conclusions permeating the novel.The story of Billy Pilgrim doesn't start until the second chapter, the first, instead, being the author's apology for the novel's mess (although he states you can't make sense of a massacre) and how, in his mind, the book came to be. The prose is minimalist and repetitive. Phrases appear regularly or statements reappear reworded. The use of \\"so it goes\\" whenever something dies, be it a person or bubbles in champagne, is understandable, however, in its need to demonstrate death as something routine and cheap, it does become grating.There are many characters in Slaughterhouse 5 although I don't feel that any of them were given much depth. People appear for a paragraph and then Billy Pilgrim is off on his travels before you have a chance to get to know them. Even Billy failed to hold my attention, possibly because we fail to really get to know him. The author spends time telling us about him rather than showing him doing anything which, I feel, cheapens the experience. His condition, that of being \\"unstuck in time\\", leaves a nice ambiguity about the novel although it's highly probable that his travelling is a delusional passage between memories brought on by the trauma of witnessing the bombing of Dresden.Maybe the book is a product of its time or maybe there's something I'm missing but Slaughterhouse 5 is not a novel I'd recommend. Having no experience of Vonnegut's other work I can't say whether this book, being part memoir, is a typical example of his canon. While the novel is understandably a mess, I can't help but feel that the prose and characterisation are lacking and what, on paper, sounds like a great idea has been put through a literary slaughterhouse. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"L: So, what did you think of the book? Did it go pretty smoothly for you? M: Yes, I actually finished it pretty quickly. L: I was able to read through it fast at first, but there were so many random parts that a lot of times I had to read sections twice before I understood everything. M: I thought it was kind of choppy, and a lot of the time when I finished reading a chapter, I was confused. I think one of the best words to describe the book is &quot;random.&quot; L: Sometimes I wondered if maybe Vonnegut was trying to be random on purpose, because war can be really confusing and complicated like that. Like when someone is a soldier and they are not really sure where they are and they get disoriented and they don't know why they keep fighting because they don't understand everything about why the war is going on, just like when we were reading and we didn't understand all the parts of the book and how they connected and why we continued reading. M: I never thought of it that way, Laura! Interesting analogy. An example of the randomosity from chapter six: &quot;And Billy worked his hands in his muff as he marched. His fingertips, working there in the hot darkness of the muff, wanted to know what the two lumps in the lining of the little impresario's were. The fingertips got inside the lining. They palpated the lumps, the pea-shaped thing and the horseshoe-shaped thing. The parade had to halt by a busy corner. The traffic light was red. M: I totally remember that quote from the book because I kept laughing at the work &quot;muff.&quot; And I kept thinking to myself, &quot;What does this have to do with the story?&quot; What do you think about the quote, Laura? L: There were definetely many instances when paragraphs seemed to just come out of the blue. Sometimes there were important issues that I thought about because of different things that happened in the book, but a lot of the time I was just bewildered. M: I thought the book had some interesting ideas about war, since it is an anti-war book. Like, war is unstoppable. I liked how Vonnegut compared it to a glacier-there's no use trying to get rid of it, because it will always be there, no matter what. L: So it goes M: Ha ha, that's a good one. L: Vonnegut writes &quot;So it goes&quot; whenever death is mentioned in the book, which is very often. Usually it comes up after a human dies, but a few times it came up about other things, like plants, or book reviews. Do you think everything in the world is sort of alive? M: Sure, I think things are alive, but I'm not sure if they have feelings like humans do. They might to a certain extent, but I don't think a plant feels the same way I do! L: Let's start talking about the aliens M: This is a topic I really like. Those little green creatures crack me up. L: They sure did do a lot of crazy stuff! One of my favorites parts is when the Tralfamadorians explain how it takes something like 7 genders to make a baby. M: Or what about the part when Billy and Montana were getting it on, and the aliens watched like it was some kind of entertainment, and they (the aliens) treated them (billy and Montana) like they were some kind of animals being observed in a zoo, and it's weird to think how we watch animals in a zoo, and the aliens watched humans in their own &quot;zoo-like&quot; environment. It brought to mind a line from a popular song-You and me baby ain't nothing but mammals so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel L: Yeah! I bet if we watched ourselves (humans) from a distance, we would see a lot of pretty weird stuff occurrring. Sometimes we act strange, and do things that don't really make sense...just like Vonnegut doesn't always seem to make sense! M: Would you recommend this book to a friend, Laura? L: Hmm...I think it's a really important book, and it's a classic and stuff. It made me think a lot and I'm glad I've read it. I guess I would tell people they should read it when they are ready, and if they get a little confused, that's okay.

This book was amusing and intreguing. Never Read anything like it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut writes a perplexing anti-war novel based on a witless man named Billy Pilgrim who battles with his trauma of the bombing of Dresden. In the last days of World War II, Billy is left with his questions of life, death, and whether or not people have free will. But Billy is unable to find any answers. Billy tries to deal with his trauma by creating alien figures called Tralfamadorians and adopt their values of life and ability to travel in and out of time. As one Tralfamadorian states to Billy, &quot;I am Tralfamadorian, seeing all times as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains. It simply is . Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all as I said before, bugs in amber.&quot; Vonngut incorporates the theme of predestination into Billy life to allow him to deal with the many traumatic situations in his life. Billy's abduction by the Tralfamadorians takes him away to a foreign planet or a pleasant place in his life when he is confused or distressed. In Slaughterhouse Five, Billy takes the reader to many different moments in his life to give the reader a true understanding of what he has experienced. Through Billy's story, Vonnegut is able to ask the question of whether life is set in stone or whether the human perception of freedom to make choices is just another foolish notion that people create in order to have some control over their lives. And it is a question that Vonnegut leaves to the reader to decide. If you are interested in reading an anti-war novel that debated the question of free will and predestination of life, Slaughterhouse Five is definitely a book that will strike your interest."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Listen: Vonnegut does nothing less that create a modern American masterpiece.

And so it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In reading this book, I gained knowledge of one's world. How things in life affect every aspect of our being. Somethings are not for our understanding and the writer clearly shows this. He lets us into his personal life and his thoughts. This book is hard to follow at first, but once the climax erupts, a new world of understanding is opened. I would recommend this book to anyone who is not afraid to hear the truth. This book is real and I think it needed to be written. It will not stop war, but it will open many minds to the effects of war.

Of course, Kurt Vonnegut has an extrodinarily abstract mind, and it takes a similar person to follow this story. If your one that likes a traditional storyline with a start, middle, then end, then this is not the book for you. Instead this book jumps all over the place from pas,t to present, to future, to alien worlds, to World War II, to a regular house. I personally LOVED his interpretation of alien life and I think he does an extrodinary job describing certain theorys that I previously thought were inconceivable. Kurt Vonnegut has a wonderful way with words and I definatly recommend this book to the open-minded. -Tyler DeLisle"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is amazing.

What I got was a semi-fictitious story focusing on a young male soldier, who really wasn't much of a soldier (or a man, for that matter) and who I deemed to suffer from obvious psychiatric problems.This book, in many ways, was a disappointment for me. I had read Vonnegut's &quot;Welcome To The Monkey House&quot; previously and was expecting the same style of writing and satire in this book. Unfortunately, the satire that was present was downplayed by the mental wanderings of the book's main character, Billy Pilgrim.&quot;It is short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. Everybody is supposed to be dead, to never say anything or want anything ever again. Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre, and it always is, except for the birds.&quot; (pg. 19)I have found this quote from the beginning of the book to be true for the book. The formatting of the book is jumbled and short and all mixed together. It's as if the author threw all the different parts of the story in a bowl and drew them out one by one, pasting them into a book in the order he drew them. That does not create a good book.However, this is not to say that I didn't enjoy some aspect of the book. The colorful language amused me, especially when it popped up unexpectedly. But other than that, I found the book to be lacking the majority of the qualities that make a good book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"To be utterly honest, I thought Slaughterhouse Five was really disappointing. Prior to my reading experience, I heard from many former readers of the novel that it was excellent. Hence, as my expectations were quite high, the magnitude of my dissatisfaction escalated when I realized the plot was so cluttered and random.Unlike other novels, throughout the entire course of the story, the main character travels erratically to dissimilar spheres of time. Billy constantly goes back and forth into random parts of the past and his supposed future, leaving the reader confused as to how each portion is to correlate with each other. I found these jumps in time annoying. Yet, whereas the visits to his past are psychologically logical, the trips to his fabricated future are quite meaningless. I especially had great difficulty digesting the part about Billy's abduction by toilet plunger aliens. What is the significance of this particular part of the story?Furthermore, another aspect of the novel that I found displeasing is its pessimistic tone. Billy experiences the tragedy of war, the loss of his sanity, the loss of his colleagues and wife, the loss of true perception, and eventually, the loss of dignity. How can one individual face so many hardships in the course of one lifetime? Although he reaps the fruit of success in the initial years of his marriage and career, all of these things are completely disregarded with the traumatic episodes that occur afterward. With Billy's tragedy in mind, I strongly believe that this story was way too dismal.Through my years of education, I have read many war stories as well as narrations of insanity. Generally, with the two interconnected, novels normally comprise of characters and events that are realistic and rational. Yet, in this particular novel, the author seems to overdevelop his characters and events pointlessly with ridiculous concepts. While Vonnegut's introduction of Billy Pilgrim's war experience is credible, the transitions that this character undergoes are absolutely absurd. The later half of the book was just a collection of non-sense.Overall, my perception of this novel is negative. I found it strange, frustrating, and awkward. Of course, I'm still thankful for the reading experience though. Because of it, I discovered that not all stories are conservative."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"being dyslexic does not provide me with the time and patience to read a book like this.

The latter covers perhaps four pages in total and the \\"time travel\\" schtick serves no purpose whatsoever as it jumps back and forth between moments that could just as well have been told chronologically.The style of writing is simple and childish.

I finally got around to reading it recently. It is appalling that this is considered a classic and that it is studied as an example of American literature.Slaughterhouse five deals with Billy Pilgrim, a WWII veteran who is \\"unstuck in time\\" and jumps back and forth from his experience as prisoner of war in WWII Dresden to mundane suburban concerns as a wealthy optometrist to life as a zoo exhibit on the planet Tralfalmadore.Being \\"unstuck in time\\" could be a metaphor for mental illness but Vonnegut's telling of it makes me feel otherwise. He actually means for the reader to believe in this infantile nonsense.The novel is written in a childish absurdist style that becomes wearisome very quickly. This short novel of 187 pages has little to say: War is bad, killing is bad. Duh. There is the idiotic repetition of the phrase \\"and so it goes\\" every time death is mentioned. Even the death of bacteria or a stale glass of water.Vonnegut also implies that he did not want to write about this subject but has somehow been forced. The opening chapter details how he had not dwelt on the memories of his wartime experiences for decades and was finally forced to reflect on them in writing this book. This unwillingness shows. I estimate that less than a quarter of the novel actually deals with the events he witnessed in WWII. If Vonnegut had been able to write a normal wartime memoir that would have been a much more interesting book. Instead we have this puerile fantasy that, perversely, is treated as great literature.I am especially amazed that this book is studied in English courses across America.

The literati have doubtless showered numerous accolades at its feet, though what, for instance, is there to celebrate in this pure dreck?Vonnegut's cheap cynicism? The novel itself, when not drowning in a sea of depression and cathartic murkiness, hardly makes a joke worth mentioning that doesn't revile the establishment, turn the hardship of soldiers into a complete and utter disgrace, revile all war, and then have the sheer scholastic arrogance to proclaim once and for all, as though this distorted face were really truth. Yes, as a 'satire', it fails completely.So we come down to technique. The structure of the novel is mildly interesting, and the minimalism flows well. The writing is fairly clear and potentially charged; if only the subject matter had been improved upon, than perhaps the author could have gotten away with the awards. As such, this is hardly the case.In short, it's nothing groundbreaking. And moreover it is dangerous. Not to mention very worthless. Had it been a great absurdist parable like Catch 22 (which, though also wrong, has strong artistic license, and will likely stand the ages) than I would have rather different sentiments.1 star."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut has penned a celebration of the anti-hero, the story of an unwitting man who takes a winding, chronologically non-linear dash through the space/time continuum. Billy Pilgrim experiences combat in Europe during World War II while simultaneously experiencing life as a successful optometrist in Ilium, New York twenty years later. Complexity to complexity, in 1967, Billy is kidnapped by aliens and kept captive in a zoo on the planet Tralfamadore, naked and with a porn star for his cellmate.That's the gist. How's the pudding, you ask?Great. A frolicking mixture of anti-war sentiments and social commentary, Slaughterhouse 5 teases, humors, shocks and entertains. In expanding the topical and structural boundaries of the American novel, Vonnegut effectively gives a new generation of writers permission to experiment. Had it not been for Slaughterhouse 5, my first novel could not have included a trial of the Lord for crimes against humanity, court proceedings conducted against the backdrop of the Iraq War. Unlike Mr. Vonnegut, I didn't manage to include aliens and porn stars in the storyline, but there's always a next time.(Smile)And so Vonnegut has created a literary masterpiece, one that successfully melds the dispassionate sensibilities of existentialism with a cubist form, telling a story that is at once funny, sad, shallow and profound."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It is daunting to attempt to say anything unique about a novel that already has 700+ reviews on this site, but here goes.....I somehow managed to get through all of high school and college without ever having been exposed to this great book. And in retrospect, I think that may have been for the better, as I believe that many of this book's themes would have been lost on a younger me. Mainly the theme of destiny versus freewill, and the idea that in becoming \\"unstuck in time,\\" Billy Pilgrim has a better perspective on his life as a whole. That doesn't however, always translate into making better choices along the way, and hence the idea that destiny is ultimately inflexible.This book is the perfect example of a modern classic and remains relevant in many ways that it might not have had it been written just ten years earlier."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a great book and an interesting insight into Kurt's world. The long awaited Dresden Novel that he claimed to be working on for so many years. I didn't find it funny, but sobering. There are many many great quotes to be taken from it and I'm sure they have been taken many times. It is worth reading for it's history alone, but deeper still there are tidbits of meaning and reality for the reader. The ending is a bit different than I would have expected, but I really enjoyed it, and consumed it in less than a day ( as I did also, with Mother Night). It is sobering and somber, but a great book, either way. It deserves it ranking with the top 100 novels of all time, and should be allowed in High Schools as required reading with or without the cussing.I am happy to have added it to my collection. But sad that there will not be more books like it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I have sat here for some time now pondering on what exactly to write, but with so many other reviews, which are excellent, I am left a bit uncreative. Let's just say this is a great book. SL5 was recommended to me in a lit class I took last semester, and I picked it up a few weeks ago and devoured it the next day. It was one of those books that was so original, meaningful, and funny (in a dark humorous way), that I could not put it down. I even left a spaghetti stain on a page because I was reading while eating.Anyway, all these reviews say so much about the book, that all I have to say is I agree with all the other good reviews. This is a great book, and it is hard not to like it. Check it out, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I can almost imagine the author sitting at his typewriter, his wallpaper outline in yellow crayon tacked on the wall, typing a line at a time--all the while wondering if this book would ever be finished.Because that is how it reads. It's random, with moments of brilliance. The first and last chapters were actually intro and epilogue, while Chapters 2 and beyond were the real \\"story\\". Characters may or may not play a part. A frozen hobo is a stark image, but what does it mean? Words and colors are interwoven - beginning with breath that reeks like mustard gas and roses, only to find it again in an underground tomb in Dresden. Like I said, brilliant--but random.I read it twice, and liked it better the second time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Despite its international acclaim and enormous cult fan base, Slaughterhouse-Five is a novel that by conventional standards should not have been. \\"This book was written by a pillar of salt,\\" author Kurt Vonnegut remarks in the prologue as he attempts to relive the Dresden firebombing; and from that moment on the reader goes on a time warped journey through the past, future, and fourth dimension always returning to the horrific massacre during World War II that he can never explain because there can be nothing to say.After serving in the war as one of the worst soldiers ever, he marries a rich fianc&eacute; he doesn't love and works a job he doesn't deserve. Although he has enough wealth to give him security, he has no control over his life because he has become \\"unstuck in time,\\" fast forwarding and rewinding to different moments in his life, never knowing which one he will visit next.At some point he is kidnapped by plunger-shaped aliens from the planet Tralfamadore and adopts their fatalistic views that time is not linear but a moments that you can visit any time. In this way, the structure of the novel reflects this Tralfamadorian ideal, jumping out of order instead of going chronologically. Billy claims to draw comfort from this but the reader is ultimately struck by the impotence of this character.Although Vonnegut died last year at age 84 (so it goes), his masterpiece is still considered one of the most remarkable anti-war books to be published; bizarre and humorous yet subtly heartrending, this novel boldly strips down the glorified war epic, ultimately concluding that there are no words for such a senseless experience with the destruction of war.Poo-tee-weet?"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Have wanted to read it for years. Ordering and shipping very efficient. Thank You"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"One of the first 'science fiction' books I ever read. Really whet my appetite for the genre. Vonnegut does not sacrifice character development for quirks of plot. Surprisingly easy to follow, despite all the jumping about in time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is just plain weird. The main character is \\"unstuck\\" in time and lives events out-of-order. There's an alien abduction, and he's taken to live in one of their zoos. And there is no traditional conclusion, so we never get a nice wrapped-up story line.However, Slaughterhouse-Five is laugh-out-loud funny in parts, such as when we get to hear an interpretation of the Bible by an alien researcher. And for being a great work of literature, there's plenty of profanity, crude humor, sexual innuendo, and violence (death and detailed discussions of torture).Overall, an entertaining read worth checking out."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (1922 to 2007) was an American novelist known for works blending satire, black comedy, and science fiction, all intertwined. He was larger than life and very unconventional. He is recognised for three important novels: the present work, Cat's Cradle, and Breakfast of Champions. His main attribute as a novelist involved the ability to cross lines melding reality with science fiction and still have works that were considered important works of literature.As a reader the most startling thing for myself was that he spends chapter one talking directly to the reader giving a background introduction to the novel, and then he uses an imaginative plot to make his point. I found the introduction a bit unsettling.\\"I would hate to tell you what this lousy little book cost me in money and anxiety and time. When I got home from the Second World War twenty-three years ago, I thought it would be easy for me to write about the destruction of Dresden, since all I would have to do would be to report what I had seen. And I thought, too, that it would be a masterpiece or at least make me a lot of money, since the subject was so big.\\"The book is based on his own experiences as a soldier and prisoner of war, and that had a profound influence on his writings. Vonnegut witnessed the bombing of Dresden which destroyed most of the city. Vonnegut was one of seven prisoners of war in Dresden to survive in an underground meat locker of a plant known as Schlachthof F&uuml;nf or Slaughterhouse Five.The vehicle of the story is the life of the protagonist Billy Pilgrim who takes a trip back using time travel. He uses Pilgrim to discuss life and death, and his supposed visit to the planet of Tralfamador. Billy Pilgrim is a World War II veteran who survived the Dresden bombing as did Vonnegut.The novel is a bit odd, unique, and entertaining. I thought that Vonnegut's introduction where he talks directly to the reader was not needed but harmless, and overall the novel was a bit short as a masterpiece. But it was a unique piece of literature that made point and was an interesting read that everyone should read.Was it on par with other short works - that are considered to be masterpieces - such as Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilych or Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men? The reader can decide. I thought it was better than Steinbeck but short of Tolstoy."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five is an epic journey through time, space, and the human mind. On this journey the reader follows an unlikely hero, Billy Pilgrim, through his travels from Dresden to an alien planet, Tralfmadore, and back again--in no particular order. The events of the novel--though seemingly random--give an insight into the meaning of war, and the human experience. Though it is an antiwar novel, and is about the bombing of Dresden--one of the worst, if not the worst, bombings in history--it has a lighthearted tone, and does not really focus on the events of the bombing itself. The protagonist was actually underground during the bombings, and the reader only really sees the after-effects. Vonnegut's antiwar sentiment is not found in gruesome details of the horrors of war, but in the way he presents his views on choices and fate.Billy learns--while on Tralfmadore--that time is not what he thinks it is, and that humans are, in a sense, timeless. Therefore, because time does not have a hold on people, what happens is decided more by fate than any choices they make. This presents an interesting viewpoint for a novel about war. It makes the reader wonder about the meaning of death, and war. If people would have been able to see the horror of the bombing of Dresden beforehand, does that mean that they would have done anything, or could have done anything to stop it? In this light, the question faced is, what then is the purpose of killing? If it truly means nothing, then why is it done? The author says that massacre's are meaningless, and then conveys this through his views on humanity in an interesting and incredibly intriguing style.Reading the novel, Vonnegut seems to be throwing ideas and concepts randomly at the pages. It is difficult to follow, and needs to be really thought about to understand (I'm not even sure if I still understand it). The beauty of the message of the novel is found in so many strange details that do not seem to connect, but that somehow create a web of intertwining ideas and messages that, when looked at from afar, creates a picture of war as it truly relates to the human experience."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five was a building that served as a German POW camp during World War II. Kurt Vonnegut was a prisoner there and witnessed the firebombing of Dresden. The long lasting impressions of this incident inspired him to write a fictional story about Billy Pilgrim's experience as POW, mixing fiction with reality.I think this novel is about the horrors of war, the sacrifice of young men who are still like children for the purpose of defending your country, and the helplessness of humans to direct their own destiny. The author accomplishes this in a jumble of events where Billy's experiences and observations of war and encapturement are mixed with his mental time travel through his life. Billy's time travel occurs after he was abducted by the aliens know as Tralfamidoreans on his daughter's wedding night. He was transported to their planet for several years to be observed like an animal in a zoo. The Tralfamidoreans believe that life occurs in 4 dimensions and whereas you cannot change how it enfolds, you can visit any moment in your life as it is occurring. Death will not exist because you can always visit another part of your life at the same time.Slaughterhouse-Five is a very enjoyable novel. The sadness and horrors of war are balanced with the absurdness of Billy's postwar life and the Tralfamidorean influence. Two things in this book have really made an impression on me. First was the terrifying reference stating \\"the candles and soap were made from the fat of rendered Jews and Gypsies and fairies and communists, and other enemies of the state\\". This made a terrible impression on me and I really hope it is a myth. Second was Vonnegut's repetitive \\"and so it goes\\" statement whenever someone or something dies. I like that phrase and now find myself using it quite often. This was my first Kurt Vonnegut novel and I can't wait to read another."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Not enough praise can be heaped upon this book. Its sentences are lean, mean, fighting machines. Its characters are humanely represented, sorrowfully represented, and humorously represented. Vonnegut's imagination fuses with memory here, as elsewhere in the body of his work, but it is in this novel that he's forged something utterly perfect in its emotional range and his ability to move through various times and places, past, present, and even future, with the literal blink of an eye."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children's Crusade is a witty, comedic, yet sad satire of war. The story follows Billy Pilgrim during World War II, as he becomes \\"unstuck in time\\". His life jumps around; he is able to see his death but not be dead and relive moments of his past and experience moments of his future long before they take place. Some of those moments include his experience in World War II, the bombing of Dresden, and living on the distant planet Tralfamadore - yes, that is correct. Vonnegut blends science fiction into his anti-war satire. The result is a highly entertaining read, with moments of comedic bliss quickly followed by sad futility on an insight into humanity (and Tralfmadorianity)."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Slaughterhouse- Five\\" is a novel that at its core is about the very meaning of human existence. Are we merely going through the motions of life, or do we control our destinies? What are our obligations to our fellow humans? Is there any great design to the universe and our lives? There is nothing new in those questions, but the way that Mr. Vonnegut examines these questions is still unique and relevant, decades after this novel's first publication.The novel's protagonist is Billy Pilgrim, whose metaphorical name gives insight into his journey. Billy Pilgrim goes through life; he does not participate in it. Billy believes that all action is preordained, and thus he lets life happen to him. Yet despite this pathetic choice, Billy is an everyman worth rooting for. He is content with his lot, even if we the readers are not content with his passivity.Like the best novels, S5 lets the reader choose what the right thing is, and allows more than one side to every issue. Vonnegut has managed to write a book about war, human nature, natural selection, religious belief, death, history, and the value of choice in one's life. He tackles these plethora of themes in a novel that encapsulates time travel, aliens, WW II, and the humdrum of middle class life. Now that is a feat.And the greatest thing about this novel is that every read yields new insights and lessons. Its themes are vast, and its pleasures continue to grow. I have read it over six times, and I learn something new each time. It is simplistically written and executed, but it is a work that is very deep and wide.Read and think and you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant. There's not a lot more I can say without writing a book myself. Funny and sad at the same time. Original. I look forward to reading more Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"What can I say? One of the seminal works of the 20th century in a nice, affordable edition."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"depending on the ISBN of the version of SH5 you are looking for, you may end up buying this product and getting the copy you don't need. i ordered this expecting to get the 275 page copy with the new sexy cover (red yellow). instead i was sent a little copy (older paginations at about 220 pages with the new red yellow cover.buyer beware!otherwise, this is an incredible book that is both experimental, groundbreaking, and innovative! a must read for any fan of literature!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five is a deep book that can be read on many levels. On the surface, it's a science fiction tale that deals with a man, Billy Pilgrim, who was purportedly abducted by aliens and can become \\"unstuck\\" in time, and can move back and forth between and re-experience moments of his life at any point between his birth and death. A signficant part of the book deals with the Billy's experiences in World War II and being present when the German city of Dresden was destroyed by Allied bombing in February 1945. However, this tale is at least in small part, autobiographical, as the books writer, Kurt Vonnegut, served in World War II and many of the decriptions given in the book are clearly derived from Mr Vonnegut's experiences. It was largely to read about these experiences that I bought and read Slaughterhouse-Five.Many books have been written about the destruction of Dresden, but Mr Vonnegut's point of view ... that of an American POW being held in Dresden ... is fairly unique. Even if fiction, at various points in the narrative, Mr Vonnegut apparently speaks directly to the reader, to say that he was the person that such and such event occurred to. The book is written in a darkly humorous style, and the books shifts from present to past to future quite often, as befitting the experiences of someone who has become unstuck in time.I enjoyed the book as entertainment, and felt that it also added to my understanding of what happened at Dresden in World War II. My only quibble with the book is that the ending seems a bit flat to me, although given that the book is an anti-war science fiction novel, it may not be entirely out of place."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"An excellent excellent novel. I highly recommend reading this... I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I still remember the first time I finished this book. I turned that last page and just went wow. The writing is phenomenal, and the emotion behind this book is intense.As a reader, this is hands down, one of my favorite books. As a writer, I can only admire Vonnegut's masterpiece."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The first time I read this book I did not own it, I was borrowing it from a friend who told me it was something that I would like to read. Usually when someone suggests a book to me I take it with a grain of salt, however this time was different. It is literally the only book that I can say I read in a day and then began rereading it as soon as I had finished it. It's easily in my list of favorite books. And the irony of rereading it just proves Vonnegut's presentation of a cyclical life. Anyways, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This one is a must-read, and Vonnegut at his best. I don't want to reveal the plot because I enjoyed the discovery."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I'm not a big fan of Kurt Vonnegut. I read \\"Cat's Cradle\\" and \\"Galapagos,\\" and didn't like either one of them. I would describe both books this way: a random series of unhappy events, written in simple language, and tied loosely together by a trite, unfocused thesis. I suppose I just don't \`get' Vonnegut. Anyway, I'm happy to report that I *did* like this book, even though (oddly) I would describe it much the same way. The book is - at its core - an anti-war book, at the same time exploring concepts of free-will and the nature of time. Vonnegut proposes that time is an illusion, and that everything actually has happened, happens, and will happen all at once. The book is written in a non-linear way, and the main character jumps back and forth in time to illustrate this idea. It works! As you're reading the book, it seems as though everything is happening at once. That makes the unhappy events less upsetting, because if you don't like the unhappy times, you just \`don't look at them' (as Vonnegut suggests), and focus instead on another event that's going on simultaneously. Death is something that just happens sometimes - \`so it goes' - but if you don't like it, then you simply choose to look at something else. It's not 100% clear to me whether Vonnegut was poking fun at these ideas, but regardless he wrote a unique, thought-provoking book. I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I saw a few magazines when I was in Vietnam. I spent a week in Cambodia before coming home in 1970. The novel I wanted to read most was Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five. Being drafted for service in the American army was part of a global strategy maintained for superpower purposes, and the limited warfare I took part in with a few free fire zones and secret CIA armies in neighboring countries were minor matters compared to the idea that a real war would allow us to wipe out everything we hate. Opinion polls about fighting godless Commies used unpopular as a euphemism for what many people would not allow to be printed in newspapers.In introducing Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut asked some questions of the US Air Force that got a response covering the bombing of Dresden with secrecy. Cambodia had been bombed in ways that were not revealed when Nixon claimed in 1970:Up to this point, we have scrupulously respected the sanctity of international borders.Books seemed like the best way to turn war inside out. I have read many books that other people consider obscure because books reveal human aspects of behavior that are not what anybody thinks openly. Books that have been published after the death of an author can reveal what only a fool would admit. The goal of self-overcoming that Nietzsche tried to make a style of transvaluation of all values when he was preparing his last works digs much deeper than comedy into the way a mind can find paths in thinking that has become twisted because it is never the same time.Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.The entire history of religion, philosophy, anthropology, and any expectations of an end of the world have been hopping back and forth between such weird alternatives that the idea of a learning curve with a money mudslide wiping out society keeps hopping back and forth until nobody knows what shoe to expect on the other foot the next time around. Even our short term is thinking up euphemisms for tremendous repudiations."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read this book because it's labeled as such a classic. It was an interesting book but I found it to be highly overrated.After thinking about the book some more I decided that it's an interesting commentary on a war culture. We as a world haven't experienced war and death on the level of the world wars in a long time. After trying to view the book from that point of view I can see it as an interesting view on the nature of death."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In the opening chapter of Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut describes his service in World War II where, as a prisoner of war, he witnessed the fire bombing that destroyed the German city of Dresden, and his long struggle to write a war novel that reflected what happened. He visits a fellow POW, Bernard O'Hare, looking for a fresh perspective on the event, which he finds from O'Hare's wife. She's openly hostile to the the idea of a war novel. If it's anything like most war stories, she says, Vonnegut will cover up the carnage with glory and cast characters more like John Wayne than the children who really fought and died. Vonnegut promises he will do no such thing, and Slaughterhouse-Five is the fulfilment of that promise.With typical whimsy and dark humor, Vonnegut presents the life of Billy Pilgrim, a well to do optometrist from upstate New York who witnessed the destruction of Dresden as a prisoner of war and, many years later, was abducted by aliens.Billy has also come unstuck in time, unpredictably experiencing different episodes in his life. The departure from linear time provides Vonnegut the opportunity to alternate between Billy's war experience, the fallout later in life, and his alien abduction. True to Mrs. O'Hare's wishes, Vonnegut's soldiers are young boys who experience war in equal parts horror and absurdity.Our understanding of Billy's struggle with the war - during and after - are revealed mostly through his actions. As Billy is captured and taken to Dresden he trudges along, just trying to stay alive. But Billy's erratic behavior in the years after the war reveal a deep struggle with the horrors experienced. He has a nervous breakdown, troubles his daughter, and becomes rather well known for his lectures on flying saucers and the true nature of time.See, in 1967 Billy was abducted by aliens and kept in a zoo on their home planet, Tralfamadore, for several years. During his abduction, Billy learned that, unlike humans who experience time moment to moment, the Talfamadorian see all things in their temporal entirety; a fixed object from birth to death. Billy goes on to preach this existential perception back on earth, and the reader is left to wonder what consolations it provided Vonnegut.For all the quirky science fiction and dry humor, it is Slaughterhouse-Five's deep sorrow and plea for humanity that lay at its core. It is an inevitable read for anybody invested in good literature, Vonnegut's most essential book, and like nothing else in the canon of great war novels."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five turned out to be a very different book than I had anticipated going into it based on some descriptions I had read of it. At times the book was tragic, other times poignant and other times a bit comical......sometimes all 3 at the same time. Wherever Billy's story took us on this story that centered around his time in World War 2, there was always a sense existential fatalism to the tale that was driven home frequently by his key phrase in this book, \\"so it goes...\\". At times that phrase was an interesting device, at times it was annoying, at times I thought it was overused but by the end it was clear that his use of that phrase was really a cliff notes version of his fatalistic view of war, tragedy and inevitably of loss presented here.Overall I liked the book quite a bit, though initially the stream of consciousness style narrative made it a bit challenging to become engaged in the events that were unfolding. But, once I settled into the groove I was able to join Billy's \\"pitiful\\" time in the war and his unthinking acceptance of the events that unfolded in his life regardless of their impact on him. It was also a book that challenges one to make sense of this life and question where meaning can be found so in that regard, this book was a success and better than most because it entertained while making you think and reflect.So all in all, I enjoyed this tale quite a bit. While this was my first Vonnegut novel, having now acquired a taste for him, I'm sure it won't be my last."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read this book as a teenager and liked it, but didn't quite get it.I recently reread it and must say it is an excellent read. It's strength is as a humanistic war memoir that perfectly captures the horrors of war, it's really not a science fiction book in my opinion. I interpretted the whole subplot about being kidnapped by aliens as a delusional fantasy invented by the protagonist to deal with the repressed pain from his war experience when he was just a \\"baby\\" as Vonnegut's friends wife references in his intro. I have nothing against suspending disbelief when reading science fiction, but for this book, to me this is the most satisfying interpretation. It fits perfectly with Piligrim's dissastisfaction with his marriage- he's conveniently mated with a porn star by the aliens- and his obsession with Kilgore Trout- who just happened to have written a very similar story. To deal with horrific flashbacks, he invents utopian flash fowards where perception of time and space are altered- thus becoming unstuck in time. It is only in this new altered way of viewing time and death that the world could make sense to him.That being said, enjoyed the book very much, I look forward to rediscovering more Vonnegut. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is Vonnegut is sometimes annoyingly clever, \\"and so it goes\\" ad nauseum for example, and the couple times in the book where he breaks down the fourth wall so to speak, and pops into the narrative as himself for no apparent reason other than to be clever. Distracting from otherwise superb prose. Also his little doodles didn't add much at all."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse 5 is a very.... interesting book. Kurt Vonnegut has a very unique and original style that comes out very vividly in this book. In this book Vonnegut has some really strong, descriptive writing. This is seen especially when he is describing things or situations that occur multiple times in the book, such as breath like \\"mustard breath and roses...\\". A weakness that I saw in this book is that it is really confusing. Vonnegut has incorporated the element of time travel into this novel and the ways in which he discusses and elaborates on the time travel of the main character frequently gets very confusing and it is metaphorically, quite easy to get lost in time in sections of this book. In order to enjoy this book you just have to know that Vonnegut is anything but a nonfiction or realistic fiction author he has his own sci-fi style that has some very unique and interesting aspects in how he describes and sees things."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In Slaughter House Five, Kurt Vonnegut writes about Billy Pilgrim's adventure through war, time travel, and life in the end. Vonnegut is able to write well because of experience from writing many other books.Vonnegut's main point is that war is bad because things die from it. He does an excellent job of proving his point, by having an enourmous amount of objects and characters die. He reminds you of how much death there is by adding the short phrase \\"So it goes.\\" after every death.Vonnegut is saying something by having aliens in his story. The aliens teach him to take time in one chunk, instead of dividing it with different events.Slaughter House Five can be compared easily with Catch-22. Catch-22 is also an anti-war book, and shows downsides of war. People die, go crazy, and hate war in both. Both books use a lot of humor.The book was not written in any order. It may confuse some people. Adventurous readers may like this, for a challenge."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This \`anti-war book,' as Vonnegut himself has called it, focuses on the life of a World War II prisoner of war named Billy Pilgrim. Pilgrim (along with Vonnegut, the narrator) was present when Dresden was bombed and destroyed by the Allied forces, killing far more people than the atomic bombs in Hiroshima or Nagasaki. The bombing, and the ensuing ruinous carnage of the former city, serve to show the horrors of war, and the violence and destruction of innocent lives which are sometimes a price of the bloody game of war.But this is not your typical anti-war book. Vonnegut does not openly criticize the Allies for bombing Dresden--in fact, one of his characters points out that, at the time, it seemed like it had to be done. Another, more subtle consequence of war is the focus of this book, however, and this consequence is exemplified in the mental state of Billy Pilgrim. Billy thinks he has stepped outside of time, and no longer sees things chronologically. Instead, the novel constantly jumps back and forth in time to different events in Billy's life, including a supposed alien kidnapping. Though the book treats these time jumps as real, enough hints are given for the skeptical reader to doubt. The war left Billy's life in shambles, and he spends the bulk of the novel trying to make sense of it all (hence the non-linear narrative).Vonnegut seems to be showing us two ugly sides to war. The first is the side we all know by now--the innocent victims, the meaningless slaughter, the terrible destruction. But the second, subtler side can only be seen in Billy Pilgrim's character, and it seems this is another horrible effect of war. War causes carnage and bloodshed while it is occurring, but it also has long term effects. Depression, anxiety, and many other forms of mental illness can come about because of war, as Vonnegut so eloquently points out in this novel. This is considered to be one of the greatest modernist novels of the 20th century, and with good reason. I highly recommend this unique take on war."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut is without a doubt an excellent author. His novels, both shockingly tender and painfully cynical, compose a body of work that ranks among the best satire ever written. The problem with \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\", however, is that it has received much more attention than it is due. It is one of the few books of Vonnegut's that I have read and felt disappointed with.Because this novel is promoted so heavily in university's and high schools, and a beloved of many critics, it is unpopular to criticize it. And while it is a strong argument against war, and marks a turning point in Vonnegut's writing, as well as being an early example of post-modernism, it simply isn't that satisfying a read.Perhaps it is because Pilgrim is a more difficult character to empathize with than Kilgore Trout or Eliot Rosewater, the protagonists in other novels who make an appearance in \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\". It may also be that Vonnegut hasn't quite gotten his new style down pat, and so when he leaps from idea to idea and place to place it doesn't always seem to work quite right, the way it does in \\"Breakfast of Champions\\".Whatever the case, anyone interested in reading Vonnegut should almost certainly begin with \\"Cat's Cradle\\", and move outward from there. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" will show you Vonnegut at his best, and keep you hungry for more, even when you trip over the occasional novel like this one."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"fyi for vonnegut fans: he was in fact in the 106th division in WW2. The 106th was in Europe for 15 days prior to absorbing the brunt of the Germans at the Battle of the Bulge. He was became a prisoner of war, and was sent to Dresden just prior to the fire bombing. The American prisoners were in fact kept in a makeship slaughterhouse.

He sets the main caracter (Billy Pilgrim) as a soldier in World War II. From there he tells the adventures that Billy goes through. Som events are from Billy's real life and opther ar from Billy's imagination. These events mixed wioth Vonnegut's dark humor leave you lauging continuously throughout the book. Yet at times I felt bad for the pain that World War II cause Billy to experience. This is an awesome book and I would recommend it to anyone thatis interested in literature."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"... Slaughterhouse-Five is a convoluted tale, and thus difficult to describe. On first inspection, it is the story of Billy Pilgrim, a drafted soldier who survives the infamous firebombing of Dresden. It&iexcl;s the meaning, however, the overall effect of the book, that is important. The novel is not actually about a man who lives his life out of chronological order, or a man who was abducted by aliens from the fourth dimension, or even a lost soul in a world full of pain and countless sufferings. It is about an average man, a boy really, trying to cope with war, who&iexcl;s horrors nobody can easily endure. In his creation, Vonnegut highlights the same twisted humor that must have been shared by anything that created such a world. Billy is representative of every poor person forced to face offhanded death and hatred. It is a moving experience to join this category so vividly, as you will be while Vonnegut&iexcl;s work unfolds.Kurt Vonnegut dispenses entirely with a beloved part of great writing: foreshadowing. Somehow, Vonnegut tells you the whole story in the first few pages and then keeps you enthralled for two hundred more. Slaughterhouse-Five is not simply the story of a young optometrist turned soldier. It is about the inescapable desensitization to death and the unhealthy alterations the mind of a human must undergo to make sense of so much destruction.Slaughterhouse-Five is one of the defining postwar novels. Gripping yet horrifying, this astounding novel will be embraced by any reader looking to be moved to a whole new perspective on war, humans, and life in general.-..."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Looking beyond the otherworldly time travel subplot, it is not difficult to see that this novel is an antiwar statement. A story about one man who finds himself trapped in a place he does not want to be which results in his unwillingness to cooperate with a society that refuses to get along with itself. Ironically, he is one of the few to emerge from the war alive and unharmed, while the noble, hardworking, and dedicated fall from all around him. So it goes.Obviously, the bombing of Dresden was a mistake. Because of this, it has quietly faded away and been forgotten. Almost. I had never heard of a city known as &#8220;Dresden.&#8221; Up until the last pages of the novel, I thought the place was fictitious. Humanity simply wasn&#8217;t capable of such a hideous feat. Indeed, I was partly right, but no matter how you look at it, the events did happen. So am I missing something? If thousands of people died that day (so it goes), why don&#8217;t I have the name &#8220;Dresden&#8221; burned into my brain. Perhaps society as a whole does not wish to familiarize itself with all of the inhuman details of it&#8217;s ugly past. On a personal note, I believe the knowledge of these occurrences (surely Dresden is not the only one) can give us a chance to reflect on our mistakes and take steps to ensure that at least we, as a whole, have learned our lesson. I believe this is what the piece is trying to say. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a terrible event, but it happened for a reason that, over the years, has been more or less justified: it stopped a war. Did destroying the city of Dresden accomplish that? Of course not. It accomplished nothing. And yet it is rumored more people died that day than the days of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. So it goes. Not many people wish to know that. But Vonnegut cares not. He only wants to get the message across. And he does an excellent job."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Reading Slaughter-house Five is nothing less than an adventure. I've read many anti-war books and was expecting much of the same qualities in this one, but I was certainly in for a surprise. Told through the eyes of a man who is completely unhinged from reality, this book - which is based around the bombing of Dresden - is full of symbolism and interesting ideas.Billy Pilgrim is an optometrist. He is the son of an optometrist and is married to the daughter of an optometrist. He believes that he was once kidnapped by aliens and brought to their planet where he was put in a zoo and given a famous actress to mate with. He believes he can travel through time to any moment of his life and that Adam and Eve can be seen in a pair of leather boots. And he is a soldier in World War Two. By living in a world which is so constantly unreal, Billy seems to perceive what is real (i.e. the horrible war which he is fighting in) to be fiction. Because he believes that all moments of time coexist at once, death does not affect him. Whether a bottle of champagne goes dead or a friend is killed by firing squad, his reaction in the same: \\"So it goes.\\" As Billy drifts in and out from the real and the unreal, we can begin to understand the relationships between the everyday occurances of our lives and the extraordinary circumstances of a horrible war."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I checked this book out of a USAF base library 20 years ago specifically because it was a perennial on local school district banned book lists when I was growing up. Otherwise, I wouldn't have given it a second thought. I ended up reading most of the rest of KV's books, which in turn, had a great deal with the shaping of my political point of view. To the school districts of Long Island N.Y who banned this book during the 70's, thanks for showing me the way to the best reading experiences I've ever had. What good is this book? Well, I'm no literary critic, but I will say to younger readers out there, this book was the first I read that married comic and tragic elements in the same instance. KV may not have invented this concept, but he certainly knows how to use it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut truely out did himself in this story, delivering a tale revealing the effects of war on society, individuals and family. It taught me a lot about the end of the second world war as the story is partiallly placed in Dresden before, during and after its bombing and placed on another planet-according to the protagonist, who can travel through time-where aliens put him in an inhuman zoo with a female of our species. It is original, funny, depressing and uplifting. A work of imagination and much thought, as it is an American classic. I am looking forward to reading more from Vonnedut."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut is able to write about deadly serious topics in a light, enjoyable style without losing substance. It's pure genius!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I had to read this book when I was a senior in high school, in Mr. Marcinec's AP English class in Johnstown High School, New York, geographically in the area where the book was written and situated. At the time I was trying to choose between going to West Point and the Air Force Academy, and reading Mr. Vonnegut changed my plans and my life. If it weren't for this book, I might well be directing operations against Iraqi civilians right now. Thank you, Kurt Vonnegut, thank you, thank you from here to Tralfamadore.Subsequently I learned that wrapped up in science fiction's basic impulse was a response to the kind of atrocious killing first experienced during military conflicts of the twentieth century. The technologically dominated nature of those conflicts was very different, and what its victims experienced could not be accurately described by reaching back onto any touchstones of history because new realities had leapfrogged old language. Thus their horror could only be communicated at removes through epic myth, satire, or even by moving as Vonnegut did entirely outside the box of molecular matter itself. War veterans like Tolkien, Heller, and Vonnegut were pioneers in a new literary device, one which came to overshadow traditional literature by the latter half of the twentieth century in both cultural impact and book sales.Vonnegut projects himself into the device and character of Billy Pilgrim, who serves as a gawkish hapless soldier and simultaneously lives a blessedly bourgeoius post-war existence in upstate New York; he writes outside time in order to make sense of the impersonal, mechanized brutality he experienced as a prisoner of war while digging thousands of dead, rotting civilians out of basements in Dresden, Germany for weeks after its fire-bombing.In performing such grisly work, unendurable for any of us on a personal level, I believe Mr. Vonnegut had to leave his mind and senses in order to function, and that the protective mental refuge he went to formed the kernel of this indispensable book. While digging and removing himself from the present, he must have determined to write an anti-war story unlike any other to stand the tests of all time. Kurt Vonnegut succeeded, and 2,000 years from now when people study war (assuming we make it so long), Slaughterhouse Five will remain. It is the post-modern equivalent of the phrase, \\"Go tell the Spartans.\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is a great book, though Vonnegut's habit of skipping around in time, though really effective, makes it difficult to see where the story is going. The book is semi-autobiographical, originating in Vonnegut's own experience as an Allied POW who survived the bombing of Dresden by sheer luck--he was imprisoned in a slaughterhouse storage room that protected him and saved his life.The skipping around in time gives one the feeling that Vonnegut is having a hard time dealing with his experience, he is having a hard time focusing and therefore drifts off to other memories. It's only in the latter section of the book when the main character, Billy Pilgrim, goes through the bombing of Dresden himself does the book come together. Taken as a whole, the scattered memories tell the life story of Billy Pilgrim, which is really cool, though it would have been nice to have known this from the get go. The second time around every detail made sense, every detail had its place. There's also a fair amount of very dark humor in the book.Also, although the book doesn't seem so shocking today, when it was written, the horrors of the bombing of Dresden were not widely known in the US. He compares the bombing to a nuclear attack, which is quite rightly justified by the casualty and destruction statistics. Offhand comments are also sometimes a little racy. This apparently caused the book to be banned from many school libraries when it first came out, though by today's standards it's hard to see what the prudes were fussing about.Two other points: 1) Vonnegut never mentions that the bombing of Dresden was the Allies payback for the senseless bombing and destruction of a 300 year old Dutch city called Rotterdam. Vonnegut should be shot for not mentioning Rotterdam. 2) Ethan Hawk does a great job reading. I wish more top actors recorded books."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"If you are a first time reader of this book like I was you are in for a treat. Kurt Vonnegut will take you on a journey from the disillusionment of war veterans to the mental toll that it takes on one's mind and finally to the indifference to death and dying. So it goes, is the phrase that is the metaphor for the book. Everytime that someone close to him dies he says \\"So it goes.\\" This effectively captures his indifference to war and death as a result of his time at war. There are some stunning narratives about war that are not worth missing."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I started reading Vonnegut on the advice of a friend. I started with Slaughterhouse Five because I had heard the title before. I must say that I really enjoyed it. The style is realy quite refreshing and the plot itself is brilliant. The reason that I only gave it four stars was because of the unnecessary use of graphic sexual description. I understand that some writers may feel that they need to use these sort of descriptions in their writing, but I, for one, believe that a book can be just as good without these references. My reading experience has never been elevated by the inclusion of such content. Still, though, a very good book overall."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The story centers around Billy Pilgrim, who becomes dislodged in time and travels back and forth between past, present and future. Somewhere between the fire bombings of Dresden in World War II, his capture and imprisonment in a zoo on the planet Tralfamadore by aliens, and his surprising success back on earth in the later years of his life, Vonnegut paints an absurdly, disquietingly hilarious portrait of life, death and much in between.While subtlety is the key to Vonnegut's writing for the story, his explosive understatements do more to blow you away than any more technical language could achieve, so don't be fooled. I often found myself caught off guard and laughing on the bus as I read, or smirking wryly in mid conversation when remembering certain parts of the text. For a quick read with simple language, you'll be amazed at just how much is said in so little.It's a slight mismatch that Slaughterhouse 5 has often been compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, as I feel that the two texts have little in common except their absolutely absurd intelligence and the fragmented scene sequences. For lack of a better choice the two can be compared, though I find it to be misleading at best. Both share the resulting impression of a life shattered in the futility of war and convey their messages with an absurd (there's that word again) humour, but I feel that Slaughterhouse 5 widens its scope to include the societal perceptions of \\"life\\" in its jeers whereas Catch 22 simply addresses the paradox of war (and with a much, much finer microscope at that).There's a great deal more that could be said about Slaugherhouse 5, and even more still that I'd like to say, but I feel that (like most good novels) it's a book that must be read instead of simply told about, and I don't want to give anything more away to someone that hasn't read it yet.

What can I say? Tears and laughter are not adequate for this work.It brought to the world Billy Pilgrim, the misfit loser with more than a few parallels to Jesus Christ. It brought to the world Vonnegut's deeply personal view of the bombing of Dresden. It confirmed that Vonnegut's wacky imagination could be applied to a serious subject to bring both hilarity and sorrow. It brought me, a person completely ignorant to the horrors of war, a person who can't stop eating his Three Musketeers candy bars, as close as I'll ever get to understanding war's consequences. With irony to spare and heart rending beauty, KV has made a true masterpiece.Recommended to fans of Sci fi, fantasy, and the human experience."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"this will change your mind. Vonnegut explores human nature from inside and out, centered on human nature's darkest time, war, without being bound by the laws of time flow. Stylistically original. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In his superb novel Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut infuses into his writing a cornucopia of rhetorical strategies, including running motifs, the repetition of phrases, and vivid diction, to expose the mental and physical destruction caused by war and ultimately to convey antiwar sentiments.Throughout his writing, Vonnegut employs a plethora of motifs to present his antiwar position. The colors blue and ivory both play a significant role in painting the picture that depicts the destruction of war. Upon his departure to Dresden, the awkward hero of the novel Billy Pilgrim glances upon the body of a previous acquaintance dead on the cold, solid ground. The man's &quot;bare feet were blue and ivory&quot; (148). At another moment in the novel, Billy looks upon his own feet, only to find that they too &quot;were blue and ivory&quot; (72). Vonnegut's clever choice of cold, impersonal colors invokes images of death, and, by using these descriptions in relation to the men involved in war, illustrates the suffering endured by fighters in the war. Their flesh turns from a healthy, robust, and energetic shade to a stone - cold, remote gray. Vonnegut also includes the motif of a lone dog howling. In the midst of conflict, Vonnegut often inserts this unique motif. On the doorstep of death, Billy Pilgrim can barely continue moving through the woods behind enemy lines. While Pilgrim's companions constantly ridicule his weakness and threaten to desert him, they hear &quot;somewhere the big dog barked&quot; with a voice like a &quot;big bronze gong&quot; (48). The connotation of emptiness conveyed in a lone dog's callings serve to accentuate the loneliness and mental isolation suffered by participants in war. War severs the kinship bonds of men, abandoning and isolating them like the solitary barking dogs.By utilizing the repetition of distinct phrases, Kurt Vonnegut augments his overall theme of war's destruction and its effects on man. Repeated often throughout the novel, the term &quot;The Children's Crusade&quot; comes to symbolize and parallel World War Two, the war employed as one of the main settings in Slaughterhouse-Five. In chapter one, Vonnegut discusses his own war and post-war experiences in first person. Responding to the bitter remarks of a friend about his novel, Vonnegut replies that he will &quot;call it 'The Children's Crusade'&quot; (15). By using this term in first person, and later in third person through other characters, Vonnegut creates a comparison between two extremely bloody historic events. In both incidents, the youth of the world stepped up to a challenge that appeared valiant and heroic only to discover that their causes would result in bloody carnage and tragedy. The reality hit the young men like a lighting bolt, changing them physically through wounds and mentally through the bloody sights that bred a pessimistic attitude and a disbelief in humanity. The most prominent repeated phrase is the short, simple sentence &quot;so it goes&quot;. Vonnegut follows every mention of death in his novel (there are approximately eighty) with these words. In the war, &quot;a lot of people were being wounded or killed. So it goes&quot; (106). This phrase highlights death as a major topic in the novel and accentuates decease as a result of the terrible and ravaging destruction of war. The sentence is presented in a curt and understated tone that adds a dash of irony and ridicules the massive devastation caused by war.Vivid diction floods the pages of Vonnegut's novel and further compounds the horrendous and ghastly images of war. Vonnegut metaphorically compares the war to a glacier. &quot;There would always be wars&quot; and &quot;they were as easy to stop as glaciers&quot; (3). With this choice of diction, Vonnegut presents war as an inevitable tragedy that will always persist in the world, always on a path of rampage, always leaving immense destruction in its wake. After the bombing of Dresden, Billy Pilgrim and his fellow prisoners of war gaze upon the massive, almost unimaginable, ruin. Vonnegut compares the once beautiful city with the surface of the moon; however, unlike the smooth curves of the moon, Dresden is littered with &quot;treacherous, jagged things - hot to the touch, often unstable&quot; (180). Rather than attempting to romanticize war, Vonnegut uses his blunt descriptions to focus on the hideous reality of war. Utilizing this specific diction, Vonnegut paints a blackened picture of war that emphasizes death and destruction.Clearly through his skillful employment of rhetorical devices, such as motifs, repetition, and diction, Kurt Vonnegut vividly depicts the devastation caused by war and suffered by man. Vonnegut unmistakably utilizes his novel Slaughterhouse-Five as an antiwar piece of literature that investigates and explores the extend of damage, both mental and physical, endured by the innocent fighters involved in war."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Over the years I've been fascinated to see how people interpret and misinterpret this famous work, which I first read while studying abroad in 1989.Some people think it is a absurd comedy, others a quirky science fiction novel, others simply don't know what to make of it. But for those of us &quot;lucky&quot; enough to be keyed into Vonnegut's cynicism, the book is a powerful anti-war statement; nothing more, nothing less.In his amusing, rambling, self-reflexive introduction, Vonnegut seems to concede that the only way to write a great anti-war novel is not to write a great anti-war novel. After all, as he says, &quot;...there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.&quot;Thus I'm inclined to say; this is one of the best anti-war books never written. I'm glad I never read it three or four times cover to cover."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was a truly interesting book.

I wish I had saved my money! I will not recommend this book to anyone, ever!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is considered a classic and deservedly so. It is almost equal parts anti-war novel and science fiction, and is thoroughly enjoyable. There's never a dull moment and there are some very interesting ideas to take away. Many of those ideas are conveyed by means of the Tralfamadorians, the aliens who abduct the book's main character.Yes, the book's main character, Billy Pilgrim, gets abducted by aliens and then proceeds to tell others about it. His daughter tries to get him to stop. But at one point in the future, others actually listen to Billy and believe him. Yes, Billy Pilgrim also travels in time. Unlike most sci-fi stories of time travel, in this case Billy has no control over when he time-travels and to what point in time he travels to. As a result, we learn about things which occurred well after World War II before we learn all the details of the war. It's a very interesting way of telling the story.The main focus of the World War II portion is the bombing of Dresden by the Allied forces late in the war. Billy Pilgrim was among prisoners of war who were being kept at Dresden when the bombing happened. The narrator of the story (who is not Billy himself) was also at Dresden. The attack is the centerpiece for illustrating how awful war is - a beautiful city transformed into a barren wasteland reminiscent of the surface of the moon. Much is also made of the condition of the soldiers on both sides, with many soldiers seemingly too young or too old for war and none able to remain healthy.Besides anti-war messages, some of the most interesting ideas are the result of Billy's time travel and abduction by the Tralfamadorians. The Tralfamadorians live in four dimensions and are able to see any moment in time all the time. According to them, you never really die, you just visit different moments of your life constantly (similar to Billy's time travel). As a result they don't believe in free will - whatever happens will happen and nobody can change it. One idea they propose that humans could learn from is that since life is full of good and bad moments, it is often best to focus on the good ones."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],E={key:0},M={key:1};function W(n,a,s,c,r,i){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",O,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",M,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",E,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const P=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-ae05db4d"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/55.md","filePath":"people/55.md"}'),H={name:"people/55.md"},D=Object.assign(H,{setup(n){return(a,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{j as __pageData,D as default};
