We think &quot;The Giver&quot; isn't that good.Our reasons for not loving that book are that we are two very realistic girls and simply can't follow the storyline,because it's so confusing.Maybe we have too small of an imagination,but above all the ending of the story doesn't really make sense and so many questions are still left open."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My best friend has been bothering me to read this novel sinceour freshman year in high school. Finally, during my Sophomore year ofcollege, I decided to read it. It's a wonderful story, which should allow many young adults to think upon issues that they may not usually explore. It portrays a utopian like community very well--showing what a big brother/brave new world mentatlity can create."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is awesome and teaches you a lot of life lessons. I read it in summerschool and I could hardly put it down. So I read it before class goes over the book. It talked about futuristic Perfect world. No pains, no worries. Each people received certain role which is life long assiment from the elders. Main character, Jonas is assigned as a reciever who recieved all the memories the giver had. As Jonas get more and more memories, he realized his society isn't perfect at all. Then he ran away to the Elsewhere. As the story goes on though, I realized a world with no difference and no choices is not perfect at all."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This story takes place in a future in which there are no choices. There are ordered little communities in which there are many rules and all people's lives are planned out by committees. In one such community, a young boy named Jonas is chosen to recieve the memories of all history. These memories of emotions are taken on by one person in the community to protect all the other people. At first, Jonas is a little scared of his new assignment. After a while, though, he can no longer understand why people have chosen to live without choice and emotion. Thus, he and the Giver, being the only two people with these memories, hatch a plan to try and give these memories back to the community in a hope to change it. I found this book to be extremely interesting. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to people who like deep, science-fiction type books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved the novel, The Giver. It exposed the advanced world of utopia and its problems. Although a utopian world has its benefits such as no poverty, hunger, and racism, it also restricts people from the simple benefits of life, such as being able to see colour, being able to make decisions on your own, and unexpected weather changes. Although a utopian life may be desirable to many, living life w/out these benefits isn't living life at all. Having a predictable and controlled environment is not at all satisfactory. Lois Lowry has shown this to us through the eyes of a 12-year old child, Jonas.Another reason I like this book was because I had never read a story like it before. It is very different from the normal books that I have read because it expands on society. Each time I read it, it makes me think of how corrupt our society and world is. I want to change our government, not to the point where it's communist or utopian, but enough that we won't have to worry about money, hunger, or devastation. We would all have jobs and work to better ourselves. We would be the land of opportunity that we never were.The book was going along smoothly until the very end. I believe the end was very abrupt and incomplete. It would have my final star if the last chapter had some sort of happy, if any, conclusion."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've read this book several times, and I've enjoyed it each time. The ending has always seemed a bit contrived to me, as if Lowry was up against a deadline and needed to end the story.Just the same, the idea of a society in which all choices were outlawed and they needed a single person to carry all their memories and their history is intriguing. It's a book to make us appreciate the society we live in, knowing that even if we do often make the wrong choices, at least we have the ability to make those choices."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a future, perfect world where there is no such thing as pain, hunger, unemployment, or even death, 12 year old Jonas lives with his family in The Community. In the Community everyone has their chosen job to perform: Laborer, Nurturer, even Birth Mother. As a Twelve, Jonas is to take his place in the Community by being given his career. He is chosen to be the next Receiver of Memory.Jonas soon finds out that to be the new Receiver means that he is to receive all of the memories from all time, including the memories of things that do not exist in the world anymore....The most obvious reason for this huge turnout for a lesser-known young adult book is obvious: it is simply a fantastic work. Ms. Lowry starts off painting such a beautiful picture of this perfect world Jonas inhabits that we, as readers in this more than imperfect world, wish we could join him in his utopia, even with so many personal decisions being made for him. However, slowly, bit by bit, we realize how limiting his world really is as he is exposed to more and more of what we call &quot;normal life&quot; that he has never even conceived of.&quot;The Giver&quot; is a work of sheer genius for all ages. However, most will encounter it first in school language arts/reading classes. Somehow I managed to miss it through my formal school education and finally picked it up at the ripe age of 32. It sings out to me as a brilliant work as much at my current age as I know it would have if I had read it in junior high. If you have not yet read it, you simply have to."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My Review consists of the following coments... 1)In the book &quot;the Giver&quot; there were many topics and many characters that made the book so much more interesting and so much more indepth that readers from age 10-100 could read this book and all of them would get something different from it. 2)The author made this book have more then 1 topic which made it so you didn't get stuck with 1 topic and then get bored with the book in the first 15 minutes of reading. 3)When I picked up &quot;the Giver&quot; looking for a good and interesting book to read and I deffinetly got the book I was looking for.Sence my first reading of this book I have read it 5 times, I can't put this book down.I get down with it and then start all over on chapter 1. The last thing that I want to say is thank you Lois Lowry for writing such a wonderfull book, hope to read more of your books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have read and thought about this book at countless hours at a time. The complexity of the story the perfectness of there world. And I wonder in my own mind what it would be like. In their world your job is chosen for you no room for mistakes. Lois Lowry does an absoulutely amazing job of desribing the excitement before the ceremony of the twelve which is where Jonas and the other elevens get there jobs. After Jonas recieves his job there is almost immediate controversy over his postion. And after that everything changes. He can't be with his friends or he can't spend time with anyone after his training starts. But then Jonas Realizes the advantages of his postion. Lois Lowry does a Great Job again in writing another book that is well thought out and a real thinker."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a very well written book that I would suggest to most people, except for people that don't like ending that leave things ambiguous.The Giver is the story of a 12 year old boy named Jonas who is selected to be the Reciever by his comunity. The Reciever's job is to take in all of the memories good and bad that have been passed down for generations. The person that is to give Jonas these memories is called the Giver. Once Jonas starts recieving the memories and seeing what his community would be like if they had these memories he decides to give the memories to everyone. His plan is dangerous but it works out.This is a well written story but it doesn't work out that everything is alright and when I read it I was not in the mood for bad endings."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is THE best book I've ever read. I read it for he first time when I was 10. It opened my mind so much. I would reccomend it to anyone of any age. It's the kind of book that you'restill thinking about for days after you finish it. I'm sure it will stick with me for life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book last year (7th grade) and it gives an interesting look into the concept of Utopia. Before reading this book, I had already read 1984 and Animal Farm (both of which were better, IMO) and this gave a different perspective than them. You probably already know the plot, so I'll save you the time, but I was slightly disappointed with the ending. I understand that it is supposed to be left up to you to decide what happens, but still, it was dissatisfying, and made me not appreciate this otherwise superb book as much."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We read this book for school and, well, the begginning sounds boring but it is awesome!! The ending is great! On a scale of 1-5 with 5 the best-I'd give it a 10! It's worth it to read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I didn't like a big giant annoying price tag right on the book cover (not a sticker but part of the cover.) It's kind of tacky but it's worth it for the price of this book. This book is amazing... a must read for all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I chose this book because my students were reading it and was curious. The story was timeless and the main character was someone you could relate. I would recommend it to young and old."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've read this book multiple times and it never fails to evoke emotion. It covers such a wide range of experiences in so few pages; and the ending leaves you stunned and shocked."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my opinion, Lois Lowry writes the best books ever!In my opinion, Lois Lowry writes the best books ever!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine you lived in a world without any pain and fear. Everything occurred like clockwork and everyone seemed happy and that you knew no different, this seems like a perfect society. Welcome to the world of The Giver. I have loved this book since I was first exposed to it in college and it has been my favorite ever since. Why? I guess it is the innocence of the parties involved and the way they come to terms with new knowledge as their eyes are opened to their world around them. I also like the fact as I read the book over and over again; I always find something new or find deeper meaning in the book.Every year, the children in this utopian society get awarded a special gift until their 12th birthday. On their 12th birthday, the children receive their Assignments. These Assignments are their jobs which the Elders have decided for them and which the children will be trained in and will do for the rest of their lives. Jonas has been elected to be The Giver and this highly prized job is not something Jonas planned on being and he does not know what is all involved in this occupation as this job is not highly talked about. Jonas has some advantages to being The Giver but struggles with some of the other issues of being in this position. Why was Jonas chosen for such a tasking assignment? The current Giver must pass onto Jonas all these memories as he is aging and these memories must be transferred to someone within the society. These memories include wonderful times but they also include pain and suffering which take a toll on Jonas. What Jonas does with the memories is unprecedented and what Jonas learns in his new position, has Jonas thinking about his life in hometown differently.I can't say enough about this book. The characters are so real and the story moves so quickly, it is never a dull moment. This book is for readers in 5th grade or higher because of some of its subject matter"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a wonderful book of adventure and excitement.

The ending is horrible but I had to get it anyways because the rest of the book is fabulous."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Amazed how Lois Lowry opens your eyes and tells a story. The Giver definintly gives you that sudden gasp when the whole story comes together."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver documents a boy coming of the age where he will be told what he will do with his life. The leaders of this world watch the children as they grow, and decide for them what their lives will be. Personality traits still exist, levels of intelligence still exist, but things that are common to us--like colors, pain, and independence--do not. Sameness is the goal of the community, and everyone is treated the same, if you're too different, you might get \`released'. Jonas is burdened with the career of Receiver of Memory. With new understanding of the world, Jonas has to decide whether to accept the disguised brutality of the community around him or to try to make a difference with his knowledge, though its might get himself \`released'.The story is very moving, you really feel sorry for both Jonas and The Giver. It's also very addicting, and I had a hard time putting it down. I would recommend for preteens or teens around the 7th-9th grade area."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Every middle schooler should read this. And if you are past middle school - you should read it too. A great introduction to challenging the environment you live in by asking questions."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" is a wonderful read because it tackles issues such as euthanasia, commanding governments, freedom of speech, and trying to achieve a system of government in which everyone is in essence \\"the same\\". I would recommend this book to all readers in seventh grade and up. I also wish to commend Lois Lowry's courageousness in writing such a bold and daring piece that she knew would indefinitely cause uproar across the country for writing about such sensitive topics."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a great book in the sense that it really makes you question what you don't know. The book is focused around a 12 year old boy who lives in an ideal community. At first you think it is so well organized and almost a true Utopia but then as we learn more about the true surroundings and see Jonas's world from the new perspective of the Giver. Jonas's new mentor and teacher. Little things like how words play into our everyday life. How in this community exact truth and meaning of a word is a form of control over the individual. In this community the individuals must be exact so the community remains controlled and safe. Where the Community can use words like elsewhere and release to be vague to the individual. At first you see it as ideal living but then it clearly becomes an ideal existence. To live is to experience and to be an individual and this book explores that in an amazing way. The ending is a surprise and truly is up to the reader how to interpret it. Young and old will enjoy this book and great for a family discussion.'"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this book is weird compared to our daily lives, but what strang is that this might happen to us the way our economys hedding."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This will always be one of my absolute favorite books.It is amazing and i recommend it to all people between the ages of 7 and 14."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Like \\"1984\\" this book presents a dystopia but it is one that older children and young adults can understand, one which addresses the issues they are struggling with.

I ordered 4 more copies to give away as gifts.One of the best stories I have listened to. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Book was delivered when promissed. A great read. Discusses big ideas in great format--my students were engaged the whole time."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry won the Newberry Award in 1994. (On a side note, it also won the Rebecca Caudill Young Reader's Award in 1996 which is an award sponsored by the state of Illinois!) I'm certainly glad I decided to read it!\\"It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened.\\" And so starts the story of a boy that is growing up in a time and place where sameness is the way only way of life. There is no such thing as choice. When a child is born, it is placed in the hands of a Nurturer. The child isn't even named until December. Every December, there is a ceremony celebrating the year's in the life of a child. The newchild is placed with it's new family...one that is chosen for that child. Every family unit is allowed 2 children. One boy and one girl. No more, no less. As the years progress, so do the ceremonies. At 8, the child is allowed to start his volunteer hours. At 9, the child is given his bike. And at 12, the child is given his Assignment. This assignment is the job you are going to do for the rest of your life.Jonas is nervous about the 12's Ceremony this year because he is to be assigned, and he has no idea what that assignment will be. As he sits in his position waiting, he hears the assignments of all his friends. But Jonas assignment is one that is a surprise to everyone. He is assigned to be the next \\"Receiver of Memories\\". It's one of the highest honors in the Community.When Jonas starts his training, he meets \\"The Giver\\", the man he is replacing as a Receiver of Memories. The Giver must \\"give\\" memories to Jonas. And not just memories of the Community, but memories that have been passed from Receiver to Receiver. He is given memories of color, because there is no longer color in the world of Sameness. He is given beautiful memories of snow and family and love, all things that he has never really experienced before. But when Jonas is shown what it really means to be released, he must find the courage within himself to try to change the way of life for one newchild that is about to be released.I thought this book was wonderful. I like dystopian books anyway. But Lowry has created a world that is structured and filled with sameness. A world that is hard to imagine. She shows us that even though the world we live in right now is filled with tough choices, at least we HAVE the right to choose. Maybe we make the wrong choice sometimes, but the alternative is not really better. And she has created a compassionate, loving and courageous character in Jonas. A character that should be admired. I can see why this book won the Newberry!! I think all young adults should read this one."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As an avid realistic fiction reader I wholeheartedly recommend this book. This is perhaps the only science fiction/ dystopia book I have read and thouroughly enjoyed. Lowry's writing is wonderful and the story is well thought out. I loved it the first time I was introduced to it in fourth grade or so and love it some five years later. It is a quick read and time well spent."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you do not like open endings, it would not be best to read this book. However it is my favorite book and has been since 2002 or so. It is a children's book, to that extent, so it is easy to read. However the concepts are mature/adult-like and although I read it at age 11, I probably would not have my daughter read it that young.My younger brother refuses to read any book but read through The Giver and liked it so I give the book props for this.Perhaps the most heartbreaking moment was Jonas's confrontation with his own mother about the idea of \\"love\\" - something this society lacks. At a young age, it put my own life into perspective."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Although I like suspense and thrills, this book left me with too many questions and really left me unsatisfied. They never really focused on one thing or went into description on what I thought were some very important issues. It is &quot;The Truman Show&quot; and &quot;Pleasantville&quot; combined."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It was hard get into book because it was moving too slow and confusing. And question did Jonas die or not? This book deserves only two stars to me.The only thing about the book I agree with it's a very &quot;tripped out&quot; book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is really great for people that think about things in a different way then most people would. I think this book would be pretty confusing for smaller children. The first time I read it, I was even sort of confused! It is about a world where everything is the same. There is a special commitee that makes all of the choices for the people. They choose the people's occupation, spouse, children and other things. In the community is a boy named Jonas. When it is his time to recieve what job he will take on he recives the one called &quot;The Reciever&quot; The reciever is the one person in the community that has memories of all the things of our world. When Jonas learns the truth of things, he decides to put things right in his community. This is a very interesting book that really makes you think of things in a totally different light. I hope you enjoy &quot;The Giver&quot; by Lois Lowry."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book because it is on my daughter*s reading list for school; once I glanced at it, I was hooked--had to get to the end. What I found was a sad, safe, uneventful world where no mistakes would ever be made. No mistakes, because there were really no choices to make at all; as Jonas, our protagonist learns, choices are forbidden *because people might choose WRONG.* The result? A peaceful world of health and plenty, wherein all might fulfill thier potential, where bigotry and violence have been eliminated, where humans live in perfect balnce with themselves and nature. The cost? Any differences, no matter how slight. Even color had been all but phased out. Apologies must always be accepted for even the smallest disruption, and all those who even remotely threaten or weaken the careful social order are *released*, which tranlates into being killed, as Jonas discovers. He learns all this from the Giver, an old man charged with retaining all the messy things such as emotions, mistakes, sorrows. This is ultimately a sad book, as the full ramifications of the carefully balanced world unfold in the telling; even such harmless things as grandparents, twins, pets, and candles have had to be phased out, in the name of public welfare. Only the Giver is allowed/entrusted to bear the dangerous burden of Mistakes. In the end Jonas has to decide between his lauded position as the Giver*s apprentice--and of saving the life of an *unfit* baby he has come to love. I find the ending frustrating-- Jonas and his *brother* set out for the mythical Elsewhere, only to be lost in the snow. Though Lowry envokes the power of memories she does not resolve the tale either way, i.e. either with Jonas* death and subsequent release of the pent-up years of memories into the general populace, or with his finding anyone else to take them in. This kind of ending leaves me frustrated; tho her point is well-made, the resolution is left unfinished. Jonas* sacrifice is almost in vain--I wonder if anything will really change. We worry about making mistakes, we see what happens if we are not allowed to make mistakes. A disturbing read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It was an easy read. It took me a couple hours and I'm a slow reader. It doesn't go in depth as much as it seems.

Almost like communism. It makes sense if you think about it. The community was all the same and those who were different were &quot;released.&quot; Although the book wording itself was easy to read, the context was hard to fully understand. The most difficult part for me was when the author described the characters age and the group in which they belonged to because of their age. However, while reading the book it got me thinking about a lot of different thoughts. Like, &quot;Oh wow, what if this was really true, how would I act?&quot; The Giver was definitely a twist to what I normally read. You know, those books that have you acting different because of something that had happened in the book and you think that it could happen to you. So all in all, my opinion on this book is mixed. I like how the author described things. I give her credit because it must have been a tough book to describe so people could understand it. I know I am having trouble just trying to describe my thoughts on the book itself. Yet I didn't really like the story line. It struck me as weird, confusing, and slightly boring. The only thought I had after finishing book was &quot;This would make a good episode for The Twilight Zone.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read The Giver for my Magic andRitual class. The book was not without itscharm, but for me, living in that world wouldbe a personal hell.

That book goes against every thingthat i believe in, except the fact that thekid had enuf guts to run away.As for the technical side of the book, itwas one of the most poorly written books thatI have ever read. The plot jumped around,you couldn't follow it.

Jonas soon finds, however, that there are many important things missing from the Community, and he wants to give it back... The Giver may be a book of only fifth grade level, but it is still interesting to read and think, &quot;What if our lives were like that?&quot; It also leaves a sort of impact when you finish, making you think about the whole thing for quite a while.

It's really not that bad."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would recommend this to anyone even adults. I have heard adults say they thought it was fantastic. I give it Two thumbs up"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm a twelve year old who read this book in two days when books the same size usually take me at least a week. I read this book when suggested it by a friend. I'm glad I read it! It's about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community in the far away furture. The world he lives in is perfect. No one has a choice about anything from whom their spouce should be to what job they should choose. They don't even make their own children! A person is selected to do this job. Every one is the same and every one develops the same. Children even have their birthdays on the same day! The rules are very complicated because they don't want the would to go back to the same state as it was long before. When Jonas turns twelve, he gets the highly honored job of resever of memories. The person who gives him the memories is the giver who got the memories from the giver who gave him the memories and so on. The reserver's job is important because he is the one who reseaves all the painful memories of the past which are given to him so that the community won't turn to what it once was. Some of the memories are painful but some are also good memories of things such as colors and birthday parties and love. So, wanting to get away from the community and go &quot;Elsewhere&quot;, where there supposidly are colors and everything he reseaves. This book is very good but I think a little to strong for younger children such as when you learn what really happenes when people are &quot;realesed&quot; form the community. Otherwise, this is a great book and, I think, deserved the Newbury medal, which it was awarded."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is one of the best I've read in years.

This book makes you stop and relate to our world and life. It shocks you at every turn and keeps you reading. The pages are filled with themes. The idea of the book might seem crazy to some people, but it's really not too faraway. Jonas' life in the Community will really make you think. I recommend this book for anyone ages 11 and up."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read this book for a school project and at first It seemed really stupid, but as I progressed throughout the book I began to really like it.

I would recomend it to anyone in middle school."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My 12 yr old daughter was reading The Giver for her 6th grade book group and got annoyed when I borrowed it from her each night, finishing it in three, when she had to read it with her class, a chapter at a time. I loved this book, it reminded me much of Ira Levin's book This Perfect Day, which is also about a perfect society where someone questions it's structure and rules. Actually , I loved the idea that children were encouraged to try out career choices-we should all be able to do that ! My daughter and I both wished there had been one more chapter, so we could see what Jonas would do with his new knowledge of the real world beyond the fabricated one he's always known."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed this unique book.

There are no choices to be made When you turn 12 you are given a role in the community for the rest of your life. when you become to old to live anymore, you are simply &quot;relaeased&quot; from the community. When Jonas turns 12 he is selected to become the Reciever of Memory, a highly respected role in his community. However when Jonas begins to recieve the memorys of the past from an old man, known as The Giver, Jonas realizes that his world is not as perfect as everyone thinks. Jonas can't live in this community anymore. But he can't leave his family and friends who he's known all his life, or can he? He must do something, and fast.

I wasn't really into it in the begining but once Jonas became a receiver and begin receiving thing about the past that was when I became hook.

I know he reached the outside and all but I'm not satisfy with it it was to choppy."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read the book The Giver(a science fiction book)by Lois Lowry.I thought this bbok had many different outlooks on life.The Giver is about a tewlve year old boy named Joans.Joans lives in a so called &quot;perfect world&quot;.In the community he and his family and friends live in, they see everything in black and white.No one that lives in this community has feelings either.In this so called &quot;perfect world&quot; a boy inhabits a seemingly ideal world:a world without conflict,proverty,unemployment,devorice,injustice,or inequality.Teenage rebellion is unheard of and even good manners are a way of life. When the children in the community turn twelve they receive a life assignment determined by the Elders. I thought it was sad the way that no one in the community could feel love or know fear,or behave different from the rest of society.I hope our society will never end up in such an existence.When I read this book,I asked my self ...If things were always done that way,than why change?One thing that I thought was very impoartant was how in The Giver they stresed that happy feelings always come with sad feelings,and that love comes with hate.Also,learning never stops.A question Lois Lowry asked in this book was can people be happy without feelings?I thought about that question for some time know.I don't think that you can be happy without having feelings because happiness is an emotion.Readers will need to decise that question for them selves. I really enjoyed this book!I think that any person twelve or older should read it, just to get a different perspective on life.I hope Lois Lowry writes a sequel to The Giver!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In Lois Lowry's THE GIVER, the main character Jona, lives in a ficticious community sometime in the future. His world revoloves around around the principle of &quot;sameness.&quot; Everything is perfect. Unlike the real world today, in Jona's world there is no conflict, no unemployment, no poverty, no divorce, but most importantly, there is no change. Everyone in Jona's world has been sheltered from the past, sheltered from the memories of past pains and misfortunes. The only person in the community that knows the truth is the Giver. In December, during the Ceremony of Tweleve, Jona is given the highest honor, and a lifelong assignment to be the new Giver. Before he can step into his job full swing though, he must learn some valuable lessons from the old Giver. Through those teaching, Jona becomes the recipricant of all the memories, and learns the true hipocracy of the world which surrounds him. On a more personal note, I would just like to say that this is a fabulous book. It really makes you value the world in which you live in, and makes you cherish your ability to make your own decisions and have your own emotions."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an intriguing story about a possible futuristic utopian society - a \\"perfect world\\" in which there is no pain, sadness, or discontent. One man in the community, the Giver, receives all the memories - pleasant and unpleasant - of the entire community. Jonas, a young boy, is assigned the position of Giver and begins to experience the memories of thousands other people. Jonas, having experienced life out of the perfect society, begins to realize the utopia is not as wonderful as it may have seemed; while the citizens do not experience pain or sadness, they do not experience color, or music, or any true pleasant feelings. Learning more, Jonas sees the truth behind the utopian society: people are just slaves to their ignorance and cannot think for themselves. Jonas decides that the only way he can free the citizens is to run away from the community, releasing the memories of the past."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What an incredible, thought provoking book. this was a very quick read. it pricked my senses and had me enthralled."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver opens with eleven year old Jonas who lives in a small community. The elders control every aspect of the people's lives such as; marriage, children, and jobs. Jonas finds nothing wrong in his safe community until he is selected to be the new \\"receiver of memories.\\" As he works with, and begins to befriend, the Giver he begins to realize how controlling the Elders are, how amazing the world from the memories are, and that \\"release\\" is not a peaceful term.Lowry does an excellent job setting up a book that at first demonstrates how good a safe community of \\"sameness\\" would be; with no one feeling pain, suffering, or hate. As the book goes on she starts to show the reader that without emotions it is impossible to love, and to truly be happy. Lowry also shows how important it is for a community to be diverse, and that everyone is their own unique individual. The Giver is an excellent book that teaches bravery and standing up for what you believe in. I could definitely read this book many more times."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Set in a dystopian society where nobody sees in color and \\"sameness\\" is the standard, The Giver presents original ideas about societal values. At age twelve, each child is assigned the job they will perform for the rest of their lives. Twelve-year-old Jonas, though, is selected to become the new \\"receiver of memory\\": one person who carries all the memories of the past. As the story progresses and Jonas begins to receive memories of love, pain, hunger, sadness, he begins to realize just how shallow a life everyone in his community lives.I personally really have read and enjoyed this book many, many times, and I get something new out of it each time. If you consider the motives behind the \\"sameness,\\" it doesn't seem like such a hard place to get to. After all, what could be so bad about ensuring that everyone is fed and cared for, that children do not have to face neglect, or hunger, or their parents' divorce. Ultimately The Giver presents the result of the choice to end these things, and the price was the loss of family, love, and true happiness. This book has forced me to come to the realization that there must be pain in order for there to be joy, because if you don't know how far you can fall, how can you truly treasure what you are given?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I originally bought this to read to see if it would be engaging for my students - I LOVED the book and bought a hard copy which is looking well worn now that my students have gotten a hold of it.

It was an interesting read. It had hints of 'Brave New World,' and this not so perfect, 'perfect' community. It was definitely better than 'The Uglies,' which is also a YA sort of dark, future society. Out of this genre I would have to say that 'Hunger Games' and 'Logans Run' are my favorite, but 'The Giver' gave an interesting take on it, even if it was a little depressing. I would say this is probably a better message for kids to read than THG, though, not quite as much fun."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Okay so im 12 an absolutly loved this series. i read about 24/7. my nickname is bookie. not kidding. thats what all my friends call me. ill read about any book there is and loveit. this one was extraordinary though. really! i cant wait untill son comes out. my favorite of the series would have to be messenger. we read the giver in school and i got totally hooked. i read the entire series in 6 days. its an amazing book and you should definatly read this series."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A mixture of divergent and matched this book is a futuristic alternate world where everything is monitored and controlled.Jonas is chosen to become the next receiver of the memories amd feelings of the entire humanity and in his journey he decides to scape repression and find a different world.

He takes baby who is destined to die with him and they make it.It was alright I guess."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a relatively short book, at least now that I'm adult. When I was in middle school, the two hundred-odd pages probably would have given me a little more reason to gulp. It wasn't assigned reading at the school I went to (probably because it wasn't published until the year I graduated high school), and despite its classification as science fiction, despite the fact (or maybe because of it) that it was a Newbery Medal winner, the picture of an old man and trees on the front cover were sufficient to keep me from ever picking it up in the past.It's really not science fiction. It takes place in the future, but so did 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and A Clockwork Orange relative to when they were written. We need a subgenre for dystopian fiction, not because I demand you get your peanut butter out of my chocolate, but because there's quite a lot of it and it really deserves attention as its own thing (as you can tell from the titles dropped in the previous sentence. The Giver is a story set in a world in which a citizen government has completely ordered every aspect of daily life. Children don't have birthdays; they all graduate to a new age together, abandoning the elements of their childhood their age group has outgrown and taking on new responsibilities as a class. Adults are coupled together by a selection committee, and 1-year old children raised in a nurturing hospital are given to them to raise. Instincts toward joy and love are tamped down, and negative feelings carefully protected against. Even concepts as simple as colors and uphill have been weeded out. The story follows a child whose assigned career path is to experience everything the society has left behind - pleasure and pain - in order to advise the society when dealing with things their atrophied emotional life leaves them unprepared for.What's Good: I thought the story was surprisingly sophisticated. It's been pointed out to me (and perhaps rightly so) that to a middle-schooler the story would perhaps be more blatantly black-and-white, that the moral choices would be clear to the reader and this dystopian society would, in fact, be obviously dystopian. But the author was clearly an adult, and I believe this is the kind of book one would expect to stick in a young reader's head and mature with them. I think that unlike the above-mentioned dystopias, it's not actually clear that the world is dystopic. People are happy. Yes, there is no \\"love\\". There isn't joy, and there isn't art. Some ugly little truths (like death) are swept under the rug. But the tradeoff against depression, against heartache, poverty and famine, a life of fear, a life of continual disillusionment is deliberate, and (at least at some point) consciously made, and successfully made. The way the society is presented, there really is no underbelly seedier than whatever they abandoned in the past. There are no clear answers, and that's unusual for a dystopian novel, and especially unusual for young adult.What's Bad: Off-hand, not much. There are some questions about how some things in the book would actually work (like memory transfer through touch), but they're conceits, not just poor world-building. The characters are rich and varied, despite the constraints their society puts on them, and the book isn't long enough for this \\"dystopia of boring\\" to drag. I can't say I actually enjoyed the book, but it -is- dystopian, after all.The Takeaway: I recommend it! Even if I didn't really like it, it's good! It's not spoon-feeding the reader a self-soothing opinion; it actually promotes thought. (Plus, it's short, and usually cheap because it's on school reading lists, so you don't have too much of an excuse.) Read it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Review: The Giver by Lois Lowry (The Giver #1) *Spoilers*The Giver by Lois LowryEdition: Kindle, number 1 in a quartet.Genre: Dystopian YA.Appearance: The cover gives an average amount of clues before beginning the book, however, upon completion it makes a great deal more sense. It is neither fantastic or dreadful, it is an average compelling book cover that speaks of a haggard looking old man and the torn promise of a forest, escape maybe?Characters: The book has one protagonist, Jonas, though the readers really do get a feel for the other characters in the book as it goes along. I don't want to include spoilers, but there were certain moments when I became very angry at a character, or relieved to find out one was safe.Setting: Placed in a Dystopian styled village, the book takes place for 3/4 of the book in a closed in community that exudes \`sameness'. It is a far cry from contemporary society, where people willingly allow themselves to not feel and everything from their clothes, to their food or jobs is regulated for the strength of the community. I sense something anthropological here, as the culture and community is priority and the individual and their relationships are not relevant what so ever. Very imaginative, considering this came out in 1993 before the Dystopian Wave rode through literature. Kind of reminiscent to Matched.The Meat: The Meat: The Giver is a YA novel and this aspect becomes obvious in the book's writing style and plot as it progresses from a young man, Jonas, going from accepting and blind to the climax where he charters a great escape. I think that's a spoiler. OopsIt is stereotypical in its pace, yet that does make it dull. Rather the book is sort of exciting, the type of read that one can complete in a solid afternoon of reading. Only 197 pages in length, it seemed a bit short actually as I would have liked to have more clues as to the world that the protagonist, Jonas, lives in. In fact, that is my biggest pet peeve in the book! There were so few descriptions of their world, it gave the image of a perfect suburbia. Fine- I get it, everyone is a step-ford wife. However, later on Jonas starts to \`see beyond' and we later on find out that it is because he was starting to see the color red. Hold up- wait a minute, no where is it described that people couldn't see colour, or know certain words. Maybe this is my own ignorance, I don't dispute that, but I would have liked some clues as to the \`different-ness' of their world in the beginning, so that I could have avoided my frantic flip to the front of the novel (thinking I had missed something). Oh well.It was an OK read, it was in moderation, satisfying, but it wasn't very WOW. I am intrigued enough to continue the second book in the series.Have you read The Giver? What do you think? All in all I'll award The Giver with 3- Page- Turns.See ya,BWB (original boo reviews)[...]"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This books starts out in a setting that appears to be fairly communist society. In other words, what one chooses to do with their life is mapped out for them by the \\"Chief Elders.\\" (Our government/lawmakers).Training starts at the year of 12. Each ceremony to the age of twelve is fairly unique. However, after years of careful examination-through each youth's volunteer work, community affairs, and schooling, the Chief Elders can decide the suitable role deemed fit for the individual \\"12\\".This is rather a dystopian society. Family units apply for children. There is no color or emotion. However, there is the Reciever of Memory who is an exception to the rules. They appointed a new Reciever of Memory-Jonas. He sees color, expresses love, and various other emotions. The Giver (the current receiver) through touch gives Jonas his memories, and some are painful. One of those memories, that is not given to Jonas, is one that he sees his father perform. His father's role in the community is \\"Nurturer.\\" they take care of the \\"new child\\" (infants). In a video, that Jonas is allowed to watch with the Giver, he sees his father \\"release\\" (put to death) a twin infant because he is the lesser of the weight of the two. However, the community, aside from Jonas and the receiver are ignorant of any feelings, and know nothing of what they are doing as harm, but just doing as instructed.Together, the Giver, and Jonas devise a plan, that will help to shed a little light on the community of their ignorance, by releasing the years worth of memories Jonas has received from the Giver back onto the community. However, to do that, he must escape the communities borders, and travel to \\"Elsewhere\\" outside the community limits. Instead of merely Jonas going though, he had to carry extra weight when he learned that his father was going to hand over a one year old restless child back over to the nurturing center to be released. After a year, the nurturing center deemed the new child unfit for a family unit, hence the reason for their decision.This obstacle of carrying a toddler along for his journey makes for an adventure. I read this material because it is one of my 12 year olds summer reads, and I enjoyed it. Read it to see how Jonas and the new child, Gabriel make out in the end. Good Read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would recommend The Giver to children 13 years old or younger. The book explains to the kids we're so lucky that we are allowed to decide on our own. It also has a couple life-lesson morals in the story. For example,\\" Choices are important.\\" The Giver tells us to be determined and never give up, even if things don't go your way. You can never live a perfect life because something or somone can get in your way. That is why I recommend this book to chldren 13 and younger. Read The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think the book The Giver was an amazing book that teaches a life-long message. It teaches us that it is good to be different in a world that has no change. It also teaches young adults that it is alright to be different from one another and that change is good.Also, the book The Giver was interesting and always left you with something to think about. The author, Lois Lowry, included many interesting details and events that made you not want to put the book down. Some parts of this book were hard to understand and were boring,but for the most part, it was a great book for people my age to read. Most , to all, of my classmates liked this book and rated it a 4 or a 5. Though it has a few flaws, I wouldn't mind reading it again!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book the Giver, was pretty good overall except for some flaws. In the beginning of the novel, the first three chapters were very confusing for minors like us and we could not process all of the information stated until nearly the end of this book. This book contained many detailed settings, descriptions, and events. Though this book was for the most part unrealistic...this was very, very interesting. In some parts of this story, we think that the author could have used less sexual examples of sexual dreams and feelings torward other beings. Also, on that note, at the end of this book when the author expalained to the readers about \\"release\\" she shouldn\`t have used such harsh punishment torwards the characters. This book did teach a good moral though. While reading this, we learned that there are different rules and expectations for all of the different communities in our world. Everyone in our world is different in their own ways and it would be bad if we were all the same instead of us being unique. So, in conclusion this book was very good overall and we do recommend this for other readers who are around our age ( 13-14 years old)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was okay athough it was very confusing. The beginning of the story (when Jonas gets afraid of an airplane,) was probably the most confusing, but when you read on it started to make more sense. My favorite part in this novel is when Jonas recieves the holiday memory. It was a very heart warming part in the story and i loved to hear all the details about it because it made me think of our own world and holidays. This book was very suspenseful. I did not want to put this book down once i started reading it. This is another reason the book was good. I would reccomend this novel to others but most likely to students a little older such as fourteen and thirteen because it was kind of difficult to follow along."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a science fiction novel based on the future community a boy named Jonas lives in. This is a community which has gone through sameness, meaning everything is the same. There is no color, no snow, no rain, or even sleet. The weather is always the same. However there is one thing what all the people in the community don't know what really it is.......... RELEASE! They all think that it is a person who is sent to another community. However it really is when you get killed.The story really begins when Jonas is picked to be the new reciever of memory at the ceremony of the twelves. The ceremony is kind of like your birthday. You're in a group with all the fifty kids born in the same year. Each December you are promoted to a new age. when you turn twelve your future is decided by the comitee of elders.Later Jonas meets The Giver and The Giver gives him memories of all different things. Then he learns of all colors and starts to see them. After he sees what release really is he decides to escape to go elsewhere. Interested, buy the book to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"You should read this book! It is suspenseful and it keeps you reading. It is mostly about a boy who lives in a community of sameness and wants a change. Weather control, no color, everything must be perfect. This book will show how good we have or life and will make you think what if our world become like his? What would it be like? How would it make you feel if your life was run for you, you had no choices, and you shared a birthday with hundreds of other people? Read this book and see what it's like in a world of sameness."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We recommend the book The Giver for other children to read. The book was very interesting. It made you think about the lifestyles of others and how their lives differ from your own. For example, Jonas had to share his feelings and dreams everyday, in our society you are not obligated to do that if you do not wish to. Also, in their community every decision was made for them by an elder, that is very different from our society where you can make your own decisions and be more mature. We rate this book 4 stars because it was exciting, yet sad at the same time. The plot kept you interested throughout the story, and it was different from any other book we have read. The book kept you guessing. That is why we rate The Giver 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This novel was pretty good, but it was not the best book that I have ever read. I do recommend reading this book although some parts were confusing like the last few pages. The middle of the novel was probably the best part to read and was suspenseful. Jonas' life was full of adventure and interesting situations. Overall, The Giver is a novel that I think that readers who enjoy science fiction and the future will find this book to be something to look forward to. So in conclusion, I would recommend reading this book in your spare time."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Many people have read The Giver and have many thoughts regarding the book. Some would say that the novel interested them and kept them want to read. Many of the people that have read the book have written to the author which is, Lois Lowry, and told her if she would write a sequel. But she responded saying that the ending was up to the readers imagination. The book focused on the journey that Jonas took after he became Reciever of Memory. As Jonas' perfect life got turned upside down with reality the book showed his strength and wisdom conquering the new differences he came upon."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We highly recommend this book because it is such a good one. The book was very suspenceful. Jonas was portrayed so well that it kept us all interested. Once you start reading this book you wont be able to put it down! You get caught up in the futureistic events that take place. Jonas story is unlike anyone elses, it is full of surprising events. When you read the book you feel like you are stuck in the middle of the book. In conclusion this book is a very good one and we think that you should take the time out and read it !"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book a month or so ago in my 6th grade literature class.I really liked the book and it's theme and moral.It did however have some very strange and well....odd parts in it.A lot of the kids in my grade didn't like the book and thought it was wierd which is okay,they were too immature to realize it's strong moral.I really enjoyed discussing this book in class and I think part of the reason some kids might not like it is because they didn't have someone to explain to them some of the confusing things in the book.As the author leaves you hanging on some details of it.It's a better read aloud for younger kids (5-7th grade possibly 8th grade might need an explanation or two).The author never tells you the ending which did drive me nuts but my teacher read an interview of the author about the hanging ending and she gave a reasonable explanation about how she wanted the reader to \\"imagine\\" the ending him or herself.It was a great book and I'm glad I had a chance to read it,it's better than summary on the back and plus the summary ruins everything for you,so my suggestion is \\"Don't read the back!\\" if you haven't already.I'd also like to state this WAS written by a 12 year old for all you other kids who might not believe this is an actual kid,lol :)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I personally like to read stories with more realistic qualities than the Giver, by Lois Lowery had to offer. However, if you were looking for some real fiction, this would be a good choice. This story is a very easy read about a boy growing up in a community of all \`sameness' where members of the community have everything laid out for them such as their spouses, their children and their careers. Jonas, the main character, is given a big role in the community that is supposed to be an honor that only pushes Jonas away from his friends, family and community. Also, along with finding the story extremely unrealistic, I found it was still sad and almost depressing. Not a bad story for an open mind or a young child."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book so much, I couldn't put it down, even to eat dinner. The plot was so intriguing! Thanks, Lois."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my opinion the book The Giver, by Lois Lowry is a good read. There is an Orwellian feel to this book. If you liked 1984, then this is the book for you.The book The Giver by Lois Lowry creates a utopian society in which the main character Jonas lives. The community is based on the fact that every citizen has a purpose, and although this may seem as the ideal situation, each citizen serves only that purpose. This community is based on structure, not allowing for variables such as individualized birthdays or love in a romantic sense. The leader of the community is called the Receiver. The receiver holds all the memories of the community. This is the most important job in the community.Each year a ceremony is held that determines the future for every 12 year old in the community. This is a bit extreme when you consider that most 20 year olds don't know what their future is today. When the Ceremony of twelve occurs each child is given their assignment, and from then on they focus on the training of their assigned occupation. Upon receiving his assignment Jonas is given his assignment as the Receiver. His job is important because the community trusts him to make major decisions based on his memories. Jonas accepts his assignment, although the more he learns, the more he hates his society. This book gives you a view at what the world could be if the phrase \\"every man is created equal\\" is taken to the extreme. A world where the basics such as food and shelter are well provided for, yet the basics such as emotion and desire are non existent. This may seem idealistic, yet aren't those the things that make us human?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Try to imagine a world without feelings, without color, without decisions. Welcome to the world of a 12 year-old boy named Jonas who lives in a futuristic community that has eliminated all of these things and much more. He can't love his own parents, listen to music, or even decide what he wants to do with his life; all these things are forbidden to him. He has never experienced any of these things until now, but how can he keep these beautiful and wonderful things to himself? How do you explain love or a beautiful sunset to someone who can't see color or express feelings? He decides that he can't go back now since he has experienced these things, he must do something to change the community forever."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Ever wonder what life would be like without color? Not just colors as a painter would put on a palette, blues, yellows, purples, and reds, but those colors which give depth and purpose to life, like hope, family, choices, and love. In Lowry's world of \\"Sameness,\\" the reader is confronted with an unsettling and even frightening sense of familiarity with this strange world which exists without any sort of color. Following Jonas, a boy of twelve, Lowry explores the fundamental questions surrounding the importance of life, choices, and individuality. While it is categorized as a young adults' book, its themes and characters speak to all generations. Through the memories of a life \\"back and back and back\\" in time, Jonas and the Giver gain the wisdom and strength to make a choice that will change everything they have ever known. Through Lowry's colorful, energetic, depth of language, the reader is drawn into Jonas' world and forced to remember with him what life really means.Personally, I would recommend this book to anyone, no matter what age, race, or creed. It is a story all can relate to and one that forces us to take a step back and take another look at life. If you enjoyed the movie \\"Pleasantville\\" you will love The Giver. By addressing these things in a children's book, Lowry deftly introduces these fundamental and extremely important ideas of life to those who will one day have the power to change the world. Beautifully crafted and poignant, The Giver is without a doubt a little masterpiece of emotion and art."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is the story of a boy named Jonas, who, in his society, is about to go out into the world with his new job and new schedule.

He is given an assignment full of honor and intrigue. No one knows what it truly is and so Jonas starts off on his adventure. This is a boy who has always grown up following orders and doing exactly as he's told and then, through his job he is suddenly shown a way for things to be otherwise, a world where things were not always \\"sameness.\\" This novel is many different things all put together and I do suppose you'd have to talk to the author to know exactly which idea they truly were trying to express, but overall, this is an examination of our society and how people all wish for things that might not be as wonderful as they may sound to be. This story's moral that hit me the most was that which says that with the good comes the bad and the thought that even if one is so wretched that you might not think you can survive, it's still worth the wonder that you have in exchange."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is a well done view into a \\"perfect world\\" scenario.

I would recommend this book to any and everyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Hey! WEll, I read this book for my humaties clss this month! And it was a great book! First it sounded boring but it got so interesting afterwards! I recomend this book to anyone who likes scince fiction. But I think that anyone can enjoy this book!This book is about a boy named Jonas. He has a little sister named Lily. His father is a nuturer. Well, Jonas lives in this DIFFERENT community. It seems very weird to me. Like one thing is that no one in the community is allowed to ride bicycles until they are a Nine(nine years old). Isn't that weird? WEll, in this book, you will find many interesting rules and things happening in thi small but exciting community.Have fun reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What would you do if you lived in a world without color, without love, without pride, without choices? It wouldn't be hard if you didn't know it any other way. Jonas's world seems perfect. Everyone has a job, everyone has food, and everyone is the same. But what lays beyond this community? Is there something else? When Jonas is selected to be the Reciever, he learns that ther is a different way. A better way. There could be love, pride, and choice. Jonas holds the community's memories. He has no one to share the burden with but the Giver, the man who transmits the memories to Jonas. But when Jonas finds out of the community's dark secret, he must learn that when you don't know it any other way, you only do what you know. With hate comes loves, with love comes courage, and with courage comes the will to survive."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver is an outstanding book. This book shows how the lives of the people in the community is different than that of ours. Their life was more protected and kept to themselves than ours is. Our life is just plain out unpredictable.At first I thought the book was boring because I dont usually like how books just take so much time in explaining the background of the story. I like books that just start out with the story then slowly have flash backs and tell what happened in the past. This book got interesting when Jonas became the Reciever of memory. Therefore I liked the book and i recomend that many people should read this."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is a book about life and what we take for granted in it. Lowry shows all the different things that we do in every day life that in the utopian community, in the book, the people can not do. For example, the people get assigned their jobs, they dont have the freedom to chose it themselves.I think The Giver is a great book to learn some of life's lessons from. Though Lowry contradicts her story a couple times it is over all an interesting book. I believe that every one should read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is an entertaining book, but it is not very realistic. The main person, called Jonas, should become the new Receiver of Memory. He is the only person in his community, who can see colours, and has feelings (besides the Giver)and so he learned how terrible it is to be the only one, who feels love. At the end of the book he decided to do something for the people in the community, but you don't know what happens to him and the community, because of this open end, you have to think about Jonas and his future life.So it is quite interessting, but I was not very lucky about the end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book is about a boy who lives in a communtiy. He gets selected to be the new receiver of the community. He gets the memories of the whole past from a person who saved them for his whole life in his BIG brain.

He wants to leave the community to give the memories back to the inhabitants..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver takes place in a Utopian society where everything is under control and there are no choices, war, fear, or pain. I think that the author, Lois Lowry, presents a glimpse of what our world could one day be like through the eyes of a young boy named Jonas. It would be a world with no war, pain, and homelessness, but also no love,feelings, colour, and happiness. In this novel, I think that the author presents us with a powerful thought that forces us to reflect about our lives until we can really appreciate the true meaning of life. I would strongly recommend The Giver to anyone of any age, because I feel it has a significant meaning to get across to all its readers. The Giver is an excellent novel that ultimately depends upon the opinion and interpretation of each of its readers to create the ending. If you ever need a book to read, try reading The Giver, I would be surprised if you didn&#65533;t enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was my first and only (so obviously favorite) book of Lois Lowry's. In the beginning, the world is far into the future. They have all forgotten their past and there is a srtict order of life. But one boy seems to be different from the other children. This boy sees beond what others can. He has a gift to become the next receiver of the past. It starts out as fun and games but there seems to be a lot more than that to the past. Soon he begins to see color instead of the average gray. He soon feels pain where there was none before. He even realizes some of his favorite games as a child were horrific battles in the past. He soon can't take much more and creates a plan with the Giver of information. Lois Lowry was really able to capture my imagination with this book and it remains one of my favorite of all time. And the end just keeps you guessing for more. More that I even wrote an ending for myself. This is a wonderful book thougha tad short and I recommend it to a Lowry fan or any one who likes a good fiction."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"the giver is one of my top ten books. i read it first when i was in fifth grade, and every year I read it at least once. it really makes you appreciate the society we live in now. the ending is left unexplained, and it haunts me when i finish reading. this books will make you think..it is sad and creepy. But I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver is a intriguing book about A boy named Jonas, who lives in a perfect world with no crime, war, or disease. When Jonas is twelve he is given the job of receiver of memory, a great honor. I liked this book because the book is full of suprises and because at the end of each chapter you don't want to stop reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Alright, I'll admit I did read this book three times and yet I only gave it four stars. It is a wonderful book it just can get boring sometimes. It's about a supposed &quot;utopia&quot; if that's what you want to call it, where all the people are organized and their differences curbed. Once they reach a certain age they are all placed into jobs picked by the leaders of their communities. Jonah, the main character, has special qualities and that's where the story gets weird. I don't want to get into details so I'll stop writing. I just want to say, before you buy this you might want to check it out at the library first."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Not being an avid reader, I was drawn to the Giver more by its cover than by its reputation. However, having read the book, I would definitely say that it is extremely profound, and worthwile for everyone to read. I am disappointed to hear the bad reviews from younger readers of this book, and I am disappointed to hear that it is being used in younger curriculums, as I think the deeper meaning of the book is being lost. I am a fan of books that make you think and question, and if you enjoy authors like Vonnegut (my personal favorite) you should not pass over this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book because other teachers at my school were using it in their curriculum, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I read it straight through in an afternoon, then read it three more times over the course of the following week! I tried to get everyone I ran into to read it, bought a few copies to give away and kept loaning mine out!The story of Jonas, and what he learns about his community, is riveting. Lois Lowry presents a future dystopia that is so disturbing simply because it is so terribly possible. Her straightforward style, with surprises unfolding at every turn, is easy to read, but has many levels that give depth to her tale.As a teacher, I recommend this book for the effect that it had on my students (after reading it I decided I just *had* to teach this book), but as a lover of literature I would recommend it to anyone of any age. This book might be listed as \\"teen fiction,\\" but it falls into the same category as \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984.\\""},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Hello, I find the book is a very good english-written book. You can read it very simple and you understand it. It is not like a few other english books, which you can read, but you didn't understand them, because they are not written as straight forwardly.And it is a theme which can be reallity in some hundret years.I like it to read, but it'is too short.When you have read it you would that it will go on,so you are longer in this great fantastic world in Jonas. In the one who is chosen to be the first in this little state. It was much fun to read it and I would read more such books like the Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book is the best english-written book I've ever read. That's not because it's my first one. It's also much better than some German books because it shows a future that really could be in some hundret years. Jonas lives in this world and he only can see black and white, don't know what has been in the past and does everyday the same job. But then comes the day of his 12th birthday and everything changes It's interesting written, easy to understand and it's great fun to read this novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book for my English lesson at school and although I thought it would be very difficult to understand and maybe boring, it wasn't. It was exactly the opposite of what I had thought. It is a very interesting book written with lots of fantasy without becoming a children's book. Well, maybe children would also like the book, but I'm actually 15 and I liked it very much. It is about a community that tries to be perfect, it is isolated and The Elders (the leaders)give many rules to make the community as perfect as possible. I won't tell you anything more about the plot, because I think you should read the book and see what it is about by your own. I rated the book with 4 stars, because although I find it very interesting and not difficult to understand, I think some things could be better, like the end, for example. I can tell you one thing for sure: Once you start to read it, you can't put it down."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Well I don't know how to start, at first I must say that I'm writing this review for my English lesson. I did like the book .I think that &quot;The Giver&quot; is the kind of book where you don't know what will happen. The author describes the situation in a paticular way so that you want to read more and more.What I didn't like is that it has an open end. If I begin telling you the story it won't make any sense to you to read it .That's why I'm only telling you my opinon. I recommend this book hoping that you will read it. :):):):)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry has created a marvelous novel in The Giver, one that received deserved attention at the time of its publishing (1994) and has only grown in reputation since. This book addresses both the pleasure and pain of having the freedom of choice in society and society's constant need to force people to conform. It has shades of 1984 and, especially, Brave New World but has much that feels new and potent. The main hero, Jonas, is a marvelous creation and captures the reader from the start and carries them through to the exciting climax of the book. This book will live on and will be endlessly debated by children for decades to come and will remain in the memory of every adult who ventured down this terrifying path in their childhood."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Several friends and acquaintances of mine over the years have said that Louis Lowry's THE GIVER is their favorite book of all-time. I finally got around to reading the book not too long ago and am only disappointed that it took me so long to finally getting around to reading it. The book is very easy to read, but is underlined by a deep philosophical questioning. The book could be described as a cross between Plato's \\"Parable of the Cave\\" and Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD written towards a young adult audience.THE GIVER takes place in an undefined, perhaps post-apocalyptic world, future. In the community in which Jonas lives there is no crime, poverty, violence, or misery. The community is well-ordered and disciplined. Every family spends each night talking together about the events of the day and all that they thought and felt; think of family-time as being a confessional. When a child enters into \\"maturity\\" they are given a pill that suppresses all sexual and aggressive urges they may have. The community seems to be perfect and everyone seems completely happy. Everyone is assigned a life occupation when they turn twelve. Jonas is twelve and at the ceremony in which their occupation is assigned, Jonas' name is skipped. It turns out that Jonas has been selected to be the next \\"receiver of memory\\". He is trained by an Elder known as \\"The Giver\\". Under the tutelage of The Giver, Jonas is allowed to see all that has been sacrificed and suppressed for the perfectly-ordered community in which he lives. He experiences feelings, colors, and thoughts that he was never able to experience before. He learns the cost of perfection and has to choose if he will become a contributor to it or if he will run.Even though there are no dull moments, THE GIVER begins rather slowly, but moves at a quick pace from the time of the ceremony on. It deals with some very important issues including individuality, diversity, and euthanasia. The book is classified as young adult literature, but the novel appeals to readers of all ages. THE GIVER is a world where everything literally appears to be either black and white, but as Jonas discovers, the world is more than just black and white; it's full of brilliant colors."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I first read The Giver I was still a child and I loved it! It was thought provoking novel that kept the reader wanting more. I recently re-read the book and enjoyed it more than ever. It is about a young boy named Jonah who lives in the perfect society. There is no crime, no war, no pain, and nothing to hurt the inhabitants. However, there is also no happiness or love. When Jonah turns twelve, he is instructed that he is to become the new receiver of memories and take the place of the previous one. Jonah has no idea what this involves and is excited to learn. The job is not what he expected and is about to discover all the secrets that have been hidden from him, and the entire town, his whole life.If you have read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and enjoyed it, or have been a reader of Lois Lowry, this book is a must read! Enjoyable at any age, The Giver is truly an astounding novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It's been 13 years since I was in 5th grade, when my teacher read The Giver aloud to my class. I have read this book atleast a dozen times since then and everytime it makes me feel the same way it did 13 years ago: enlightened and more aware of the world around me. I can say with all confidence that this book changed me as a child and it's the book that made me want to read; it made me love reading. To any parent browsing this page, wondering if this would be a good investment for their child: please take a chance. While the subject matter may be \\"too mature\\" to some, I feel that it is too important to keep from any child."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed this book basically because of its diversity. The Giver was like nothing I had ever read before. With a combination of intensity, depth, and a somewhat alien community, this was unique and suspenseful. I had been told by other Giver readers to \\"read slow and take notice of everything\\", but I just couldn't put it down. I was so disappointed when the book came to an end, but I was lifted right back up again, when I discovered that The Giver was part of a series."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I came across The Giver while teaching a high school English class. I read it leisurely over one weekend, enjoyed it, and found myself reflecting over it for several weeks.The Giver won the 1994 Newbery Medal for most distinguished contribution to American literature for children. It is, along with the sequels mentioned below, dystopian in outlook. The Giver is thought provoking and appropriate for adolescent or young adult readers. It certainly could be used in a middle or high school literature or English class. As with many well-written books, it can be read just as a good story however, issues such as community, security and individual liberty are reoccurring themes. Those ideas are not presented in a graphic or sexual way but for the reader to understand them a certain level of mental maturity is required. I would recommend the book for good readers starting at about the age of twelve.The milieu of the story is fascinating and believable in most of its detail. The protagonist, Jonas, lives in a world that appears, on the surface, like a utopia but that veneer covers a darker side of humanity. Resist reading reviews that reveal the details of this world, they should be discovered as the author intended.Readers tend to have strong opinions about the ending of The Giver. I find the ending lacking in closure and incomplete. The Giver does not end in the sense of a traditional book--it just stops.Two other books by Lois Lowry are set in different locations of the same world, Gathering Blue and Messenger. I have reviewed both. Gathering Blue answers one or two questions left hanging from The Giver but then adds a few more. Finally, in Messenger, we get more, but not all, answers to questions left over from The Giver. This might be fine if the books were actually planned as a series, but I do not believe that was the original intention. Since I believe each book should be a unit unto itself, I can only grant The Giver four stars.Overall, The Giver is an enjoyable book for adolescent or young adult readers and has earned my recommendation.Kyle Pratt"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is indeed an amazingly written and well thought-out book. No wonder it's so well reviewed and awarded. It really makes you look at society and life in general today, and practically anyone can relate to the main character on some level.Personally, I wish that I had read this back in middle school and believe that more books along this order (like F. 451, 1984 and Brave New World) should be required reading for students. Books like this are helpful in teaching younger people to question the way things are and, more importantly: why things are the way they are. We are short on true thinkers these days, not conformists.As for my rating, the only thing that keeps this from getting 5 stars is the ending! I guess I feel that there could have been a little more closure, as with what happens with the main character, but then again, that was probably the intent here; to encourage reflection."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a really great Science Fiction story!!It is very well written, answering enough questions to keep you satisfied, but leaving enough unsaid that will keep your imagination going strong! The Characters are well-developed, and the story flows along at a good pace.This is the plot:Jonas is a 11-12 year old boy who lives in a very controlled community. There is no disease, poverty, violence, etc. The climate is perfectly controlled, and the landscape is flat and unchanging. Sounds perfect, huh? Not to Jonas. He can't quite pinpoint it, but something in this Utopia isn't quite perfect.The most important factor in Jonas' life, The Ceremony of 12, is fast aproaching. In this ceremony, All 12 year old children will receive there life time job. Jonas has no idea what his will be, but when his job is chosen, it is the thing Jonas least expects.He is chosen to be The Receiver of Memory. This job is filled with honor, and shrouded in mystery. Jonas finds his life is taking an unexpected turn. In this job all memories, from years and years ago, will be passed on to Jonas, painful memories, and memories of joy. As Jonas progresses, he comes to realize what his 'utopia' lacks. And there is no hiding from the choice Jonas now faces.You must read the book to find out what happens!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is wonderful.I recomend this book to people over 12 because it is intense and it is a tear jerker in many places in the book. I believe Jonas in the book is right in almost everything he says. He is definately right. He is the main character. He can do things that no one else can do. It is a good book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I absolutely adore this novel. I remember reading it in junior high school and now I find myself re-reading it in college. This is one of my favorite books of all time to say the least. Any person can read this book and I can predict they will not be able to put it down. The writing is incredible and the character of \\"Jonas\\" is so real. \\"The Giver\\" is one of the best novels ever written without a doubt."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A true classic. Reviews indicate that The Giver is for ages 12 to 14, or young adult. My 12 year old grandson told me it was his favorite book, so when I saw it at a yardsale, I bought it.

One good thing about this book is that it was not boring. One bad thing about it was that none of the people wanted to feel real pian or know the past. I gave this book 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a twelve-year-old boy, in a world with out color, music, choices, or differences of any kind. Where people &quot;apply&quot; for children. Where people assign jobs to people. Where people are &quot;released&quot; when they get to old or do something wrong. The main charactor is &quot;Jonas&quot;. Jonas can see color, hear music, and knows of the world before it became like it was presently. Jonas is compelled to change it back. The most emotional part was when Jonas was out in a field and all the kids started playing &quot;war&quot;. The thing is, they don't even know what war is. As they're zapping each other Jonas goes into a fit because he knows what war is. I think that this book is one of the greatest books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just read this book and it is fantastic!

It has unique story. This is probably on of the best sci-fi books I have read. The book is about a boy named Jonas. Jonas lives in a &quot;perfect&quot; town.

The Giver is a man that holds all of the memories of color, feelings, etc. The Giver's job is to pass on the memories to Jonas. When Jonas finds out all of this new information, he wants to share it to the world. How will Jonas do it? You'll have to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's book is both disturbing and wonderful. It makes us seriously consider our choice to make everyone the same. This book is not just for young adults. I first read it when I was 18, but it now rests as part of my perminant collection of books. It is a great book for both young and old. It can also be read in a single sitting, which is a plus, because it is hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really loved this book!

It had that classic idea that the government will eventually own everything, including our memories. I don't know if I neccissarily agree with the idea of our government eventually becoming totally Nazi-ish but it's definately a possibility. There is also is the very interesting idea that people can hold other people's memories. While I have heard some folklore that poked at this idea, I have never read another book that so clearly and accurately depicted this idea in story format. All in all this is a good book and I would recommend it for children and adults, although some of the deeper aspects of the book might be hard for very young children to grasp."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A great book that really pulls you into it. The plot is great and develops smoothly. The characters are well developed and the book itself is written greatly. This book is recommended reading for anyone who likes this style, and some who might not. When i first started reading it i really didnt want to but then it just pulled me in."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is a thoughtful, interesting book. Lois Lowry writes about a controlled society and a boy finding his way through life in that community. The book raises issues concerning constant control and makes the reader consider everything they take for granted in their daily lives. The book itself ends with the reader still questioning how Jonas' life ends. Personally, I liked The Giver for the questions it raised and how it made me actually think about what life could be like. The only thing I found that it should have more of was adventure or some excitement. It was a very thoughtful book, and not a book to read just for entertainment purposes."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The imagination of Lois Lowry seems boundless as she creates a world with perfect detail. The explanation is flawless, the images peerless. Once I picked up the book, I could not stop reading it. From the beginning, when the main character, Jonas is getting ready for very important ceremony of Twelve, until the end, I was mesmerized by this book. Freedoms, which are taken for granted in our world, are talked about in this book and it really made me appreciate them. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Utopian-style books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The central themes in The Giver bring up a common question. What would life be like without emotions? Pain and suffering? Love? Personal choice? War? Color? I can't even begin to imagine what life would be like if there was not color. Lois Lowry does an amazing job of describing the life of a young boy named Jonas in a community lacking emotions and responsibility. Through Jonas, we the readers are given insight into what life would be like in a community like that.While I was reading The Giver, I realized that this book is very much like Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Both authors chose to write about a place where basic human rights are stripped away without the citizens even knowing there is something missing. I think that The Giver was written for a younger and less complex audience than Brave New World, but they are both very good books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book because it is not straight forward because straight forward books bore me.I love it when a book keeps you gueseing! Because in some parts you eather dont understaned it or it does not tell you everything you want to know which lets you think about what will happen and whats not fun about that! It is packed with emotions we have everyday but for the main charecter it is a whole new world!But even though it is very emotinal you wont shed a tear in this out of this world wonderfull book!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I like this book becouse it made me think and it is a lot like other stoies.I didnt under stand all of it and some of it is still confusing to me aswell.This book kind of put me in a spot of where i dont know what is going to happemn next!!! At the end I was not such what realy happened, But I wish there was more!!I had to think a lot to understand most of it, and the other stuff I just will never know.

Jonas is choosen to become the giver, who is a person who stores all past memories of life. Jonas is given memories of what life used to be, which is what it is today and discovers war, pain and death. A really really good book that deals with reality and the choices of being oblivious and happy vs. realistic and having to deal with the hardships of life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Hands down without question the 2nd best book I've ever read. The Giver is a masterpiece written beautifully by Lois Lowry. I loved this book which showed similarities to Fahrenheit 451 but was in no way boring or unoriginal. It's amazing view of a world of sameness awed me and will entertain you too.The Giver is set in what is seen as the future although there are no references to what year it is or even to the date. The place is a \\"community\\" (one of the many different words used for substitutes in The Giver) that has adapted to total sameness. Everyone is the same to an extent: Every family unit has a boy, a girl, a mother, and a father. This is one of the many differences in this reality to ours. The protagonist is Jonas who is about to be assigned a job just like all the other twelve year olds. He has no idea what he is to be and is scared about it. Then he is selected to get special training from the Giver. The story follows Jonas training with the Giver.The only complaint I have about this book is that it could've been a lot shorter. And that's it. Lowry's amazing talent to tell you the necessary details at the necessary time allows the story to have moments where you read these details and are compelled to read on waiting for another one of those details. You will be astonished at the things this society lacks without you noticing. This is all tribute to the consuming way that Lowry tells the story. I recommend this book to anyone who has a pulse and can read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I liked the book because it shows how much we take individuality for granted.In the book the main character is Jonas. Jonas has been assigned to be the Receiver for his village. He doesn't know what it is but he finally finds out. When Jonas meets the Giver he learns more than he expected. The memories he got had color and feeling which he never saw or felt before. After he has the memories his life goes crashing into reality and he must find a way to escapeThe type of reader I think that would like this book is a person who likes adventures, the book seems like its from a different culture so the reader can imagine"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" is a story written by Lois Lowry that conveys what human life would be like if no thought or feelings were involved. Life just goes on as normal with people never asking any questions on why such activities are done the way they are in the town. The story begins to pick up when Jonas is selected as to be the Receiver of town (the most respected position). As this happens, a whole new story is unfolded to the reader.Overall, this is a wonderful story that brings the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotions as Jonas begins to receive memories that everyone takes for granted. Due to the variety of emotions the reader feels, it becomes very hard to put the book down, because the reader feels the need to find out what happens to Jonas. This is a very good story that keeps the reader interested throughout the entire story and still keeps the reader wanting more at the end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book the Giver by Lois Lowry is a book that is set up in the future. It is a Utopian Society where everybody is equal and everything is the same. There the people don&#65533;t have choices they don&#65533;t even know what choices are. There are no colors, music, and everything else is the same like the weather and the land.There is a tradition in the community that when a child turns 12 there is a ceremony where they will get their job assignment. There is a boy name Jonas and he receives the assignment of being the next &#65533;Receiver&#65533;. He is going to receive all the memories from the old times. Jonas and the Giver are the only ones in that society that know what change and choices are, but it is too much to handle for just two people. So they have do make a decision on how they&#65533;ll make the society with choices and freedom of decision. By reading this wonderfully creative story you&#65533;ll find out what happens in the end.

I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read good stories.-Robbie"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think that this is a great book, if you like to let your mind wonder a little and explore possibilities of the future of civiliazation. The writer keeps you into the book even without action and adventure like qualities it gets you hooked like one."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"After having read The Giver by Lois Lowry, I find it an excellent book. When reading this book, I found it hard to put down because of how different Jonas's society was. The community, where Jonas lived in reminded me of Utopia, an ideally perfect place where people in the mid 1800s were seeking. They were unsuccessful because they could not start over. For in the book, the community was able to start over by giving up suffering, color, and meaningful words such as love.I also found this book interesting because Lowry takes the reader through process of Jonas's thinking, which led up to his major decision, a decision he made himself, not by the society's conforming rules and regulations. I especially loved the ending, where Jonas, the Receiver of Memories, was able to seek the life he hoped for. His life changed the community's Utopian society.This short book brought me into an entirely new world as I was reading the novel, and left me with a whole different perspective on Utopia. The perfect place in society is not everything; there are some losses. The most important lost is the meaning of love."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that this book was very good. It shows you how life would be like if you did not have to make life choices. It was also really sad.

As he is trained he begins to learn that his world isn't quite what it should be. He begins to understand just what everyone is missing.As the year rolls on he decides that something must be done.

Honored with the Newberry Medal, (which it truly deserved) this novel should be on every booklover's shelf.Lois Lowry is a remakable author. She never wastes a word in anything she writes. She takes her time with details and character development, making the story terrific and bore-free.The story follows an boy named Jonas, who lives in a society where there is no color, pain, war, divorce, or even love. Every person in this community has an assignment, which they receive at their 12th birthday. Jonas is honored with the assignment of Receiver of Memories, an assignment that only the bravest person can receive.Jonas is instructed about his assignment from the previous Receiver of Memories, or The Giver. From then on, Jonas experiences memories that no one else in his community remembers, except for The Giver such as love, sunshine, and color. But there are also other memories; painful memories such as physical pain, starvation, and warfare.\\"The Giver\\" is a remarkable book by a remarkable author. I'd say that kids 10 and up could read it. There are some dramatic and violent moments that could scare or upset children under that age.

The people there do not have a choice of who they marry, what their job is and if they have children or not. Their world is so controlled that there is no pain. There are no choices. Their lives are controlled by other people. They have certian things they must do. The rules are strict. If you break three rules you get \\"released\\" (killed). If you are born different or special you get released. They want everybody to be the same. When young people have crushes on people they must take pills. They take pills because they do not want men/boys and women/girls to fall in love or get too attached because chances are they will not get married to each other. The word love is an inappropriate word in their society. A long time ago everybody that was living in the society chose sameness as their way of life. From then on everybody is supposed to be the same. One of the very odd things about this society is that they see in black and white. Another odd thing is that they have never heard or seen animals. One day Jonas, the main character, who is a very intelligent boy, finally turned twelve. He went to the \\"Ceremony of the Twelves.\\" He got his job. Jonas got the most important job.

He is living in a normal and completely perfect world, living a normal and completely perfect family. There are no lies, no deception, no dishonesty, no hate, no war, no illness, no evil, and no good. Everything is gray so there is no racism, and everyone looks the same. Among all of these identical blobs of gray is Jonas who- on his twelfth birthday awaits to be assigned a job form the community. He finds he is different than many of his friends who where chosen as workers, doctors, nurses, and laborers. For Jonas was the new Receiver of Memories... In which only the giver, and elderly old man, can give to him. All he can offer is memories of relaxation, of pain, of color, of light, of good, of bad, and of a different Utopia other than the only one Jonas was used to.Jonas was different. He (as the receiver of memories) was allowed to lie, he could manipulate, and he could see color. Like the red of an apple or a patch of wheat blonde hair. In a world where there is no emotion the giver exposes Jonas to love, and to hate. To fear and pain and the cold and the heat. It is with this understanding and this emotion that he understands he must overthrow the community. He realizes the true insanity of the world around him, and the pure evil of his brainwashed friends and family.

But, it isn't what you think it is. This \\"perfect world\\" is nothing more than a prison where conformity is the golden rule. I happen to like the ending. It give room for you to think, instead of forcing on an ending to such a mind-boggling thing. There is an article out where the author, Lois Lowry, explans why her ending is like it is. She wanted people to form their own ideas and if she had given a definite one, there wouldn't be discussions about it. About writing a sequel: She feels that since some people feel that Jonas dies on the hill (there's this stage before you freeze to death that you see things and fall into a dreamlike state). There wouldn't be a sequal because he's dead. Btw, I'm one of those people that feel Jonas dies. It just seems like a tragic ending and you just gotta love those. And it's the only one that seems realistic to the story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you ever wonder what the perfect society would be like read this book. This book introduces us to the \\"perfect\\" society and the cost which is paid to uphold it. The book is a lesson to us all that perfection is better left as a idea as opposed to a reality. Character development is somewhat minimal in this book. Lowry does a good job with developing the main characters but the others are kind of flat, but don't get me wrong Lowry does a good job considering the length of the book. The plot is excellent and despite the flat charcters it will get you hooked."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a one of a kind masterpiece written by Lois Lowry. Jonas is an adventurous, courageous boy who undertakes the perilous job of Reciever of Memories (in training). The old Reciever of Memories keeps all the memories of the town from the old, outside world, inside him, many of which show him great pain, which he must now transfer to Jonas.A terrific book, Lois Lowry has yet again created a tragic yet wonderfully written fantasy. Caught by the suspense woven into her story, this book took me around 3-4 hrs. to read at an estimate.The ending came as a surprise, yet was tragically heroic of Jonas. This is a one-in-a-lifetime book. Try it out."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas was born into a perfect community. In a society where there is no unemployment, criminals, or poor people. Everything is perfect, and everyone is happy. In this world people are assigned to their spouse, and children are assigned to couples if the Committee of Elders believes the couple is qualified. All families in this community consist of a mother, a father, a male child, and a female child. Once a person in the community gets too old they move to the House of Elders, where they live until they are \\"released\\" from the community. A person can also file for \\"release\\" if he or she no longer wants to continue to live in the community.This year Jonas will become twelve years old. Becoming twelve is an important year for all children within this society. It is important because that is the year when all the \\"twelves\\" receive notice of their occupations in the community and begin their training. The Committee of Elders decides the careers for each child that will turn twelve in that year at a ceremony performed in front of the entire community. Jonas is given his job title last. He is assigned to be the Receiver of Memory, which is the most important job within the community. His job is to receive the memories held by The Giver in order for Jonas to become The Giver of Memory himself someday. His training is secretive and can be painful or pleasurable. The Giver transfers his memories of all things including love, color sensation, sledding in the snow, and war. Memories such as war can cause Jonas to have pain. On the other hand memories like sledding can be exciting for Jonas.Jonas' training will take much time to be completed because there are an abundance of memories to be transferred. The purpose of The Giver is to hold all the memories so the people of the society do not have to experience the bad memories or have the burden of holding memories. For instance, Jonas training is dramatic and he grows wiser. Jonas realizes there is more to life than just the community where Jonas lives. The author has shaped a creative plot that is fascinating and intriguing due to the creative plot with the concept of one person holding all the memories for everyone within a community.Written for young adults, The Giver convoys a positive and outgoing mood due to the fact that the society in which Jonas lives is protected and perfect. That memories are valuable and precious is a central theme in this book. It is important for people to experience a great variety of things and cherish their memories and experiences."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We read The Giver with An Audience for Einstein. Both are about memories, and feature a young main character. While different in many ways, they both make you think about where society is headed, and how technology can be used for good or evil. The Giver has a sadder ending than An Audience for Einstein. But both are fascinating. I would say that the future in The Giver is darker and more disturbing than the closer future of An Audience for Einstein. At least things somewhat return to normal in An Audience for Einstein, while things remain bad in The Giver at the end. In that regard, An Audience for Einstein has a happier ending, especially for the main character. The Giver is a classic novel, while An Audience for Einstein is newer. Both have won awards. They can be read by anyone from teens to adults and will hold your interest. I am glad I read both of them."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverBy: Lois LowryReviewed by: J. HoP.1The Giver is about a boy named Jonas. Jonas lived in a perfect small town governed by many rules. He gets excited about his ceremony of twelve years old because he gets assigned to his adult job. His job was to become the receiver of memories, or all the experience of the world. During his training, he experienced real world feelings that he was unable to experience in his perfect little town. After seeing what a \\"release\\" is and hearing that a newborn was going to be released, he couldn't stand living in the village anymore. He planned his and the newborn's escape from the village with the memory giver. In the end, Jonas and the baby were able to escape the village. There were some things I liked and disliked about the story.The part where there was the war scene was a part I didn't like. \\"Dirt streaked the boy's face and his matted blond hair. He lay sprawled, his uniform glistening with wet, fresh blood.\\" The war scene was really sad. A kid had to go to war and even got badly injured. \\"The colors of the carnage were grotesquely bright: the crimson wetness on the rough and dusty fabric, the ripped shreds of grass, startlingly green, in the boys yellow hair.\\" The scene was described in a sort of gory way because I pictured a place with lots of blood everywhere on the ground. There was another part in the story I disliked.The part where the newborn was released was another part I detested. \\"To his surprise, his father began very carefully to direct the needle into the top of newchild's forehead, puncturing the place where the fragile skin pulsed. The newborn squirmed and wailed faintly.\\" I felt sad for the baby. I knew that taking a shot at that area meant that there something bad was going to happen to the baby. \\"As he continued to watch, the newchild, no longer crying, moved his arms and legs in a jerking motion. Then he went limp. His head fell to the side, his eyes half open. Then he was still.\\" This quote from the story confirmed my guess about something bad happening to the baby. The baby was killed. There was also a part of the story that I liked.I liked the part where Jonas escapes with Gabe, a newborn. \\"'So,' Father went on, \`we obviously had to make the decision. Even I voted for Gabriel's release when we had the meeting this afternoon.'... But it was necessary because it had the child seat attached to the back. And he had taken Gabriel too.\\" Jonas was very brave to risk his life to save someone else even though he is a kid himself. \\"He wept because he was afraid now that he could not save Gabriel. He no longer cared about himself.\\" Jonas acted very kind. He put the well-being of the baby in front of himself."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine a world of black and white, a world where everyone is equal and no one is capable of doing wrong. There are no lies, no thieves, no murderers; everything is perfect. This is the place that Lois Lowry takes us to in her distopian novel, The Giver. She paints a picture of the perfect life; free from all wrongdoing and judgment. There is also, however, no feeling. The community that she artfully depicts fulfills almost any expectation. This place, though, lacks hate, love, joy, grief, pain, sorrow, and even happiness. The people of this numb community are always fed, but always hungry, not for food, but they are starving for some kind of Elsewhere, a place that they are totally oblivious to. The main character in this fictitious read is a young boy named Jonas. He is given the honor to bear the weight of the Memories of the Community; and often battles himself over this knowledge. Jonas is constantly conflicted with his yearning to share his ability. As soon as he received his gifts, he wished the community had abolished them, yet still wanted to protect the citizens from themselves. Until one day, he discovers a horrible truth, one that drives him to do the unthinkable. This book is a must-read. Lois Lowry is has an excellent ability to drive a plot through its end. The Giver is a powerful example of a distopian society at its worst, yet it still brings out the best in mankind. This book compared to such books as 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and Animal Farm."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As someone else stated, the concept and plot of this book has been mentioned many times, so I will not cover that area. I will simply explain why I love this book, and why I would recommend it to others.I simply fell in love with this book in the sixth grade. We were required to read it, and we were supposed to read a chapter a night - I read mine in a few days. Now mind you, that was over 10 years ago. I have since read it a handful of times, and each time, I draw different conclusions. I love that the book always leaves me wanting more; always leaves me imagining what would happen next; and always leaves me envisioning myself in the World it creates.I would recommend this book to anyone, including young adults all the way up to the elderly. It gives you a greater appreciation for things you would normally take for granted - like colors, emotions, and freedom to choose what to do with your life. I would also recommend seeing the movie equilibrium, or reading the book 1984 if you enjoy this quick and easy read. It's a more adult view of the same concept - a World with no emotions, no war, no pain, and sadly, no love."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The title of the book that I am reviewing is The Giver, the author is Lois Lowry, and I gave this book 5 stars.This story is about a 12 year old boy named Jonas and his journey into becoming a man. I gave this book 5 stars because you can really get a feel for what the characters are feeling. There are many packed into this wonderful story. Lois Lowry created a totally different world and she filled in everything you need to know to understand how Jonas and his friends feel. Once you get to the middle of the book you feel like you actually live where Jonas lives. In this time period there are no colors, no choice of jobs, when you become 12 you are offically an adult and age no longer matters. With each year there are different perks, like when you are 10 you get your first bicycle. Every family unit gets two kids, a boy and a girlm the parents a child has are not the people that geave birth to them Birth Mothers have all the kids in the village. Everything is assigned and nothing is a choice. There are only a certain amount of new children (babies) in the community each year. If there are too many new children the ones that weigh the least get released or killed. When your children have grown and they leave you house you go to live in the house of the old, then once you have been there for a few years the workers there preform you release (they kill you). It is a very sad way to live but that is how they do things in this time period. There are many different jobs in the community. One for almost every interest you have.When Jonas is assigned The Reciever of Memory, the most respected job in the community, he is frightened. He meets with the Giver, the former Reciever of Memory, to recieve memories of the past. All the memories he gets to start out with are all happy memories. Then once he has been recieving memories for about a year the memories start to get scary and painful to witness. The more memories Jonas recieves the angrier he gets with the life he lives. He wants to live with emotions and colors he doesn't want to live a miserable life anymore. He and the Giver are the only ones who know what life could be like, but they know they can't change the way the community has lived forever. Since they know they can't change the ways of the community they have to take matters into their own hands. Jonas plans to run away and take a new child that was going to be released the next day. He and Gaberial (the new child) run away to find a better place to live. They travel for days and days until Jonas hears music and he knows they have found refuge.I am a 12 year old that loves to read. Other tites that I would recomend are Gathering Blue, The Messenger, and the Harry Potter books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book back in 8th grade, many years ago. Now, I am not a huge book reader mind you. (Though I do keep up with the Harry Potter series.) But of all the books I have read, this has to be, by far, the best. I'll always remember when I was in school, reading this book, always wanting to skip ahead many chapters before class the next day. Ended up I read the whole book a week before we were suppose to finish it. I was enthralled buy it. Caught me be surprise that Jonas was seeing color for the first time. I was never told about that. Just the fact of a whole society where everything is controlled makes things interesting. Very well written in my opinion. With the ending, it isnt as bad as people think. The writer wants you to use your imagination and figure out what may have happened with Jonas. I think the ending is a good very happy. The Giver itself is a must read for any age."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Eleven-year-old Jonas lives in a community where all decisions are made for you--your career, your spouse, and even your children. Everything is meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made. Once you begin to have wants and desires, you're required to take a pill to suppress them. There are no deep feelings, no real sense of right and wrong, and love is meaningless and useless. The Elders control everything and keep everyone happy, healthy, and ignorant, as they are themselves ignorant and must look to The Giver--the person who knows all--for wisdom.When Jonas reaches the age of twelve, he's assigned a career based on what he did as a volunteer. Instead of being excited, Jonas is apprehensive about the upcoming ceremony-with good reason. He's selected as The Receiver, a very honorable position, and he must meet with The Giver every day after school to receive the memories of pain, war, destruction, happiness, and love--the memories of man from way back.The more Jonas learns, the more outraged he becomes. He wants to make his own choices, and he believes everyone should be able to choose what color of tunic they'd like to wear each day, but The Giver quickly tells him there are more complicated choices, and it's safer to protect people from making wrong choices when they're at the age when choices become important.Jonas learns that, yes, there is the pain of hunger, death, war, and cruelty, but there's also the happiness of birthday parties, holidays, spring rains, blue skies and sailing, horseback riding, and hugs and laughter. He learns that everyone should be able to experience making choices.Even though this novel was written for teens, I truly enjoyed it from beginning to end. Several conflicting emotions surged through me as I read \\"The Giver\\"--at first it was anger that anyone could conceive of such a place, but mostly I was confused because I couldn't decide if the community Jonas lived in was truly a good thing. Part of me thought it was. People do tend to make stupid choices and mess up not only their own lives but also the lives of those around them. But the emotional side of me kept screaming, It's wrong! All wrong! Because I had the gift of wisdom, the knowledge of right and wrong, and an array of emotions, I couldn't agree with such a community. In the end I had to agree with Jonas and The Giver. No one should have the freedom of choice taken from them.At the end of the book, you, the reader, are left to determine what fate you think Jonas saw. Yours will probably be different from mine, depending on your optimism. I like to think...well, I wouldn't want to influence your thinking. Everyone should read \\"The Giver\\". It's a powerful, thought-provoking story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"different from gathering blue, this book is just as good. jonas lives in a world of organization, where no memories are found, no colors or sounds. there is one person who holds them all, the giver. it is so organized that you have no choices. 2 kids per family, extra infants are killed, the leaders don't know anything, nor do they want to. it is a world unexpected and makes you think. makes you wonder but most of all, makes you feel happy for what you have. it sheds light on the most unnoticed things in life, like love, sight, sound, color, and the choices you make. this book was and is a part of me always because it taught me an important lesson, to appreciate."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The story was about a boy named Jonas. The world that he lived in was very special. Everyone was under control, and they couldn't see color! The company \\"released\\" some people and you can ask to be released, too. There was no war or fighting in their world. The family in that world could just have four people a mother, a father, a brother, and a sister. Jonas was a 12years old kid. In that world, when the children were twelve, they would receive an assigned job, and they had to do that job forever. Jonas had a job: the receiver. This job was to receive all the memory. The Giver, who was the receiver in the past, gave Jonas all the memories everyday, after a year, the Giver told Jonas that if the receiver was gone then the memories that he received would go back to the people, so the people would see color again and \\"remember\\" things. Jonas wanted everyone to have the memories, so he and the Giver planned to escape from the community. At last, Jonas escaped! But everyday there were airplanes searching for him. There was no clear ending for this book, but I thought Jonas had died.The center controlling the community seemed good. Everyone would live safely and never have trouble. The same things happen again and again every year. They called this \\"Sameness\\" Some jobs such as Jonas father in the story required killing people. That is too sanguinary.I think I'd like the job of a receiver. Then I can remember the things that nobody can remember and see colors. I can call out some memory when I am cold or when I need it. But if everyone can see colors or remember things that are good, too. I think that \\"release\\" is too terrible. Put a poison needle into person's head and kill them! I would cancel that part if I were the writer. I think he was dreaming at last and his real body got frozen. Everybody can imagine their own ending. But I suggest that the writer can end the story clearly so I won't be confused. I guess maybe the writer didn't have time, so the writer didn't write the ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Story: Jonas lives in a new futuristic \\"perfect\\" world. No pain. No wars.

But Jonas thinks that the world SHOULD see and have these memories because with the pain, comes great benefits. It isn't really living unless you them. What will Jonas do to satisfy his desire to share it with the world?Comments: I love this book. I love all the science fiction books I've read so far. It makes you feel sad for the people in his world since there is no true feelings and stuff like that but it makes you appreciate your world.

Jonas the main character in \\"The Giver\\" faces this conflict when he questions where people go after their jobs are over or if they are not qualified for a job.

There is no war, no pain, no unemployment - everyone is assigned a job in the community. Everything is taken care of. When Jonas turns twelve, he is assigned to the lonely but highly honored job of Receiver of Memory. In his new life he discovers that his Utopian lifestyle has not been around forever, that before his day there was more than this. There was war, there was pain, poverty, joy, colors, happiness; much more feeling than anyone in his lifestyle has ever experienced. The Giver, who is giving Jonas all the memories of the past, is training him so that the community can call upon Jonas when they need wisdom. Jonas later becomes confused, because he is to bear the burden of the past while the mindless drones in the community continue their \`perfect' lives. He wonders if one person is to bear this burden while the others continue not knowing anything, or if everyone should know the truth of the past. He discusses his feelings with The Giver, and they hatch a plan. Want to find out more? Read the book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book! There was a few proubles with it though. I recomend this book for people how like an ending that dosn't tell what happenes to the charters. I think that the author should have told us me of what happened in the end. Another prouble with the book is that it has a lot of counter dictions. It say they don't have guns, but a few pages later they do.I think it was not as rewarding at the end of the book. I still will recomend the book, becuse it has a lot of good twist in it.

So dont even hesitate to buy it because you will LOVE IT!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book The Giver was a very good book. Although it had many unanswered questions, I thought that it was interesting trying to think of what could have happened. I also liked the fact that they kept on going back to the beginning of the book and connected everything together to make it a great story.Lois Lowry is a great author, and it is proven through this book. She puts in the story a couple little lesons that could relate to an everyday situation even though this story obviously takes place in the future.Overall this book is superb.

At first we were afraid not to understand the content, but while reading we recognized that the book was very simple to read and the content was easy to understand. And with the help of mind maps, which we should make to each chapter the content was lot easier to understand.The protagonist Jonas lives in a community, which seems to be perfect. But as Jonas is selected to be the new receiver of memory he observes that it is not as beautiful as it seems. From the memories he receives as the new receiver he notices that in \\"Elsewhere\\" there are feelings and colours and things he doesn't know about, but there is also pain and war.At first there is to say that we both have the same opinion about this book: The book is FANTASTIC!!!The way how the author describes the events, the feelings and thoughts of the characters impressed us. Each chapter has its own tension and some times the chapters brake up in a tension and this makes the book so exciting.It is only the ending we don't like much, because of the open ending. We think that the book would be better if the author has written on. And that's why we wrote our own endings in our class."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver: A book review by Jochen and WaldemarThe novel \`The Giver' by Lois Lowry is about a community in the future and a small boy who wants to escape from there. There were concrete attributes which he could not abide after he had not take drugs (pills against pain) like everybody else there.We liked the story \`The Giver' by Lois Lowry.To tell the truth we have to confess that on some parts of the story, the content was a bit boring. But all in all the entire book was imaginative. The mixture of science fiction and fantasy was new to us. With all that fantasy you could reconstruct it. You could imagine that the society today could develop to the society in the book. The book is maybe a alert the people in our world. The people want to have everything perfect today and you can see what might happen if everything seems to be perfect. The main character Jonas was the only one who saw the problem of the community in which he lived, and wanted to have a world in which nothing is perfect but a society with feelings like love.

We think it is too unreal but also very exciting. While reading the story you don't know what happens next, there are many surprises in the story. The idea to that story is very good but someway very silly. In this perfect world there is no pain and no feelings like love or something else. We think this world is very boring because everything is planned and you aren't allowed to choose your partner or your job. Something good is that there is no war. But in the community there are no colours, no weather, no cars and even no real families. Everything seems as a real world but it isn\`t because they live a lie. They can't carry their own life in their own hands, the Elders control everything.The book has an open end which makes the reader think.We think that the end is too abrupt.

We had to do mind maps, reviews, presentations and so on. All in all it was a time with a lot of work to do, but although with a lot of fun.The society we find in the book seems ideal. Everyone has a job for which he or she is suited emotionally, physically and mentally. The elderly are lovingly cared for. Every family has a mother, father, and two children, one of each sex. There is much laughter and joy. There is no rudeness, no crime and no disease.We see it all through the eyes of Jonas, a young boy about to receive his life's assignment along with others of his age group. To his surprise he is given the most respected job of all. He is to be trained to become the \\"Receiver of Memory\\". You see, in the society Lowry has created for us, the people don't want to be stressed with memories. However, they also don't want to make decisions or changes which, in the past, have led to disaster so they have assigned one person to keep all the memories of history, their own and that of all societies.The Receiver's job is to listen to their plans and just tell them whether or not they should do it based on the lessons of history. The present Receiver now sets about giving the memories- all of them - to Jonas. He does so through all of the senses. Jonas learns about war and hate, about snow and trees and colours. All of which are not present in this society. He also learns of the horror all around him. This novel is not difficult to read.I liked reading the book, it was not hard for me and I knew nearly all vocabulary. On the one hand it was not the kind of book I would read in my free time, but on the other hand I enjoyed reading it. The book showed us to keep individualism and not to build a perfect state, so the book is also transferable to our society. -Felix-I have to say that I don't like most science fiction books. It's only that I like this work although it is a science fiction and fantasy book. I liked the way Lois Lowry described the community. At first you think the community is perfect and you may want to live there, but then you see the disadvantages of this way of live that is what makes the book interesting. -Katja-"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think the book The Giver by Lois Lowry was a great book to read!

If somone asked me if i would recomend this book to them i would because i think anyone would like this book if they are a good reader or if they arnt. The book is about a young boy named Jonas that lives in a community protected by the rest of the world. When Jonas turns 12 years old he is awarded the job of being that leader of the community.

There is no crime, poverty, or prejudice, and everyone's happy, and everyone has a job, there's even control of the weather.

You get your job when you are twelve, at the ceremony of twelve's, there is also a ceremony for the other years, but this is the most important.

He was chosen to be the receiver of memories, who kept all the memories, feelings, and knowledge from Jonas's community and for everywhere around the world. The previous receiver gives Jonas all the memories, and he has to keep them. But Jonas thinks that the memories belong to the people, and secretly him and the Giver devise a plan to give them back.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book that you cant put down. Parts of it are hard to understand, and I'd only recommend it to someone who is a decent reader of all books. The book offers characters that you can relate too, and a brilliant plot.

As I was reading, I decided that this book was one of my favorites. As I reached the end of the book, I was unbelivably dissapointed. This book, which was full of detail, had just left an ending out to the open. Had jonas died? Was he dreaming? What happened? It seemes no one quite knows. If you love a book with a great ending, dont read this one."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" is a very strong novel whose main point is the importance of differences and choice. Also especially important is the theme of safety over freedom. It demonstrates these points by showing a society with very few differences and freedoms. In these respects it is very similar to \\"1984\\", and \\"A Brave New World\\", although it seems to be geared for a younger audience. The story revolves around a boy named Jonas who is chosen to become the only one in the community who is given the capability to remember the past. The rest of the community can only know things as they are now, not as they were before. No history books or other reference materials exist, so the \\"Receiver of Memories\\", as the position is titled, is the only person with knowledge that can be used in new situations. Everything and everyone else runs by a mechanical routine. Eventually Jonas, encouraged by the former Receiver, flees the village in order to restore the memories to all the people. The ends like \\"Lady and the Tiger\\" with no one knowing if Jonas makes it to a better place or dies in the attempt. The biggest problem I saw in this book was the predictable plot. Once you understood the job of the Receiver of Memories you could guess the rest. The term \\"release\\" in this book is a euphemism for death designed to be mysterious, but given that those inefficient per the needs of the community are \\"released\\" and disappear forever. You know that Jonas does not like or fit into the system, the old Receiver is idealistic and the book needs to make a point. It fits that they would try to change things. The only way to do that is to return memories to the people. The details are just that, details."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"There are two themes in this book which I really liked. The first, as Jonas learned after becoming the Receiver, is that without pain and sorrow, people are less able to appreciate joy. The second theme I liked was that the freedom to make one's own choices and determine one's own fate necessarily involves accepting the risk of making mistakes and failing. These two themes made the book worthwhile for me.I felt the book started out a little bit slow, and the ending left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied, but from the point where Jonas becomes the Receiver up to the point where he and the Giver make their fateful decision, this book was an interesting read with a good message to it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It was confusing at first and I am still trying to figure out the end.

When he turns twelve he is chosen by the community leaders to be the receiver of the Memories. Throughout the rest of the book strange things begin to happen to him.

I read this book once in fifth grade, and again this year. While thinking into the book i realized that The Giver is a great example of how society today is starting to mesh together.

Parents and grandparents pass down stories of their past to their children, who will pass their stories on.

For Jonas, a 12-year-old boy, just that happens. His exists in a community with the strongest sense of conformity. There philosophy is in the idea of sameness. They believe in this so strongly that they have removed memory, emotion, pain, and even color from their society. Jonas is chosen to become the Receiver of Memories. Everyone is so proud and confident in him, but Jonas will soon realize the corrupted community that is being controlled by. Jonas learns about emotion and freedom through an old man known as The Giver. He transfers his memories to Jonas, allowing him to experience love, pain, and joy first hand.This book is a great and easy read for the science fiction fan inside of us all. If you like the myth or folklore, it will be especially exciting. Every turn of the page hold a new twist that will leave you guessing for more. Although, if your a big fan of solid endings, don't be upset if this book leaves you with unanswered questions. I give this book a very solid 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry&#65533;s book The Giver is a book based on a community that lives in sameness to avoid conflict.

During his training he begins to see how blind and ignorant the people in his community are only because they have no memories of the past. Jonas starts to understand that you cannot truly learn if there are no memories of the past to teach you. He realizes he must do something to help his community to see the error of the way they live now.This book inspires the mind to realize how important it is to learn from the past but not to try and take away individualism. I believe this book is truly a one of a kind read that will defiantly open your eyes."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. Not only was it interesting but it was also an easy read. In the beginning, it started of by giving some backround to the story and their beliefs of the community. Then as the story goes on it shows how the boy learns that there is more to what he was brought up to know to be true. Towards the end of the book, he becomes rebellious as he starts to realize the truth. The giver's job was to give the memories of life to the receiver who turned out to be Jonas our main character and with those he felt that everyone should have the memories that the giver has fed to him. The only part I did not like to well was the ending. It was sort of a cliff hanger."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I liked reading this book. It was very easy reading and has some little brain teaser like ideas that make you think about things. I felt that Lois Lowry has some very interesting messages to share with the readers. I think it is a book that almost anyone would like to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of the few books that stays with me from my childhood (I am a high school senior now). My friends and I still have discussions about this book from time to time. It will always be a favorite of mine.I remember how entranced I was when my librarian first read it to me. It was probably my first exposure to a book with fantasy/science fiction elements and is probably what incited my interest in that genre. I am forever indebted to Lowry for writing this book and stimulating the thoughts of a little girl all those years ago.I really have to compliment Lowry on her amazing skill. In her novel, she has created a world very different from our own; one free of pain, suffering and fear. However, the cost of living in such a world, as Jonas, the main character, will discover, is very high. This novel shows the reader the value of his or her right to make decisions. In addition, the Giver, in its counter-utopian standpoint, reminds us that without the dark, one can never truly appreciate the light. How wonderful can love and comfort be when one has never experienced pain or sorrow? How enjoyable is the sudden burst of warmth one feels upon entering a house if one has never played for hours in the cold? In order to fully appreciate the good in the world one needs something to compare it against. Everything is relative."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;THE GIVER&quot; Author: Lois Lowry Report by: Shelton AmermanIn my own personal opinion, &quot;THE GIVER&quot;, by Lois Lowry, is an extremely bizarre book. It's a book about a future world. This world is supposedly perfect; no crime, no poverty, no starvation, no war, no prejudice, no overpopulation, no divorce, no pain, good educational system. Children grow up learning different jobs, rules of the community, good manners, and proper speech. When they reach the age of twelve( they celebrate birthdays all at the same time), they are assigned a job that fits with their abilities, if they want a spouse, they are assigned one, if they want children, they are assigned one male and one female, no more. When they are old, they go to a special facility. It's perfect; on the surface. There is also no freedom, no privacy, no emotion, no color, no music, no sunlight, no weather, no understanding of the past, no choice. When someone gets to old, they are &quot;released&quot;, if twins or an extra child is born, they are &quot;released&quot;(releasing is what they call killing). The book focuses primarily on the experiences of a boy called Jonas. When he turns twelve, he is selected for the most honored position in the community, &quot;Receiver of Memories&quot; from the &quot;Giver of Memories&quot;. The position is one in which &quot;The Giver&quot; gives memories of the past, both good and bad, to Jonas. Jonas learns that the community is not the perfect place he once thought it was. Then something happens that causes Jonas to do something drastic. At the end he......well, you'll have to read the book to find out. The book is very well written, very descriptive and imaginative, But the ending leaves you hanging. All in All, It's a good book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I downloaded this book onto my reader. Could hardly put it down; loved it. Until I came to the end. What? It just left you hanging, not knowing what the imagery was, not knowing whether Jonas was \\"there\\" or not. I looked it up online to make sure I hadn't had a hiccup when I downloaded and only got half the book. Nope. This book could have been great if the end was the middle. Very disappointing and dissatisfying."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Ah, The Giver is one of those few books which can completely captivate the mind and soul... and can do so with such simplistic and discernable writing.The Giver is the story of a futuristic society where choices are premade, emotions are fake, and human urges are supressed. Jonas is the novel's protagonist. He is an intelligent child who quickly finds out that this 'utopian' society is much more of a dystopian hell.As I read through this book, I was able to find shades of Orwell's 1984 or Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD; however, The Giver is quite distinct. Though it's concepts are not new, the way in which they are presented are quite spectacular.My advice would be to not read the reviews... for they will only ruin the book for you. As I read the book (having not previously known the action of the story) I was actually shocked and almost driven to tears at points. I was amazingly affected by this spectacular novel.Finally, to clear up the misunderstanding about the book's ambiguous ending. This ending NEEDED to be the conclusion. Thus we can truly decide if this novel should be considered a utopian or dystopian world. Compare this to the other great 'dystopian' novels 1984 and BRAVE NEW WORLD... both have a definate ending.This novel gives the reader a chance to believe... a chance to have faith... but most importantly, it gives the reader hope: a hope which The Community would never be able to 'release.'..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a book I really *wanted* to like. It's generally well-written, it's a widely-banned book, and deals with really incredible themes (is a society flawed if people are happy in it, the relationship of memory and emotion, &c.). In fact, the beginning and middle of the book are incredible--as is the very ending--Lowry brilliantly shows us a utopia/dystopia (the readers have to decide which they think it really is) and its effects. However, getting from the brilliant middle to the brilliant last page is a chore--after setting up a psychologically compelling picture of two people's struggles with the world they live in, the book turns into what I can only describe as a low-key adventure novel. It's almost as if Lowry decided that continuing to write with the attention given the first three-quarters of the book would make it too long for the format, so a few shortcuts (having certain characters act in decidedly odd ways, essentially eliminating all dialogue) had to be taken--and it's a real pity, because the book had the potential to be a 4- or 5-star novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book will become a classic among the many wonderful novels about the potential for counter-utopias (creating the opposite of a better life for humanity), and deserves far more than five stars. I found it as interesting and rewarding as 1984, Brave New World, and Atlas Shrugged.Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. The Giver was one of her picks. She said, &quot;It's an awesome book, Dad, and it will only take you an hour to reread.&quot; My wife then chimed in and said I really should review this book for Amazon.com. So here it is.Ms. Lowry paints a bleak picture of having achieved equal lives for all. Everyone gets the same things, and interactions are modulated so that there will be a minimum of social disorder. Think of this as socialism turned into a low-security prison camp operated by the inmates with the help of drugs to keep everyone's minds and emotions numb.The book evolves through the life of Jonas, a 12 year old, who has lived this life of great civility and little intensity up until the book's beginning. Then he goes through a great ritual in which each young person begins specific training for their life's work, as determined by the collective to best fit their skills and personalities.Jonas is to have a role that he did not even know existed. He is to be the one person in the society who will have memories of what occurred before the collective state was formed. His tutor will be the man who has had this role until now. That man is the Giver. I won't tell you any more, because I don't want to spoil the story. The rest proceeds much like what would occur with a hero in an Ayn Rand novel. The resolution of the conflict is a particularly inventive and thought-provoking one.This book is particularly good for showing the dangers of having everyone think alike. I heartily endorse its message of exploring new thoughts and experiences. Those provide us with greater comfort than a grey conformity that we do not even perceive as such.After you have finished enjoying this outstanding book, I suggest that you ask yourself what rules your family has that could be creating missed opportunities to be more caring and close to one another. After you locate those rules, I suggest you have a discussion about the benefits of changing those rules. Good luck!May you find warmth and love wherever you go!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I wanted to like this book much more than I actually did. I pushed through each chapter eager to learn more about Jonas, Giver, the community and some unanswered questions. Then all of a sudden, Giver is helping Jonas leave the community and the book ends with him and Gabriel in the snow....???? Did I miss something? And what's up with that red sled (from a memory) showing up at the top of the same hill ?.I do like books that make you think, ponder and then later wonder, \\"what ever happened to ....or, I wonder why....\\" but I was just irritated that the Giver abruptly transitioned and then ended with the rest of the story never told and questions left unanswered. No continuation and no real sequel. One more chapter maybe? What happened to Jonas between the snow scene in the Giver and him showing up as Leader in the Messenger??? What about Gabe??? I cared about these people and then.....nothing.I was left with strange feelings after finishing this book.....like, that feeling you get when you reach out to shake someones hand and they don't reciprocate, but rather leave you hanging. Or, being invited to dinner then ignored and expected to pick up the tab. This book had so much more potential. The author invited us to a great party and somewhere around 11:30, when things were getting good, she up and goes to bed.This was a bittersweet book, (I'll admit it more sweet than bitter, ) that left a lingering residue that I wish a Receiver could take from me. The decisions the author made to move the characters from Sameness into Nothingness while I wasn't looking was most bothersome. Did she become bored with her own characters? Seems like we were all abandoned on this journey. I think it only proper to be asked for forgiveness for this rudeness."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Read it as a big kid - loved it.Read it as a not-exactly kid - loved it.Arguments that \\"The Giver\\" is not a suitable book for kids come from adults. I'll put it simply. When my fifth grade teacher told the class we were going to be reading this book, I was happy. I'd already read the book. Every week, once a week on Fridays, the entire class gathered round and we listened to our teacher reading \\"The Giver\\" out loud. We analyzed it in class, and every single one of us (including those who hated books and reading) loved it.Some people say that \\"The Giver\\" is inappropriate for children because it deals with death and other difficult social issues. This is the reason adults don't like it? If that's the case, they need a reality check. We'd already studied about the Civil War in school (mentioned in the book). We knew what the word \\"starvation\\" means. We understood the concept of \\"death\\". Maybe we didn't fully understand population control, but we knew it existed. Unnecessary sheltering is silly. This book drew us in with the first sentence. It opened our minds to things we knew OF, but didn't fully understand. It brought to light things that nobody ever wanted to mention because they were concerned we were too young. This is exactly what made the book wonderful.It's not just the world image that's interesting. I fell in love with Jonas the moment the book started. He's an easy character to relate to, no matter what sort of a person you are. I connected to his need for accuracy. Others connected to his friendships and personality. All of the characters felt real at the beginning, but only halfway through do we realize how fake everything is. It was wonderful to reread the book and note all of the little things that had been hinted at, that only later became clear and necessary.This book is not just about a future void of differences. It's about relations between people, it's about being different, and it's about a boy who's trying to do his job, stay normal, but is realizing that he can't. The Giver himself is also a fascinating character that we very quickly learn to love like a grandfather. We see him at his best, and at his worst. We see humanity in an ignorant way.And yes, it's a children's book. Adults may find that the writing style is too simple for them. It's perfect for pre-teens. It's got enough of a plot to keep them interested, and isn't too difficult to read. It's a wonderful book that I don't think I'll ever stop loving.I recommend this book whole-heartedly. It's honestly one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Referred to me by my wife, an elementary teacher, I was not especially excited at first to read this book. But, being an avid reader and believing that every book deserves a chance, I picked up The Giver and very soon found that I couldn't put it down. The Giver is the story of Jonas, a boy who lives in a futuristic 1984-esq society, where everything appears to be perfect. Selected to become the next \\"Receiver of Memory,\\" the most important role in the community, Jonas is sent for training to a man who gives his name only as \\"The Giver.\\"Although a little slow to start, the story quickly picks up as Jonas begins to see the world in a way he never imagined before, and the reader quickly begins to see a world that we may not be to far from, a world that we may want to avoid creating at all costs.As a future teacher myself, I feel confident in saying that the book itself is fairly easy reading, and could probably be read as early as 4th or 5th grade. The content, however, may be more appropriate for middle school or even high school. While the story does work on several levels, and could be understood by younger kids, there is a scene in the book that may be disturbing for them. But that is, in the end, the overall purpose of the book: to disturb us, to make us think and consider the nature of humanity and the cost of \\"perfection.\\"The Giver is a truly amazing book, one written with eerie clarity and foresight, one that could change your way of thinking in many, many ways."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Newberry Award winning novel The Giver, by lois Lowry, is an odd yet exiting book. It takes place in the future where everything is the same. There is no color. There is no music. There is a rule for everything. There are no families.

When it was Jonas turn, they gave him the job of \\"Receiver\\". The last apprentice failed the job ten years ago. The Receiver's job is to receive the community's memories from the Giver.

One day his father brought home a baby boy who is was going to be released. His name was Gabriel. Jonas decides to run away from the community with the baby. He runs to a place in the world where everything isn't controlled, and decides he wants to stay there.

He lives, at first glance, in a wonderful community protected from pain, illness, unemployment or unhappiness. Jonas is approaching his twelfth birthday, the day on which he will receive the assignment for his future life. He is chosen to become the new Receiver of Memory. His teacher, The Giver, stores all the memories generations before had given up to live in Sameness. During Jonas' training in becoming the new Receiver he learns a lot about emotions, animals or different weather conditions, things that the other community members had never known before....P>That book is absolutely a great one. While reading the book through the eyes of Jonas more and more questions were raised - some where answered, some not. You get a closer look on your own life, your life as an individual, your life in society.How would life be without happiness? Or without pain? What is life living in sameness? What is a protective society? Where do we have to draw the line between creating protection and taking away the things that make us human? And what is it exactly that make us human? Lowry doesn't offer us any answer, more effective, she makes us think of our own how these questions will be answered.I have really enjoyed reading the \\"The Giver\\" and I guess it was the right decision by the teacher \\"making\\" us reading it.

It kept me wondering, I would try to guess what would happen next. Things that kept on appering in my head were questions such as: what exacly does this mean? it might be a lie! whas this right or wrong? could it be better? The Giver is a very exiting book that kept me on my toes. The story is about a boy named Jonas who was chosen to hold all the memories of the past for his community. His community is a town were everyone is the same. However that doesn't mean that they just are all equal. They had the same of everything, same school every thing in their lives were the same. People got assigned jobs at 12 and were given every thing they needed. There were strict rules such as 1 boy and 1 girl per family. They didn't even have their own kids they had to apply for them and like \\"UPS\\" would deliver them to your house which was exacly like everyone elses. Anyway, I didn't like the ending. It just sudenly ended. Jonas ran away!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Have you ever wanted to live in a &#65533;perfect&#65533; world? In The Giver, Jonas lives in the &#65533;perfect&#65533; world that does not have war, sickness, or hunger. Lois Lowry wrote The Giver in 1993. This Newbery award book is a futuristic science fiction about what could possibly happen in post-apocalyptic times. The theme of The Giver is &#65533;life is boring and meaningless if everything is the same.&#65533; Although some things are hard and painful, those times make life interesting and worth living.Jonas is an ordinary boy in his community, except for one fact: he sees &#65533;beyond.&#65533; At the age of twelve, all children go to a ceremony and receive their life job. Jonas was given the job of &#65533;Receiver of Memory.&#65533; He receives all the memories of the past from the Giver. When Jonas grows old, he will be the Giver and give his memories to the new &#65533;Receiver of Memory.&#65533; The memories are from hundreds of generations ago. Some memories are happy, while some are horrifying and very painful. The &#65533;Receiver&#65533; keeps the memories so the people do not have to endure them. Therefore, people give up color, individual freedom, and responsibility. While Jonas is receiving memories, he realizes life was better when everything was not the same. Although there was violence, hunger, and sickness, life was more meaningful. Jonas and the Giver want to do something, to somehow bring more meaning to the community, but are not sure what to do.The Giver is a very interesting, yet different kind of book. It makes you think about what the world and the human race could become. It also makes you think about the importance of freedom and of diversity. I thought it was a good book; though somepeople might find it disturbing. For example, Jonas finds out what &#65533;releasing&#65533; really is. He only knows it is the worst punishment in his community, but does not realize that it is a type of euthanasia or mercy killing. As a writer, Lowry uses very vivid and colorful verbs and adjectives. I would recommend this book to anyone who does not mind disturbing references and likes thinking of the future in a different way."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"After reading The Giver, I was amazed at how the setting, thoughts, and characters all interacted to spin the story that you can't put down. It appears to be a perfect future with no hunger, no war, no pain, and the awareness that all was well. Based on things in everyday life, The Giver focuses on the life of Jonas, a boy that lives in an environment of peace, rules, structure, equality, and seeming perfection. But when given the title as The Receiver of Memory, Jonas begins to see his family, their life, and their world differently. Jonas leads the reader on a journey of self-discovery that forces you to think of how you, your life, and your beliefs are shaped. It is this journey that leads Jonas to question everything and find that all of life is not as we grow up believing. This book was great; it never stopped raising questions--some answered, some not. By seeing the world through Jonas's eyes, you can not help but see your own life differently and know that some questions have no answers, but we must always keep asking."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas.

That's what life is like for Jonas, a pretty content Eleven in his organized community. Anyone can reply for Release, a Spouse, or Children. His family is a family unit, exactly one girl, one boy, and two parents. The family units are not biological; instead, at the Ceremony of the Ones each December, children born by the Birthmothers that year are given to families units chosen by the Elders. Following the Ones are the Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, and so on. At the Ceremony of the Twelves, each Eleven becomes a Twelve and is appointed a role in the community.

However, when the other forty-nine jobs are assigned, the Chief Elder returns to him. \\"Jonas has been appointed Receiver,\\" she says after talking about his personality. \\"Thank you for your childhood, Jonas.\\" The Receiver is a great honor. Soon Jonas must endure much training as the current Receiver transmits all of the memory of the community to him. Jonas's life takes a sudden turn as he realizes there is a life beyond the orderly one he knows. He learns more secrets than he thought were ever possible. The end of the book brings an unexpected but exciting twist as Jonas' life changes . . . forever.Lois Lowry brings an amazing tale to life before the reader's eyes.

There are thousands of strict rules to follow, and everything is chosen by a select Council of Elders. This includes jobs, marital partners, children, etc. There is no color, no emotion, no diversity.The story is good from the beginning, but really picks up at the Ceremony of Twelve, where children who turn twelve that year get jobs chosen for them by the Council and go into training. Other kids get jobs like Engineer and Laborer, Jonas gets specially selected to be the Reciever of Memory.On his first day of training, Jonas meets the Giver, a kind old man that transmits memories of past generations into Jonas, so he can gain wisdom. There are happy memories, such as sailing on a lake, and going downhill on a sled, but there are sad and horrible memories, like poverty, war, and physical pain.I won't go into much detail from there, because I've told you too much already, but I will say this gets thumbs up from me.

Jonas an 11 almost 12, goes to the ceremony of 12 for his new job and future, but at first it seems that he had no job at all, since the elders passed him by. But he soon finds out that he's been selected to be the next Receiver of Memory. The theme to this book it to be thankful for what you've been given because you can look at someone else's life who's wasn't as fortunate as yours, and know that your lucky to have the life that you have. Lois lowry would have written this book from her past experiences. When she wrote this book, everyone didn't trust on another and things weren't the best they have been in the past. You know this because this book is about people helping people, being more interdependent instead of independent. The quote at the top of the page brings the type of person Jonas is and the things he might of experienced. But when you get further on in this book you'll find that the first line is only some of what you'll find out about Jonas, and what he knows as \\"The World\\".

Everything in this town is too perfect and under control. In this town there is no war, pain, hunger, homelessness, love, sorrow or real feelings of any kind, but while this might sound like something good the sacrifice you make for it is not worth it to me. The main character is a boy named Jonas. Jonas is quiet, follows the rules and has dreams of things he can't explain or understand or share with anyone. When Jonas turns twelve he is selected to be the new Receiver of Memories or future Giver, then everything in Jonas's life becomes different. The Giver is a person who makes sure the rules are clear,when asked for guidance, and the only person who holds in his mind all the memories of history, life and feelings. At first learning the memories are painful and disturbing to Jonas because having true emotions and feelings arenew to him.In a short time Jonas becomes an eager learner but the knowledge causes Jonas to question the society he lives in and now finds less than perfect. The story made me think how easy this could really happen here at any time if we don't pay close attention to what is really happening around us. People are always trying to think up all kinds of rules so they don't have any problems. I wish to God this never happens to us but if it does I hope I can get away before it is to late. I don't want to live in a world where anyone different is RELEASED. The book also made me sad after I realized what was really happening and that if I lived there the day I just enjoyed at the beach would never occur. It also made me think that there are some things in my own life that maybe I should work on so that no one would ever think about RELEASING me. I strongly recommend this book to others because it really makes you think about your own life and how important your life is to you."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry should be on all reading lists for middle schoolers because it inspirs its readers. With every new chapter, there are new suprises that await the reader. For example the main character had no idea he would be chosen to be the Giver. This book deserves a four stars because in some places it was just a little too confusing for some yonger readers. Some of the confusion comes from the advanced vocabulary and complacated plot. On the other hand for older readers the advanced vocabulary and plot only add to Lois Lowrys spectacular novle."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read this book for school, so maybe that tainted my judgement, but I thought it was good none the less. It was kind of weird, and the end wasn't as satisfying as I would have liked. It was one of those books that you think about more everytime you read them. If you are looking for an quicker read than Harry Potter, then read this."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Like A Wrinkle in Time and Tuck Everlasting, Lois Lowry's The Giver is a book with appeal beyond the science fiction genre. It would interest a general audience looking for a story about what societies value in human terms. It is a sophisticated book. Both Jonas and the reader are on parallel courses, both gradually realizing the dilemma Jonas faces. The reader begins innocent of the fictional setting, and discovers how it functions as the story unfolds. Jonas, the 12-year-old protagonist, on the other hand, knows nothing about societies in the past like our own and finds out step by step. The dramatic climax of the book comes when the two converge. Lowry has imagined an intricate future society, with some recognizable elements such as nuclear families, but other foreign combinations, such as birthdays for all people on one day a year. It seems to be a society that has taken social science ultilitarianism to an extreme. Their language has a clinical sound, such as \\"comfort object\\" for a teddy bear, and more poetic terms like \\"love\\" have no place. The author has done a clever job at \\"seducing\\" the reader by creating a society with many desirable traits. One can see the reasons for the choices the leaders made and that makes the drama and provocativeness of the book even greater. It is a book that works skillfully on both the intellectual and emotional levels. Recommended to readers 15 and older."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a page turner; it was so good that I found myself reading it for hours at a time. Obviously, I liked it very much. The book is set in the world of the future, a world that looks almost perfect on the surface, but which is very difficult for some within it. The central characters are Jonas and the Giver. Jonas is a sensitive boy of twelve who is the Receiver of Memory. It is the Givers's job to pass theses memories along to Jonas. When Jonas gets most of the memories, it is very painful for him, because he can see the real pain that happens in the past while others in his community can't. Great efforts are made to keep the people of the community free from things that can be &quot;difficult&quot;-- such as snow, sun, or any other extremes of weather. The people are also given pain pills frequently if they feel any discomfort at all. There are no racial tensions because the people in this society can't see color. Some believe this is the best possible society. However, Jonas and the Giver realize that to make things &quot;perfect&quot; incredible sacrifices are made. For example, old people are put to death, and families don't have children-- they are given to them from the Nurturing Center. Babies who aren't perfect are &quot;released,&quot; which means they are killed. One of my favorite scenes in the book is when Jonas escapes from this community at the end of the book , and makes a run for his freedom from this very controlling society. I was so glad for him, because I wouldn't want anyone to live in that kind of place. This book makes the reader realize that not having everything &quot;perfect&quot; is a very good thing after all. I gave The Giver the highest rating possible because it was written in a way that kept me interested, and because it is really important for people to realize that a &quot;perfect&quot; society isn't worth striving for. It is much better to live in a world with lots of different people in it from lots of different races, and just do the best we can to help those among us who aren't &quot;perfect,&quot; -- in other words-EVERYBODY!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was assigned reading for my college Library Science course. I was very moved by the horrors that were common in this world and if we boil it down it shows us what is going on in OUR world. I would save this book for Freshman or Sophomore high school students. I think that not only are some of the scenes very real and heartbreaking, but it requires a certain maturity level to be able to understand what it is telling us. If this book doesn't inspire a strong desire for social change it has fallen on ears unable to hear its message."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and I still remember the impact it had on me. &quot;The Giver&quot; is wonderfully written, and has a good message to it. It's one of those books that you finish, and the begin to look for other books writen by the author. I have read a couple of Lois Lowry, and I think that she is a great author; I especially love her descriptive technique of writing. I would recommend this book to anyone who interested in a good read. Allthough almost any age could enjoy it, I think that maybe 6th grade and up would appretiate it more. This is a great book, and I encourage everyone to read it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was interesting, and caught my attention. I loved how the community was supposed to be a Utopia.

Also good, but don't read them if you like the way this one ended)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonah, aged 12, is selected to be a receptacle for a futuristic society's memories in this book for young readers. Lowry's portrayal of a \\"perfect\\" society, with assigned jobs, clothes, spouses, and children, is as frightening as it is interesting. Its frank discussion of sexuality, infanticide, and suicide are perhaps a little dark, but a reader mature enough to work through Lowry's language should be able to deal with these parts of The Giver.Lowry's concoction is honest and hard-hitting. It is definitely a dark look into a possible future. It's important for the new generation to embrace the idea of individuality for the betterment of a whole society."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book was okay; not great, not awful.

I recommend this to every one with a taste for a good sci-fi read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a community that is all the same lives Jonas, who discovers that he is very different. Jonas is the main character in the book, The Giver, one of my favorite books. I loved The Giver because the plot was very creative, the theme was magnificent, and the setting was vivid. I think you should read this book for many reasons. The theme of this book is clearly represented: freedom, the right to make your own choices, uniqueness, and individuality are worth dying for. In Jonas's community, a commitee selects one's job, war is unheard of, all people wear the same attire, and all are assigned spouses and families. When Jonas is given the special, wonder-filled occupation of becoming the Receiver of Memory, he finds that there is much more to life. Through his task of becoming the Receiver of Memory, he discovers the meaning of love, pain, frustration, color, and cold. That is when Jonas realizes how much more there really is. Life soon becomes overwhelmingly unbearable in his world of \\"sameness.\\" He finds life isn't worth living without the qualities (often that we take for granted) he discovered. That is when Jonas goes on a dangerous journey to find a land that is different. The setting in this book made it quite a pleasure. Everything in the community was predictable and pre-planned. The housing units were all the same. There were designated spots for everything. The setting helped develop the plot and theme. The mysterious ending leaves one filled with curiousity and wonder. The book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry is pure enjoyment, especially for someone who likes a good theme and plot that ties in with the setting."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was great.

I haven't seen a young adult or children's dystopia that has met or surpassed The Giver in both quality of writing or as an interesting, appealing and thought-provoking storyline.I suspect the ambiguous ending might have been a bit of dissatisfaction for some people but it never was for me. I was fine with the ending, yet, I was very pleased to learn there were sequels to this book! Quartet actually!

He becomes the Receiver, a painful but important job. He must receive the memories of past times, good and bad. His leader, The Giver, has the job of giving the memories to Jonas.This is a very exciting book, one of those books you can't put down until it is done. This author is good at writing books that make you excited and tense by changing everything in the story until it makes sense. It's so much fun to know what happens in the end. It is unpredictable -- the story comes to a very different conclusion than you would think. It is a mix of confusion, adventure, and a little bit of sadness.

The book takes on themes that are incredibly sophisticated and examines them in ways that even a bonehead like me can wrap his mind around. Every bit as daring as 1984 and Brave New World, Lowry forces us to look very closely at what it is that makes us human, and what the costs and benefits of conformity really are. The conclusion of the book is--I hate to overuse the word, but it's the only one that fits--daring, forcing the reader to decide for him or herself just what has happened. Either way, the moment is transformative.Beautiful as this book is, it ISN'T appropriate for my nine-year old. Not because of the very mild and beautifully drawn budding sexuality of the protagonist, Jonas. Rather, the themes are deep and disturbing enough--and the ending open-ended enough--that I don't think a preteen would be able to take it all in. But for a teenager--or an adult--I think it is a wonderful, provocative read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is amazing. The main character, Jonas is faced with some very important decisions to make. His experience mirrors that which many young people go through.

My son cried in the end, but overall, he loved it. He wanted the book to continue or to have a sequel. We also loved the author's Number the Stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"STORY: As one of the editorial reviews so nicely put: \\"In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of Brave New World, in this 1994 Newbery Medal winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly decides he cannot pay the price.\\"MY FEEDBACK1) SETTING - The story takes place in a made-up utopian community that seems to exist in Earth's future at some point. The setting really is a huge part in understanding how this community has isolated itself through choices, in order to have the \\"utopian\\" society they have. It was very interesting and could be imagined thanks the the author's descriptions.2) CHARACTERS - The character's play the parts they are assigned like the people in the community take the job they are assigned by the community leaders. There are no questions or variance from these roles because that is all the character knows. The character of Jonas is the one that breaks this mold and is the focus of the story. As he learns what his society is missing he grows as a character to be liked even though he isn't following the standards of practice that his peers are. His character becomes increasingly gripping especially in the last twenty or so pages of the book when he starts to act on his newfound knowledge in response to the contradictions he has been brought up with all tweleve years of his life.3) STORY - At first I was reading this as the authors viewpoint of what a utopian society \\"should\\" be: Euthenasia, abortion, clothing is an nuscience, be intouch with your personal self, pills to control sexual desires, controlled and numbered births and marriages each year, etc. Then I came to realize that the society the author creates is not necessary her viewpoint but simply the concept created by the architects of that particlar community. Each community is a bit different depending on who configured them. But all in all, in order to live in a place without poverty, starvation and crime there are some major things each and every community gives up. This is the crux of the story and what really drives the climax and conclusion.OVERALL - I picked this book up because I heard that a famous scriptwriter was contracted to do the screenplay for this book. It is an easy read and less than 200 pages. The story leaves you thinking about it hours later. I could not read the last ten pages fast enough!! The story just built up to this phenominal climax and conclusion that had me ripping through the book to the next page because I had to find out what happens. I got this book at the library and now I have to own it so I can read it at least five more times."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"One of my friends convinced me to read this book. It's a little hard to understand at first, but it's definetly worth reading. With Jonas I felt his frustrations, and after awile lonliness. I loved Asher, Fiona, the Giver, Rosemary, Lily, the Ceremonies, the perfect world that turned out to be you-know-what, and I loved how little things like jackets that button down the back symbolize things like interdependence. My dad and I think that at the end, Jonas finally found the room with the grandparents, family, and Christmas tree. Kudos, Cheers, and a HUGE THANK-YOU to my new-found favorite author, LOIS LOWRY!!! :) by Pam, 11"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I will have to give the book a three.I didn't like this book because it was to confusing.It would say something then something else. Some thing totaly different. It was to confusing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is like a cross between Brave New World, 1984 and Logan's Run. The concept of dystopia is not original, but Lowry adds her own interesting twist via the society's overall structure, as well as the concepts of a Giver of Memory and Receiver of Memory. Lowry builds the story nicely, slowly unveiling the twisted nature of the society in a way that maintains suspense until the very last page.However, there were important elements that I felt were unexplained or poorly developed.-Spoilers!-1) Receivers store memories from individuals throughout human history, but do those \\"memories\\" include the experiences of people who are currently living? How else did the Giver have the sled memory that he trasmitted to Jonas, which ended being the EXACT sled Jonas rode at the end? It wasn't a random memory of a sled from hundreds of years ago. It was the SAME sled, in the SAME location (this is made clear when Jonas recognizes the hill and knows exactly where the sled will be). Obviously Givers and Receivers have some psychic abilities, but the sled memory was made to sound like something from the past, not a future projection. So what was the sled ride memory then? A future vision? A memory from a currently living person? What?3) Once Jonas escaped with Gabe, how was the Giver planning to release memories to the entire community? It sounded like only a rare person had the ability to receive memories and yet, when a Receiver dies, somehow the memories end up dispersed to the whole community. How on earth does that work?4) Was the Giver planning to kill himself in order to release all his memories to the community? If he could release the memories by choice and give them to whomever he wanted, then why go through the agonizing process of finding a Receiver who appears to posses the psychic ability to \\"see beyond\\" (as it's described in the book) since apparently anyone could be a Receiver. Obviously they want someone with the emotional capability to be the Receiver, but there was certainly no need to find a child who could \\"see beyond.\\"5) Making oneself cold - as Jonas did to himself and Gabe to mask their various locations when the planes with infared heat sensors were searching for them - does NOT mask the heat from an entire body. Unless you're dead, it doesn't matter how cold you are, your core still produces heat and a heat sensor will detect it.However, although I felt that it was missing some important background development, the story itself was intriguing and worth a read for the themes it explores, chief among them being freedom and individuality."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Book leaves you with no closure... which would have been fine if the last chapter didn't feel like a complete hack. Simplistic style of writing, with little to no imagination used to create this \\"utopia\\", but a compelling story that had me gripped up until the very last chapter... I real let down."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've read The Giver twice now for school. I think it is an okay young adult book, but I don't really recommend it for younger kids. I read it in elementary school and again for a senior class. I think it is extremely important that Lois Lowry questions the structure of society with \\"The Community,\\" but I feel that her ambiguous ending is a bit of a cop-out. While it leaves for many stimulating open ended questions, I feel that if you are lucky enough to articulate yourself into a book, and send create message to anybody (even yourself), that you should be complete. What I mean is that Lois Lowry posed questions about society, but didn't attempt at all to answer them. Anyone can ask a question, but who is gifted enough to find the answer? Being the punk that I am, I can't help but be interested in ideas about the \\"cure\\" or \\"better answer\\" to our global conception of society."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver really is a good book. A thought provoking read, however, I'd say for some children, it may go over their head. This is young adult literature, and it's fine young adult literature provided you haven't read very many dystopia novels out there. The idea is enlightening, and even though the ending is a bit ambiguous, it brings about discussion like no other.In the future, the world is perfect. No one starves. No one is left unwanted and the community assigns each person a job that they are certain to excel at once they reach the age of twelve. When the \\"ceremony\\" finally happens, Jonas is selected by the council to be the next Receiver of Memory. It a title of honor. Jonas then begins his training with The Giver, who gives him memories of unimaginable things. Color. Feelings. History. The Giver holds all of them. The Giver isn't just full of joy, he also gives Jonas memories of despair, war and others that aren't so pleasant. As he changes over the course of one year, Jonas discovers that the \\"perfect\\" world that he lives in may not be so perfect after all.There are plenty of books out there just as thought-provoking as The Giver, but this is one where your brain will really turn on for a second. As the book opens... who wouldn't want to be in this world? Everyone is so nice to each other. You don't have to worry about trying to find a job. No poverty because everyone is fed, and all your decisions are made for you. At first it feels like heaven. But just as Jonas discovers, you too will see that this world is far from perfect, and that while we may want a world where life is simple, there's a sense of loss in having a world that would be like that. The pains and pleasures of life should never be forgotten, which seems to be where this book is getting at.The characters outside of Jonas don't really come to life, but it's strangely effective in this novel for the simple reason that the people don't have feelings to begin with. Therefore there's no need to be so heavy in character development. However, as the novel progresses, Jonas DOES come to life as he receives new memories.The Giver is a great thought-provoking book but it suffers in some areas. For one, the book hardly goes into detail on some aspects. You get about halfway through the book before you even realize that the people in this community can't even see color. And what themes of the book do come up don't stick around long enough (such as music) for the reader to ponder too much about it.Another huge aspect we have to face: The vague ending. Some people love interpretation, those people will undoubtebly love The Giver's conclusion. However, for those expect some sort of resolution, it isn't quite there. That's not to say it's a bad ending. It's just to say that it doesn't feel complete. It certainly gives the reader a chance to interpret, but it feels anti-climatic. All that build up for... well, virtually nothing.However, in some light, my disappointment with the ending may very well be what Lowry was trying to draw. Some sort of emotional reaction. We may never know.The Giver is a great thought provoking read. I probably wouldn't recommend it to elementary school students. It seems a bit more secondary. Despite that, the idea is so simplistic. Anyone can understand it, but the themes and allusions may go over some of the younger readers heads."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I started reading The Giver I couldn't put it down.

The premise seems unreasonable as the act of love is mechanized, career paths are chosen by a board of elders, and all the pain and joy and memory of society is stuffed into one overloaded brain. The Giver must give this knowledge to the Receiver, \\"The (New) Chosen One,\\" an astute twelve-year-old boy named Jonas.In the beginning he never questions his society because he knows no alternative, but he knows he has always been a little different than the other kids. As soon as he is exposed to pain and love he wants to share them with others, but the Giver explains the circumstances of his society and his lonely responsibility. Like members of today's society, Jonas and the Giver must decide whether it is right to continue compromising freedom and choice for security and \\"happiness.\\" CLEARLY THE ANSWER IS NO!!!

The character Jonas lives in a utopian community where &quot;Sameness&quot; is a rule. There is no pain (emotional or physical)or fear, just perfect calm living, designed by the society around them. Jonas escapes from his community to try and find out what the rest of the world is like, where there is pain and emotions and feeling. This book gives a thought to how our society acts today and how our community effects us."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Although Ron Rifkin's voice seems monotonal at first, as you listen further, it becomes apparent that the sound fits the text. The society in which the main character, Jonas, resides is also lacking variation. The society in Lois Lowry's, The Giver, is one which frowns upon those things we honor so greatly-- love, compassion, emotional attachment, freedom, creativity,etc. When Jonas turns twelve, he is assigned the task of receiver of memories. Thus begins his transformation and, in the end, Jonas learns too much for his own good. Or maybe not! You have to read it to find out. The writing is superb. I couldn't wait, each day, to listen to this audio book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have just finished reading 'THE GIVER'. And I think, in general, that books with open ends are the best. When I read the first three chapters I wasn't very eager to read this book until its end. But I had to (because it was part of our English lessons). I would have missed reading a fascinating book if I didn't read it. From chapter 7 on, I think, I began to like this book because the community had a so different way of life. There is 'Sameness' allover the community, but one little Eleven has the opportunity to change it, to change his robot-life into a real life worth living. A life full of colors, feelings and nature. With his will he'll achieve his aim. He'll achieve a different life for him and the 'newchild' Gabriel, using the memories he got from The Giver. But HOW he achieves his aim is let by the reader's fantasy. PS: I apologize for my mistakes. I'm just a 16-year-old student from Germany... ;-)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book the giver by lois lowery, I personally think that it is a great and facinating book. If I had to rate this book I guess I would rate 5 stars, because the author is very descriptive. So if she said something like how the muffin made jonas's mouth water everytime he felt the warmth of the muffin bounce of his hip as he walked. You could she a muffin bouncing of his hip as he walks. Other reasons I would give this book a five is because she leaves you hanging and in suspence, it also makes you wonder what happened to the person or how he/she got thetre or got out safely. Plus another reason is the vocabulary is like words you never knew existed. The book makes you feel like you are really in jonas's utopia. I think that everone should read this book but mostly people that like cliff hangers and suspence."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Book the giver was a excellent book that was well written. The book had much to do with folklore and mythology. i would recomend this book to anyone who feels there are things out there unknown."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was very interesting. It was like taking me to a whole new world. Most everything was different. I didn't like some of the people in the book's views. Although at the same time, I wanted to know how those people thought, worked, and felt. I wanted to know why did what happen, happen. There was only one man who seemed to care at all about anything. I thought the little one was cute as well. I felt sad when I found out what the father's job was. Another thing I didn't like was the ending. I wanted to know more!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I feel that Lois Lowry's The Giver, did not really effect me in any way. It was a very interesting book that questions everything that society doesn't like to talk about. This book lets the reader re-examine their beliefs and ideas. This book is mainly about a boy named Jonas and how he was chosen for something special. This special something as it is referred to, leads Jonas to a man only known as the Giver. This book deals with such touchy subjects as: conflict, poverty, unemployment, divorce, injustice towards others, and inequality among people."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The reason that this book is so great is that it can be read on two levels. The first, more obvious level is that it tells a story about what the future could possibly be like. The concept of a colorless, symetrically boring society is very original and provokes thought in the reader. The main plotline tells the story of a young boy's struggle when he begins to realize all the things that once existed in the world, such as color, animals and emotions. The fact that only he knows the real truth creates a deep sense of loneliness in the 12 year old. Moreover, this book can be read on a deeper level. The themes of conformity and morality hold a strong presence in this novel. In short, &quot;The Giver&quot; is an excellent story that can be enjoyed by all readers over 11 years old."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed the book The Giver by Lois Lowry. It is a great book about a child in an unrealistic world. He has the job to handle the whole world's memories. It is a great book with an excellent story line. It is a must have, you should all purchase the book right now. Jonas, is the coolest kid. Plus, the story has a great meaning behind it. That is that a society who loses the past is bound to make the same mistakes, and that society can become corrupt, so don't let it happen."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As many reviewers noted, The Giver is a wonderful book. However, the audio CD is is not divided by chapter. Each CD contains about 14 files. They all have the same track name, such as \\"track 1\\". All CDs have a \\"track 1\\". It's confusing for the player when you load the CDs. It thinks it's the same file.Anyway, I was commenting on the audio CD itself, not the novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverBy: Lois LowryReviewed by: R.AjocPeriod: 1The Giver, by Lois Lowry is a story about Jonas and his new occupation as he becomes a young adult. Oh the day of training Jonas is chosen to go with The Giver. The Giver is the person in Jonas's community who will remember everything that happens in his community. After one year of training and transmitting of memories from The Giver to Jonas, Jonas was really into the occupation of The Giver. Jonas's intelligence makes him realize that he must show his community what is inside life, and Jonas also stopped all the violence that was going on in his community. Jonas goal as The Giver was to remember all the memories good or bad of his community. As he grew from his twelve year old stature he was not able to transmit or remember any memories. One day as Jonas was going up a hill he forgot all of the memories the last Giver had given to him and the only way to get the memories back was if Jonas left his community boundaries.The Giver was not as interesting in the beginning as it is towards the end. The beginning didn't give me the feeling that this was going to be a good book. Intentionally I read the rest of the book and realized how interesting it gets during the last few chapters. The beginning sentence of most the chapters were boring: Jonas watched as his father poured a fresh cup of coffee, dose not seem as exciting. Right., if you read on all the detail come in you can see this is the beginning of the day when Jonas is chosen his life occupation. As you can see, if you read on you will see that throughout the whole book. Most of the book is like this \\" It was colder, Jonas perceived.\\", does not look like an important chapter. Right., read on and you will see that this is where Jonas will lose his memory and the memory of his whole community.On the down side this book is not the type of book that has an adrenaline rush. If you like regular literature this book will be for you. If you like action or anything such as horror, type book this book is not meant for you. This book is the regular type literature that is not with all of the rush and horror that you want. \\" He wanted his childhood again, scraped knees and ball games\\" dose not sound very interesting, for all you people who want a very interesting book that will keep you in your seat for hours this will not be for you. Although it maybe a boring book for those who hate boring books, that are just plain boring and have no action chose another book.The most touching part f the book is my most favorite part of the book. The part where Jonas must leave his community. Jonas had to leave his community because he forgot all of the communities memories as he was climbing the hill. The reason why it was very touching was because once you leave a community you may never come back. Since leaving the community was the only way for the community to get their memory back, and so everyone could remember everything again. The quote that really says something to me is \\" Behind him, across vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo.\\" This quote showed the feeling as if you are leaving someone or even leaving something behind, forever! If you really look into this quote you will see yes it is a very strong quote."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book terrified me. And I loved every word of it.The \\"Release\\" was haunting. How far are we from a society that kills people on a whim because they aren't convenient? I'll tell you: we're there already. Have you ever heard the term \\"abortion\\"? Just because a baby has not been born does not mean it is not a human being. People who are shocked at the concept of Release perhaps have not heard their counterparts in this world: Abortion and euthanasia for the old.Jonas was a great character. He was sympathetic and EMPATHETIC. When Gabriel was scheduled for Release, I was so scared until I read that line, so dramatically put right after the lines describing how he left (sorry if this is slightly off, I don't have the book with me):\\"He had hesitated for a moment in taking this, not wanting anything of his father's and unsure whether he would be able to ride the larger bike. But it was necessary because it had the child's seat in the back.And he had taken Gabriel, too.\\"I loved that line. One of my favorites. Then there was the equally haunting scene in which Jonas asks his parents whether they love him. They laughingly reply that 'love' is a vague word, and that they enjoy him and take pride in his accomplishments -- but no, they do not love him. Directly after, Jonas whispers to Gabe how, if everyone had the memories, there could be grandparents, and colors, and choices, and animals...and -- \\"Gabe?...There could be love.\\"I am surprised so many people found the end \\"disturbing\\", yet the same thing is happening in our world as we speak. Infants and the elderly are being killed for the sake of convenience. Yet when you read about it in a book, away from the comfortable mindset of \\"It's not even born...won't feel a thing...maybe it's not even really alive...\\" or \\"He's not long for this world anyway...so much trouble to keep healthy...\\", when you're away from this mindset, it is shocking and disturbing.Thank you so much, Lois Lowry. Maybe this is what people need to see before they can understand the horrifying things being done in today's world, glossed over and even advocated nowadays.Rating: Very Good"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is written in a unique style that gives much for the imagination to ponder. Lowry's descriptions are vague as well as the ending. However, I feel Lowry wants each reader to come away from the book with something personal so she leaves certain details open to interpretation.The plot is unique taking place in a perhaps futuristic world. The community in which the main character, Jonas, lives seems to be controlled by computers and other sophisticated technology. The people live simplistic lives, but Jonas will learn the secrets behind the community. He faces decisions that ultimately prove to be too much and he must leave the community. The ending is rivoting and readers will be moved and surprised by the ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The title of the book that I am reviewing is The Giver, the author is Lois Lowry, and I gave this book 5 stars.This story is about a 12 year old boy named Jonas and his journey into becoming a man. I gave this book 5 stars because you can really get a feel for what the characters are feeling. There are many packed into this wonderful story. Lois Lowry created a totally different world and she filled in everything you need to know to understand how Jonas and his friends feel. Once you get to the middle of the book you feel like you actually live where Jonas lives. In this time period there are no colors, no choice of jobs, when you become 12 you are offically an adult and age no longer matters. With each year there are different perks, like when you are 10 you get your first bicycle. Every family unit gets two kids, a boy and a girlm the parents a child has are not the people that geave birth to them Birth Mothers have all the kids in the village. Everything is assigned and nothing is a choice. There are only a certain amount of new children (babies) in the community each year. If there are too many new children the ones that weigh the least get released or killed. When your children have grown and they leave you house you go to live in the house of the old, then once you have been there for a few years the workers there preform you release (they kill you). It is a very sad way to live but that is how they do things in this time period. There are many different jobs in the community. One for almost every interest you have.When Jonas is assigned The Reciever of Memory, the most respected job in the community, he is frightened. He meets with the Giver, the former Reciever of Memory, to recieve memories of the past. All the memories he gets to start out with are all happy memories. Then once he has been recieving memories for about a year the memories start to get scary and painful to witness. The more memories Jonas recieves the angrier he gets with the life he lives. He wants to live with emotions and colors he doesn't want to live a miserable life anymore. He and the Giver are the only ones who know what life could be like, but they know they can't change the way the community has lived forever. Since they know they can't change the ways of the community they have to take matters into their own hands. Jonas plans to run away and take a new child that was going to be released the next day. He and Gaberial (the new child) run away to find a better place to live. They travel for days and days until Jonas hears music and he knows they have found refuge.I am a 12 year old that loves to read. Other tites that I would recomend are Gathering Blue, The Messenger, and the Harry Potter books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was always encouraged to read this in middle school, but I never got around to it. Now I'm a twenty-something, and we selected this for a book club discussion, and I was completely blown away! I highly recommend this as a book club selection because it is short enough that everyone can finish it on time, but it packs a serious punch and there are dozens of published discussion questions and ways to explore the book.There's no need for me to recount the plot in this review, and doing so wouldn't explain why this book is so essential. It has timeless themes, one that will be studied by students for years to come, I am sure. This is an outstanding book for any teacher wanting to discuss diversity, and how our individualism makes our world so wonderful. My one word of caution is that the book is deceptively simple to read. I've heard of 5th and 6th grade teachers teaching the book, and while it is technically readable at that grade level, some of the themes about reproduction, adolesence, and the like are more appropriate for students who are just a few grades more advanced. Other reviewers have mentioned the age-appropriateness of this book, too. I recommend it to middle schoolers, no younger, despite the fact that it is technically readable at a younger age. Middle school students will be able to identify with the changes Jonas is going through as he matures."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was AMAZING! It definitely makes you think about what the world is coming to. I stayed up until 10 (on a school night) to finish it. I was so tired when I got to the end I didn't get it at all, and was barely paying attention. The next day at school I brought it with me to ask my friend about it, because she recommened it to me. I told her I didn't get the end and she tried to explain it. My response: \\"huh? I don't remember that.\\" So she dragged me over to my desk and pushed me down itno my seat and shoved the book under my nose. \\"Read!\\" she commanded. So I read the last few pages and was in total tears. Everyone was asking me what was wrong but I couldn't stop crying long enough to answer. No one knows exactly what happened, but if what I think happened happened, this is a very sad but still very good book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is book is about a child named Jonas who lives in a community were everthing is controlled including, your name, your job, and weather or not you have a spouse or children. When you turn twelve in this community your are given a job, but Jonas is not giver a job. He is selected to be the new receiver, (the person who holds all the memories for the community). Jonas believes that everyone needs thes memories so he runs away and lets all the memories return to the community.This was a great book even though many people think that it should be banned because it goes against religous views. If you are a parent and your child wants to read this book you should probably read it first and then tell them weather or not they can read it. This is a great book for people of all ages to read because it explains why the idea of a society in which everything is controled would not work. Over all it was on the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community in the future. In this community most people don't make choices; only a few elected officials make choices. This committee of elected officials chooses everything for everybody, from your job to what your name is. They choose EVERYTHING. In the beginning of the book Jonas is an eleven, which means he is eleven years old. When children become twelve they are assigned jobs, but when Jonas becomes a twelve, he isn't assigned a job he is selected to be the new \\"receiver\\". The receiver is the person who receives memories from the past. These are the memories of true pain and of true pleasure. The man who gives Jonas the memories likes to be called the Giver. After awhile, Jonas and the Giver make a plan to give the people the memories, but it's very risky.I believe that this is one of the best books ever written. I think this way because it gives an excellent idea of what life without choices would be like. I think this is important because the ability to make choices is something we usually take for granted. I love how Lois Lowery slowly reveals things about this world throughout the book. At first it looks like nothing is different but slowly you start learning about this community. This is a great book and I hope I have convinced you to read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a small community in the future where everything is planned out for each person and there are no choices. Everything is in \\"Sameness\\". I think that The Giver is a very good book. I like how the book has a new and different perspective. I think the author, Lois Lowry, did a great job of creating such a futuristic community. The usage of details in the story was stellar. The setting, plot characters, just about everything was completely original. It has a complex plot, but it is not so complex that you can't understand it. It is also suspenseful. You don't know what is going to happen next. The setting and characters were described well in The Giver. I could really tell what the characters were like. I don't think I know anything that is bad about The Giver. The author, Lois Lowry, did a great job writing The Giver. Unfortunately, though, this book has been \\"challenged\\" which means some people want it to be banned. This book is very deep and full of emotion, but I do not think it should be banned. I think everyone should read it, because not only is The Giver a moving book, but it is also an entertaining read. If I could, I would give it 6 stars. Please read this book! I know you will like it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The novel&quot;The Giver&quot; is about a boy name Jonas, who lived in a community where everything is perfect there.

But his whole world turns upside down when he is skipped in the ceromony and given an experience he will never forget. I liked this book very, much even though some parts are confusing.

It's nearly impossible to make connections to the Giver. Text to text, text to self, and text to world connections are hard to come by when reading this novel.How? Well, this is a made up book just like a lot of other books are. But, this book not only takes place in an unreal town or city, it also takes place in an almost unreal planet type world. People do some of the same things on Earth as other Earthlings do. So it is nearly impossible to connect what we do here on Earth to what they do on their own planet. That wipes out the ability to make text to world connections.Another reason for this near impossibility to connect is accounted for the deepness and detail that Lois Lowery writes in. She writes with such detail that you don't see the main points of the plot. You're lost in detail.Some books you can relate The Giver are other sifi, methodical book such as The Lord of the Rings, and the Star Wars series.I feel that in connecting you must thing outside the box to get information that is identical to both books. I hope I have given you advice to not only assist the process to connect The Giver but other books as well."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book great.It has a very interesting and consistent plot. It caught my attention and made it fun to read. It was about this boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect community. All of a sudden it's time to get there life time jobs. Jonas now gets his lifetime job which is the receiver, (The person in the community that holds all the memories even the good ones.) Jonas tries to change all of this when he figures out how few choices they have. Jonas finds out that they are going to release (kill) Gabriel. Jonas wasn't trying to let that happen and the only way Jonas could change the memories to the community was to leave. That is exactly what he did and took Gabriel with him who is only 2 years old. Jonas font out what love really feels like. Also he figures out what looks like. Jonas almost starves and freezes to death, but it doesn't happen.Some more of my opinion on this book. I think the people in his community are rude and unreasonable. There are things that do for no good reason. Such as killing a twin baby because of they want everyone to have there own identity. They choose there spouse, kids, jobs.That is crazy,but that there community operates. Rules on everything and they just mess the people up.Thanks to Jonas and he who tried to change."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a boy named Jonas and how he becomes the Giver. Jonas is just a regular boy in a community of order.There is no war,no pain,no anger,and no choices. Now the twelves ceremony has come and Jonas is chosen to be the new giver. Now Jonas has to face something he has never faced before.I gave this book four stars because it was good except for the very confusing parts. Like when Lily came home and shared what happened at school. When Jonas in the morning shared what dream he had. And the idea of you having no choices, that just blew my mind because if I lived in that community I'd SLAP somebody if they forced me to do something for the rest of my life!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book.

In chapter 14, Jonas crashed and got hurt badly. When he crashed, I read \\" It was as if a hatchet lay, lodged in his leg, slicing through each nerve with a hot blade\\" and also it said \\" he vomited onto the frozen snow. Blood dripped from his face into the vomit\\". The last reason why The Giver had good literature was because it had interesting details. There were two important and interesting details and they were that there was sameness in the community and that only 3 people can see colors. The 3 people are Jonas, The Giver, and probably Gabriel too. The Giver was a good piece of literature because it was full of feelings, full of descriptions, and full interesting details."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is not good literature. Three characteristics of good literatureinclude how it relates to you, full of action, and a surprising ending.The book did not relate to me because the community followed rulesthat completely contradicted my life. The book was not full of action. Itseemed tedious and uneventful. The ending stopped abruptly and seemeda bit dull and confusing. Jonas said, \\"We are almost there Gabe.\\" Thiswas close to the end of the book and they still did not meet theirdestination point. As you can see The Giver is NOT good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I read the book The Giver it made me think about different things. For instance, how would I feel about living in a utopia. At twelve, Jonas is assigned his career: Receiver of Memories. He is trained by an Elder called \\"The Giver.\\" And, Jonas finds out what the world could be like. In Jonas's community your matched with the job that best fits you. this is a good book you should read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in an utopia where everything is controlled by rules. There is neither pain nor war nor feelings. When he becomes twelve he is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory. Now he gets to know the truth about the community by his mentor, the Giver, and wants to change it.Slowly the reader gets to know how the community works - in great difference to reality. The story is very different to other stories which makes it interesting. You can identify with Jonas and understand his thoughts and decisions. We don't like the ending because you can never be sure what happened to Jonas and the community. If you like reading science-fiction, you will have fun reading this book. We absolutely recommend reading it for pupils at the age of 14."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book The Giver was a great book. It was so interesting. With Jonas's strange village. The village had weird costums. Some things in this story I just couldn't belive like what they do to one of twins when they're born. The only part I didn't like was how they ended it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is really good. The thing i liked most about this book was the idea that no one in their own community could see color so no one was made fun of. This book is about a kid that is given the job of being the Giver. He is the kid that will be able to see color and feel true pain. Everyone in this community is to obey all of the rules or if they don't they will be released out of the community. Also there are no twins allowed because they look the same and no one looks like someone else. This is a really good book and you should read it to find out how this books end!!!! I would recomment this book to kids that in middle school or older."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine a world without color, music, emotions and most of all feelings. That is what it was like for 12 year old Jonas who felt nothing, knew nothing about his community until he was assigned by the Chief of Elders his role in the community. Most people have a normal job for example, a nurturer or a caretaker for the house of old and judge but strangely Jonas was not assigned any of these normal jobs. He was declared the Receiver of Memories.Although this job comes with high honor, it also comes with immense pain and Jonas will have to force himself to get through the training. When things get tough, Jonas gets mad and he and the Giver think of a plan, but this could get them killed.I recommend this book to anyone looking for action and suspense at the same time. This is definitely my favorite book I have ever read as it kept me wanting to read on. Lois Lowry uses great vocabulary in every sentence, I know that if you read it you'll love it just like me."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was a good, quick read. The ending leaves you hanging with a lot of unanswered questions. In order to understand all of the story, you must keep reading the series. Read Gathering Blue, Messenger, and Son in order to fully understand the story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We purchased for a school read and love it on the kindle fire with the feature of touching a word and it giving the definition so she understands what she is reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Not only is this an enticing novel, the kindle edition is easy to navigate and bookmark.

It's a great story, a definite page-turner, but way too short. And that's mostly why it's a 4/5. It felt like a long short story rather than a novel. And what I mean by that is that it needed more meat. More detail. This book could have easily been 400-500 pages long without slowing it down too much. Where are the descriptions of the community in general? Flashbacks to when Father was a child? Stories about Father caring for Asher in the Nurturing Center? Stories of Jonas and Asher working together and Asher causing Jonas to not be able to concentrate? Flashbacks of the Giver back when he was the Receiver? It could have been much, much longer. And I really wish it had been. This book took me 3 evenings to read and I'm generally a slow reader."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was reading it because my grandaughter was also reading it, in the beginning I had mixed feeling but ended up loving it!The Giver"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As with \\"The Hunger Game Series,\\" my thirteen year old grandson, Jonathan, had read \\"The Giver\\" and recommended I read it. My daughter also read the book, and Jonathan told me his mother and he could not agree on the ending. This piqued my interest so I bought \\"The Giver\\" to read. I enjoyed reading it, but can see why Jonathan and his mother disagreed about the ending. The village where Jonas, the main character, grows up is in the future. The people in it are highly controlled and it is a vanilla world where psychologically expressions of strong emotions have been eliminated. There is no love, hate, anger, or depression, and hunger and disease have been eradicated. It is a asexual world where birth mothers are chosen to have babies. Each family unit is allowed two children, a boy and a girl. Husband and wives are assigned to each other based upon personality and intelligence as well as your life's occupation. A ruling body of twelve elders sets the rules and controls the population. There are surrounding villages, but the people have little contact with them. Older people and new babies (if multiple births such as twins) are released. Only one family is different in the community, and that is the Receiver-Giver family who are identified by their light (blue) eyes. They are the family from which the current Receiver is chosen. This individual is the most important person in the village since he remembers what the world was like when their ancestors experienced war, famine, disease, and crises. Jonas is chosen by the retiring Receiver who is now old. I would recommend buying this book to learn what Jonas does once he receives the memories and what action he takes. Lowry does not explain everything, thus what has occurred and what is going to occur remains a mystery. The reader is left to develop his own scenario(s)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"While reading some of the reviews that gave the book less than five stars, I was simply shocked. I loved this book. I believe I have 3 copies at home, and I've read it at least 8 times. Some of the reasons people gave for not liking the book were that the novel was confusing, they didn't like the ending, it didn't explain things enough, or (and this is the worst) it was \\"disturbing\\". I'm sorry, people, but that is the whole point of the book.I'll first address the fact that this book is confusing. I think it is a valid point, the book does confuse the reader. The reader goes into the novel with assumptions, and the author takes those assumptions and smashes them down the garbage disposal. The frist thing you must realize is that this world is entirely fictional, but like \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and \\"Brave New World\\", it is set in the future of humanity. Any confusing events are there to make the reader think. If you are wanting a simple read, just to take your mind off life, I do not reccommend this book. You are just one of those people that this book is against. The book is thought-provoking. Lessons are revealed on many levels, and after many reads. If you find the book confusing, stick with it, read it again, and again, and I guarantee it makes sense.The ending of the novel is just another method the author uses of involving the reader, making the reader think. I won't describe it (you'd all hate me forever), but the ending is basically a fill in the blank. It kills me every time I read it, but every time, I fill in the blank with hope. You'll understand when you get there. Basically, it is ambiguous for a reason. The question the author is asking you is, how will you make the story end? Will you give up your humanity for peace and contentment and boredom, or will you fight for your right to feel, and see, and think?As for the people who thought the author didn't explain things enough, just deal with it. The author wrote the book the way the author wanted to write the book, and maybe the explanations have a reason for being ambiguous. The novel isn't a detailed science report, it is a book with a message, and the author is entitled to whatever poetic license the author wants. Think about the ambiguity and maybe there is a purpose behind it. Facts that don't illuminate the message would just detract and confuse people.And now for the other point. Granted, I only read one that said that the book was disturbing, but that made me so angry that I had to put down my thoughts right away. The book is SUPPOSED to be disturbing. If you didn't think it was, then you are disturbed. But the point is to look at the disturbing parts. It disturbs you to make you look at your life. Are you the kind of person who would go along with this society that murders babies, murders those who don't conform? The message is about the price of individuality. Don't just take a shallow view of this book. If you want shallow, read \\"The Boxcar Children.\\" This book is for kids, a lesson against peer pressure, but also for anyone who is willing to take the author's challenge and actually THINK for once."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book, The Giver, was very entertaining and interesting. I enjoyed finding the ups and downs of a \\"perfect\\" world. This book talked about a boy who lived in a \\"perfect\\" world, and was discovering throught the special \\"assignment\\" given to him-the Receiver of memeories-that the life and world he had always know was not as wonderful as it appeared.

In this book there are very strong emotions and acts of bravery and love. This book has changed my life forever and I will always treasure the memory of reading it. I would recommend this book to any one who likes Lois Lowry's writing skills and who loves books that change your life. In the book there is a world with no pain or suffering and the people who live there are always protected. It sounds like a place you'd want to live but after you read it you just might change your mind!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great science fiction book written by Lois Lowry. This book is about a boy named Jonas and his family in a perfect world. Jonas does not like this world but he cannot leave. When the children become twelve they become adults. They also get their first job. Jonas's job is to become the Receiver of the town's memory. This makes his life even harder. Now he wants to escape.I loved how Lois Lowry described this setting in this detailed book. In one part of this book Jonas receives a memory from the Giver about snow, which Jonas has never experienced. He feels the Giver's old, frail hand touch his bare back. All of a sudden, Jonas feels the room grow cold. He also starts to feel tiny pin pricks on his back. He then realizes that the Giver told him it was snow. I think that is a great setting description for that memory. When Jonas learns about love, the Giver puts his frail hand back on his bare back again. Then all of a sudden Jonas is in a warm room with a fire in the fireplace. Then he sees multiple children and parents. He turns and sees two elderly people. He thinks to himself, \\"This is an odd family unit.\\" He feels something in the room but can't quite grasp it. Then the Giver says that it is love. I know this makes me want to read the book more.A perfect world is not always good. To make this a perfect world, they had to take out many things such as color, memory, love, hope, fear, and hate. Imagine a world like this. The author might like this world because she wanted perfection but I think that some people would not like this world. I know that I wouldn't like this world.The Giver has a strange ending but has an interesting twist at the end that makes it exciting. I understood this book because of the themes. For example, love cannot be artificial and a perfect world is not always good. I also understood this book because of the settings. Without these in the book, I would be lost. This book has good details and an interesting plot. It was a good book because it made me feel differently about perfection. I give it two thumbs up. You should read this book too."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a good book, but slightly disturbing at times. The end is suspenseful. This book is full of suprises, but they are sometimes given away by foreshadows... but overall, it's a pretty good book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked the novel \\"The Giver\\". I always kept you thinking about Jonas and his world. Jonas lives in a Utopia where there are no choices, differences, or memories. When he is given a highly respected job, he learns the truth about how communities just like ours really live. While reading this book I started thinking about life without choices. What would it be like? The little things that we take for granted would not be there. Things like waking up in the morning and choosing whether to wear blue or green, eating a pear or an apple and seeing red or green, or just looking up and seeing the stars, these are all things we take for granted that Jonas didn't have. Eventually, Jonas leaves his community in search for memories and choices. This is the way I would want to live too. I really like the novel and I think that Lois Lowry did a good job writing it. It speaks a great message."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a story about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community that is guided by rituals and rules. There are very few choices to make because the major decisions of each person's life are made by a committee.

This is a job unlike all other jobs in the community, because The Reciever is the only person in the community who knows the truth about the outside world and understands true pleasure and pain.I first read this book when I was in 7th grade. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to reread it as an adult, and I loved it just as much the second time. The characters in this novel are great, and the idea of a Community where there are no choices is fascinating. I would recommend this book to anyone, child or adult."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an eye opening book of all genres. I couldn't classify this wonderful story under any category.

In the community of which he lives in, a celebration is held each time that you turn a year older. During the celebration, or ceremony you are expected to do a specific job or play a specific role. Adulthood is very important in this community because turning twelve is a big deal and it puts you up a step toward maturity. At the Ceremony of Twelve, you receive a job, or your role in the community. Considering Jonas is turning twelve this year, he is expected to get his role in society, along with his friends Asher and Fiona. Asher hopes that his role in society will be the one that has to do with taking care of kids and Fiona hopes that her role is the one that will have to do with taking care of the elderly. Jonas doesn't really mind of what role he gets, but he hopes that it will be something that will suit him well.When the big day finally comes, Jonas gets a job that he will soon get to love. This role will suit him very well. He begins to learn things about his community and has a knowledge of things that only he and his teacher are allowed to know about. He also learns about the people who have been \\"released\\" from the community.This book is both suspenseful and rush-fulfilling. In this book, you are always waiting for the huge moment of what Jonas's role in the community will be.

When he begins to see beyond and beneath the perfect exterior of the Community, Jonas as well as the reader must make a difficult choice.This is a very good book to spark discussions about our society today, our future, and our choices.

Most readers will find that this book is well written and, if your imagination is still working, a book for people of all ages.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I love it when \\"Young Adult\\" authors can capture any reader by using ageless themes, descriptive writing, and strong characters. Rowling does this well, and now I've discovered Lowry. In The Giver, she explores the pain and pleasure of growing up, expressing TRUE feelings, LIVING life, and the special bond of family. These themes make it perfect for older children around 11 or 12. The protagonist's age is also in this range. However, Lowry speaks to any age reader in this powerful scenario of a future society bereft of choice, variety, and authentic emotions. My wheels were turning all throughout the book as Lowry only gives a bit of information at a time about the Community in which the characters live. But the end of the book really got me thinking and wanting to talk with others who have read it.

It makes you look at the world in a completely new light, for every bad; there is something that is good. To get rid of all bad we would loose our freedom.

The end is ambiguous; it leaves you to make up your mind about what happens.

They run it by advice that is given from The Giver.The one thing I liked about this book was that Jonas got to work with The Giver. I thought it was really cool that Jonas got to experience seeing colors, riding on sleds, snow, sunshine, sunburn and pain. Things that he never even imagined. That was one of my favorite chapters. The Giver's job is to pass along memories, emotions, feelings of pain, joy and happiness onto Jonas. Jonas' job is to receive them.One thing that I really didn't like was some of the Community rules. They were only allowed 2 kids per family. I think that kind of sucks that you get your kids assigned to you and you can't just have your kids yourself. They assign you 1 boy and 1 girl per family. They believe that any more would ruin the community. I feel sorry for most of the kids because they can't ride bikes until a certain age. You can't really do anything until they, the community, feel you are mature enough to do it.

ChangPeriod: 5The Giver is about a boy named Jonas, who lives in a community that doesn [] let you have choices, with nothing like love, hate, music, color, emotions, weather, fear, and family. Everything is rules, rules, and rules. People live in the same routine, nothing new, no freedom; everything is the same and plain, even the weather. In this community, there is the [] Ceremony of Twelve[], a ceremony that chooses a twelve-year-olds job. Jonas is chosen to be the Receiver of Memory&iexcl;[], the most honored, painful, and rare job. Through this job, he is able to see the memories of the past, which shows him everything he doesn&iexcl;t have in the Community. He learns about emotions, weather, color, and family. Then he finds out what a controlled place he [is] living in.The plot was very interesting and made me attached to the book and is very touching. Although I really enjoyed reading this book, it was too confusing. While I was reading The Giver, my mind became unorganized. It never really gives us an explanation of the Community, as if it assumes that we know about how the Community works, which we don[]t.I didn&iexcl;[]t even know there was no color for the people in the community until I read half of the book. I realized for the first time that the Community didn&iexcl;[]t have color when the Giver said, []Once, back in the time of the memories, everything had a shape and size, the way things still do, but they also had a quality called color.&iexcl;[] I also didn&iexcl;[]t know there wasn&iexcl;[]t weather in the Community until Jonas thought, []Suddenly the perceived the word from it: sunshine&iexcl;[].My favorite part of the book is when Jonas first receives the memory of family and love. It finally gave him emotions, and it made him more like a person. I think the basic emotional needs are love and family. What is the difference from a robot from a human if there is no love and family? In the community, they erased love and family out of their lives, the basic emotions of a person. When Jonas received the memory of love and family, it made me think of Jonas more of a person."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book can be pretty confusing but I still love it. About a boy named Jonas who becomes a Twelve and get a assigned job. See this community is perfect. Jonas gets assigned a special job. He meets a man that becomes his true friend. There's twists and turns but it's great. Lois Lowry writes very different than most writers. That is what I love about her. And this book shows her creativity. And if you read this book and finish it, you might want to read another book called \\"Number the Stars\\" about a girl named Annamarie in 1943 and her friend is Jewish and the Nazi's a trying to kill them. So Annamarie must protect her friend until the war is over.

His job is to carry the memories from so long ago. he now knows suffering, famine, burns and color. Jonas goes to an annex after school and receive bit by bit of the memoriesI liked this book because it gives me an idea of what it would be like to live in a totally controlled and forced environment.

Although Jonas is unaware what he will be assigned he knows the elders have been watching him and will choose what they know is right for him. He is nervous but the feeling deep inside him is anxious for the day to arrive!The day of the ceremony comes and Jonas watches the ages before him go by making him extremely anxious. Jonas sees his friends and the people before him get their assignment's but when he is next something extremely odd happens. He is skipped! For the first time he finds himself different and singled out.The chief elder announces Jonas as the receiver of memories, everyone else seems to know what it is but Jonas. Jonas receives a small list of instructions and is to report to the annex behind the house of old for his training.At training Jonas realizes what his job really is. He is to hold the memories from the past in his mind. The giver holds all memories from the past of pain and pleasure and is to give them to Jonas. The memories Jonas receives from the giver's strong but comforting touch are memories of the past with pain, color, unlikeness, feelings and love.The giver has come up with a plan but this plan includes great risks for Jonas. What will Jonas do and how far will he go to achieve it?I loved this book! It is extremely different and definitely original. I could not imagine living in that community were everything is the same and the people feel nothing. This book is unbelievable and the characters and plot make this book fun and exciting to read.

Looking at the cover, it does not appear to be entirely too appealing, but the inside is what holds captive a jar of suspense, happiness, sadness, and a lillte bit of everything else that Lois Lowry meticulously inserted on each page of this wonderful book.The main character is Jonas, a boy at the age of eleven. This book takes place in a future utopian society, where nobody has a worry in the world . . . that is, until Jonas is given his life assignment at age twelve. Together, Jonas and the Giver decide it is time for a big change.This book includes a little mystery, magic, and everything in between!

Lois Lowry never fails to touch me deeply!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas's world is perfect. There is no fear or pain. Jonas has been chosen as the \\"Receiver of Memories\\" by the Giver. This book is an excellent book besides the ending. In the ending there wasn't much of a point. They ran away, and the memories went to the people.It was a perfect world. You couldn't do any thing wrong or you would be released. Jonas later found out that release was a form of murder. You couldn't do anything wrong or you would be released. There was a pilot that flew in the wrong area so he was released. Some people would apply for release. I guess that was a form of suicide? Why would they want to do that?In the book, The Giver, Jonas lived in a world where you couldn't experience pain or pleasures. Jonas had never experienced pain and when he did he experienced war and the pain of breaking a bone. Jonas's first memory was the memory of sledding down a hill. That was his first pleasure. He later visited a house with Christmas going on through the memories. It wouldn't be a life if you couldn't have something fun in your life. Jonas was kind of lucky for getting to do some of the fun things.There was no color or sound. Everything was black and white. Jonas finally saw the color red. He saw an apple and Fiona's hair. Nobody else could see the color beside himself and the Giver. There wasn't any music. The Giver told Jonas that he first heard sound like Jonas saw the color red. Jonas later heard Christmas Carols in the Christmas memory.Only one person could hold onto the memories. Jonas became the Receiver of memories. He was treated differently by all his friends after that. When Jonas ran away the memories were given to the people. The Giver told him that if he ran away that would happen. The reason theyheld onto the memories was so that everybody wouldn't have to experience real life. Every thing was chosen for the people. Like when you were ten you would get your first bicycle. When you were twelve, you would be chosen a job. I think that it wouldn't be fair if you couldn't choose what you wanted to do for a living.I think that the unbelievable part in this story was when Jonas saw his father release a newborn child. That would be weird for a twelve year old to become a birth mother. This book is just so different.I wonder if there is pollution or anything else in this world that couldn't be perfect? I mean there were planes. How would they run if they didn't have internal combustion?The book The Giver was a great book because it was so different. There wasn't anything like our world like music, color, pain, or pleasures. Since it really didn't have a good ending, maybe Louis Lowry can write a sequel to The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This amazing story is about a boy who lives in a town with no worries, pain ,or guilt.

Just by the way that the author imagined a world where everyone is the same, they eat the same, they wear the same clothes, and they have no real emotions.

It shows in it's realistic-fantasy way that he was experiencing what we all go though around his age.

I selected \\"The Giver\\" and was very pleased with my choice.I found it to be a thought provoking book that encourages the reader to evaluate his or her own position on matters such as life and death, right and wrong, good and evil. Lowry was able to create an idealistic utopian society where outwardly things seem to be ideal. However, upon closer inspection, the reader realizes that in this fictional world where there is no existance of war, hunger or poverty, there is also no evidence of emotion or freedom of choice.Provocative subject matter and the author's use of descriptive langueage makes \\"The Giver\\" a wonderful book for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book didnt realy keep my atention.

This book is about a boy named Jonas and his family in a perfect world. Jonas does not like this world but he cannot leave. When the children become twelve they become adults. They also get their first job. Jonas's job is to become the Receiver of the town's memory. This makes his life even harder. Now he wants to escape.I loved how Lois Lowry described this setting in this detailed book. In one part of this book Jonas receives a memory from the Giver about snow, which Jonas has never experienced. He feels the Giver's old, frail hand touch his bare back. All of a sudden, Jonas feels the room grow cold. He also starts to feel tiny pin pricks on his back. He then realizes that the Giver told him it was snow. I think that is a great setting description for that memory. When Jonas learns about love, the Giver puts his frail hand back on his bare back again. Then all of a sudden Jonas is in a warm room with a fire in the fireplace. Then he sees multiple children and parents. He turns and sees two elderly people. He thinks to himself, \\"This is an odd family unit.\\" He feels something in the room but can't quite grasp it. Then the Giver says that it is love. I know this makes me want to read the book more.A perfect world is not always good. To make this a perfect world, they had to take out many things such as color, memory, love, hope, fear, and hate. Imagine a world like this. The author might like this world because she wanted perfection but I think that some people would not like this world. I know that I wouldn't like this world.The Giver has a strange ending but has an interesting twist at the end that makes it exciting. I understood this book because of the themes. For example, love cannot be artificial and a perfect world is not always good. I also understood this book because of the settings. Without these in the book, I would be lost. This book has good details and an interesting plot. It was a good book because it made me feel differently about perfection. I give it two thumbs up.

Jonas, the main focus of the story, is a boy living a normal life in his community. Regulated by strict laws, blinded to color, deafened to music, and bearing no memories of a time before their own, the citizens of the community are dominated by a state known as Sameness. They have a contained, controlled, and predictable way of life. Pain and pleasure are not known to them, because their emotions and feelings have also been taken away, quelled by drugs that all of them take daily. But one among them is selected to hold all the memories of the world, color and music and joy and grief. He chooses Jonas as his successor, and passes his memories on to him. As Jonas learns about the true feelings of life, he and The Giver formulate a plan to give the community back the memories that they lost and regain a truer sense of life.\` The Giver ' takes place in a Utopian, \\"perfect\\" community of the future.

Well-written, a fascinating story of a utopia gone wrong, quite similar to Orwell's \\"1984.\\" The premise is interesting, the style is fitting, and the layers of meaning are thought-provoking. Need I say more?Obviously.Looking at the mass of negative outporing which this book has recieved, I feel it is necessary to make some things clear, even though I am quite sure that this review will glean nothing but scorn from those I am trying to debate with.For all of the 12 year-old readers out there, I am somewhat surprised with the disregard and in some cases complete disgust that this book is being recieved with. When my class read this book when we were 12, we absolutely loved it, and thought much of how we view the world. Perhaps it is a level of maturity that is the issue, or a societal placement, but the fact that fascinating books like this are being left by the wayside frightens me quite a bit.Now, for the people whom I truly wish to pick a bone with: the adult figures declaiming this book as a piece of [garbage] which does not even deserve to be burned.My first comment would have to be that your are being incredibly closed-minded in regards to this book. One should not look at a book in a disrespectful light because one disagrees with it. I mean, you should realize this is a fictional book, and a vehicle for an author's ideas and opinions. It made so we can look at ourselves critically, not so Mr. Deer can go and play with Mr. Goat.Besides, by saying that you wish to protect children from this kind of [book], you are denying exposure to the real world and the many fascinating viewpoints that the world contains. Kids see the fact that life isn't happy-go-lucky every day (especially now since events from last September).

A place with no crime, poverty, hunger, and any real feelings. Until Jonas learns the actions of the community he felt safe. Now Jonas, and his nine month year old baby, Gabe, are on the run to find a world that is real. The book has amazing depth and a real heavey theme. The only draw back is the immature way it is written.The book deals with very mature ideas, however the author seems afaird to tackel them. So many questions were left unanswered, so many fates undeterminded because of the author PG rating. However, the young adult writing didn't hinder this great example of literature.The Giver, by Lois Lowry is a unbelivable book. It makes you ask the question if a world with peace is worth living without a free will."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have read this book over and over agian because it will never be old. I read this book in the sixth grade and after we read it i knew i had to get my own copy. It was so good that used to be all i read until i read Lois Lowery's Gathering Blue. In my opinion everyone should own this book. It is the best book i have read and own. I recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book when I was ten years old and it gave me a whole new world to think about. As I reread it, I'm stunned by the even deeper levels that come across. It's a disquieting, but provoking read. This isn't recommended for general bedtime reading, but it is a wonderful book to share with your child."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book with my daughter of 11 and found it to be frightening and kind of a downer.The parts about the young boys budding sexuality was disturbing to me. I realized it was probably my own uncomfortableness about this rather than the fact that my daughter was reading this. She is probably having some of the same thoughts but I'm just not aware of it.I would strongly recommend this book to kids 11 or older. Probably not the best for younger kids."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my opinion, The Giver is an excellent book. Why I feel this way is because it opened a whole new world for me, and my seventh grade class. This book made me think of how lucky I am to have things that the characters in the book didn't have. I think that everyone should try to read such a great book like this one to realize that some of us in this world have it good.

There are no choices for anyone to make, no sicknesses, no crime, every family is the same and happy that way. But there is one person who holds all these memories that the community doesn't have. This person is The Giver.When the children of the community become Twelves each december, they are all assigned as Assignment which would become their everyday jobs. Jonas was selected to be the Receiver of Memory. He would work with The Giver and learn that the rest of the world isn't like his community: perfect and peaceful. The Giver holds all the things the community doesn't have, such as: color, love, pain, mountains, sunshine, and many other things. Additionally, Jonas learns that the term, &quot;release&quot; really means murder. After a year of training sessions with The Giver, he and Jonas decide it's time to start letting the rest of the community start feeling the memories. So they come up with a plan. But when a new child that Jonas has come to love is applied to be released, Jonas is forced to leave the community and take the new child with him. You should read this book to find out the ending and what happens to Jonas and the new child.I recommend this book to everyone because it has a suspensful plot that keeps the reader interested. Also, The Giver has many climaxes that make the book more eventful. I think that not only kids would like this book; adults would enjoy it also. Overall, The Giver by Lois Lowry, was an excellent book with great lessons and I would definetely recomment it to anyone I meet."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Of the many literary devices employed in Lois Lowry's The Giver, the three that are best displayed are the rising action, climax, and resolution. Although some might say that these areas lack in the novel, it it this lack of explanation of these particular literary devices that makes them so brilliant.The rising action of the book is incredibly exciting. The reader is not sure what is in store for Jonas on his journey. The action is most suspenseful when Jonas is leaving the &quot;utopian&quot; society he has lived in all of his life. As Jonas makes his journey in order to restore the memories of the townspeople, the rising action comes to its highest point. The climax of the story is when Jonas' memories are starting to slip away. This is a great climax because it gives the reader a sense of insecurity and wonder about the coming events. After the climax has ended, the author provides the reader with a resolution that does not really resolve anything. This is because he does not conclude the story in any way, but leaves it hanging for the reader to decide in his/her mind what had happened. The author does not force an opinion on you, but instead lets the reader make an important decision about the resolution. Although the author does lead you in a particular direction about what has happened, it is up to the reader to make out the details, and this is why the literary device is used so well. Without the wonderful use of these three devices, this story would not have as great an impact on the reader."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a spectacular book! I read it at school forthe academically gifted program. Usually the books are extremely boring to me. This book was so awsome that I am asking for it for my birthday. I cannot wait to read it again. It is about a world totally different from ours everything is supposively perfect but when you dont have any feelings or memories it isnt as good as our world if you really think our world has alot of problems their world doesnt. From day to day their world is perfectly fine but they are just there with no feelings or memories! When you start the book it grabs you and reels you in you can not stop reading it. I loved this book and I rate it with five stars because of the fact that it is so great! It really deserves more than five stars!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Title: The Giver By: Lois Lowry Publisher: Bantam Doubleday DellThis book is called The Giver. It's sort of a mix between Sci-Fi and Realistic Fiction. It's about a boy named Jonas. But he doesn't live in the world we know. He lives in a world without color, without crime, without freedom, without love. The story begins when Jonas turns 12. He is given a very special job in his community. He is given the job as the Receiver. Then he experiences things that he would never have thought possible. And his whole life changes forever.The characters, you can't describe because we all have different images of the characters in the story and the author doesn't really describe the characters. Jonas is the main character in the story. The Giver (once the Receiver) is an old man who trains Jonas to become the new Receiver. Jonas's mom, dad, and his sister Lily are completely oblivious to what goes on when Jonas trains under the Giver. Then there is Asher. Asher is the best friend of Jonas. There is also Gabe. Gabe is a baby that has no assigned parents yet so Jonas's family is taking care of him. Gabe also has the same kind of \\"abilities\\" as Jonas.The book is good because it tells about a \\"perfect\\" world that isn't so perfect after all. It tells about a boy that lives in a community of ignorance and how he copes with that. It has real raw emotion and feelings. It can drive you insane how stupid this community is, but satisfies you at the same time. Over all, The Giver is a wonderful book for those who want to think outside the box of life. I give The Giver 5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is possibly the best book I have ever read. I received it from a friend about eight years ago, who received it from a teacher she had been working with. Since then, I have given the book to no less than thirty people, each of whom has touched my life in a loving and eye opening way. I have read The Giver so many times, I have gone through three copies! I am in my twenties and have worked with children most of my life. My favorite literature genre is young adult, but due to my age I am often not taken seriously by those around me when it comes to discussing novels. I feel anyone who takes the time to read The Giver will understand my passion for young adult literature. I continue to pass along the words of Ms. Lowry, because I feel the need to share with the world the meaning behind her stories. I have read several reviews for The Giver which have stated it is inappropriate for the age it is written for. It deals with controversial, or delicate, subjects, such as death, puberty, maturity, sexuality, love, the environment, child bearing, the roles of men and women, etc. The list could keep on going! The point is, for those of you who work with children or have children of your own, this book gives you the opportunity to discuss these matters with them! Open up your own mind and let them open theirs to the world around them! Some reviews say The Giver is too emotional a read for children. Let them feel! Let them get angry, or hurt, or scared, or joyful--talk to them! I feel this is an excellent book for communication--if I didn't feel this way, I would not have written such a lengthy and involved review!I also recommend Gathering Blue, by Lois Lowry. It is an excellent companion to The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I normally only read novels that I know will have adventure in them, and only read The Giver because it was assigned to me in school. However, The Giver has surpassed everything I've ever read. It's now my favorite book because it compels you to think, particularly about aspects of life that I had always taken for granted. I won't tell you what they are for fear of becoming a spoiler, but I will tell you that The Giver is something I intend on reading again and again in the future. This brilliantly-written book deserves every one of those above five stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas in his perfect world (no poverty, no sickness, no crime, no color, no music, basically communism controls)...goes through some changes.

Great great book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you want a book that will make you think, then _The Giver_ is a book for you. It is a thought provoking book in many ways. It reminds us as citizens whose lives have also been changed by technology and the people who run the country, that just because we have the capability to do something, doesn't mean that we should. Although many do not care for the open ending, I loved it because it made me feel hopeful for the future of Jonas and Gabriel.

This is the story of a boy who had an amazing gift but was a child still. Despite this, he risked everything at the end of the book for liberty and safety for someone he loved.

The giver has to transport all of his memories from the past to Jonas. When he gives Jonas the memories he loses them. He gives him memories like war, family, love, and hurt. All of these things are only understood by Jonas and the Giver. This is the best book I have read in a long time. I do not enjoy reading very much, but this book hooked me. I read it in three days.

The setting is a fantasy utopia, where every family unit has a mom, a dad, a son and a daughter. Everyone has a job chosen by the elders set to the recipient's mental, emotional and physical health. Jonas, the main character, is growing up with a group of kids the same age as he is. On the day Jonas' group turns 12, they get their \\"assignments\\" which is their lifelong job. Jonas gets a very special job. He is to be the \\"Receiver of Memory.\\"In the utopia Jonas lives in, people don't want to have the burden of war, hate, pain and love, but they also give up sunshine, snow, color and music. They do not simply give the memories up. They give them to the \\"receiver.\\" The \\"receiver\\" can aid the elders in decisions they have not faced before. When Jonas becomes the \\"receiver\\" he learns of the true nature of life and death and how many bad things his family and friends are trained to do, but not think badly about. When the old receiver, named The Giver by Jonas, transfer memories to Jonas, it is with almost psychic power. Jonas gets to live these old memories with all the senses he has. He actually feels like he is reliving terrible past events. He finds out terrible things. When Jonas learns of the worst things, he decides he can no longer live in this community. He decides he must leave and he takes with him the one person he has grown to love and can't bear to abandon that person to what fate has in store for them if left in the community.The book is very detailed about the community and its people. You actually begin to enjoy watching them come to life, and when you begin to learn things about them, you feel angry. Lois Lowry does a great job relating Jonas feelings of anguish and betrayal as he makes one of the hardest decisions in his life. The climax is very good and you are left with idea that maybe a couple of things could have happened, and you need to decide what kind of person you are to end the book for yourself. And added benefit is that it is not a very hard read and anyone above the 4th grade should easily be able to read it. I highly recommend the book to anyone who likes to read fantasy novels."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverIn the book the Giver by Lois Lowry a science fiction novel. Is a very exciting and adventurous story about a boy in a sameness community. Who sees everything very different from others.Jonas is eleven year old boy who lives in a sameness community. In the community there are a ton of rules for example you can only have two children one boy, and one girl. Once you reach the age of twelve which on Jonas mind is coming up everybody in December has I big ceremony celebrating there age, and when you are twelve you get assigned a job by the Chief Elder the leader in the community. The most important job you could be assigned is receiver of memory which Jonas was chosen for. He thought he was skipped because she did not say his number. Everybody has trainer and Jonas was the Giver he gave him memories of the past and could see color now because of the Giver but he could not tell anybody about his training. Later on in the book Jonas Dad a nurturer in the community had a job when there was two kids (twins) wit same name they have to choose the one that is the heaviest and his Dad had to kill the other baby. Jonas asked the Giver if he could see the tape of the neutering and he does, and after he has seen he tells the Giver he wants to apply for a release but you are not allowed to apply for a release. So what does he do?Jonas&#65533;s motivations are when he does stuff like when he tried for an a release he did not think about it he just went and asked for one with out thinking and that is how Jonas is in the book. In every decision Jonas makes he never thinks about it first and then he ends up regretting his decision. He does it because he doesn&#65533;t know about the consequences or does not think of any consequences that might happen. There for Jonas is a character who does thinks before he acts and later on pays for those mistakes.Jonas role in the book is he is the main character the center point of the story. Jonas is a wise, brave, persistent boy who sees everything different from other people and that is why he was chosen as receiver of memory. The Giver the man who is training Jonas is also the same as Jonas because the receiver of memory and the Giver are the same thing and that&#65533;s why they were chosen for that position in the community.The strong points of the story are that it is very exciting and adventurous, and it makes you think like why did he do this? Another one it was a very descriptive book and, very easy to read and, follow along the author describes every little detail in the book. It is also very strong in describing the characters description and what they do and why. I don&#65533;t think there are any weak points in the book because it is very, easy to read and, follow along, and follows the expectation for a science fiction novel and, it is very descriptive and, really good word choice. That&#65533;s what I think of the Giver a really great book.By: Derek Rager"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an EXCELLENT book!

It challenges conformity and conservatism even in our own society, but its focus is on this utopian society and the character of Jonas.

A bad book can go on poisoning minds for generation\\". The society is feeling to emerge the society by burning books. Well I read, but it's mostly the newspaper or I just read the news on the computer. Well, let's just say that the book The Giver is a book that shows that it isn't good to live in a perfect world. First of all, Jonas gets assigned a job by the Elders to be a giver. I think life is dull in Jonas's world. They have to follow strict laws, and they can't meet anyone outside the town like people on vacation. So, basically, what I have to say is your life is being taken over by people that you don't see all the time. I don't think you feel excitement. In my opinion I would just let the people decide on if the books should be banned, not the government."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Censorship represents the amount of confidence a society feels. When a society feels threatened they will attack the ideas in books before the ideas attack the society. The Giver by Lois Lowry is number 14 on a list of 100 books that were reported by the American Library Association to be the most frequently challenged books from 1990-1999. Some of the books this list should be banned, but some of them are not that bad. The giver stresses that a perfect world is one without books for enjoyment. This book also has some suggestive material that I felt was very scary. In conclusion, books aren't great for all readers."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"CensorshipAccording to Alfred Griswold books won't stay banned. They won't burn. Ideas won't go to jail. In the long run of history, the censor and the inquisitor have always lost. But the only weapon against bad ideas is better ideas. If books were banned they wouldn't stay banned for a long time. Even if they were burned, the ideas would have been expressed wouldn't be gone forever. Ideas wouldn't be taken away by putting people who knew the stories away from the people who don't know the stories. They say \\"the only weapon against bad ideas is good ideas.\\" This means bad ideas can easily change into good ideas. Also, you can chance. Books will always be remembered, meaning after reading a book you can tell someone the key points of what it is about. Like in The Giver they are not allowed to have books. That's not right because books help you so much."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"For banned book week I read The Giver. In my opinion The Giver was a great book, because you get to use your imagination and fill in the parts. The Giver doesn't give the answers; it just lets you believe what you want. The Giver gives you the right to believe in whatever you want. The message that I think The Giver is trying to get out is that you shouldn't take life for granted because you could be living in a life of no choices, no personal opinions, and sameness."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"To demolish civilization today, you do not have to destroy books by burning them, destroy them by telling people to stop reading them and before long; no one will know what books really are. Our imagination will be nowhere. Censorship of books is much like destroying our thoughts and leaving us nowhere. In many schools today, The Giver, a book by Lois Lowry, has been banned. In this novel, there is apparently, censorship in the society. Even though you may think that this book is nothing like reality, it really is. We censor things like their community does. We don't want our nation to see certain things and neither does the community in The Giver. This censorship may be for better, possibly for the worse. We will never know some things because of censorship. Some things are better left unsaid. This is the reason we censor books even though some minds may be yearning to know these things. Burning books is one way to censor things and telling people not to read is another."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you think for yourself, you should let others comprehend how they want to also. In the book The Giver people weren't allowed to read and they never got to do what they want. Why should the world be restricted against reading the book of there choice? That is just like saying the religion you believe in you can't believe in it any more. The Giver is a book I have recently read and there is no reason why it should be banned. It makes you want to use your imagination. You have to picture everything such as if the world had no color. You should know there are some disturbing parts, such as them giving the old a bath.

I enjoyed reading The Giver and I did think that Jonas made acircular journey and came back home okay. I thought since Jonas left the town it had changed for the best.

Painful and nice ones, war and warm beaches. There would be days when the Giver would not feel good because of memories. Then the next day he would transfer other memories to Jonas.

The security of the book really makes you appreciate how good we have it, having your feelings and fun.

They get assigned jobs. They can't see color and they get put in a family. They also have to tell their dreams if they had any. It was a hard book to understand sometimes like when people got released. It was also hard to understand how much freedom they don't get. It was suspenceful in many ways. One time when they were at the ceremony waiting for their tasks. And another time when Jonas (a main character) was going to The Giver while wondering what they meant by pain. And finally, the time when they could never get to Elsewhere. One of many lifes lessons that I thought of while reading was to never give up.

Basically everything is the same, but Jonas has all the memories of pain, delight, and everything else we have today. His life changed a lot when he got his job as receiver because he was not with his friends anymore, he sticks it out because he is important, and he learns so much about the past pains and glories. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am 15 years old, and just finished reading this book in my class. I first read this book when I was in fourth grade. I can tell you now that this book isn't for anyone younger than myself. It contains very graphic scenes, and adult themes. I believe this book was written for all those people who criticize our world, they say that there is too much violence, hatred, and racism. After they read this book I promise that they will realize that the perfect society, a utopian society isn't what it seems to be, and that we are lucky with the world that we live in. I enjoyed this book very much, and I hope all of those who read will enjoy it to."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that this book was pretty cool, but it was very confusing at the beginning. Is shows a &quot;perfect&quot; community, and how everyone in this community lives. At the end, it kind of leaves you off, not knowing what would happen, so If I were The Author, I'd probably clear up the ending some more, But I found It a very good book!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; is a great book, if you like fictional stories. I don't want to give away the book by telling you a full summary, but for you people who don't like surprises, read on. I'll be telling about a few characters and maybe a few really good parts. One of those good parts was when Jonas, the main character, started to panic when he wasn't assigned a job. The part I liked the most was when Jonas and Gabriel stole out of the community and were learning to survive in the outside world. The community Jonas and the others live in aren't like the communities of today. This community is extremely orderly and everyone who lives there are the same. There isn't a president but they have a chief elder who leads a group of elders who decide what goes on in this community. Later in the story, the chief elder announces that he was selected to be...

As he grows older, he is given the most honorable job in his community. The job teaches him about the past,when there were feelings, color, and emotions. As he learns more and gains more emotions from the old man,&quot;the Giver,&quot; he tries to teach his friends about the past, but they don't understand him, and what he is talking about. Soon, he becomes fond of a little boy, Gabriel, and passes the information of the past to him. Jonas soon can not put up with the community and leaves with Gabriel. They journey to another place. This bok has no ending. If you like sci-fi books then this is the book for you. This book will spark your interest and you will never want to put it down. There is much suspense near the end of the book. The begining of the book might be boring but once you make it to the ninth chapter it becomes more interesting and begins to get intense near the end. I recommend this to people ten years old and up. Just give it a try. Happy reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was just amazed at how this book got me to think, &quot;What if I had to live under these cicumstances?&quot;, or &quot;What if this happened to our world?&quot; I was literally on the edge of my seat reading through Jonas' trials and tribulations, but was surprised at the uncertainty of what happened at the end. Seriously, there needs to be a sequel to this novel. Most extraordinairy book that everyone MUST read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I though The Giver was a very good book, with an intresting setting. The only thing I didn't like was that the ending was pretty lackluster."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" is the first book in a trilogy, although I understand the story doesn't really continue for the main character Jonas. This is a young adult book, and I can see why many teachers enjoy using this to spark discussion. It is short and easy to read, although it is filled with a lot of controversial topics that would be a wonderful source of discussion.As the book unfolds, you slowly learn about a utopian society, but you start to realize they've paid a high price for \\"sameness\\". I find this somewhat similar to what Americans are doing for a sense of safety from terrorists and evil in general. Americans are willingly giving up many liberties for an assurance (or similitude of one) that they won't be attacked.The geek inside of me struggled with some of the concepts in the book regarding memories and technology. This colored my review a little, but I still think this is a great book for middle-school aged kids to read and more importantly discuss with parents and/or their teacher and class."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book a few years ago and because I loved it so much, I figured I would share my thoughts with the people on Amazon considering this great read.This book describes a Utopian \\"perfect\\" society,\\" where there is no pain-no love-no fear-no hunger-and no segregation. Everyone is 'the same' as described in the book. At around age 12, everyone is required to begin taking a medication that suppresses the urge to *ahem* reproduce, so that the government can control the population very easily. SPOILER: when a twin is born or when someone commits a crime one time too many, they are released--executed. This is where Jonas decides that his \\"perfect\\" society may be a lot less perfect than he thought. A perfect society comes at a great cost, no one can decide for themselves, the government decides everything. SPOILER: for the entire book, everything is in black and white, so no one can see in color! Some of the most important people in this book are the geneticists who control what a person will look like before they are born, they make it so no one can see in color. Also, HUGE SPOILER: no one can hear music, so that no one can be overly-happy (this is huge because it is the core of the ending of this book).I 100% love this book, it creates a complete society in your mind where everything seems so perfect, and only one-two people (the Giver and the Receiver) know the truth and this history of the world.I definitely recommend reading this book to almost anyone, it is very interesting and a page-turner that you wont be able to put down until your done, and you'll be glad you read it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Growing up, I always loved literature. I began reading by the age of almost 4 and I haven't stopped since. In the eighth grade, my middle school homeroom began to read a novel called \\"The Giver\\", however, just as we began to read the novel, I moved across the country here to small-town Montana. To my surprise when I got to Montana, my english class was reading the novel too, but they were just finishing it. It surprises me that I remember these events to this day in my senior year, but back then, I never really got interested in the book. This was not because the book was not good, because it is a wonderful novel, but because at the time, I could not grasp the social concepts behind it. I have now returned to the novel and read it twice for my semester project. Lois Lowry truly wrote a spectacular novel.The Giver is a story about Jonas and his recieving of the role infamously known as \\"The Reciever.\\" As Reciever, Jonas begins to know of the things that float in existence without the knowledge of the community. Things like pain, hurt, sadness, and loneliness are emotions that the community is simply not aware of. Jonas recieves these feelings through memories of the past, given to him by \\"The Giver\\", hence the novel's name.The Giver has too many concepts hidden behind it to simply discuss them, and I believe that is what led to its multiple bannings, but things like social oppression, abortion, and individuality, are all alluded to within the novel. Jonas struggles to accept such evils and decides to rebel, but I'll leave the rest to the reader.Simply put, \\"The Giver\\" is a must-read. I think that is the reason that it was being read in my Florida class, and also being read across the country in Montana. I absolutely recommend you to click the add to cart button above and prepare yourself for an absolutely fantastic read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We had to read this last year in 7th grade for a project and then we had to make our own Utopia. Mine was called Alpha and Omega (christian world). anywho this book was amazing the end made me cry. It was just so beautiful. If you buy this book you won't be sorry. Trust me!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a futuristic community where individuals are not capable of making their own decisions. This book is both captivating and unique at the same time. The captivating uniqueness of the community and how the community handles social issues is interesting when discussing topics in socialism. There is some content in this book that might be misunderstood by younger readers and may even be graphic in nature. Such as the release process of sickly new children,as well as the old. This book can at times be dark and bizarre, but keeps you interested throughout the book. There's alot of symbolism to be obtained within the book, such as Jonas seeing the color red. There is alot to learn about social behavior and what happens when we are exposed to things we have never seen before and how it is in the nature of an individual to make choices. The question that arises from this book is \\"Are we better off making our own decisions individually, or having the community make it for us\\"?. There is also the aspect of the ending, where he inevitable escapes the community with Gabriel. The ending left you to think about what might have happened, but the symbolism implied by the new-child Gabriel implies alot to clear the ending. I would recommend this book to those 12 and older, since some aspects of the book might be too unclear and even scary(death of a new-child..etc)for those younger than 10. If you enjoy books that describe aspects of social behavior and science fiction, you would more likely like this book. Would also suggest as a read for social studies courses."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"WHAT is this book about?Jonas is an 11-year-old boy who lives in a community that prides itself on order and following the rules. Everyone in the community knows their place, and they are expected to adhere to the rules at all times. If you are a newchild, you are expected to grow and develop under the care of Nurturers (like Jonas's father)--meeting all your milestones and expected behaviors before you are assigned to a family at your first birthday. For soon-to-be Nines (like Jonas's sister Lily), it is an especially exciting year as you'll get your bicycle (the primary means of transportation in the community). For soon-to-be Twelves like Jonas, the Ceremony of Twelve is critical as it gives you an Assignment--your permanent role within the community. Jonas is anxious about the upcoming Ceremony, and expresses his concerns at his family's daily Sharing of Feelings. His parents assure him that the Council of Elders take their job of assessing the Elevens and picking their Assignments seriously. So when the Ceremony arrives and Jonas discovers his Assignment, he is shocked to discover that it is a very prestigious position within the Community--one unlike any other. This new role puts Jonas in a unique position to learn more about his community ... and what he discovers changes his view of the world forever.WHO do we meet?Jonas is a young boy with special abilities that put him in a unique position to learn about his community. This knowledge throws Jonas into a quandary as he must keep what he learns to himself, but what he learns causes him to question everything he's ever known about his family, friends, school, and community.The Giver is Jonas's teacher and the one who opens his eyes to the realities of their community.WHEN and WHERE does the book take place?The book takes place in an unspecified time and place. However, I'm assuming it is set in the future, when life as we know it has been \\"modified\\" in order to maintain order and peace.WHY should you read this book?This is a masterful addition to the canon of YA dystopia, and I think it does what a good dystopian book should--send chills up your spine while presenting you with an alternative world that seems like it could actually come to pass. Like Jonas, the reader slowly begins to grasp the realities of this world and exactly what has been done in the name of order and control. I loved how Lowry created this seemingly utopian world (no sickness! respect for elders! lovely weather all the time!) and then slowly turns it over to reveal its rather sinister underbelly. I read the book in one sitting, and I immediately wished I had a young adult (13 or older) to discuss it with. This is what YA dystopia books SHOULD be like. And I'm not the only one to think so. The book won the 1994 Newbery Medal (which is awarded annually by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association, to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children).By the way, this is the first book in a trilogy (the other books are Gathering Blue and The Messenger), and I plan on reading them as well."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book when I was in 5th grade or so, and found the story captivating. Perfect society, perfect world, everyone is fair, everyone is equal. Discuss our feelings, speak concisely and nicely about others. Fear, poverty, violence, and the bitter realities of the real world don't exist. Except for Jonas. Jonas is given the burden of holding these memories, so that he can help the council formulate educated decisions for how they should properly moderate their perfect society.This book evokes so many emotions, and is hands down one of my favorite books still to this day. I read it countless times when I was younger, lent it to friends and family members. I went through two physical copies of the book, and when I started reading on a Kindle I figured it'd be an excellent way to get myself back into the spirit of reading. I couldn't have been more pleased with my decision to pick this one up first.It's a fairly simple read, but the concept, depth, story, and feelings inside the book are very complex. My girlfriend is in the process of reading it now, upon my recommendation. You should do the same :)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is intended for both YA and adults (I think that the adult will appreciate it more). The author paints a pretty bleak,scary picture. If you are enjoying the new Syfy series on Fox, about a new earth,you will enjoy this book. The story isn't flashy, it might even be discribed as stark; but your immagination is all you'll need for a Wow of a time. Are we \\"givers\\" or \\"receivers\\"?The book might have only taken me a day to read, but the story has stayed with me.That makes it valuable to me. ENJOY"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I enjoyed this book very much and finished it quickly. It is a tale that will set you thinking, and it is just a good story. However I must admit to some disappointment. My expectations were very high for this work. It is Newbery medal winner, a book that we know from the author's comments, was very well received - beyond anything she had experienced before, and thus I was expecting something exceptional. What I read was a story that had some flaws, and set me thinking, but was no more profound than Nicholas Fisk, Robert Westall (albeit himself a Carnegie medal winner) or other such authors. This was a very good book - just not exceptional.Before I get picky, I would point out I would still like to recommend this book to older young adult readers.But what did I not like? Well the world itself seems to lack explanation. We can understand perhaps why the world would seek to homogonise itself to reduce difference and relieve the suffering of difference and choice. But if we run with that premise, it is not clear why we would choose not to see colour. It is not really clear why we would choose to create the life we are shown. There is no hint, even, of some major event that caused people to react by turning themselves into automata. Personally I much preferred Orson Scott Card's \\"homecoming\\" series and also his \\"Worthing Saga\\", both of which explore this idea much more completely, and for my money, would be better and more thought provoking stories than this one.But this is a childrens or young adult book, and space is limited, so we can excuse much of this perhaps. We also must excuse the lack of explanation of what is happening with memories. Why are memories never lost? what is the mechanism for the passing of memory? We don't know but just take it on trust that this is now how the world works.Some people will not mind these gaps one bit, and for them this will be a five star book. For me though, I felt there were better renditions of the same story, although I still certainly enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a required read when I was a freshman in High School. I am so glad I was introduced to this book! This book is set is the future when the world is nothing like it is today. There is no color. Your job is picked for you based on how you act, which the leaders of the society study you as you grow up to determine this. You do not \\"Love\\" the way most people do. Your spouse is picked for you. Nothing is your choice. The Giver is a special person who holds all the knowledge of how the earth use to be. The giver can see color. The giver knows everything. When a young boy gets picked to become the giver, he has no idea what he is getting himself into, and he learns a few things that will change his future for better or for worse.This is an amazing book. Please read it! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Unfortunately, I did not read the novel until my freshman year in college, and yet the theme was still somewhat difficult for me to comprehend at this level, because of its'complexity. For some reason I believe that this story would be difficult for younger children (such as fifth grade) to comprehend. I am not usually a fan of science fiction, however, I enjoyed this novel immensely. Lowry shows that even the most perfect world is still flawed.Yet, surprisingly, she took the components of the novel from her real life experiences. Although I know that the book ended exactly the way that Lowry wanted it too, I still think that she should have included some more information as to what was to happen to Jonas. From reading most reviews, that was the major problem addressed."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a strange book because it takes place in the future. They have all sorts of wierd rules on hair ribbons and bikes and they even have a special term called &quot;release&quot; for people who don't fit in with the other community people. A release is when they kill the person. But I shouldn't give the book away!!!! I am reading the Giver for a grade six assigned book. The other assigned books I have reviewed are as followed: Bridge to Terabithia; The Cay; Sounder {I think I reviewed it!} and others. So you can read my point of view from a sixth grader who has to read these books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who becomes the &amp;quot;receiver of memory&amp;quot; in a world that I found was too fictional. The author sends the message of what the world would be like after a nuclear war. The book also brings out the advatages and disadvatages of a world without choices. I recommend the Giver to anybody who is searching for an excellent fictional and symbolic book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time because it is meaningfful and gives a view of how life without strong feeling can be harsh and unwanting. I thought this plot was definetily an act of pure brilliance by Lois Lowery. This book is so meaningful and important. Jonas's expieriances as the new reciever showed me that we need things like love. It also showed the sadness of war ,hunger,neglect and many others that we have to deal with today. I saw that when not used to it all these things can do a number on one's soul. I don't know how much I can tell you what a great book this but all i can say for now is everyone should read tis extrodinary book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book as an assignment in my English class. I think it's certainly full of revealing insights about society and what's supposed to be for the benefit of society. On th other hand: Does a story have to be so stiff, so boring and so obvious in what it is meant to say?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was the book to get me to start reading. Once I got past the... different cover, I realized what a beautiful book it truly was. The book itself told of a life of a young boy that loved his life but didn't know what he was missing... or what people were hiding from him. When I had finished reading the book I thought -What a wonderful ending- because that's just what it was. Some authors leave details out, leave strings hanging, not tied into a knot, but Lois Lowery tied them tight with a shiny red ribbon. Highly reccommended for people just starting to read"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book, I loved the way it was written, and, although a little to young for my age (17) I still enjoyed it a lot.I liked the way the story started. It seemed like Jonas was innocent, a child. He knew nothing of what was happening all around him. That is until 'The Ceremony of Twelve', everybody in this 'commune' has their lives mapped out for them. Jonas is chosen for the highly regarded and much revered role as 'The Giver'. The Giver at the moment is an old man, who reveals to Jonas that he is the keeper of the communes emotions and feelings, all the good, the bad, the happy, the sad, the painful and all the pleasureful ones. He must give these to Jonas by psychically passing them to him (like a Vulcan Mind Melt for you trekkies out there!) Jonas must learn to accept the good with the bad. As Jonas receives the memories The Giver looses them from his mind, he only remembers them slightly.First of all Jonas learns how to feel snow, he loves it. The Giver continues to give Jonas wonderful and exciting emotions and feelings and then slowly starts to introduce the harder ones, like a broken arm, a fire, dying, etc. Jonas hates this part of his calling. When he realizes that death is the same as 'Releasing' he learns what his whole society is like, - a sterile emotionless existence where all independent thought and personal growth is quashed. He starts to turn against his father who works as a 'Nurturer'. He released a baby earlier that day, and Jonas realized that his father murdered a little baby.This acts as a catalyst for Jonas and The Giver to start a plan that will inevitably turn the whole society and ideology of the commune upside down.I suggest you read this book, if you are 6 or 60, it is a really good book all about what our world could turn into."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is yet another example of Lois Lowry's wonderful work. Her novel deals with the importance of memory and of the necessity of recognizing change -- the concept that life doesn't stand still.In this novel, a young boy becomes the holder of memory for a society. He must learn to deal with the pain and pleasure that has accumulated over the years.The novel is vaguely similar to Ayn Rand's Anthem. It includes the theme of free thought and is set in a society where your life is chosen by the community. It is, however, more realistic psychologically speaking. In Rand's novel, the setting is an oppresive one in which the main character is unhappy with his life even though he does not realize that there is indeed a different manner of living, and somehow manages to instinctively change his lifestyle to Rand's ideal. In The Giver, the main character doesn't realize that another manner of life can exist until he actually experiences it. For example, the society had managed to lose the concept of color, and while the main character notices it, he has no idea of what is going on. It isn't untill someone explains it to him that he can specifically say why some object appears to be different from another while the shapes may be the same.This novel is very original, and very well done. I would definately suggest reading/buying it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is my favorite book! I love Jonas's world, and with him I grow to hate it. I love the Giver, and the memories! I just love the whole book. There's just no other way to describe it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In the beginning of The Giver the book was boring to me. It was sort of confusing which made me not want to read it anymore. After I made it through the beginning, I entered into a place that kept me wondering about what was going to happen next. This is a story of a boy who experiences incredible situations and makes it through the impossibles. In this book The Giver by Lois Lowry, Jonas was one of the main characters. He was chosen for something very special. When his selection guides him to an unnamed man-the man only called the Giver-Joans begins to realize the secrets that underlie the soft perfection of his world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm really not a person who gets into books.

The only way to understand is to READ EVERY LAST WORD!!It will change your life, and send tears streaming down your face.Not for the faint of heart, THE GIVER RULES!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think when I found out abuot release I was going to cry. It wasn't right to do that to children. I think Jonas made a right decision on take Gabe and leave the community. Some of the rules were unfair. I would like to pick who to marry and what job I want. Also making one person like the giver deal with all their pain is rude. I think this books shows you that sameness isn't always good. They couldn' even see in color because people according to the community would be jelious."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When writing a book with a setting where there is no poverty no theives and so forth it would probably be very hard to maintain your train of thought, but Lowry did an excelent job and created a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I don't usually care to read and don't have time, but in the seventh grade when I was forced to read this book, I LOVED IT!!!!!

However, it was not a book I would care to read again, as it is about, basicly, the oppression of a community of people. It starts out with everyone supposedly being happy, and living in a perfect place, where there is no war, poverty, or starvation. However, Jonas looks past that and sees a community deprived of culture and freedom. But Jonas is chosen as the new Giver, in which he will recieve memories. Some sad and horrifying, others peaceful and serene. But in the middle of his training, the Giver and Jonas take a day off to see what Jonas's father does at work.

Jonas takes him, and some supplies, and they leave the community. They are almost caught, but they managed to escape.

Jonas' family got to keep Gabriel for a while. At the end of the book Jonas got to snow and in one of the memories the Giver gave him. Five things I didn't like about this book was the people couldn't see in color, they couldn't go to another town. If woman had twins, the one that didn't weigh very much was killed, everyone was told what to do. The children didn't get toys like a bike until they were a certain age.

Then, when Jonas started his journey to &quot;Elsewhere&quot; with his favorite newchild, life changed for him. They then knew real pain and it took everything they had, including the memories Jonas had got from The Giver to stay alive.

I like the idea that the author used the future for the setting. I thought is was a little confusing at some parts because the author doesnt tell you out-right that the story is set in the future so you dont know why this environment is the way it is. For instance, when the plane flys above and everyone is amazed/frightened, you dont understand why they would be afraid of a plane. The ending has a alot of strength to it and leaves the reader asking themselves &quot;Did Jonas die or did he really find that 'home'?&quot; The Giver is an amazing character in this book. You feel sorry for all the others in the community because they dont know what its like to love someone or enjoy holidays like The Giver and Jonas do. The Giver is the 'heart' of the community, in my perspective."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was extremely well written. It has a very intersting plot.

It's so confusing at first, especially when the apple changes color but Jonah can't describe it.

I don't know how Lois Lowry came up with this idea for a book, but it was a really good one. The book is so interesting, and it just draws you in. I literally couldn't put it down! I hope the author writes some more like it. The ending is very weird, and it leaces you hanging. That is the one thing I did not like about this book. Anything could have happened at the end, and I think the author made sure that you would think that because she included some pretty bizarre stuff during the story itself."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book really gave me a great insight on what would happen if there was no color, no feelings. Jonas' Community has no hate, pain, or suffering, because without feelings or color, there won't be fighting. Also in the book there was no religion. These three things are the main reasons war started. Somehow they got rid of them and that helped them make no war. But in doing that there haad to be no love.

In many ways it is a &quot;Big Brother&quot; that children can relate to."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Great book. If you like science fiction and enriching your imagination, read this book.

When you turn twelve in the community, you are given a life assignment which is chosen by the Elders of the community. But Jonas is not given an assignment. He has been selected to become the new Receiver of Memories, something that only happens once in a lifetime. Jonas soon after meets the most important Elder in the community. He is called the Giver. He holds memories long forgotten, so that they can be passed on and not released into the community. During the course of a year, Jonas learns many things about the past and the present. But when Jonas learns the worst thing a child can learn, he does something no one in the community has ever done. This book was very good, however I do not recommend it for younger readers. The book has a wonderful story plot line. If you are in Grade 5 and up, then this book is definitely for you."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Everybody should read The Giver because you never get bored. There is lots of action and feelings that Jonas has. You get really attached to Jonas so you want to read more and more. Lois Lowry is such a good writer.This fantastic book is about an eleven year old boy who hasn't gone through any pain, loss of family, or even heard about war. The weather is controlled, the food is provided for them, and they have to take pills every day. No one knows what they are for in the community, but they don't care. That's because the pills control their feelings. The people don't care about anything. Love or want to make a change in the community is ignored. Until the main character, Jonas, turns twelve, he doesn't realize what he needed to do.When anybody in the community turns twelve, they receive a job. Their job is chosen for them. Jonas gets picked as a Receiver. The Receiver gets all the memory from the past (our time). When he learns about all he is missing out, he takes action. Trying to find a way out of sameness, Jonas learns sneaking out of the community isn't such a good idea."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\", by Lois Lowry, is a book that when finished causes the reader to really think about the society he lives in. Jonas, the main character, lives in a society where everything is perfect. Pain, disease, and any kind of suffering has been eradicated from society. Everything is in order; no one has any worries. Except for one person, The Giver. There is one person in this perfect society who carries the burden for each and every individual. This is the person with all of the memories since the begining of time. The Giver has memories of famine, war, sickness, poverty, and many more indescribable memories especially the abortion-like process which is happening in the society. However, The Giver also has every good memory since the beginning of time such as snow, springtime, love, and the ability to smell and see color. Jonas has been chosen to be the next Receiver of Memory for the society. Along with many memories Jonas is fond of, he receives the memory of what is done to the babies after they are born if the family already has too many children. This utterly terrifies him and he plans to stop this act. When his mother brings home a baby, Caleb, and says that he will only be staying for a while, Jonas is devastated because he knows what is really happening. This profound memory and the drive to stop this horrible action takes Jonas on an journey that will change his life forever. This book shows us how important the flaws in our society are and unlikely we are to really like a perfect world. After reading this novel, the reader will have learned that a perfect world would require many sacrifices some are unwilling to give. HMJ"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a somewhat difficult book to understand, and there are a diversity of opinions that come after reading it. The tone of this novel was suspenseful. Readers want to keep reading; to find out what happens to Jonas next. The ending probably has the most opinions considering how it's not straight forward with what happens. Lois Lowry said that she wrote this ending so that readers could create their own ending. Some might think he made it Elsewhere, passed away or maybe even was dreaming. I, on the other hand, believe he was not dead but dying.The Giver is a novel some people don't plan on liking, but they are soon proven wrong the more into the book they get. This book is about a child, merely eleven years old, who lives in an immensely controlled society where there is no color, pain, emotion, poverty, crime or illness. Everything is meticulously planned and organized. Once one turns twelve, or becomes a Twelve, he or she is assigned an assignment, or job. Jonas, however, is assigned a very honored assignment in the community. He is assigned Receiver of Memory. Jonas was very apprehensive in the beginning, but the more into training he gets, the more he learns about the community. He discovers the secret of Release also. He decides he's tired of living in a world with no color or love, so he leaves, taking a new child, Gabe, with him.Jonas then leaves, taking the child scheduled for Release come morning. He leaves taking his life, his memories, along with him until they fade off back to the place he once believed was home. They make it through sunshine, pouring rain and harsh snow. Do they really make it through the snow? As for Jonas, no. Gabe may live on, but in the end Jonas is dying. Some say before you die, your life flashes before your eyes. This is what is happening to Jonas, what he has left of his memories he can see; the house, family, lights, color and love. His memories were his life, and he sees them before he dies. Yet, he heard something, something he knew to be music. The Giver never gave him any memory of music, but he can hear it. Jonas is now hearing beyond. The Giver did it, and now Jonas is too. Passing away must have lead him to finally doing so. All in all, The Giver is a suspenseful novel that keeps people reading with an interesting twist in the end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a boy named Jonas. He lives in a town that's really scary.- Docotrs give everyone a pill when they start to get \\"Love feelings\\"- They have people called \\"Birthmothers\\" that have kids.- No one can see color- When twins are born, the lightest one is given a shot to die and then thrown out. (There can't be doubles in a boring town like this)Well, anyway, I read this book last year in my 7th grade class. About 160+ pages.\\"The Giver\\" is the dude who teaches Jonas to see color.Ok, I know it sounds boring, but IT'S NOT! It's a page turner. :) Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Just wanted to add my perspective as a mom. Save this book for older children (grade 8 and above) due to content, and because they'll get more out of it. This book appeals equally to adults, and to anyone who enjoys reading about societies that are different from ours (whether futuristic or contemporary). Read it before your children do, and then talk about how this society differs from ours - the pros and the cons, and their reasons for their opinions. My children and I have had some wonderful discussions about what our \\"ideal\\" society would be, what they think their assigned job would be when they turned 12 if they lived in Jonah's world, as well as the reality of being \\"released\\" and its similarities to the Holocaust, and more. Hopefully reading this book together will result in even more interesting discussions with your own children. If your children enjoyed this, they may also enjoy Among the Hidden, by Margaret Haddix."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In The Giver, the world is a dystopia where people live apparently in harmony and sameness. The irony in the normalcy is that although there is no war, hatred, or fear, this community is also devoid of feeling, emotion, color or love. People, although polite, are well-trained mechanisms that live each tradition year to year, and each duty day to day that there is almost too much structure and organization. However, because society has been trained so well to their duty, they don't realize this, and go about each day with perfect tranquility and contentment. During the \\"Twelve Year\\", each member of society is given their role, their job; something that the \\"observers\\" believe fits them best. Jonas, the main protagonist, anxiously waits for this day to arrive in December, wondering what role will be chosen for him. When this day arrives, Jonas learns that his new job is that of Receiver of Memory, a rare role chosen only to an honored few. He, like other kids who are twelve, is given his instructions; he meets and is trained by an old man known as The Giver. The Giver, who is current holder of memories, slowly but surely opens Jonas' eyes to many forms of past memories. As Jonas learns more and more about the pain and humanness associated with receiving these memories, he begins to question the way society operates. He becomes cognizant of emotion (pain, happiness, hopefulness, family love) that he cannot express to others, such as his family or friends, and as time wears on, this seems to leave a void in his life. The Giver wants to prepare Jonas for his new role effectively because the last receiver of memories had to be \\"released\\" because she could not accept her role. Jonas, to his horror, begins to find that there are dark secrets about this community his lives in; he wonders if there is a way to change life. Jonas experiences a series of dilemmas, which encompasses the narrative in the book's final part: How can he change this world? What will he do to transfer these memories to the people? Is there anything beyond this world, to the world of Elsewhere? What can he do to break from the restraints of this community?The Giver, although marketed as a young adult novel, deals with heavy issues, and so, might not be appropriate for younger kids. However, I second the notion (one reviewer had brought this up) that this should be required reading in secondary school. Students complain often about \\"classics\\" as being \\"boring\\" or irrelevant to their world; this is a book that is relevant to them and would probably engage them. Lowry's novel has sophisticated, deep issues (such as our societal response to apathy, the dangers of conformity, the significance of emotion and hope and individuality) and it would profit a younger audience to form their own opinions of the issues.I had heard so much about this novel, and am glad I finally got around to reading it. Lowry's writing style is quite engaging, as she pulls you in to empathize with the characters and their major conflicts. You find yourself pulling for Jonas as he learns more and more about how different life could be with memories, hope and emotion. He separates himself from the Sameness that the community offers, and tries to find out something deeper. Over all, this is a wonderful book, and I'm looking forward to trying some of the other books in this series, Gathering Blue and The Messenger.The Giver is a very satisfying read. Definitely Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a world with no pain, no fear, no love, no happiness, a world without feelings. When a child turns 12 he/she is assigned a job. When you grow to old too be in the community you are released. Everything is controlled, all choices are made for you. At Jonas' year 12 ceremony he is signaled out to receive special training from the Giver, therefore becoming the new Receiver, keeper of all memories. Jonas is given many memories some of which are: the memory of pain, of fear, of weather, of love, of happiness. Jonas slowly begins to realize that the community he lives in is unfair. No one has actual feelings. Compared to Jonas and his newly acquired feelings, everyone seems like robots. Jonas wants the rest of the community to have feelings too, to have freedom, to truly experience life as Jonas knows it is supposed to be lived. Jonas knows the world he lives in is wrong, but can he change it? Very unlikely.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves science fiction or books about the future. The Giver isn't a difficult read, you just have to read between the lines, and the whole concept can be hard to grasp. This is a truly amazing book, lots of action, detail, and suspense. The 4/5 grade class that I'm in read this book as a book club book, so it's appropriate for 4th graders. The only less \\"age appropriate\\" parts are when Jonas is bathing a naked old woman and when he has a dream caused by the stirrings (puberty), but even those parts really aren't bad. The Giver really makes you think about the world we live in today, how fortunate, and unfortunate we really are. How our world is controlled. Even if you do not like the plot outline, I would still recommend this book, it is a very short read, why not give it a shot?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've waited a few weeks before reviewing Lois Lowry's Newbery Award-winning book, The Giver, because my first inclination is to say: read it. It's awesome. The end. I am not a big reader of science fiction, although on the off chances I do read the genre, I usually find myself enjoying it. One reason I fear I don't venture into science fiction too often is that it's hard to read reviews about the books without learning too much about them, and I like to know as little as possible going into books. With that in mind, I'll try to review this brilliant book giving away as few details as possible.The Giver is told from the point-of-view of Jonas, an almost-twelve-year-old boy. As the story unfolds, it becomes more and clear Jonas lives in a very different world than we do. Details of when and where are scarce, as it is all Jonas knows. The reader is along for the ride as Jonas learns more and more about the community he lives in.One of the things I've loved most about my immersion into children's literature this semester has been the coming of age story. I don't think it's a coincidence so many narrators of children's books; it's the magical age of intellectual awakening it seems. Jonas is a great narrator. He's thoughtful, kind, and increasingly skeptical. Lowry does a marvelous job of telling the story through Jonas's eyes but leaving clues for the reader to pick up on before even Jonas himself does. This layering of knowledge provides suspense on two levels: the reader wonders what really is going on in this strange world and when and if Jonas will fully realize it as well.I cannot recommend The Giver highly enough. It's a fascinating novel, and although it's intended for upper-elementary students, it's appropriate for teenagers and adults too.(Yes, I also realize most everyone with even a passing interest in children's literature read this novel fifteen years ago, and I am ridiculously late to praise it, but I am anyway)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was loaned to me by a friend and I loved it.

This book is absolutely a must-read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Very enjoyable book fast paced and interesting well written, found it very difficult to put it down. Story is set in a futuristic society where 'sameness' has been favoured in terms of individuality but as a result there is littl place for deep feelings such as compassion and empathy and for those who don't fit or are surplus to requirement....."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Before there was The Hunger Games, or the world of new Young Adult genre selections we often see today with beautiful and appealing covers that enthralls our imagination and tends to our emotions, there was The Giver. It has been a book of its own caliber. One that tends to the human spirit and intellect with a sophisticated approach to society and the individual. If you read this book in childhood, it will stay with you for the rest of your life. If you read this book in adulthood, it will blow your whole view of life wide open.As one of the Newbery Medal Award winners for the most oustanding contribution to children's literature, the author deserves some mention. Lois Lowry is absolutely one of those writers of simple genius, a seemingly effortless genius. This is what she says about the book (from Random House Website).\\"I will say that the whole concept of memory is one that interests me a great deal. I'm not sure why that is, but I've always been fascinated by the thought of what memory is and what it does and how it works and what we learn from it. And so I think probably that interest of my own and that particular subject was the origin, one of many, of The Giver.\\"A seemingly utopian society for the purpose of the greater good. Every year is significantly structured to promote the appropriate and standardized growth of each child. At the age of twelve, all children are given their 'adult' places/careers/duties in society. They are taught that questioning and having existential wonderings are 'stirrings,' and should be treated by the use of pills. Their lives are built around the concept of conformation. Conform or be 'appealed.' Mostly everything becomes an automatic and possibly even meaningless gesture.This book is about Jonas's journey through this society. All events in the book matter, and every page is significant to the transformation of the story. At twelve, Jonas is chosen with the responsibility of being the new Receiver of Memory. How does one bear the burden of memory of the whole human experience? The agony of war. Disease. Loss and pain. Even the heights of human existence: human acheivement, freedom, music, color, and the power of love. He, alone, keeps these memories on behalf of his community. He isn't to share them with a single person. The reason being that no-one, supposedly, wants to experience the whole range of human emotion. Additionally, this limitation on the society as a whole means that if people cannot remember things then they cannot remember the pain that comes with life as well, holding people in ignorant bliss.The ending felt much like being vaguely abandoned. There is a sense of ambiguity about the ending when you get to it. The Giver is the first in the series of three book, the second being Gathering Blue and the third being The Messenger. Just with any series, the placement of such a vaguely placed ending probably is meant to lead us into the next books in the series for us to find out more. Here is a word from the author about the end, for she knows best why that was accomplished in that way, and it will probably put things into perspective for you, the read, as to how to approach the end the way Lois Lowry might have intended it.\\"Many kids want a more specific ending to The Giver. Some write, or ask me when they see me, to spell it out exactly. And I don't do that. And the reason is because The Giver is many things to many different people. People bring to it their own complicated sense of beliefs and hopes and dreams and fears and all of that. So I don't want to put my own feelings into it, my own beliefs, and ruin that for people who create their own endings in their minds.\\"I have my own personal relationship to this book, and it has become a strong part of me. It's made its mark on me. It's truly one of those book you have to read in your lifetime. I absolutely loved it. I will be coming back to it throughout life, it's just one of those timeless books for both children and adults."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"THE GIVER hardly needs commentary from me. It's been praised up one-side and down another. And yet I'm going to write a few more words.Lowry's writing in this book is delightful. Her tone is calm and her word and grammar choice are simple, almost childish, which fits the principle character who is only 11 at the beginning of this book. And yet it's the soft, light tone --which never changes as the story unfolds-- that makes the horror of the tale all the more real, all the more poignant when juxtaposed against the community's gentle nature.The Giver is written at the 5.7 AR level.

There's no direct violence or bad language.Recommend.Pam T~mom/kidlit-YA blogger"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This novel is for anyone who wishes for a perfect world.

As one of the 100 most frequently banned books in the U.S., it may not be appropriate for children and young teens, but the messages of individuality and freedom make it a worthwhile read. The book's aesthetic appeal is limited, probably because it was written to be understood by a young audience. If your favorite books include Orwell's 1984, Bradbury's Farenheit 451 or Rand's Anthem, you will probably appreciate The Giver, although it lacks the depth and dimensions of those great novels."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lowry's books have been sending me to new worlds since I was very young and first picked up her Anastasia series. Now, as a first year English teacher, her books are always on the top of my list as recommendations for my students. The Giver is no different. Lowry's simple style of writing is easy to read, yet it pulls you in completely. The Giver focuses on Jonas, a twelve year old boy who makes a tough decision concerning his future in &quot;the community.&quot; Reminding the reader of certain elements of Anthem (Rand) and The Handmaid's Tale (Atwood), Lowry spins a tale of forgiveness and self-discovery.

Children from the ages of 11-15 have an easy time relating to this book and get drawn in to the amazing situations in it.

Jonas never had to deal with pain or feelings. Everything so awful in our world was taken out of Jonas's, but everything was still missing from the lives of his community.

This is one of very few books where you don't need a sequel to know how the story ends.A REAL PAGE TURNER"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this is an utterly cold novel about social acceptance and what it means to be socialy unacceptable"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My first introduction to Lowry will definately cause me to seek her out again. A book assigned to my 13-year-old daughter, I picked it up and was provoked with the profound simplicity of her story. Jonas lives in a perfect, black-and-white utopian hell from which escape is impossible -- unless you're the Receiver who learns the terrible price of such perfect peace and harmony. Many a long and deep discussion with your children can come from reading this marvelous parable. There is one scene in the book, a very disturbing one, which, in the words of my daughter, &quot;will blow you away.&quot;Highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In The Giver, the world has been removed of all things thatwould cause grief or sadness in any way. As a result,all things which bring happiness are also removed. Forexample, motherhood is reduced to a science where parentsare genetically picked.

Memoriescause pain as well, so they are removed from the people'sminds. Pills are taken to supress sexual feelings. Everyoneis happy.

This book captivated our teenagers, along withour younger ten-year-old.

It is slightly disturbing. In A Wrinkle in Time, Madeleine L'Engle shows us a world where &quot;IT&quot; controls the mind of every inhabitant; deprived of any individuality, they have perfect social harmony. Lying somewhere between the two, the distopic world of The Giver is utterly terrifying. We slowly come to realize the extent of the individuality that the people have relinquished; seeing color, hearing music, remembering or feeling emotion are too disturbing; those who will not fit in are selected out of society (in one horrifying scene, we become vividly aware of what this means for the socially unacceptable). Emotion, being too ingrained in the human species to simply breed out, is controlled by drug. There is no IT controlling the natural rhythm of life; there is the pretense of normality and family life, so our young protagonist slowly becomes aware of the depravity of his society. In the end, the message is clear: what we see, and feel, and touch in life is infinitely more valuable than a social &quot;order&quot; achieved by denying the richness and diversity of the individuals who make up that society.

This is a pity because, speaking as a 51-year-old man who also is an avid reader, adults could learn a lot from this small, thought-provoking book. Granted, the prose are not very colorful, but the story moves along at a brisk pace and, at a mere 179 pages, even people who rarely open a book should be able to make it to the end. I read Ms. Lowry's work because my 13-year-old son's 8th-grade, English class was assigned it. I was very pleased to know this excellent book was part of their curriculum. It's a great, yet somewhat downbeat, story to help kids as well as adults think outside their limited purviews. Well done."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was read to my class in the 6th grade (1996-ish). I absolutely remembered nothing of it other than the fact that I liked it.Reading it 15 years or so later I still remember nothing of it except that same fact - I like it.The story follows Jonas into his twelfth year - the age at which future jobs / endeavors are prescribed by this apparently utopian society. At each age something is given, life is perfect the family is composed of mother, father and up to two children - at request. Food is abundant, the concept of \`death' is non-existent, many things are hidden or circumvented in awkward terms...Jonas is selected for a very prestigious role - he is to be the \`Receiver'. For there to be a receiver there must, by nature of implication, be a \`Giver'.The Giver is the holder of the societies body of knowledge. He's much akin to an encyclopedia with the addition of the feeling, the aura-glow of those memories which are possessed within...He is boundless, he possesses pleasure, pain, war, hate, love... every emotionally straining & uplifting event that has ever happened in the history of civilization. While he holds these the community cannot experience any of them - however, because apathy is the status quo, the lack of feeling doesn't interfere with \`normal' life....

The plot is intricate, interesting and full of surprises as you discover the main character and the odd world he lives in. The ending does leave questions unanswered but that's the beauty of it.

A little tid bit is released for the reader to knaw on at great length, and before you know it you can really start to reflect on the whole picture and spend a great deal of time just doing that. i think it is the perfect book for kids to reflect on their own ideas of a utopian society, which also asks children to critically think way beyond the comprehension of Lowry's text. I can't say enough about the richness of the text. As an artist and one who appreciates all facets of the Humanities, I couldn't stop thinking about Lowry's created world.With regards to the Illustrations, I was reluctant to pick up this book because the pictures in my mind were so very clearly illustrated and I didn't want them compromised by some other depiction. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not overly illustrate. The illustrations were fantastic.One of my favorite fellow teachers suggested I read this book, and I thought it's a kids book how good could it possibly be. This book floored me and started my quest to read more Newbery Award Winning Books, and I have to say that I love a good 70% of the recognized Newbery Award and Honor Books. After reading a hundred or so of these types of books, The Giver always remains in the top 5 of all time for me.

The Giver challenges us to see the beauty that we take for granted and lets the reader discover it without feeding it to them. A must read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am sad to say that I have never read this book in all my 32 years until now. I am so glad that I did- and have heartily and honestly recommened to everyone I have met- it is stunning.Lowry has created a future that exists just outside the realm of possibility with its edge of magic, but also sits firmly in possibility with its ideals, operations, and view of \\"sameness\\" that permeates the book. Her writing is fresh, flows well, and carries the reader along at an amazing pace that builds tension well and guide the reader at the same time. We discover secrets, lies, half truths, and painful realities at the same rate as the protagonist, Jonas- and in doing so, we bond with him, share his sadness and feel his burdens as well.The hallmark of a great book is one that makes you forget yourself and instead you become absorbed in the story- \\"The Giver\\" does all of that- and in such a way as to be satisfying and mysterious at the same time.While the subject matter has been challenged, banned, and even demonized- the book is powerful and deserves to be read on those merits alone. While it could be a harsh warning, character piece, or even just a light bit of sci-fi story telling, it is a timely book that will (hopefully) make one look at the world around them and see what is important, beautiful, special, and necessary in being different, being human, feeling emotion, and experiencing life.I recommend this book to everyone and really feel that it is a masterpiece of modern literature. The hardcover is on order, and will sit firmly on my \\"must read\\" shelf permanetly. I want to let the story sink in and percolate a bit- but I can't wait to read it again. What an amazing, stunning, and overall satisfying piece of fiction. One of the BEST books I have ever read.*NOTE: there are some scenes in the book that are difficult, but necessary in the revelations of the society and its rules. Be warned that they might be hard to handle.*"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have always loved this novel--in fact, I would easily call it my favorite of all time. Lowry paces it perfectly--and it meaningfully displays the need for opposition--all good things do come with bad. If there was no sorrow, than nobody would have anything to compare happiness to--and happiness therefore becomes obsolete. If there was no happiness, there would be nothing to compare sorrow to--and no one would ever learn or develop from their mistakes. Lowry's message remains clear throughout the novel, and she shows that message wonderfully in The Giver.Francis Bacon once said, \\"Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, but only a few are to be chewed and digested.\\" Digest this one, it's an incredible book that deserves its Newbery Award."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's novel &quot;The Giver&quot; was written in 1994.

But this year in the 10th grade I felt a need to read it again, and I suppose because I am older,the book has gained an even more cherished place within me for it. This book centers around a society that is totally planned out. Where you receive a position (job) to train for at the age of 12. And you must dress a certain way or you will immediatly get corrected. And an animal such as a hippo is nothing but an imaginary thing. Well that is exactly what a young boy named Jonas lived in for his whole life, and he to thought that his world was the way it had always been. Until he turned 12 and he started training for his position in society, which had been chosen for him. I wouldn't suggest that you find out much more about the plot, because it is 10 times more interesting to read about this book without little hints about what is going to happen. I have read comments about the ending being stupid, but I think that it represents that there is always hope (you will see what I mean when you read it)and that we can't live our lifes in dread of tomarrow, but in anticipation of the new things to learn about and achieve. These are the thought provoking things that this book has made me think about. You will truly experience this adventure along with Jonas, and it will make an impact on the way you look at the world that surrounds us.

During his training, performed by &quot;The Giver of Memory&quot;, Jonas finds out about dark secrets that underlie the apparent harmony of his world. And so he runs away. 'The Giver' won the prestigious Newbery Medal &quot;for most distinguished contribution to American literature for children&quot; and for 'The Giver' she also received other important awards such as &quot;The Boston Globe-Horn Book&quot; Honor Award. Lois Lowry uses the I-narrator (Jonas). She describes Jonas's feelings, what he thinks and sees, she describes the minor characters, the village and other things. And so you often think, that you are a part of the book. Lois Lowry delays the excitment, and so the story gets more and more interesting. But sometimes she delays the excitment for a too long time. She doesn't only use the monologue (which is done by Jonas), she even uses dialogues between the different charaters, so that you can get what the other charaters think about important points.

It's just one of those things, I think, kind of what my sister calls such things: \\"It is what it is.\\"I take my lunch most days and eat in the library where I work. Twenty minutes of quiet time. I always take whatever book I am currently reading. One day I forgot. No way am I going to just sit there, so, aha, what book catches my eye? It's time I say.The Giver by Lois Lowry won the Newbery Award in 1994. That means it was voted Best Book in older children's literature for that year. Devil's Advocate that I am, I always want to know what books were in contention, the Honor Books. They are Crazy Lady by Jane Leslie Conly, Eleanor Roosevelt: A Life of Discovery by Russell Freedman, and Dragon's Gate by Laurence Yep, all worthy choices.So, The Giver. Set in a nameless community in an unidentified future, the story is about a utopian society or seemingly, depending on whose opinion is being solicited. No hunger, no domestic violence, no deformities or disabilities, no painful and lonely old age, really, basically no worries. To accompany those realities, no color, no variations, no differences, no choices. Ah, this utopia begins to look dystopian. Yes?No, of course not, why would you question? Choices, colors, differences have been removed. How can one question if one has no frame of reference? That's where the character of The Giver comes in. In this society children go through a naming ceremony when they reach the age of twelve. The main character, Jonas, has no idea what his future will hold. He has no particular interest in any particular field.During the ceremony Jonas is skipped over, only to be given his future at the very last. Receiver. Keeper of the community's Memory. Jonas will be the next Receiver, an assignment held with such reverence and awe that Jonas can hardly fathom that he is the one to be trained by the old Receiver, who will now become The Giver. Therein lies the rub.The Receiver is privy to all that has been erased from community memory: color, smells, bird twitter, tastes, things now controlled and wiped out of existence, such as snow, and sunshine, and forests. Things that make life interesting, but certainly unknowable. Things unpredictable. Love. Family. Yes, certainly, Jonas has a family of two parental units well-chosen for compatibility, one annoying sister (some things don't change), and a temporary baby.Jonas's dad is a Caregiver, meaning he takes care of babies. This particular baby shows signs of not adjusting--he cries when it's time to sleep, so Dad brings him home to socialize him. If this doesn't work, Dad will be required to \\"release\\" this baby. During Jonas's training, during the transfer of memory from the old Receiver, now called The Giver, to the young Receiver, Jonas begins to learn differences. Jonas in the belly of the whale.And a plan is formulated. There is a sequel.Newbery, yep, definitely."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book twice. The first time, I read it in one night, which I rarely do. The second time, I finished it in two nights. It's basically about a 12-year-old boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect world. There is no crime, no poverty, no illness. Everyone is happy and all is well. Then he and his friends are given their careers. Jonas gets the job of retaining memories of how things used to be--before the world became a perfect place to live. He visits an old man called \\"The Giver\\" who is the one who gives Jonas the memories. Over time, as Jonas receives these memories, his entire view of the world changes as he learns what is real and what he has been taught. For example, he starts to see color. Apparently, this peaceful, ideal world is in black and white. I thought this was a fantastic idea. Then Jonas stopped taking pills that he, his friends, and adults take. These pills inhibit sexual desire. In fact, no one has sex. There are birth mothers who carry babies and that is how the human race continues. Well, when Jonas stops taking these pills, he starts getting these desires, such as falling in love with his childhood girl friend. He also recalls pain, illness and war. So it's not all pleasant stuff that he's being taught.This book is actually more gloomy than books I typically read but the author did a terrific job of pulling me into Jonas' world and I had to keep wondering what was going to happen next. Some of it made me cry. *spoiler alert* He discovers that babies who aren't developing normally are euthanized and when the elderly reach a certain age, they are euthanized as well. But you see, the people in this world are told that the babies are going to another family and that the elderly are having a big party before they head off somewhere else. It is Jonas' love that develops for the baby his father brought home to nuture (because the baby wasn't developing normally--he had delays in his development) that leads Jonas to run away with the baby before the baby can be euthanized. Well, Jonas manages to escape with the baby and he's searching for the place where people will be like him (now that he's changed). The final thing Jonas experiences (after who knows how long he's been gone) is sledding down a hill at Christmas time and looking into the window of a house where a Christmas tree is hung and there is a fire in the fireplace and there's love and happiness. Then the author makes it clear that this is a memory that he dies remembering. Very sad. I still get teary when I remember it because I really wanted Jonas and the baby to make it.Now on the flip side, it wasn't a completely sad ending. When Jonas escaped, the memories he contained \\"leaked out\\" and the people began to remember these things as well. The book ends with the people coming to the Giver and wanting to know what to do about these memories, some good, some bad. The problem with the perfect world was that people lost their humanity. Even though pain is part of the human experience, good emotions are part of it too, and to give up the bad, they had to give up the good. Love and compassion seemed to be the thing these people needed the most, and at last, they will get it back."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is beautiful. I had to read it in middle school, and then read it again multiple times when I was in high school and college. I suggest it to anyone. It really makes you think and it is so easy to relate to the main character. The world portrayed by this author is so vivid! Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's The Giver has just made my top-ten list of favorite books. Although I am a senior in college, this is the first time I have ever delved into the intriguing world of The Giver, and I found it fascinating.The story revolves around a young boy named Jonas. Jonas has grown up in a supposedly perfect society where no one experiences pain or suffering and no one has to make their own choices. Everything about their lives is carefully controlled, from how they wear their hair, to their jobs within the community and their assigned spouses. At the beginning of the book, Jonas is about to become a twelve and receive his assignment within the community. Jonas learns that he has been selected to be the new receiver of memories. The giver is the man who currently holds those memories, and he begins to give some of those memories to Jonas. As Jonas receives these memories, he learns of a long forgotten world, a world full of pain, full of sorrow, full of color, full of joy and full of love. It is as he begins to learn about things such as sunshine, war, holidays, and family that he begins to realize what is missing from the society he lives in--depth of feeling and the ability to make choices for oneself. Jonas struggles as he tries to adjust his new knowledge in to the perfectly ordered society that he lives in. And the more he thinks about how things were, and how they could be, the more he begins to wonder if things can change.I gave this book five stars for two reasons. Number one, as a life-long lover of books, I particularly enjoy reading a story that is very unique, even for its genre. Although one could argue that The Giver is similar to other dystopian novels such as 1984 or Anthem, I thought that Lowry's approach was quite original. The second reason that I loved this book is because it was thought provoking. It truly made me ponder the importance of choice, the necessity of experiencing pain and sorrow to understand true joy, and the significance of feeling and being loved. Unlike other dystopian novels, this book didn't seem to be a political statement or a warning of what society could become, but rather just a story that raises questions about what is most important, and what a perfect society truly is."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have read The Giver 4 times--twice to myself and two other times to other people. This is one of those books that should be read more than once, just because of all the information in it. The Giver starts off slow, and migh deter some younger readers, but once it gets a few chapters in it becomes very intriuging and thought provoking. This is a wonderful book for young kids to first realize and understand the freedoms and other important things we have in our world today. This also teaches that sometimes living through the bad in life is worth it to get the good. I really cannot say enough about this book. It is simply excellent."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book, to me, was just brilliant. I love the idea of another time and society, which were expressed so originally in this story. Rules, safety, everything made for what could have been a perfect society. But it is what lies beneath these things, what they choose to cover up, that makes the story really interested.Jonas, at twelve, grows up way too fast. It is traditional for twelve year olds of his society to be an adult at 12, but Jonas is the only one who truly experiences any real growth.Given the choice to protect the world they live in or unleash everything unknown, he has a powerful choice to make, and does so accordingly.This book gripped me right up until the end, which was the only slight let-down. While the end was good, it wasn't great, as the rest of the book was. But overall, I highly recommend this book to everyone. An instant classic."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book the first time as an adult (late 20's). I remember it was a popular summer reading book back when I was in school. Everyone I know who has read it said it was good, so I figured I'd give it a shot.From the very first chapter, it had a spooky, ominous feel to it. It was a bit confusing during the first chapter, because it's set in a different world, and even a futuristic setting. The author quickly explains everything you need to know to understand this new world, but it doesn't make it any less strange. It reminded me a lot of \\"1984\\" to give you an idea.The last 10 chapters or so I was not able to pull myself away. It was a good read, don't get me wrong, but it was more of a morbid fascination that kept me glued to it. I could not believe what I was reading. It's horrifying not only to reading about the kind of world that was presented in the book, but to see aspects of it in the real world. It leaves you thinking (just as \\"1984\\" did): \\"Wow, this could actually happen someday if we continued down this path\\".It left me feeling very unsettled after I finished reading the book, and that feeling continued with me until the next day. People I've talked to that read it in high school told me that the book always stays with you like that. Not to mention, I finished it right before going to sleep that night, so I was left with some pretty odd dreams and an overall restless night.When I first finished, I disliked the ending, but after sitting with it on my mind for awhile, I have a better understanding of why she chose to end it that way.I remember this book being on my 5th grade reading list, but I feel some of the themes are a bit mature for someone that young. I'd say it was better for 15 and older. It just contained too many mature situations, death of a baby, for one. And the author was pretty descriptive.It was a book that I equally loved and hated. I loved the writing style, and the overall idea. It was a quick read, with no slow points to speak of. Her descriptions were amazing - very detailed. As the reader, you could really picture what she was describing. The characters that needed to be 3-D were, and there were some that needed to be less developed, and it went along with the premise of the story. I also hated the world she created because it scared me so much and it was just horrible.I recommend that everyone should read this book. It serves as a warning of what may become (\\"sameness\\",etc) if we continue on the same path. Don't let the \\"young adult\\" label stop you from reading it, it's a must-read for adults too."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Eleven-year-old Jonas is a typical boy living in a futuristic world of mediocrity. Even the geography, (completely flat) and the color scheme (only black and white) are bland. The elder of two children (all that is allowed per family unit), he attends school and enjoys the company of friends like any other kid. But in his town, everyone's behavior is closely monitored, Big Brother-like, with physical punishment meted out for infractions of its many rules. The community gains 50 babies per year and at prescribed ages, persons are given certain freedoms and/or responsibilities (for example, bicycles are given to nine year olds). Once a family's children move away, former parents (babies seem to be born in vitro) move out of their homes and in with others in the same situation until their eventual move to the nursing home and, finally, \\"release.\\"Jonas's life changes drastically when he is given his life job assignment, the most respected of the lot, Receiver (of memories). During his training, he gains the freedom of being allowed to ask any question of any person, but is unable to share his newfound knowledge with family and friends. He sees and feels the formerly unimaginable, love, hate, joy and sorrow, and, for the first time, experiences color. He also learns the truth about the procedure known as \\"release.\\" Author Lois Lowry has created a simply written, amazing book with a memorable plot and engaging characters in this story about social conformity. Of the Newberry Award winners I've read, The Giver is my favorite. Similar science fiction: Feed by M.T. Anderson, The House of the Scorpion by Nancy Farmer, and Fearless by Tim Lott."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is, at least in part, a cautionary tale, in the tradition of Brave New World and 1984, about the danger of allowing ourselves and our government to continue slouching toward paternalistic statism. The difference between it and those older and better known stories of dystopic societies is that this one is written for kids.I found the book to be well written, well paced, and of a length that won't scare off tweens and teens. The development of Jonah was quite well done within the constraints of such a short book (171 pages in the paperback edition I read); he was likable and sufficiently flawed so as to be believable. As for the other characters (excepting The Giver), their lack of development is one of the points.The Giver does a fine job of giving the reader food for thought and discussion about the inverse relationship between individual liberty and the imposition of outcomes by governments and communities. It's not a one-sided account on that score, however. I often found myself being seduced by the security, safety, and civility that accompanied the depicted totalitarian society. As is typical of good fiction that tells some significant truth, that balance allows the reader to come to a conclusion through seeking and thinking as opposed to having it thrust down his throat; that makes the The Giver's case against soft fascism a strong one.I do find it a delicious irony that the education establishment, a great friend to the statist movement, has embraced this book.Some have complained that the book contains some logical inconsistencies. I thought those were minor and they didn't significantly detract from my enjoyment of the book.There are some mature themes that some parents won't be comfortable with their kids reading about. These include infanticide and senicide, capital punishment for crimes far short of murder and rape, and some fairly oblique sexual themes."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois LowryScience FictionIf you like books about the future, you would like The Giver. It is a goodbook because it gets the reader caring for the characters. It also gives a feeling of adventure and action. The book is a very sad one because everyone is almost the same, and if they break the rules three times they have to die. This book has many feelings; it has love, anger, sadness, happiness, and pain. Lois Lowry did a good job of making you feel like you're in the story, but while you're in the story, you feel helpless. The story is about a boy named Jonas who gets a job as the new Receiver. The job of the Receiver is to keep memories for the community. While in training he learns about death, pain, and that his people are doing wrong things. So Jonas and a man called the Giver make a plan to secretly stop the community. It is hard for Jonas at first but, in the end ... sorry can't tell you that. If you like books about feelings and science fiction than this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"SynopsisThe Giver is a captivating story that takes place in the future in a perfect society -no pain, no crime, no unhappiness, no sickness. Jonas, the main character, is eleven years old at the beginning of the novel. He is \\"apprehensive\\" for the Ceremony of Twelve. This is when Jonas will receive his assignment that will be a significant factor for the remainder of his life. Jonas is stunned to find out that he was selected to become the new Receiver. He is given private training from the Giver, who holds the memories of what past. These memories include color, cold and snow, war, and family life of the past. Once the Giver transmits these memories to Jonas, they belong to him. Overtime, Jonas comes to understand and detest the perfect world he lives in. Together, the Giver and Jonas come up with a plan to change how their community works. However, before they carry it out, Jonas is forced to make a frightful decision.EvaluationThe Giver is a thought-provoking book about a fictional futuristic society. This book is told from a third-person-limited point of view. The fast-pace chapters and clever writing make this remarkable book a page turner. The characters are three-dimensional and their actions are surprising and at times frightening. Lowry does an excellent job in portraying the themes of \\"balancing the values of freedom and security\\" (Flowers, 1993). In this world of \\"sameness\\" there is no differentiation of human rights and choices of freedom. Everything is controlled from family units, jobs, and emotions. The cliffhanger ending leaves readers wondering and questioning what really happens to Jonas. After reading this book students ages 9 through 12 will have a greater appreciation of the freedom of choice which they have and the importance of having the opportunity to learn from the knowledge of the past. There is much controversy and criticism of this book and its themes. Some possible concerns are that there are mild sexual references and a scene where Jonas witnesses his father euthanizing a baby by injecting it with a needle in the head. Although The Giver won the Newbery Medal in 1994 and is used in many middle schools, it does appear on many banned book lists. If you enjoy this book don't miss out on Lowry's Gathering Blue (2000) and Messenger (2004), two other books set in this same futuristic setting.ReferencesFlowers, A. (1993). The Giver.

Everyone just does their jobs and goes home. Then their meals are delivered to them. All the people are safe, and they are all happy.I really liked this book.I just wanted to read and read. It was really interesting how they lived and what kind of jobs they had. I really like that at the endit leaves you to wounder what might happen to Jonas."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In his community of so-called \\"perfection,\\" Jonas discovers many faults and disadvantages. First, he's scared to leave his community, scared of what lies beyond the walls, but when he finds out the truth he can't wait to get out!This is a very exciting, mysterious, heart-warming book that I just couldn't stand putting it down. Honestly, I don't like to read, but this book was amazing...between the stirrings, the memories, realease, and everything in between, you'll be drawn into this book, just like Jonas's pale eyes. Lois Lowry allows you to come into Jonas's world, experience the true meaning, then lets your imagination run free at the end leaving you with suspense and wondering mind."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was really good and taught a lot of lessons, but not a book I would read and read again. To me it is a one, maybe two, time read. It keeps you wanting to read, but there are not cliff hangers on the end of most chapters. Jonas learns many things along his journey and fights for what he believes in to help the others of his community. He wants to be different, not the same as everyone else, and wishes everyone else could, too. Jonas longs for true feelings and individuality, though he can not completely solve this on his own. I enjoyed reading this book and encourage others to read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was one of my favorites. I don't like to read very much, but I just wanted to sit down and read the whole book. It caught my attention and wouldn't let go. Lois Lowry lets you come up with the ending which was one of my favorite things. The Giver is about a boy who becomes the Receiver, and finds out what his community was like before Sameness. He receives memories of the past and does not like what the community is all about. The Giver is about a long journey to make the community what it was in the past. THat means getting rid of Sameness."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This twist of fiction, fantasy, and human nature is one of my favorite books for those reasons. Jonas, the main character, has to abide to the rules of elders who dwell in his community, Receiver of Memory. Along his way, he encounters a strange thing that he personally has never expierienced. He also expieriences love, courage, danger, and hope, all in the eyes of a baby."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"How would living in a flawless world of sameness feel like? In Jonas's mind it is a perfect place. No pain. No secrets. No war. It is just as if living a dream. Everyone has a role in the community and is placed in training at the age of twelve. Each year prior to twelve, there are ceremonies. For example, at the age of nine, the child receives their first bicycle. Then at age seven and eight, sweaters are given to teach the child how to put it on and eventually how to button it. Every one of these gifts is meant to teach proper life skills for the future.Well, it is time for Jonas's twelve ceremony. Everyone is excited to see the jobs chosen for each child. As he stands nervously awaiting the announcement of his name, the announcer mysteriously skips his name and moves on to the next. Come to find out, he is chosen for the most difficult and rarest job in the community, to be the next Giver. So, later he begins his training. Jonas works with the Giver and finds out about what the world was like in the past. The Giver tells him that nobody has feelings or emotions, that the only one who can hold the memories and pain of the entire community is Jonas.By transmitting the memories to Jonas, he experiences life like no other. At first it is true pleasure feeling the warmth of the sun melting over head. Then the brutal bloody scenes of war approached. Jonas starts to see that sameness is not good. His friends don't understand why he acts out against them when playing a game of war. They're curious about what is happening to him and his odd behavior. When it is just too much for the Giver and him to take, they devise a plan. Will Jonas make it out of the sameness community? Or will they track him down and have him punished?The Giver is probably a science fiction combination futuristic novel. This book has a very good sense of creativity and suspense. The only weakness is the ending. It does not imply much about what is to happen next. Lois Lowry's writing style is phenomenal because of the excellent detailing work and all around eagerness. I would recommend this novel to ages 12+ only because of the vocabulary and understanding of it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"You can compare this book with an (interesting) school lesson, it is interesting and you learn that our world is better than their community."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"For us, the book \\"the giver\\" is written very well because the characters are well defined.

There is imagination that inspired me appreciating my life in reality. Although I don't really like the ending, I do enjoy the atmosphere that Lois Lowry created throughout the book. The first impression I have for this book is &quot;incomprehensible&quot;. But the more I tried to experience how Jonas feels, the more I enjoyed the new world that was so unfamiliar to me. However, I think that the imaginary world created by Lois Lowry is probably the &quot;ideal&quot; that we human beings wish to have. In the mean time, people do not actually think of the consequences while they're trying to better our society. Learning from the history, communism was the &quot;ideal&quot; for most of the people in the 19th century world-full of disciplines, rules, and regulations. The government (the House of the Old) has the greatest power controlling over people and everyone is divided into assigned units and groups. People are not allowed to read in order to prevent people from learning from the past. There is no individual because they dare to develop human weaknesses-emotions. People's futures are decided by the elders in the community rather by self-willingness. Everyone lives in the same living entity instead of being unique and enjoying the freedom. Although all the arrangements probably would be the best way for all people-without pain, sadness, and worries, I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't be the best way for happy lives."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was intrigued by the description of this story, and when I started reading it, I got caught up in it fairly quickly. But then I started feeling like some of it wasn't explained very well. A story like this, which is obviously far-fetched, should have everything explained...but instead, much of it went without ever being clarified. For example, how can a community stop people from seeing color? How could they control the climate without some sort of border? How could they prevent other people from coming in? None of it was given any thought or explanation and it drove me crazy!I also HATED the ending. I got close and even commented to my husband that it was getting really good. And then bam, it was over. I agree with another post that said it seemed like the author got bored with writing the story and just decided to end it.I thought the idea behind the story was excellent and it would have made a really interesting read, but it simply wasn't developed enough. Disappointing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book because a young adult friend of mine recently started a philosophical discussion using it as a springboard. I was immediately disappointed in the overly simplistic way in which the author puts together her ideas. However, it was a quick read and I was able to finish it easily within a couple of days. It was a stark contrast to the book by a Japanese author which I had just finished reading.Obviously, a person who writes this sort of book has an agenda to comment on her society - to warn about trends that she sees afoot, and to offer some ideas for potential solutions. That's what visual artists would call the \\"grand narrative.\\" I also imagine that there is a \\"lesser narrative\\" as well - that is to say it may be something of an allegory for some aspect of her own relationship to the world.I can see why this book spoke to the heart of my friend. I compare it to a similar book (and series) I read when I was young - the \\"White Mountains\\" by John Christopher (pen name for Samuel Youd). Certain very caring and smart young people who find that they don't really fit in, here in the culture of the USA, latch on to these kind of stories as being those which might possibly provide guidance for them as they seek to navigate their social problems. I just wish that the authors of such books would have more of a sense of nuance of the problems and possible solutions for these young people before they set pen to paper - that is, if they really are trying to serve the needs of that type of kid.I can see how Lois Lowry ticked off all the boxes when she was designing the plot of \\"the Giver\\" - she was careful to cater to all the preconceptions (prejudices) within the sensibilities of the American reader population. She even included a Christ-like figure in the book. Because of this practice, I feel the book ends up as a hollow and empty shell of what it could have been. The author does not seek to challenge her readers and share new insights, but instead her book becomes a perfectly resounding part of the echo chamber of the way that left-leaning American thinkers see the framework of the problems of society around them.However, I suppose this is exactly why it is popular, and why it has become an award winning novel. People will only devote the time to reading things which confirm what they already feel about how the world works.Children's novels need to use simple language, but there's no need for simplistic ideas. I would have also appreciated a more realistic character arc for Jonas. It's odd that his big decision to leave his community comes out of nowhere and becomes decided upon in his mind over the scope of three or four pages of the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is for children, not for teens or adults. It starts promising but there is just no ending. It goes nowhere. And therefore it was not worth reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas never knew that there was more out there. In the book The Giver by Lois Lowry, the main character Jonas lives in a totally controlled society, it is so controlled they can't even see color. In this story, the government controls everything. I do not like this book because it is written in a very formal style. Besides that, I think others might like this book because it is an interesting idea for a story.This book is about a boy named Jonas whose life is totally changed when he turns thirteen. He gets a very special job. Because of his job, he gets emotional. He can see colors and he can know the pain of the past. This job is unique because only one person is chosen for it. After a couple of months working he realizes what a terrible world he lives in and decides to go elsewhere to change his life.This book is written in a formal way that middle school kids might not understand. All the characters talk in a really stiff way. For instance, when Asher speaks angrily to Jonas, he then says \\"I apologize for not paying you the respect you deserve.\\" The language is hard to read, and this makes the book it confusing. There are common terms, like \\"released\\", that seem unfamiliar because they are used in a different way than I am used to. The type of dialogue the author uses makes the book hard to read.I would recommend this book for people who do not like action. This book is very slow. After I had read four two weeks, nothing had happened. I prefer book that are exiting like when you get into something right away. The story however had an interesting. Them that might interest some people.I seriously did not like this book. The dialog was confusing and it was incredibly slow. If there was a bit more action, I might have liked it.

This part of the ending was not good nor suprising. Also, I was unable to relate to the story. I could not picture myself as one of the characters. The details that the author left in the novel were unclear and vage. You had to guess for yourself what had happened. The author left bits and pieces of information, not answering the questions that came into your mind.

It tells the tale of life how so many of us wish it were like: perfect; no crime, no poverty. No sadness. Before reading it, our teacher asked us to describe our idea of a utopia in a paragraph. Everyone wrote of a crime and poverty free world (and of course there was the occasional mountain of icecream). Then she told us, what if you had to sacrifice something in return? Such as emotion? We didn't know how to return her question. Emotions are a wonderful thing that we have, but still... This book involves a world in which no one knows love, but lives without hate. When Jonas, a 12 year old boy is given the memories of when life wasn't so perfect, he decides to the fate of his world into his hands. A thrilling adventure that will leave your heart aching."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a remarkable story about a young boy who discovers a life totally different from his own.Jonas finally turned a 12 and was very anxious to find out what his role in the community would be. After much exessive worrying, he soon learns that he is to be trained as the new Reciever of Memory, one of the highest ranking jobs in his community.Throughout his many meetings with the Giver, he learns of a totally new world. Through the shared memories of the past he can longingly look apon a world with both love, sadness, pain, family, and feeling.But now, because of his new discovery, he looks apon his world with less and less favor. Shortly afterwards an opportunity arises for him to leave his solitary community and become a member of the new world. He is faced with a difficult decision.This is an extremly powerful novel through which the author expresses courage, love, and friendship. I can confidently recommend it to all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a novel I would recommend to any adolescent. It deals with issues that grip we, as people, from our adolesence through the rest of our lives. The issues discussed in this tale are issues that one will remember for the rest of one's life.Lois Lowry's masterpiece is one of the most interesting tales that I have ever read, as a youth, and as a young adult. The prose is fantastically written. It is definitely interesting enough to keep both adults and young adults glued to the pages.I will definitely read this book again and again. I have recommended it to my younger sisters, and I will recommend it to my own children some day.If you are looking for something to read after Harry Potter, perhaps this might interest you. I must admit, Harry Potter got my sisters to read, but this book captivated them in a way that I never saw Harry Potter do. [Now, it's my turn to read Harry Potter!]Read The Giver, you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois LowryHow would you feel if you never knew your mom, you couldn't see colors, and it never snowed, rained, or got hot? You might not like it, but the people of the Community never knew anything else. In the community, everyone is perfectly equal. There is no crime, no poverty, and everyone thinks that they are happy. When Jonas is assigned the job of Receiver of Memory in the Community, he learns more than he could have ever imagined existed. The Giver of the memories in this book is a rescuer, because he helps Jonas out of the lie that he had been living in. The Giver had to be brave and intellegent, or else he would not have his job as the person who held the memories of the Community. I think this is an important book to read because its message is that real happiness can not exist without some insecurity. The Giver is a great book becasue it makes you think. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading, and if you don't, read it anyway."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is an excellent book for readers of all ages. The plot and the themes work together beautifully to keep the reader both intrigued and guessing. You find yourself appreciating your own world and the things we so easily take for granted. The Giver shows us a world without feeling and without emotion, and one cannot help but think about ways in which our own world is also devoid of such basic necessities in life. This book will entertain, but also educate the reader about the ways in which society as a whole can so directly affect each one of us as individuals. I highly recommend this book to any reader above the age of 11."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I got this book from the library because my sister, who is only eleven, reccomended it to me. She said she enjoyed it, but obviously she couldn't have understood its true depth. I read this book in one afternoon, since it is short and the language simple, but it haunted me for days. This book made me so glad to be human; it made pain feel wonderful just because I could *feel*.The only word for it is spectacular. It made me cry when I found out about Rosemary, and I was ecstatic when Jonas took Gabe with him. The ending is a bit unclear, but I think it was meant to be that way. This book will never end, since we all have our own ideas about what will happen next. I love books that end that way, since they can just make me think for days on end. Some people have said that this book is sick, and not something they'd want their kids to read. I think that that's censorship, and isn't that something that this book talks about? In the book no one is allowed to read books, for fear that they might actually - gasp - think! By saying that you wouldn't want your kids to read this, aren't you doing the same thing? This book isn't sick, it just inspires contemplation. The plot is beautiful and at the same time frightening. I could spend years analyzing it, since it has to many different meanings. I found it terrifying, since Lois Lowry is clearly warning us about what might happen if people continue the way we're going: We long for perfection, but can there truly be a perfect world? I doubt it, since a &quot;perfect&quot; world would end individuality and rebellion.This book is wonderful, but it's not really suited for sixth-graders. If I were a teacher, I'd prefer to have ninth-graders study it, since I'm sure they would understand it much better. I'm thirteen, but I'm a bit ofa philosopher, and the other people in my grade who read this book didn't really grasp its true meaning.This is an amazing book. It may be a bit strange, but, all you people who say that it's sick and you'd never let your kids read it, have you even stopped to contemplate it? It's people like that who made Jonas's world the way it was. Think about it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a futuristic tale that demonstrates to the reader a possible approach to a utopian society. It clearly illustrates that the loss of freedom in such a society is a trade off for &quot;perfection.&quot; Creativity is a threat instead of valued. Longevity is inappropriate. Thinking is not allowed.This book is an outstanding tool for the individual reader and the middle school classroom. The projects and discussions are endlessly possible, completely the opposite of the existence of the people who populate this novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"For those who have ever felt like the world was missing akeyelement; for those who have felt special, The Giver is a book abouta young boy named Jonas who recieves the truth. The society in The Giver shelters its citizens. This book shows, through Jonas' relationship with the Giver, how humanity is meant to live. Rules and government that restrict feeling, whether they be positive or negetive, is harmfull to us."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i am glad i put time into reading this book. i have read it at least five times. there is such an irrelevant controversy over it. when there was an article about it in my newspaper, i wrote an article, not expecting it to be published. it ended up being published, jump-started my writing career. i highly reccomend this book. it is truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I give The Giver four stars because it is a great book, but the ending is one which I myself did not understand. The Author, Lois Lowry, obviously put a lot of thought into each individual character. When you read the book it is as though the characters are there around you. You can see them. They come alive in your mind. Jonas, is a young boy who does not see the world with the same eyes as us, for he has grown in a community different from those in which we grew. There nothing has great importance as they do to us. Then his life is changed in a way his fellow citizens can not understand. Everything in his life is different. As you read, you can feel the pain that Jonas feels. It is some of the best characterization I have ever read. The community in which Jonas lives in strangely different from ours. Lois Lowry brings the community to life. She explains in detail how the community does certain things to keep perfection. It is as though she is in this community writing what she sees and hears, yet this community does not exist in real life. She lets you see into the ways of the community. For example, each night at dinner a certain amount of food is given to each family. If the family does not eat it all at supper they must put it in a container and set it on their doorstep so that the city maintenance crew can pick it up. This is something new to the reader and Lois Lowry brings it to life. Love is something that the community does not have. The pills they are required to take stops all feeling. Yet, when Jonas stops taking the pill and works with the Giver, he knows what love , sadness, happiness and loneliness are. He is starved for feeling. He does not like the idea that the Community has been deprived of such things. He knows it needs to change. This book is truly one that show the characters feeling. I think that Lois Lowry put a lot of emotion into this book. It is a superbly written piece and I see why it received the Newbery Award."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I enjoyed this book. The story line was never boring and it moved at a good pace. The unique ending leaves the reader curious about the boys fate. This is a great read for adults, teens, and children over the age of nine.Jonas grows up in a society where there is no crime, pain, or inequality. This \\"ideal\\" world is created because controls have been established that promote sameness. For example, climate controls have been devised that prevent different seasons, medication is taken to suppress sexual impulses, colors have been eradicated, jobs are assigned by community elders, and spouses and children are designated based on compatibility.Jonas' life changes when he turns twelve and is assigned his role as the receiver. He begins his training with the \\"Giver.\\" The giver is the only person that holds all the memories of life's true pleasures and pain. The giver's job is to transfer these memories to Jonas, and train him to become the next giver. When these memories are passed on to Jonas, and he experiences pleasure, pain, and the freedom of choice, he becomes torn between his presently controlled existence and a possible uncontrolled existence that includes pain, war, pleasure and love. He must decide between the two worlds for himself and everyone living in the community.This is a wonderful read for anyone that enjoys science fiction and adventure."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this for the first time when I was in Junior High School and instantly fell in love with it. It's the story of the perfect society where you do not know pain, affliction, color or what life really was. In this society everything is assigned to you. From who your parents are, your family, your jobs everything. Jonas however is a special one as he is called to know what life really is like as he is to bear the burdens of the world so others would not have to. So join Jonas as he receives the good and bad from the giver and learns what the world is really about."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I kept hearing good things about this book so I finally picked it up and read it over Christmas break. Being a kids/young adult book, it was a fairly fast read. Still, because of the depth created in the world of the book, I tried to slow down my reading and take it all in.The overall plot of the book felt fairly familiar after having read other 'futuristic' or 'alternate humanity' books. My most recent memory was to _City of Ember_ which I read earlier this year. In both books, there's an isolated Community with rather specific rules and regulations as well as a sort of lottery process that specifies a future career for children once they reach a certain age. Stepping beyond that plot device, the two books diverge greatly...with Ember dwelling largely on the mystery and adventure of escaping the city and Giver concentrating more on what is lost and missing in such a community (granted, Ember still contained the same theme and I thought a lot about if, but it wasn't as overt).The writing style was easy to follow and the story line was concise and interesting. Through the first many chapters, I grew close to the main character, Jonas, and enjoyed his perspective and his thought processes.Once he received his assignment as the next Receiver, many new revelations came to light. Up until he met the Giver I wasn't entirely sure of the direction the book would take. I still wasn't entirely sure where it would go, but the message and intent became more clear.It was interesting to me some of the things I didn't realize were missing in the book prior to meeting the Giver. Once Jonas meets and begins his training with the Giver, he becomes more \\"awake\\" to the state of the world and more aware of his surroundings. Naturally, his descriptions become more vivid. Looking back at earlier sections of the novel, I wasn't aware of some of the simple adjectives that were missing from the descriptions. I must have just chalked it up to the simple writing of a younger book...but now that I know better, I attribute it to the artful direction of a talented author using his writing style to propel his message.I really enjoyed this book and look forward to picking up more books by Lowry. My biggest complaint is with the ending of the book. Don't get me wrong...I don't mind \\"sad\\" or even \\"ambiguous\\" endings. In fact, my wife will tell you how much I love depressing stories. What I felt was lacking from this book was more sense of closure.I don't want to spoil the ending, but be warned that this paragraph may allude to elements, so skip it if you like. I didn't mind not knowing the exact nature of the lights Jonas saw at the end. I can be hopeful that they indicate a positive ending, but even if they are elements of a sad ending, that's alright.What was missing for me was closure as to the results of his final actions. What happened in the community? I realize that Lowry probably didn't want to spell things out exactly because he wants to leave a sort of \\"call to action\\" for the reader. Still, I wanted a few pages about what happened in the community...whether or not Jonas' theories were valid...even if the book ended before a resolution happened. I wanted to know whether or not Jonas' actions were valid and justified or whether they were ineffective and futile. I wanted to see some hope of change for the community rather than leaving it completely nebulous.OK, now that I've added sufficient ambiguity to all those who haven't read it, I hope you'll take my call to action and go read it yourself. It's a fairly short book with quick reading and a thoughtful message.****4 stars"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book in Jr. High and really liked it. And have not re-read it until now in my mid-forties. I still really liked it! But I have gone from being the 'RECEIVER OF MEMORY' to 'THE GIVER' and I think the book has tremendous meaning when reading it from that characters view. I would highly recommend this book to any one 13 years or 43 years old."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books. I'm not exactly a low-level reader, but this book touches on topics in a way that many more complicated books don't.

No crime, no anger, no great divide. The laws of Sameness makes sure of it. Utopia, at what cost? Along with this very Creepy Utopia comes the forgotten memories of what it is to be different. Forgotten memories of war and hate, of hunger and sickness. But also forgotten memories of rain and snow. Of falling in love and having a child. Of make choices. Remember what it was like when you first starting having feeling for someone, that little funny feeling in your tummy. Feeling of love stirring deep inside. Well they have a pill for that, and everyone must take it. The joy's of being with child--Gone. They have birthing women for that. What about sharring loving memories with the grandparents sitting around the dinner table or a warm fire on a cold night--Gone. Sickness, death, not anymore. They just release you. There is only one who holds all these memories both good and bad. Now it is his time to be the Giver and pass on the memories to the one who will take his place. What is Utopia anyway, and what are you willing to give up to obtain it? Great book. But more for a young adult reader. Still very enjoyable. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is probably one of the books that I read through the fastest. It kept me interested throughout and was difficult to put down. This is one of the first books to ever make me keep reading so I could find out what happens next. I told myself I was only going to read one more chapter and ended up reading three more before going to bed. One of the great things about this book is that it is very short and very easy to read. This isn't one of my favorite books I have ever read but it was very enjoyable and I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I got through this book in one sitting. It was quite captivating. If you are a fan of \\"The Outer Limits\\" or \\"The Twighlight Zone\\" you might really like this book since it was like reading an episode of a story from one of those shows. The only reason I give it only four stars is that it felt as if the author could have done more with it in the end. It was like he got bored writing the story and punctuated with an ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this in 7th grade and loved the book. I recently ran out of books and I read it over again (I'm a college freshman) and loved it even more. The plot is amazing, the characters make it even better. This is truly a piece of art, and the meaning behind the book is astounding. I would definitely suggest this book for a good page-turner to all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Honestly, I did not expect this book to be this good. Its target audience is young adults, but it certainly is a great read for adults also. I finished the book in one day. The author created a main character you care so much about you just want to read it all the way to the end to find out what happened to him. The idea is creative and the pace is fast and engaging. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The author of the review \\"A Horribly Written Work of Fiction\\" obviously is not thoughtful reader. To rant about how stupid it is to give a 12-year old a job in the story is just ridiculous.It appears that this author is just mad because they read it in school. They are wrong, as this is a well-written and very deep book. Lois Lowry is telling us how a society without any emotion is not a perfect society. It is an exciting, quick-paced adventure, and the ending is excting and leaves you to think about what you have just read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was introduced to this book as an adult working with adolescents.

If you want to know what I mean then read \\"The Giver\\" and other books of Lois Lowry"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As a high school senior, I am always looking for a book that gets my attention and holds it. I have found that book. It is THE GIVER By Lois Lowery. At the start of the book I thought that it would just be an ok book, but as I read farther and farther into it, I found out that I was wrong. I found that it is a great book to read.The book begins with a young man named Jonas who is outside and he sees a plane flying overhead. What's the big deal, you ask? Planes are not supposed to fly over the village, so the people are all shocked. This is just one strange thing about this community. The village is its own little world with every thing controlled. Everybody gets a job assigned to them when they turn 12. Jonas becomes 12 and is assigned the job of receiver of memories which is a big honor. But will it be too much for him to handle?The book is an interesting look at a society trying to control everything it can in its town. As you read you will see all the crazy things they do and how it doesn't always work. You will see how they suppress love and other feelings and even color.Overall, I believe this is a good book for seniors or any high school student to read. While many schools use this book in younger grades, I recommend this book for older students because of the complex ideas. I also recommend it to people of any age who like realistic sci-fi. It's interesting to wonder: how far are we from having this perfect society, and do we really want it???"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you have ever been hurt before, then you have probably thought of what it would be like to have no feelings or emotion. It's a nice thought, never to be hurt again. You also then have to ask yourself what it would be like to never experience love or happiness, because if you have no feelings, then that would eliminate the goods ones as well. This is what it is like for the community of people in \\"The Giver.\\" They see no color and feel nothing, not even love. This can be very disturbing to read. I know it was for me and I am an adult. A world like that is hardly imaginable, but is no doubt well detailed and explained by Lois Lowry.It is a complete contradtion to the world and society as we know it in the United States. Here, diversity is welcomed and smiled upon especially in our schools. In this book, everyone is the same and there is no room for differences. This is very sad and would be very boring if it was real life. Also, the people in this community are just assigned a job at age 12. No one gets to choose what they would like to do. Jonas is both blessed and cursed with receiving his assignment which is to be the receiver.The ending of this book is a cliffhanger. The reader is left without knowing what truly happens. I like that it is open to the reader's interpretation. My interpretation is that Jonas and Gabe die and go to heaven. I could be wrong. It is only my opinion. Even though this book is sad, it is still an excellent book. When I began reading it I could not put it down and that is saying a lot because there is not much that can hold my interest for any given time."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In The Giver there is a boy named Jonas. He is an eleven year old boy who lives in a supposedly perfect world, a world without hunger, sickness or any danger. It is a time in the future when everything is perfect and no one ever gets hurt.

I recommend this book for anybody that loves adventure, and a good long book. I hope you enjoy this book if you read it.by warren chan"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I like this book because it is interesting and different from others that I have read. Also I like it because the book is about a future that is not real. There are no animals in their make-believe world. The people can't make choices. That is why I like the book.The book is about a boy named Jonas. It's about how he was selected to be the new Receiver of Memory. He and the Receiver try to think of a way to change their community. The people in the community lie about things and don't know that it is wrong. Jonas and the Receiver are the only ones who know that they are lieing and they know they're not doing things that are right.Who would enjoy this book are people who like some drama. If you like people try to do the right thing even if they have to break law in your books and all the others than you may like this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a very interesting read. The beginning of the book starts off very slow, introducing the characters. Eventually, you realize that everything is the same. There is not a bit of that thing we now call individuality. There are no feelings of any kind, no pain, happiness, or even hunger...Then this one boy had been chosen to be the receiver. This job is filled with pain and suffering. He has to take all the memories from the Giver, memoeries of times when there was love, hate, pain, suffering, and happiness. Jonas, who is the main character, starts trying to use these new feelings that he has acquired through the Giver and wants to apply them to his life of \`Sameness'. It does not work though, because the people have npt experienced what he has felt since becoming the receiver.Overall I give the book a b+.

If they are not perfect, there are serious consequences. When you are 12, you are given a job. When you request it, you can apply for children. You don't choose your spouse, your children, or your job. The irony of this book is that the so-caled \\"perfect city\\" is really not perfect at all. I didn't exactly like some of the ideas in this book, but it did make me think.

After one or two times of someone explaining how Jonas felt, you just want them to shut up! I also believe that this book had a slow start, and that ,for me, isn't very helpful when trying to get into the book. I think that younger people wouldn't have a clue to what The Giver is about, so older people, such as fifth and sixth graders, should read this book. The reason i rated this book a three star book is just for that reason. I think it was too complicated for younger people and too boring for older people.

I think that it is good for all middle school students. It has a pretty high vocabulary so younger kids might not get it unless there parents read it to them. It is a very strange book but that is what it makes it different and better. If you like strange books that you can't put down this one is for you, you never are going to want to put it down. It is about a boy this is about twelve years old that a middle school could relate to, the only difference is that he lives in a society that is totally the same, everything is the same so there is no judging. That makes it so you don't have to impress anybody. The book started off a little slow but if you keep reading it gets better and better.

Watch out for the ending though as it will leave you wanting more.All in all this book is wonderful, whether your ten or one-hundred. If you have the chance (and can find one of those awesome Amazon \\"penny books\\" deals) and want an easy read with a message;Read This Book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is novel about a community and a society optimized through governance by a strong central committee of elders, which are only briefly encountered in the book.The book focuses on one boy's transition from youth to early adulthood, Jonas. Through his eyes, we come to know his family and community. Everything is very structured and orderly. People's careers and mates are assigned to them based on observance and psychological profiling for optimal fit. Even reproduction is assigned to specific people who engage in sex for reproductive purposes. Children are then raised by nurtures. People chosen to rear children until they are two years of age, at which point, the children are assigned to families for further upbringing. Once children reach the age of 12, they are assigned their careers and begin training. The old are well cared for in retirement communities where care givers see to their needs.The high degree of structure is even found in people's daily lives where we find everyone eats sleeps, plays and works based on the schedules dictated by the governing body. Families even have designated sharing time. Where each family member is suppose to share their feelings based on their experiences during the day.At first, there is something seductive about this society. People are well treated; there is no war, poverty or crime. However, as we see the community through the Jonas' eyes, one cannot help but notice unsettling aspects to the community. Jonas' mother's comments that no woman should want to be a breeder as these women are assigned to physical labor after three years of producing children. The elderly are \\"released\\" when they reach a certain point in their lives as are small children whose behavior is too unruly. The people seem to need the orderliness and any disruption in their serene existence results in almost child like responses expecting someone to take care of them.Jonas is selected to be the new \\"keeper of memories\\" a prestigious position awarded only when the old keeper is nearing retirement. His first instructions are to discontinue sharing and he is given permission to lie. This is the beginning of his introduction into the world behind the community's pristine faade. He learns of love and his parents' inability to express it as the concept lacks the precision the community expects in language. Love is too messy to nebulous to truly be meaningful in the community. His journey of discovery ultimately leads to death or salvation depending upon the reader's hopes.In my opinion it leads to death as Jonas' last moments in the book are too conveniently similar to the collected memories given to him. Also, ending in death leads to a bitter poignancy. The realization that his society has made him into someone that cannot hope to survive outside its rigid confines. His new memories are the only thing left from lives lived before sameness.Lowry's book is a brief, well written book on the dangers inherent in wanting too much safety, ease and convenience. The result is a society with no pain, grief, longing or suffering. However, there is no love, passion, joy or deep appreciation. Life is functional, but not meaningful. The world has become gray, not because the people are color blind, but because they are numb from a society that protects them from being human.This book is excellent cautionary tale for our own society. We have become a society afraid of any form of discomfort, and seek to isolate ourselves from it. In the pursuit of isolation we have separated ourselves from our extended families. We text instead of greet. We email instead of talk. We have successfully insulated ourselves from each other, making for a safe, rarified environment bereft of the messiness that comes with real living. Lowry shows us the final result of the decision to make efficiency and safety paramount and impossibility of breaking out of these chains once they are forged."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a book written for kids (but it also resonates powerfully to adults. I read this once as a kid, and then again a couple of years ago. It had as profound of a effect on me the second read as the first. This place seems like a lovely utopia, but there's subtle signs that this utopia is flawed, such as the kids' occasional complaints about the rules or Jonas' own feelings of unease as time goes on. This is simply one unforgettable book that is immensely thought-provoking, with an ending that will leave you wondering."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This story really moved me. Set in the possible future, the concept of Sameness is brought to extreme levels. Members of society barely think for themselves. Everyone has a position, with set tasks and actions to preform everyday without question of why. The one exception is The Giver. He is the holder of memories. Memories that include love and family but also pain and war. When Jonas is picked to be the next Giver, time has finally come for change. The ending is purposely ambiguous. Lowry leaves her readers to make their own conclusions.1994 Newbery Winner. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this si my favorite book. i just wish the book didnt end i know theres a book when gathering blue and the giver unites but i dont know which one that is. but overall this is one of my favorite authros and my favorite book next to the boy in strped pajamas"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My 7th grade Reading teacher absolutely loved this book. I didn't get around to reading it until I was long out of middle school, but I'm very glad I did.Technically, I believe this is children's fiction. However, it's very, very deep.The story takes place in a utopian society where everyone has forgotten how to feel (which would be one of the wort things that could possibly happen to a human in my opinion). Each child, once they reach a certain age, will be assigned a job. There are medics, glorified babysitters, and so on. And then we have our main character, the Receiver. The Receiver is a very special person as he has to receive all the old memories of feelings and then pass them on to future generations.There is a lot of depth in a short book. You honestly can't go wrong with this book. It's very good, albeit simple."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry has created a terrifyingly regimented future in which every need is provided for. There is no hunger (a child is severely reprimanded for saying he is 'starving'), everyone is exquisitely polite, there is no color, no music, no love, no pain and no choice. Careers are assigned at the age of twelve, and if one's usefulness to the community is at an end, or a child is unable to conform to the community's expectations, he or she is 'released.'When Jonas turns twelve, he is chosen to be The Receiver and is apprenticed to The Giver, the repository for memory. This is both a tremendous honor and burden, as The Receiver must experience every memory of the human race as passed on by The Giver. As The Giver passes memories to him, Jonas begins to see colors, experience pain, and understand the terrible price the community pays for the Sameness it has elected.What Jonas and The Giver choose to do with this understanding makes for a thought provoking tale, and the ambiguous ending provides excellent fuel for discussion. Dystopia is not a new subject for fiction, and this book has overtones of The Twilight Zone, The Prisoner, Logan's Run, Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451, but with a YA slant. Excellently written, the truth about Jonas' world is gradually revealed and the reader is lulled into its rituals and celebrations before being slammed with the nasty truth about its ultimate nature.This was November's book club selection and while I was a little dubious at being asked to read a children's book, this was one of the better books on the list. I'm looking forward to reading the other two books in this series."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book five years ago, and just re-read it. It has a profound and emotional quality---and in parts is a great metaphor for the terrible psychological conformity of our society and world, and for the power and intensity and specialness of one who challenges that conformity by thinking outside the box. That is the strength of the book, and here Lois Lowry shows her creative genius as a writer. So many times she subtly and deftly spun a sentence or two that brought the community she portrayed into the most vivid, realistic life.But some parts of the book left me questioning---and wanting more. Allow me to list two:1) Weak ending. Without giving away too much information, I felt it lacked the power and immediacy of the first half of the book. I felt the same way when I read the book five years ago--and part of how I remember the weakness of the ending is that I couldn't remember it at all! I remembered the beginning---plot and themes---so well. The end just gets murky and semi-irrelevant, like she lost her focus.2) Too much reliance on magic. When the Giver starts transmitting memories to Jonas in magical fashion, the book loses its strength of reality. Lowry did not need to jump into magic to make her point, and I felt this weakened her point---and the potential strength she could have accomplished.So overall I felt the first half or so of the book was utter genius, and I think little could be added to improve it. Not so with the second half, and especially the last third..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We ordered this book for our son's english class. We did not want to spend a lot of money for a book we knew would be read once and then put to the side, so we decided to order a used one. I know that we ordered what was said to be a used book, but you cannot tell the book has ever been read. The condition of the book was excellect. Just like a brand new one hot off the press. The book arrived in the time frame promised. I would certainly use this seller again."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is good literature because it is full of feelings, full of action and adventure, and has a surprise ending. The Giver is full of feelings because during the novel, the Giver and Jonas can feel things that other people in the community cant. For example, during the story, Jonas feels sad when he sees what his father did to the twin at the Ceremony of Release. This text states, \\" Jonas felt a ripping sensation inside himself, the feeling of terrible pain clawing its way forward to emerge in a cry.\\" The Giver also has a lot of action and adventure. For example, when Jonas tries to calm Gabe down and accidentally transfers the memory of a sailboat to Gabe. Also when Jonas goes through the memory of war, there is a lot of action. The Giver also has a surprise ending. I never would have expected the novel to end with Jonas and Gabe getting lost trying to find the elsewhere they were looking for, but only hear an echo. I would have hoped that in the end Jonas and Gabe would have found the elsewhere and would have started a new life there. The Giver is an example of good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an example of good literature. The Giver has a very surprising ending so many questions were left on answered. This book is very adventures, especially at the end when Jonas and Gabriel escape. They have to go through different climates and temperatures that they never experienced before. This book is scary at some points like when the plane fly's over. Jonas had to give Gabriel memories in order to survive. The book says.\\" He knew that they could not see color, and their flesh would not be seen, they used heat seeking, so he gave the memory of cold to Gabriel\\" So in conclusion the Giver is good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my mind, I would consider The Giver, to be an excellent book. I enjoyed how Lois Lowry based the book upon having a perfect community. Also, she used many characteristics of good literature. In fact, I think that this novel had at least 4 or 5 good literature traits. Some of these traits would be that this novel had lots of description, lots of interesting details, had believable characters, and also at times I found that this novel could be considered humorous. Most of all, I enjoyed how Lois Lowry showed what it would be like if the whole world was perfect. As in perfect, I mean no death, no colors, people telling you what to do everyday, people picking out the food that you were to eat, and most of all there would be no feelings. I could not imagine what it would be like to live in a world without feelings. For example, the characters from The Giver would not know what it is like to be happy, sad, angry, or even what loving someone feels like. All I know is that if someone were to take away my feelings, I would have no idea how I would be able to live."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver was an example of good literature. This book contained many special elements that gave it an edge over other books. The Giver was very suspenseful and mysterious, with many different plot changes. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading it I wondered what surprise was waiting for me around the corner. For example, there were many times when I thought Gabe and Jonas were going to get caught or die. But they fought courageously and made it through. Another element that made this book good was the story. Imagine a world where everything was done for you. You couldn't pick your clothes, food, mate, and many other aspects of your life. It' s hard to understand how life would be if everything was controlled. This book touches on that perfectly giving little hints but still leaving a lot to be desired. The life of the people in the society is a bland boring life with no changes and nothing epic rarely happens. The lack of feelings and memories was scary. Imagine your parents not being able to say they love you. How badly would it hurt? It wouldn't because in Jonas's community there aren't any feelings. All in all this was a really good book and I recommend it for reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver'' is not good literature based on these characteristics Ichose. \\"The Giver'' is not good literature because the characters in thebook have no feelings. They have no feelings because it is a Utopian society,in which the people live. Another reason why \\"The Giver'' is not goodliterature is not considered as good literature is because there is no adventureand action. I felt the novel was tedious because the setting of the storyoccurred within the community and there wasn't a lot of action. Lastly,\\"The Giver'' is not good literature because of the ending. The ending of thebook wasn't surprising. There isn't an actual ending to the book. A quotefrom the end of the story is, \`'Behind him, across vast distances of space andtime, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhapsit was only an echo.'' This is why the novel, \\"The Giver'' is not consideredas good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is good literature because it is full of feelings, full of adventure and action, and has lots of interesting details. First, the Giver is full of feelings because Jonas has good feelings and bad feelings receiving the memories from the Giver. Jonas had good feelings when the Giver gave him the memory of love and whole family, and he had bad feelings when the Giver gave Jonas the sled crash memory. Second, the Giver is full of adventure and action because there are so many events in this book. One main event is when Jonas is assigned Receiver of Memory, and all the memories he receives from the Giver. Last, the Giver has lots of interesting details, especially all of the memories. One interesting detail is Jonas's sled crash, \\"In his agony he perceived the word fire and felt flames licking at the torn bone and flesh, he tried to move and could not, and the pain grew.\\" As you can see, the Giver is good literature because it is full of feelings, full of adventure and action, and has lots of interesting details."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This phenomenal novel, \\"The Giver,\\" is hands down, without a doubt, considered to be good literature because it is full of realistic feelings, it shares an important message and it has a surprise ending. The first reason why the novel is such a brilliantly put together piece of work is because the feelings just explode from every inch of the text on the pages. The feelings demonstrate warmth, love, happiness and more through the characters such as Jonas and The Giver because they connect and really give you the full effect of feeling the emotions yourself. Also, this novel is considered good literature because the message that it conveys is just life changing, and really impacts the reader. The message proposes the thought that maybe life should be appreciated, and not taken for granted because in the real world, choices aren't made for you, such as they are in Jonas' community, and your own fate is in your hands. Lastly, the novel should be recognized as good literature because the ending is just a great surprise, which is left up for you to decide how the adventure ends. For example, the author even states when questioned why there is no direct ending, \\"So I don't want to put my own feelings into it, my own beliefs, and ruin that for people who create their own endings in their minds,\\" showing that the ending is a freedom of choice and decision itself. So finally, that is why I highly recommend this novel to all, and is why I consider it to be good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was very good literature. First, it was full of adventure and action. Second, it has lots of description. Third, it had a surprise ending.First, The Giver was full of action and adventure. When Jonas tries to escape to Elsewhere he struggled to stay alive. There was also the time when the memory of warfare was transmitted to Jonas. All the agony on the battlefield was full of action, which is why I like this book.Second, The Giver has lots of description. When the memory of warfare is transmitted to Jonas he went into extreme detail. The author described the pain and all the bodies lying lifeless on the ground. She describes the thirst of the one soldier who was still alive. There was also the occasion when Jonas broke his leg. The author describes the blood flowing from his leg with the bone popping out of his shin. She explains that he threw up, but she described it in such a way that it seemed like you were there. The detail in this book was amazing.Third, The Giver also had a surprise ending. It was surprising that it did not explain what actually happened to Jonas. I also found it interesting that Jonas found a sled out of nowhere on his quest. The ending actually shocked me because it was not all that good. It was not as good as the rest of the book, and left you hanging. All throughout the book the author went into detail, but when it came to the ending there was no description at all. It was not bad, though. As you can see, The Giver is very good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver ReviewThe Giver is good literature based on the characteristics of lots of description, full of feelings, and a surprise ending. The Giver had lots of description in it. Whenever The Giver would transfer a memory to Jonas, Lois Lowry was very descriptive. Here is a description she wrote about a memory of Christmas morning: \\"He [Jonas] was in a room full of people, and it was warm with firelight glowing on a hearth...On a table there were lighted candles, standing on a polished golden holder and cast a soft, flickering glow.\\" Another characteristic is the book was full of feelings. From the memories Jonas received, he perceived several feelings. He endured feelings of love and warmth, as well as feelings of death and warfare. A third good characteristic of literature was a surprise ending. Other might think it wasn't a surprise ending, but it depends on how you use the word. My thought of a surprise is I was surprised that the ending wasn't as good as I though it would be. It really left me hanging. So as you can see, The Giver is an example of good literature based on the characteristics of lots of description, full of feelings, and a surprise ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Good literatureThe Giver is good literature based on three main reasons. First, there were tons of feelings throughout the book. The Giver transmits memories of all kinds of feelings almost every chapter. Second, there were tons of interesting details. For example, instead of saying \\" Jonas fell and broke his leg\\", the book goes into detail about how his leg broke. This is to show how new and painful it was to Jonas. A quote to support my answer is \\" He fell with his leg twisted under him, and he could hear the crack of a bone. Finally, there was a surprise ending to The Giver. Who would of thought that Jonas would escape without being caught, and survive out in this new terrain? As you can see, The Giver is a piece of good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Her style of writing sounds childish and unformed, like a child whining when it feels bad.

This book is shameful mockery of literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This Book was ok because it would get good then it would lose your attention. I liked when Jonas found out that his dad killed the babies because he thought his dad was a pretty good guy until then. I wish his community was more like ares instead of it being based in the future because his community was way to strict. When they became 12 they got a job and started working and learning to be that person of the community. When Jonas gets called up for his award and job the whole auditorium gasps. He gets scared because he thought that it was a bad job. The job of the giver. Then he is walking into a building and going to where you recieve your training. Well at the end of his training he gets a message sent to him from the givers head to his head without talking or anything except with a touch."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The begining was cool and creative, but once Jonas becomes the reciever the book is too slow repetive.

(Racism)2) That sharing feelings and dreams is bad, and keeping your feelings bottled up inside is good.3) That the idea of community and interdependence is bad, but rugged individualism is good.4) That Old-Folks' Homes and daycare centers are bad, because they really are \\"death-panels\\" in disguise.5) Providing three square meals a day is bad, but starvation is good because it helps people develop \\"feelings\\".6) Bicycles are bad, but sledding downhill is good.Now what does all that sound like? Why, it sounds like typical right-wing fascist propaganda.Congradulations, Ms. Lowry, for being able to disguise your propaganda as \\"serious literature\\", and for being able to foist it onto kids with very little serious objection from parents.Needless to say, this book is not for kids, and never should have been placed in the kid category. Instead of making kids think, this book tells them what to think. If the author wanted to write true literature, she would have had the main character die at the end of the book. Only then would I even remotely recommend it to kids."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Book had so many highlighted paragraphs and notes in the margins that it was completely unreadable. I wouldn't have minded a few marks but this copy wasn't good for anything but the trash."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The ONLY reason I went ahead and read, THE GIVER, by Lois Lowry is because it was chosen for one of the book clubs I attend. Like many reviewers I've read Orwellian books; and more importantly, books which included a wide range of ideology of social, political, and religious philosophy written by famed scholars [Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, John Locke, Nietzche, Karl Marx etc.,]. For this reason, it escapes me why anyone with a minimal education that included a few courses in classic philosophy/literature would bother with this book.From the first pages, I became IMMEDIATELY impatient with the book's premise and storyline. I found it irritating, impertinent, and ultimately irrelevant. Worse, despite claims to the book's creative 'originality' I found this to be an overstatement.Why was I frustrated, annoyed, and unnerved by Lowry's, THE GIVER??? Probably because the notion of a perfect society - by it's very definition is flawed, and thus futile.Conversely, I absolutely do give credit to Lowry for her efforts [and courage] to tackle an 'absolute' theory such as perfection and/or utopianism into a story which attempts to expounds 'ideal' concepts such as societal equality, justice, and absence of suffering. This is a high goal for any writer. Yet, for me this seemed rather presumptive -and a somewhat naive and unnerving premise. For example, from the onset, the dialogue which Jonas has with his family group when they gather at the table to express their 'feelings' about events of their day, I knew immediately the futility of the task facing Jonas when he expressed his fears about becoming a 'twelve' - not yet aware that he would assume the role as 'The Giver'. Consequently, for me, it was a 'no-brainer' that Lowry's ending fell off the cliff. How could she possibly postulate [literally or figuratively] a credible scenario wherein Jonas' society could thrived harmoniously and in unison within 'utopian perfection'. [Oxymoron.]Finally, ideologically, I simply did not like the book primarily because implicit in the concept [definition] of utopianism is the ideal of a 'perfect' society or world order. To this end, Lowry's fails clumsily in her attempt to construct a storyline which ULTIMATELY brings forth a social-cultural utopia where all the various factors come together in 'perfect' unity and harmony to contrast with a society absent of order and in chaos.Post Script 8/19/12: Because of all the positive reviews, I researched the author and learned that Lowry is the author of children's books, and that 'The Giver' was intended for younger readers. For this reason, I better understand Lowry's intent. However, I think 'Lord of The Flies', and 'Animal Farm' were better.Maizie Lucille JamesJuly 19, 2012"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a creepy, dystopian novel about a society that appears to be perfect but really isn't.

It tends to be a bit boring in the beginning, but once the pace picks up, it's a great read all the way until the end. Books that talk about a Utopia, like Jonas' are a nice contrast to our society. I think everyone should read this book or a book like it to know that not everything is always as it seems. There are always things that affect us and our society, even when we don't notice it. As a twelve year old boy, Jonas has to realize these things. He realizes what is good and bad about how his community is run. He discovers new and beautiful things along the way. But is it enough to keep him grounded when he realizes activities and happenings that just don't seem quiet right, and some that are completely chilling?

It made me notice every emotion and feel everything more."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a novel that really makes you think of what the world would be like without originality. You, the reader, are introduced to the &quot;perfect&quot; community where everything is controlled and decided for you. It is a place where you never have to fear for anything. Then you meet Jonas, a young boy, who has a lot to learn...I personally would never want to live in place like this. You lose your identity in the process of trying to be similar. Being an individual is what makes life interesting."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very powerful book with a strong message and isgreat for young adults to read. The author portrayed the controlledcommunity in what seems to be a very definative manner, but failed to give a real ending to the story. The message would have been more strong if there was a sufficient conclusion to back it up with. Overall, it was still a pretty good book; I've read it several times."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i thought this book was great. it really made you think about the freedoms we do possess and what it might possibly be like if they were taken away. like, what would the world be like without emotion, or music, or even color... it would be totally different totally controlled. i think the aurthor had a good sense of how important those freedoms are, and how much they make life what it is and that is why she wrote the book. read it, it is great!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas, the main character in this book, lives life without choices. At first I was confused because this book opened up without any sort of explanation what so ever, but as I read on I was able to figure it out and I enjoyed learning about this alternative lifestyle. As for the ending, it was not at all what I expected but I can't see how Lowry could have made it any better. Read this book, it makes you think!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book needs serious help. Lois Lowry started out with a good idea but turned it into an oversentimental, childlike sci-fi wannabe. Plus, it has a similar plot to another one of her books, Gathering Blue. An author can't make money off of two books that have an almost exact plot, except with different character names. I was told that Gathering Blue is a COMPANION, but note that it was never said it was a prequel, sequel, or even book in the series. Take a breath of fresh air and read something else."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is simplistic and sounds like it was written by some child. The ideas present within this novel are unformed and not clearly thought out. This book tries to be another 1984 written in the style of Albert Camus' The Stranger, but winds up sounding like the Unabomber's Manifesto written in the style of Dr. Seuss."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was one of the most dark, sick, demented & depressing books I've ever read!It's amazing to me that the publishers would think this type of book would be suitable for \\"young readers.\\" It was unnerving to read about the euthanasia of infants in the story and also the suicide of a little girl was just plain sick!I was very upset that this was required reading for my twelve-year-old son. I wish authors and publishers will come to realize that you don't have to have darkness and death in a book to provoke thought and emotion. Books with a light subject matter can be just as entertaining! Overall if this book was written for an adult audience I wouldn't have a problem with it. However being that it was targeted towards youths, it was totally inappropriate!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The author aborts a slow paced delicately written story with a nonsense ending. At the end of the story, Jonas climbs the hill sees the warmth and love in a colorful world of Christmas, family, fireplace.I did not recall if, there was a big cross or star of jesus on the tree, an old rocking chair with grandma sitting in it. May be we could add a voice- over invoking a Hallmark cards, as the camera pans up and back showing the two dead children on a snowcapped mountain with the sky backdrop of two lone but beautiful shining stars..A vision of death with love of Christmas and Jesus.I was offended.. I felt ripped off by not being given a thoughtful ending, and felt the author wrote an ending that was as cruel as the murderous cult characters she painted.The reader is entitled to a finish with thought and morality; not this quasi-symbolic Christian hammer of death.The Beatles knew &quot;Love love, love, all you need is love, all you ever need is love&quot; is great for songs that inspire action not just belief. Action not just suffering.Perhaps the author ran out of paper, or the limit of her ideas, or had just come from being reborn. ."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was expecting a novel but this version of the book is broken up and asks a lot of questions to the reader like I'm in school.

The 12-year-old main character Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory whose task it is to contain all the memories of the past. All other members of the community live without memories. The community controls and watchs over what everybody does in the community. People do not feel any pain or other things and the people in the community cannot see colours or choose on their own. The Giver transmits the memories to Jonas and will be released when he has finished. At the end of the book Jonas and Gabe leave the community, because he cannot bear his life in the community.Jonas and his family live in a dwelling. Jonas is a typical child of the community who plays with friends, attends school and does volunteer work. Jonas cannot speak to anyone only with the Giver who gives him the memories. Jonas feels lonely, because he cannot understand his friends and the people. Jonas has his own opinion on everything and he sees the community from another view. He has many qualities for example intelligence, integrity and courage.The book has an open ending so that the reader can imagine his / her own ending. With the book \\"The Giver\\" Lois Lowry wants to say that people need freedom and memories and not control. People independent on the community, and this is not right. They must be independent and they must have feelings to go their own ways.I do not like this book, because it is too unrealistic for me. The book does not have any tension and it is difficult to read. The book is not interesting. And the open ending is stupid, because it does not say anything. The book is so boring that I would not read it if I did not have to read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Okay, my teacher assigned the whole class to read this book, The Giver, and the kids who were able to actually read the whole book, didn't like it. Maybe we are a class who just doesn't like science fiction books, or maybe the book wasn't that good. But a lot of people did enjoy the book, so it isn't the latter.The book was just too weird. Creative? Yes. Well- written? Yes. Boring? Heck yea' ! Jona's world is a world without color, a lot of technolodgy is missing, feeling, and just about everything good and bad of life is gone. Everyone is assigned a job. There are the birthing people, the doctors, etc. But Jona's job is the job of the highly respected Giver. The older Giver gives the kid feeling, and what it is like in the real world.Plus, the ending was so confusing. NO one understood it. There were too many questions not answered in the book.However, many people obviously loved the book, and some just didn't. If this sounds like your kind of book, buy the Giver. And if this review sounds like something you would write, then don't buy the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I read this book for the Children's Lit class that I teach, I was horrified. Not only is the story ineptly constructed, but it also portrays the blatant manipulation of the child protagonist by the very person who's supposed to train him for his designated job. I had had high hopes for this book when I started reading it, but clearly Lois Lowry needs some instruction in how to create a functional alternate worldview. Her utopian world makes little sense because she fails to explore it in enough depth. I think if the book had been another 100 pages or so, it might have been worth the reading, but as it is, I'm horrified by both the popularity of the novel and by the uncritical manner in which it is approached by teachers and students alike."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book to me was frusterating. i didn\`t like how the people were called males and females.

I had recently read 1984 the summer before and found the elements of Lowry's community more than curiously similar to Orwell's. It seems to me as if Lowry watered down Oceania into a book suitable for children, forfeiting the intensity and powerful writing in the process. If you're going to teach children about what it is to live devoid of joy or pain, use a good book for once.

They were told that &quot;public education may not be the best choice..&quot;This book so poignantly illustrates the liberal socialist agenda to ingrain even into our youngest the propaganda that some life is better off without living. It is disgusting and I am appalled that our children are forced to read this garbage, and that our society praises such garbage."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"BrendanNew HampshireThe Giver is about a so-called community of people that are all nearly equal. They can't see colors, or even hear music (lame). They're assigned jobs and there are a set amount of babies born each year. The only names the babies can get are the ones of the recently realeased (killed) old people. It's basically the suckiest place you could be in, only the people don't realize it because they're nearly rertarded.This is supposed to be a story about how we need to keep things like love, family, and equality intact. I'm all for it, but i don't need 180 pages of crap to teach me a useless lesson. The author, Lois Lowry, must be the stupidest person in the world. With a line like \\"'Gay!' He shouted. 'Gay!'\\" She doesn't come accross as very intelligent. Maybe it would be ok if it was funny, but it's just moronic. I'd rather read a book of fart jokes than this crap.When I heard that this book was part of a trilogy, I nearly commit suicide. That means that at least a couple hundred people have gone through 3 times the pain that I have. I'm willing to bet that Lois Lowry feels special for winning the Newberry Medal for this crap. As if that medal were an accomplishment. After seeing that medal on this book, I'd be ashamed to have it on a piece of my writing.There are so many homosexual references in this book. First of all, the Giver constantly makes Jonas, the main character, take off his shirt. Second of all, the baby Gabriel makes his appearnace by shouting \\"Gay!\\" Thirdly, everyone has to take a pill to stop them from thinking about the opposite sex. Wow. I wonder what this says about Lois Lowry.The ending was stupid. Stupider than anything you've ever seen on VH1. And everyone knows VH1 is awful. Awful like this book. I recommend that if you see this book in a library, you burn the place down. I think the local police might even be grateful to you for it. Nobody likes libraries anyway. If you hate this book as much as I do, round up as many copies as you can, and come see me. We'll have a bonfire."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am not a prude or a conservative in my outlook on life. By most standards I would be considered fairly radical. That being said, I absolutely cannot understand how this book has won the prizes it has as a \\"Book for Children.\\" While it is well written and thought provoking, and I consider 95% of it as suitable for kids, the ending may confuse and upset those of more tender years, and the graphic description of a release absolutely will shock and deeply disturb those of a more sensitive mien. I have still not recovered from reading the latter, and I honestly wish I had never read it. It will stay with me for a long time, upsetting me in the process, and I would never want that to be the case with any of my children. Please, parents, do not think this book is a great read for your kids just because a number of \\"experts\\" have chosen to award it the prizes and accolades it has received. It is, as I have titled this review, GHASTLY, and very disturbing. In closing, I looked at the author's smiling picture at the back of the book and found myself thinking, \\"What kind of person is this woman to be capable of writing such a descriptive passage of a release? How could she ever want a child to read such a thing? Is she capable of writing other books that hit in such a darkly disturbing way?\\" I will never be able to answer that last question because I will never read another book from this woman, whom I believe may have some pretty serious mental health issues, especially as it applies to her true feelings about children."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was not very exciting.

I loved that book and decided to give this one a try, especially given the overwhelming positive reviews. I am glad I did. In a nut shell \\"The Giver\\" is about a boy who turns 12 and is selected as the next Receiver of Memory for his community. As he goes through his training (Receiving memories from the previous Receiver of Memory) his eyes are open and he begins to learn many things about his society that trouble him. Some of the issues he faces are that he truly learns what it means to be \\"released\\" from the society, the truth about the outside world called, \\"Elsewhere\\", and love. This is just a small sampling of the issues he tackles. I found the book to be very thought provoking when compared to our current society. One of the issues other than the ones mentioned above is the idea of not having birth parents but rather choosing a child to raise, with two being the maximum. The family seems to be close knit, but is lacking love. If you look at our society, it seems that work and all other sorts of issues are put ahead of the family and there is a lack of love and unity. This, in my opinion is part of the reason why our society has degraded so much. Overall, I thought the book was good and I am glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I decided to read this book after a couple of people said Hunger Games reminded them of this book. I loved Hunger Games and decided to give it a try. Wow, they were right. In some ways I think it was even better. I loved being able to witness the day to day life in the community. The concept of no colors intrigued me and is a little scarey. Could science ever go so far? I would love to see this book turned into a movie."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A marvelous dystopian future, with most of the \\"sci-fi\\" stuff hidden behind the scenes. The writing is wonderful, and the protagonist someone we can all identify with. My only complaint is the somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying ending. This is a rather famous book, and should probably be in any serious reader's collection. I recommend for age 12 and up. Older teens probably won't appreciate it, but once past the \\"I don't read kids books\\" phase it can be read again for more depth and analysis. For some reason, Giver gets banned a lot, which I can't fathom. The only thing I can think is an issue; there is one particularly distressing scene. Parents should probably read this first so that can both decide what age is appropriate for the child to read it and to be prepared to discuss some major issues."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is an amazing book, suggested to me by one of my peers (yes I am of College age). Many of my friends tell me they were instructed to read the book in middle school and call the topic \\"childish\\". I suspect these people didn't read into the book as the author wanted them to, they were unable to find the deeper meaning. This book is accessible to children and adults alike. After reading this book I am definitely interested in reading the other two books in this \\"trilogy\\" for lack of a better word."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A great read. A peak at a &#34;perfect&#34; home and how it can become not so perfect. I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book as a child and reread it for my book club as a companion book to another dystopian book we were reading. The ending is different from what I remembered as a child and I think this is because the ending requires almost another level of disbelief suspension and maybe doesn't fit in for that reason. I remember reading being confused by the ending as a child, reading it several times, and deciding he had died, but this most recent reading reminds me that it was actually the Giver's idea that he escape and he actually succeeds in finding a new community. This is totally different than what I remember and I think it makes less sense but I'm willing to just let it go. I think the main virtue of this book is that it's like a soft core 1984 for children and introduces the darkness of pain and suffering through a book that's not that upsetting or graphic. It brings up a lot of very interesting questions about freedom of choice, sex, the importance of remembering history. I'd recommend it to older kids."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"While I can't really write something more erudite and thoughtful than the other reviewers of this book I will add an observation. What really freaked me out about this little novella was the way in which people talked in this future dystopia. The speech is very stifled and over-intellectualized, but at the same time the characters are kind of super in-touch with their feelings when compared to twenty-first century humans. For example, there is this nightly that takes place in the early chapters after the family finished dinner where each family member talks about something that happened that day and how it made them feel. Then, they all analyze the situation, the feelings it produced, and talk about solutions or other aspects that may have been overlooked at first. It's kind of sweet in this quirky Bizzaro World way.Funny thing is, the stilted way the characters talk remind me so much of Kro-bar and Lattis from the movie \\"The Lost Skeleton of Cadavara\\". It might as well have been set on the Planet Marva. I imagine all of the characters speaking in that cadence and emotional affect."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in the \`Community', a supposedly utopian world where everything is flawless. There are no good or bad, there is no hunger, no war, and no pain - a perfect world to live in. Jonas lived 12 years of his life without questioning the system and accepting things as they were. But when he is selected as the \`Receiver of Memories' he starts to discover secrets which lie beneath the perfect exterior of his world which he rather would not have known. As he receives more and more memories his wish to explore the world beyond his Community increases. A compelling tale showing the courage needed to go against a set system to bring a change.The characters are perfectly described and none of the characters are bland. Most of the characters are accepting of the system of the \`Community' and do not want to change it or are rather scared to go against the system. The main character of the book Jonas on the other hand is unsatisfied with the way things are and wants to see it change. Sometime before he becomes twelve he notices certain changes in his surroundings which he can't explain. When he becomes the Receiver of Memories he starts to understand the change he had experienced, change he which had made him feel free and not bound by rules. His longing to explore the world beyond grows stronger with each new memory he gets even though he knows it's illegal. My favourite character from the book would be the Giver who gives the memories to Jonas. Sad and melancholy in nature, he is the only one who understands Jonas' longing for freedom and even decides to help him escape.The book is a complete page turner and raises issues which force the readers to ponder upon. What if the world was perfect, a world where everything was same and without any conflict? Would we still long for the imperfect world? For the people living in Jonas' world the world they live would be a utopia but for the reader it is a dystopia where all things are controlled by one person, a world where there is no freedom of thought and talk of change is not endured. The people controlling Jonas' world to be perfect even the families are made so that they are perfect. People are made to think what the rules say are right. Even their profession is chosen by other people. This book shows us the imperfect world hidden behind the fake exterior of a perfect world.I recommend this book to all young adults. A book which would compel you to ponder upon the concept of the perfect world which we all wish for. If you liked this book you would also like The Seventh Tide by Joan Lennon and The Time Machine by H.G.Wells both of which deal with the same concept of utopia and dystopia.A memorable and thought provoking book which cannot be easily forgotten. A compelling read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I will admit that this book is strange, disturbing and sad. I have no children, so I cannot say I recommend this for under 13 readers. Though I guess I would say to parents of under 13 to read before letting your kids read.That being said, this was a fantastic book with an ending that left me very moved. Things that I didn't realize till half way through the book is that the utopian community can only see everything in black and white. Like an old black and white TV sitcom. There is no concept of color, only The Giver can see color. When the Reciever of Memories is chosen to be the next reciever, he begins to see colors that no one else can see. He begins to learn the truth about life that everyone is oblivious to. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give anything away. For example, take Adam and Eve....when Eve bites into the forbidden fruit, she knows all knowledge and everything is different. The new reciever, inherits all memories of war, faminie, pain, suffering and what it means to love because 'love' is obsolete in the community. It really is a beautifully written, somewhat tragic story about the burden of knowledge. I read this book in one day."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is fantastic! I am a teacher and I am truly excited to share this novel with my students...it makes you open your eyes and question the meaning of &quot;perfection.&quot; Many times we speak of how wonderful it would be to live in a &quot;perfect world&quot;, but I do not believe that we can comprehend what that would mean - a loss of freedom, of beauty, of innocence,of history, of love...If you are interested in reading a book that will make you thankful for all of the many great gifts we do have, pick up this treasure and enjoy it for all of its wisdom!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Louis Lowery is a great book. The author brings the characters to life, and it feels as if you are really in Jonas's world. It is a page turner, so I recomend everyone to read it!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver looked really boring at first, but due to an assignment from a teacher, I had to read it. Most of the class read ahead of the required reading. It is defininately a page turner. You will start to really feel for Jonas and what he goes through. The ending was very confusing, but if you have a good imagination, you'll love this one."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I actually met her in 6th. grade when we were reading the book.

If you do not read this book you are missing probably a life changing story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am thirteen years old and in the 8th grade. I really love the Giver, even though I read it two years ago! It was very compelling and interesting, and it never became slow. There were unexpected turns in the plot at random spots, which I love. And though the ending was different, it was a unique ending for a unique book; a &quot;happily-ever-after&quot; ending would dillute this type of novel. Although I enjoyed the Giver immensly, I feel a sequel would dillute it. To me, the ending preserves the readers right to make choices, which was the main theme in the Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As I came upon the book &quot;the Giver&quot;, I was a little reluctant to read a grade level 7 book, I decided to anyhow.I was utterly surprised at how much the book exceded my expectations. I found it to be,as I put above,a wonderfully written book.I loved every page of it. Although the vocabulary was limited,I still found to be intellectually stimulating and easy to follow. For me the ending was confusing but I liked it anyhow.For me Jonas didn't die but had one of his wonderful &quot; memories&quot;. For those of reading this I know you have probably read the book many times,I urge you to read it again."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am in the seventh grade and have read this book three times.

The first time I picked up the book I couldnt put it down. I think its a great look at how the future could become if we continue trying to make a controled enviroment for americans. Its also just a great little story and kept me reading which is hard to do because i hate to read. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes to finish a book and feel really good after their done."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book offers an amazing critic about how could be our future if we keep thinking about being practical, and forgetting our human essence which is formed by colors, differences, and deep feelings. The Giver remarks how important is our history and how powerful could be. Also, this book invites us to be creative and make our life spectacular everyday."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I completely forgot about this book until I heard someone mention it one random day. Then I remembered that I had read it in 7th grade. This book was still great the second time around! The author does an incredible job of describing the scenes throughout the story. You are in touch with the main character Jonas, you feel what he is going through. I especially liked when Jonas first discovered colors, and how he was now viewing his life, and community. The story makes you wonder if we as humans are missing out on something really special in the our world. Just like Jonas had when he first realized love, and how his community didn't know how to understand the concept."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm not what most people would call a \\"reader.\\" If I read more than two new books a year, it has been a good year. That being said, I usually manage to re-read \\"The Giver\\" once a year as it is, by far, my favorite book. I connect with the protagonist so well and no one can rightfully speak ill of Lois Lowry's writing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Touching. One word that flows. Beautiful, sad, amazing. It is all that! When I finished it I was literally CRYING. Really! No kidding. It was beautiful ad touching.I was dying. Dying!! For the sequal, but like there isn't one connected to The Giver. Like no more Jonas. Sadly. I recommend this book for everyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Stop giving this damningly good book 1 star just because it has adult themes. If you don't like your kids reading this then take your complaining to the school, but don't tarnish this wonderful book with low ratings. Idiots. GRRRRRRRRRR. Yea maybe its too mature but how does that mean its bad? There is no connection there."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It is an extraordinarily well crafted novel. The chapters are concise and well structured. Each chapter carries the plot a single distinct step ahead. Though the chapters are untitled, you can easily summarize each one in a succinct sentence. The language is very clear, the plot is interesting and the book reads very quickly. It's a textbook example on how to write good prose. The reason i'm giving it just 4 stars is that, despite its masterful execution, it doesn't really have that gripping a plot or that mesmerizing characters that linger with you after laying the book down. Still, i warmly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Why read: Considered by many to be a classic.What impressed me: The Giver totally lived up to the hype, and from reading it I can see why everyone compares the newest YA dystopian books to it. The world created in The Giver is clearly the basis of many modern day stories. Knowing The Giver came first makes this short but powerful novel even more impressive.What disappointed me: I wish I had chosen to read this back in school, as I remember it being suggested reading may times over the years, but look at that cover. It's no wonder I never picked it up as a student.Recommended: Definitely. The Giver is classic dystopian for a reason.Continue series: Of course."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is definitely a child's book, in languague, characters and length. It is a modern fable, another take on a Brave new world and Logan's Run. In an unspecified place and time a society has opted to live in a world of sameness. Children are made in a nuturing centre, families assembled by committee. The story follows one boy, Jonas, who on reaching 12 is assigned to be the new receiver of memories. He gradually learns of colour, love and pain. This is a gem. Enjoy it at any age. Aparently it has been banned for children at some times as the some of the content, e.g. infanticide, is considered inappropriate . I can understand this as, reading it as an adult, the world it projects is a little scary and vivid. However, considering some of the things deemed appropriate nowadays this is rather mild. I loved this, am somewhat disturbed by it as some of the ideas are disturbingly close to issues today. It explores what happens when we discourage diversity. When conformity is celebrated and people receive complete nuturing of body and dulling of emotional extremes."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this as required reading when I was in middle school and it's even better the second time.

When I first saw it, I thought it sounded kind of strange, but since a lot of my friends liked it, I thought I'd give it a try. (Actually, one of my friends thought it was disturbing.) I picked it up, and after a few pages, I was hooked. It really shows in detail the sharp contrast between our society and a perfect world or &quot;Community.&quot; The details were great also, and they added to the clear picture I got of the story. I could really feel the cold snow blowing against Jonas's face in his first Memory. The book had a good meaning, but parts of it were disturbing. I won't mention them because I don't want to give it away, but I definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story that makes you really think about life. Kudos to the author, Lois Lowry, for creating such a spectacular work of literature!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"the giver is a graet book! the first time i read it was when i was in 6th grade at age 12, its a really deep book and sence ther i have read it 3 more times each time understanding more and more. i really would recomend reading it more then once, but wait untill ur at least 14."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine a life with no pain, no war, no sadness, no problems.

There are many things that could not really be, but it lets your mind expand and try to answer all of the questions you have while reading it. It is a great book that teaches you lessons.

By the end of the book I was shocked and crying. I would give recomend this book to anyone!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I may be one of the few people who never read Lois Lowry's The Giver growing up. For some reason it was never assigned to me in any of my English classes but I remember seeing people carrying it around. I would like to start off by saying I am so glad I decided to read this book. I wish I had been assigned this book to read this novel growing up instead of an entire year of Shakespeare and and entire year of Greek plays. I read The Giver a few days ago and the novel still haunts me.Twelve year old Jonas has grown up in a community where nothing bad ever happens and every decision is made for you. In this society everyone's career is chosen for them at the age of 12. Sexual impulses are squashed with a well regimented drug therapy, and later in life the society decides who your partner will be. The society then provides you with two children to raise, One girl and one boy. Once the elderly become a burden they are \\"released\\" from the society. Infants who do not grow at an ideal rate as also \\"released\\".At first glance the society seems perfect. There is no crime, no poverty, no unemployment and everyone appears to be happy, but there is also no sex, no pure joy, no large families, and worst of all no love. The society's mission is to promote \\"sameness\\".The novel follows Jonas after he is picked to be the next \\"Receiver of Memories.\\" This position is a very prestigious position because there is only ever one \\"Receiver of Memories\\" at one time. Under the guidance of the man known as \\"the Giver\\" he begins to learn the mysteries of the world. Jonas slowly learns about war, famine, love, and is educated on some things as basic as weather and colors. As Jonas progresses in his chosen career path he starts to wonder if the perfect society is worth all the sacrifices. Jonas and the Giver decide to try and change their society but will people who have never experience any true emotions be able to handle the history of the world?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed by this book. I understand that it is intended for a much younger reader than myself. Still, it seemed incredibly simplistic to me. For one thing, Lowry does not give many details about how the society has come to be, or how it really functions. Despite that I thought it was a great thought-provoker for younger/more reluctant readers, and provided some truly chilling scenes. One more quibble: the ending was open-ended and unsatisfactory. I know, I know, it's supposed to make the reader think. But, argh.[...]"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My 12 year old daughter had to read this book for her gifted and talented program at school. She likes it so much that it doesn't seem like homework."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a classic. It's hard to find good science fiction in juvenile fiction. The perfectly ordered world is not all that it seems. Jonas is tested with the knowledge gained as the Giver. He will learn of another kind of world - one with war, pain, love, color, etc. As a result, his relationships with his family and friends are altered. This is a terrific book club selection or class read as it invites discussion. What would our world be like without color or emotion? Could a world be ruled by order? The Giver is best suited to a little older, sophisticated reader - an advanced 10-year old up through adult."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverThe Giver is a book that is extremely captivating and intriguing. It will blow us as teachers with adult minds away as well as children's minds, taking them out of reality and forcing them to imagine the world in a different way. This way though, is not a happy visualization. It is a world with no color, love or joy. The one fine experience that this book offers it the revelation of us as a people to be grateful for the things in life we do have. The story follows a boy names Jonas who is chosen as the Receiver. As the receiver, he is imparted with memories from before the world was void of things we know as life and vibrancy. These memories are given to him from an old man named the Giver, who wants Jonas to not only see, but know the world through a fulfilling journey. As a reader you will be captivated by this story as it keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat as you wonder if Jonas will make it to the land of the living. The Giver would be a great tool to read before a writing lesson on science fiction. This text would most appropriately be used in a upper primary grade such as fourth or fifth grade. So next time you step outside, rejoice in the clouds, the blue sky and the birds singing outside."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I understand why there are over 3,000 reviews for this story. I can't believe I had never heard of it until I stumbled across it while browsing for Kindle books. My son said that many of his friends had read it so I downloaded it for us both to read. He devoured it in a day (on his 12th birthday no less and the main character is a \\"twelve\\"). It took me a couple of days but only because of time constraints. However, once I started, I couldn't wait to get back to the story every time I had to leave it sitting.This is one of the most unique stories I've read in a long time. Imagine such a world where there is no color, no choice, no love, just complete compliance. Jonas is a wonderful main character and carries the story well.I really liked the imagination that went into creating this perfect world while illustrating that we can't have love without loneliness, we can't have joy without pain, and would we really be happier if the frustration of choices were taken away from us.I love this story so much, I've download three more books by Lois Lowry and can't wait to get to them.Oh, my son loved the story as well and I'm hoping that he found it something to think about. It certainly opened up some discussion between us as I read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i read this for school and did not want to. i realised it was a book to think about as you read. i would have never read this for fun."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an excelent book.

It is a wonderful book to read along with your child! I did an eight week novel study on The Giver with my 5th grade Honors reading class and they all enjoyed it. In this book, Jonas is a boy that lives in a \\"perfect\\" world. As he becomes older, he begins to see things that make him question everything he knows. Lois Lowry is a wonderful author and this is a perfect story for a fifth or sixth grader. I'm in my thirties and it's still one of my favorite books!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What a great book. The Giver is a very serious book but also a book that youngish readers shuold be able to understand. This is one of those books that kids can begin to learn critical thinking from. It puts moral weight behind such mundane things that we take for granted. The book has you asking yourself questions like,\\"Is it okay to be pain free? Would you want a protected, colorless life if it meant safety and well-being. What things are worth dying for- freedom, oppurtunity, or even basic chioces?\\" I wish I had read this in junior high but better late then never."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is great it portrays life lived in a utopian world where nothing is wrong, and everything is perfect.

There was only one person in society who had to take on the burden of carrying all of the feelings and experiences of the past. When Jonas became a Twelve, he was chosen to be this person/the receiver of memories. Jonas's training involved much pain, but he continued. Through his training Jonas changed. He knew the origins of the games the children played, such as a war game, and thought them to be cruel. Jonas had access to anything he wanted in society, now that he was a receiver. One day he requested to see a &quot;release&quot; of a new-born child (a twin). Jonas was horrified to see that the child was actually killed because it was a twin. At this point Jonas decided to make an effort to change society and looked to the person who was teaching and giving him the memories; The Giver. The Giver thought about it for a while and constructed a plan. Even though the plan was dangerous, Jonas accepted it. Just as Jonas was about to implement the plan, however, a dramatic turn-of-events took place. To find out the ending I suggest that you read this book. My over-all opinion of the book was that it was very interesting. I liked the way the author set the book in the future, even though their society was more primitive than ours. The book seemed almost scary because the people didn't have feelings. If I had a choice to pick between the two societies, I would definitely choose mine. Although their society didn't have any poverty, I still think that feelings are the most important aspect of a working society. I would recommend this book to teenagers. I think that almost any teen would find this book very interesting."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This seriously is the best book I have ever read. It is so different than any other book.

Some of the underlying meaning was difficult to understand at first, but now I still can find more that wasn't pointed out before.

This is a classic book that should be required for every middle-schooler."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought it was okay. Jonas's world was weird with there being no color or animals.

When they released the smaller twin in the forehead, I was about to cry."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book. In the community there is no war, no fear, no pain.

When the time comes for Jonas to be assigned, he gets chosen to be the Reciever. The former reciever, now called the Giver, holds the memories of the true pain and pleasures of the community. The Giver now must give the memories to Jonas and then Jonas will become the Giver. I liked this book mainly because of its plot and descrition.

Apparently, it is one of the most popular books for children (approximately ages ten to thirteen) in the late 1990s. It is about a young boy named Jonas who lives in an unusual future world and is about to turn twelve. In this world, everyone lives in a highly structured Community and each is assigned specific roles. There is no war, no pain, and when one is old and is no longer contributing to the community, they happily are \\"released,\\" although no one seems to know what that really means. When a young person turns twelve (all turn ages on the same date each year; just like horses do today), there is a big ceremony in which each is assigned their future job at which they become apprenticed. However, Jonas is not assigned to a job. Due to his special insights, compassion, and intelligence, he has been selected to be the new Receiver of Memories. This Receiver is a single individual who has within themselves all of the memories of the past, including memories of true pain, war, passion, family, etc. The older Receiver becomes the Giver and begins to transfer these memories to Jonas. Soon Jonas discovers concepts he never even considered. For example, he discovers color and that the ability to perceive color had been purposedly removed in the distant past. He discovers hills, snow, joy, and pain. And he learns about love. Finally, he discovers what \\"release\\" really means. And, he and the Giver must do something about it. Near the end of the novel, Jonas starts a quest to find others with imagination, memories, and passions; others with more humanity."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The novel The Giver, entailed many aspects of every day life in a typical &quot;perfect&quot; or utopian society. While reading this novel it appeared that this society was to set in its ways. They had every aspect of a child's life written in stone before they were even born into the society. This appeared to be a little strange that all of this information would be complete before the child even existed. This is one of the many aspects that occurs in a utopian society. The novel had one main character, named Jonas that the story was based around. Jonas belonged to a family unit, this included his mother, father and his sister Lily. Each family unit only consisted of a mother, father and a son or daughter. All of this information is written out before the parents and children reach a certain age. I don't know about you but to me this doesn't seem normal. This novel is highly recommend to audiences of all ages. As you read the book you should think of all the so called normal things in our society and realize that in the utopian society these things would never be heard of. It is also a great novel to compare how other societies live, as compared to our democratic society."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"One of the best books i have ever read if not the best an amazing story i would reccomend this book to kids and adults of all ages"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"First id like to clarify that i am NOT kari regier. i am her 11-year-old son.

There are no violent or inapropriate parts (in my opinion) in this book. However i do not suggest that children under eight years of age should be allowed to read this book. This is because there are one or two parts of this book that are a little disturbing. This is a very Wonderful book.

This city is a dull, lifeless place where there is no love, joy, happiness, family, and laughter. However, very rarely, there is someone who does have these feelings, which one of these gifted ones is Jonas.At the age of twelve, everyone is assigned a job, according to their skills and talents. Of course, Jonas is the Reciever, the most honored, yet painful job in the community. His job is to keep all the endless memories of the world. Jonas is trained and taught by the Giver. Soon, Jonas realizes that there might be this place where love, family, sorrow, pain, joy, and colors still exsist. Will he find this place? And does this place even exist? Read this book to find out!I admired the way this author paints a vivid picture in my mind. There was nothing I disliked. This book is one of the most well written books I have ever read.

I thought the writing was slow and that the plot was hollow. Boy oh boy was i wrong. This is a fantastic book (once you get through the first 50 pages) and presents some very poignant and though-provoking ideas about a future with no feelings.I do think that the book did take a little to long to really get going, but on the other hand, i think it was neseccary. We are so used to living in a world with color and emotions that the author needs to try and bore us to tears so that when emotions happen, they are shocking.When push comes to shove, i think that this is an excellent novel for all ages. The writing is clear and concise, and the ideas are daring. Now more than ever you see politicians attempt to \\"keep us safe\\" from certain things that could cause any sort of emotional response. The Giver gives us a picture of what the world could be like with a government that retains total control over thoughts. The picture is very bleak indeed.Meyer H BrownVirtual High SchoolMythology"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The following was written by YM, age 11 (Grade Six), as part of a homeschool novel study assignment:I think that The Giver is an amazing book. I like the way ithelps us understand how the characters feel at all times. For example, when Jonas is trying to transfer the memory of red to Asher, we can understand how hopeless he feels, and sympathize with him. This is an excellent book by an excellent author, and I hope we will be seeing more from her soon, maybe even a sequel to The Giver. I sure hope so!--Y.M.P"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry is definatley a great writer, and this book proves it. Even though The Giver, the title of the book, refers to the Giver that Jonas works with, the book is more so about Jonas, which isn't found in any of her other books. Jonas's community is a perfect community. It's a community where there is no violence, there are no arguments, and there is no slang or poor speech. I suppose you could even describe his community as \\"uptight\\". I personally think it fits in the catagory of science fiction, though some may disagree with me. Jonas's community has very strict rules, and some even seem hilarious. Puberty in their community is called \\"stirrings\\". I couldn't help but laugh a little when I read that part, but it didn't make me take the book any less seriously. The Giver gives Jonas the memorys of the past that aren't found in their community. The Giver is growing old, and someone needs to take over. So, a new \\"receiver\\" is chosen. The Old, as the elderly are called, monitor what the children do during their volounteer hours. Jonas never focused on one particular thing, which made him perfect for the assignment. The previous receiver was The Giver's daughter, but his daughter could not take the stress of all the memorys, so she decided is was best that she was released. Release, as we find out later, is when they stick a needle in a person's arm and they, well, die.I definately reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a deep and very, very interesting read. You won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was a very interesting one that paints the picture of a community with no color, no hills, no hurt; just sameness. It made me think of all of the differences that are around now and how different cultures record them and their mistakes for the future to learn from them. In this culture that Lowry has created in the book they record them in a fascinating way . With one person that unlike the others has to be responsible for all of the previous horrors along with the joys that none of the others get to experience. Another thing they never get to experience is making any real choices. They lack the right to choose their jobs and women . It is a reflection on today's society about those choices and how because of the high divorce and unemployment rates if people did have a board researching and deciding for them that it might work a little better. It might work a little better but, the only problem with this utopia is that when you take away people's choices you take away their freedom and with out freedom you can't have a utopia. This community however is happy with these choices that have been made for them and that is because they never knew the alternative. No color, no hills, no hurt, and no death. In the book they take away the concept of death and replace it with a concept of release. Most cultures have their own ways of dealing with death and this one just camouflages it. So when all of these things become clear to the main character he leaves and by doing that forces the others to bear the load of history which had been alone on he and the Giver's shoulders. The book ends with out telling what has happened where he left from. It leaves that for the reader's imagination to kick in and think about what they are going to do know after the failure of two Receivers. This obviously was the weak link in there chain so maybe next they go back to writing pictures on the wall..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A perfect world. It'd be nice to have a perfect world, but would things be really perfect? In the book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry, the setting is utopial, in a close knit community where there is no crime, war, prejudice, pain, or love. The Giver is all about a community giving up their human race in order to establish a close knit and safe haven. People who live in the community consider themselves living in a perfect world. Jonas is a twelve years old boy who receives his assignment. He is to become the receiver, the highest honor of the community. The receiver holds all of the community's memories, pain, and love. Jonas begins his training with the Receiver, an Elder, whom he calls the Giver. As Jonas receives the memories from the Giver, he see colors, what snow is like, pain, and love. The more Jonas learns, the more afraid he is. In the community he lives in, there are no colors, no sun, no love and pain, and no choices. People of the community have their beliefs and that is to let others decide their future and their fate. He then discovers a ceremony, &quot;release,&quot; is murder. Jonas realizes the &quot;perfect&quot; community he lives in isn't perfect after all. The book was very fascinating. I read the book in less than two days. I was immured in the book from the start and I just wanted to read to find out what would occur. One thing led to another thing. At the end, I was mystified."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry was captivating and interesting through out it's content. The setting is familiar, yet not, and so it kind of makes you use your head to figure out just exactly what is going on. The main characters are interesting enough but towards the end they get to be redundant. The plot left a little something to be desired too. I was very disapointed at the ending, to me it was a let down. I read this book in three days and it wasn't a big waste of my time. I liked it a whole lot better when I was in the middle of it though, then I just couldn't put it down. Latter I got to the ending and it was very disappointing. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth so to speak. Read it for yourself and let me know what you think, obviously not every one has the same thoughts as me on this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by. Lois LowryThe Giver shows us that memories are important to all individuals and societies. In the book the community that Jonas live in is strictly controlled by a group of elders. The citizens have very little decision making to do, all aspects of everyday life is controlled for them, in the book it was called &quot;Sameness&quot;. Everything was the same because the citizens had no memories of what life was like before they converted their life to &quot;Sameness&quot;. These memories help people perceive the world and without them they are not really experiencing a fulfilling life. Jonas found this out after he had been passed on memories by the Giver, he realized that his life had not been whole and fulfilling without &quot;first generation memories&quot;. Memories play and important part in a culture because they make each culture distinct. In the book the culture that Jonas lived in did not differ very much from the other communities in the surrounding area. Part of a culture is its folklore and stories of that kind and these stories are passed on from one generation after another, there is no such passing on of information to the next generation in the book and this creates somewhat of a separation of each generation, even though the citizens do not realize this. Folklore give a culture color and wholeness and since part of folklore is memory the society in the book did not have the color and wholeness since there was no memories that were not &quot;first generation&quot;, there was no color and wholeness in the community."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"can anyone help me with the ending... did the people thingk that he was dead....? but then he went back ...what happened?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver made me realize what a totally controlled society could be like.

The relationship that develops between the Giver and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; is tender and paternal, allowing Jonas to experience love for the first time.

I also disliked the fact that people get \\"released\\" because I think they should have the elder people go threw old age without having to die early. At the end of the book Jonas and his little sister had escaped from the community and I thought that would be a good part in the book because they found out what it means to be released and they didn't want to be part of the community anymore so they had escaped."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Very thought provoking read.

He and the Giver are the only ones in their world that know about any history before the sameness. Jonas is assigned to be the new Receiver. He receives the memories of everything before the sameness from the Giver.My favorite part is when Jonas receives the happy, joyful memories. That is why I like this book.

Good job. :)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you appreciate the genius of 1984 &/or A Brave New World, you will also love The Giver. This is a sentiment expressed by other reviewers that I would like to echo. An important area where I disagree with other reviewers though is that just because the main character is a child, that that makes this a book only for children. Many very adult issues are discussed in The Giver about the direction in which the world is moving. But I am very gratified that adolescents are also reading this book in school. It will help them to think about the future and what kind of world they would like to inherit.The society described in The Giver leads \\"The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past.\\" (p.164) This is largely due to societies' conscious group decision, referred to as the \\"Sameness,\\" to eliminate pain through constant medication (similar to A Brave New World). While everyone is assigned a job in the community, and even a family to raise them (not their natural parents) from the time they are babies. There are no longer conscious choices to be made in life. Societies' collective memories of pleasure and pain are the burden of one individual: the Giver, who then passes on collective pain and pleasure to a child, who succeeds him. Old people also no longer have any use in society and live together in group homes until society decides to \\"release\\" them, a term that loosely describes euthanasia.The Giver is beautifully written and there are many amazing plot twists along the way. The world described by Lois Lowry seems deceptively utopian in places until shocking revelations are disclosed about the truth of the future community. The society described is also similar enough in places to the world in which we live today as to make the reader both uncomfortable and wonder about the collective choices being made in the name of social harmony. The Giver is a very important, prescient book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked reading The Giver by Louis Lowry. I think that students ten years old and up would enjoy this book also. This book revolves around a boy named Jonas and the perfect world that he lives in. In this Utopia, everyone is the same. The people who live here cannot see color or feel emotions. After the age of twelve, nothing changes and you are assigned a job for the rest of your life.This book tells the story of the position of Giver which Jonas is being trained for. Even though I liked reading this book, I cannot imagine living in a perfect world. I like the fact that there are people with different thoughts and feelings.I like meeting people and hearing what they have to say. In a Utopia nothing ever changes. Even when something bad happens in our world, you can learn from it. With Jonas, the people never learn or grow, they are assigned a life. The author was able to create a world that was interesting to read about and maybe someday in the future there might be some form of living that way, it does make you think."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Daniel TyrrellPeriod M Book review5/3/10The book The Giver is about a kid names Jonas who lives in a community that is just perfect they have no crime, no poverty, no unemployment, and no diseases. But in the community you have absolutely no freedom because when its your birthday on certain years they have ceremony's which they give you new things but you lose your previous things. The other is that when you turn 12 you officially become a adult and your assigned a job, a spouse, and you can sign up for a baby. Then when Jonas gets the most important job in the community he starts to get memories from the last recover and he learns watch the community used to be. I think that the book was a decent one It wasn't one of my favorite books because it seemed boring to me because all it did was describe the community the only part in the book I got that wasn't boring was the end because so many things happened. Also I think that Lois lowery could had make the book make more sense because I think that their would never be a community that is so perfect. But I thought Lois did a very good job with the explaining of the story and the description.

A novel should tell a believable story, but nothing in the Giver makes a bit of sense. There is no logic. Didn't Lowry give any thought to the world she was creating when she wrote about it? This book reads like it was written in a couple quick,careless weeks, and then published without any review.The Giver describes the world of Jonas, a 12 year old boy who lives in a Utopian village. It is a perfectly controlled environment. There is no violence, no hunger, no poverty, and everyone has a job and a meaningful place in the community. But in order to construct this ideal world, the citizens of Utopia have to abide by a strict set of rules. They have to sacrifice a lot of free will to the decisions of the Council. For example, the Council decides who you will marry and what your career shall be. Lowry clearly intends to write a Book With A Message, but her delivery is so bad that it is hard to figure out just what The Message exactly is! I think the intended Message is this: in order to lead a meaningful life, you must have the freedom to make bad choices, or else choosing to do good things will be meaningless. Okay, that could be a good premise for an insightful novel, but look at all the ways that Lowry screws it up:When Jonas turns twelve, he is assigned a career as the new Receiver of Memories at the Naming Ceremony. What kind of a job is a Receiver of Memories? It means that Jonas will be required to store all the memories from the world before the Utopian society was constructed. An old man, the previous Receiver of Memories, will transfer all these memories to Jonas before he dies. Jonas will learn aboutlove, families, passion, war, fear, poverty - everything that existed in the human world before being wiped away when the perfect society was constructed.In the perfect society where Jonas lives there is no color, no music, no warmth in the sunshine, no grandparents, no hills(!), no true love, no change - because all that had to be deleted when making Utopia. But why? Why do people have to give up seeing color in order to live in a world without hunger? Why do people have to give up music so that there will be no war? Since when did warm sunshine cause greed or crime? There is no logical reason for this. In Lowry's world, the citizens murder their elderly people, and kill the people who break too many rules - this is so that they may live in a world without violence or fear! Does that make any sense? If you were going to be killed if you broke too many trivial rules, wouldn't you live in fear all the time?What magical mechanism allows the designers of this world to prevent Jonas from feeling the warmth in the suns rays? Why would a society so obsessed with efficiency bother to expend so much energy on blocking the feeling of warmth from the sun?When the old man who was the previous Receiver of Memories (he is called the Giver, since he gives the old memories to Jonas) lays his hands on Jonas, he can transfer memories with incredible vividness. In the first memory transfer, the Giver passes to Jonas the sensation of riding a sled down a snowy hill. This is a wonderful adventure for Jonas, who has never experienced anything so strange as snow or color. But what strange ability allows the Giver to pass a memory simply by touching Jonas? (Indeed, by giving the memory to Jonas, the old man forgets it himself, which is another item that makes no sense). Later, when Jonas touches the baby Gabe, he can give memories to the baby. But when Jonas touches his friend Fiona, he is unable to pass a memory to her. Why not? Why can Jonas transfer memories only when touching certain people? When Rosemary killed herself ten years ago, all of her memories were dissipated to the rest of the village - but she wasn't touching anyone when she died, so how did her memories get transferred? The Giver tells Jonas that memories are never lost, but Jonas was alive 10 years ago when Rosemary died - so if her memories transferred to all the villagers, and memories are not lost, why doesn't Jonas have any recollection of color, music, etc? If Rosemary's memories are dispersed when she died, then why isn't the memory of dying given to the citizens every time a Giver dies? Presumably, a Giver will have transferred most his memories to the new Receiver of Memories before taking the lethal injection that kills him, but obviously the last thing the Giver will remember is receiving the injection just before dying, so that memory of dying should always be transferred to the village.After Jonas learns about sledding, he wishes that his village had some hills and snow so that he could go sledding on his own. But the Giver says:\\"We had to get rid of hills, because they are inefficient. It takes extra effort to go up hills.\\" An thoughtless remark that makes no sense - although going up hills is harder, going DOWN hills is easier. The net effect is zero, the existence of a hill does not impair efficiency. Besides, if the village has no hills, what keeps the river flowing in its bed? Without hills to contain the river, its water would spread evenly over the entire land.Jonas goes to the retirement home where gives a bath to an elderly woman. I believe Lowry intends this scene to shock its readers - there is no nudity taboo in a utopia? But this scene made me wonder - why does anyone wear clothes at all? The villagers live in a climate controlled environment, they don't need clothing for protection or style. And obviously they don't need clothing for modesty. If they are willing to expend enormous effort to remove all hills from their landscape in the name of efficiency, why do they spend any effort on something as useless as clothing? After all, the people who labor to make and clean the clothing could be put to more productive tasks. Another question: why do they live in buildings? Isn't it inefficient to build and maintain structure that you don't need?When Jonas receives the memory of a broken leg, his own leg hurts for a while, he limps home that night. When Jonas gets the memory of starvation, his belly aches from the memory of the hunger pains. But when Jonas learns of war, he gets the memory of having his whole arm blown off - but there is no mention of his arm hurting after that. Besides, that is not how memories work - if I think back to when I hurt my ankle playing basketball, my ankle doesn't start hurting. If I recall my last visit to the dentist, my teeth don't start hurting. When Jonas makes his escape from the village, airplanes fly overhead searching for him. To escape their thermal scanners, Jonas thinks of a memory of being cold, and can then actually lower his body temperature! When he is cold in the mountains, Jonas remembers being hot and this warms him up!! Again, this is not how memories work, this is nonsense.The Giver claims that no memories are lost, and he apparently has the entire lifetimes of many people stored in his head. But how can he possibly transfer multiple lifetimes worth of memories to Jonas in less than one lifetime? In order to absorb so many memories, Jonas would have download huge quantities of experiences all at once, otherwise the transfer couldn't happen fast enough. But if the memories are exchanged at a high speed rate, then Jonas won't \\"feel\\" them. He will have the memory of warfare, but it wouldn't bother him unless he actually recalls that memory. If no memories are lost, does that mean Jonas can now recall an infinite number of times of washing clothes, tying his shoes or going to the bathroom? In real life, memories ARE lost - can you recall what you had for breakfast every day of your life?Prior to being selected as the new Receiver of Memories, Jonas starts to see flashes of color in his black and white universe - for example, he strangely sees the apple flicker with color. Why does this happen to him? Why doesn't it happen to anyone else? Remember, there is nothing biologically special about Jonas, he has not been specially \\"bred\\" to be a Receiver of Memories. He never gets any special education. Why can't anyone else in the village pass memories with a touch or see flickers of color?Why does this society keep a Receiver of Memories? Because the Receiver of Memories has Knowledge of How Things Used To Be, the Receiver can advise the Council on their decisions. For example, the Council of Elders suggests that if more babies are born then there will be more Laborers to get the work done. But the Receiver of Memories can recall a time when there was starvation, and therefore advises them not to grow their population. This is illogical. Why not grow more food? Why not have everyone skip one meal a week? Why not kill all the old people sooner and use their food? (In this ideal world, the elderly are sent to a retirement home, where they are treated nicely for a few years, and then they are killed. Why not just kill them right away - there would be more food for the healthy young Laborers, and the people who currently work in the nursing home would be free to do other tasks.)One of the key points in the story is when Jonas learns that his father has killed one of the new born identical twins. Why does his father kill one? Because it would be too hard to tell identical twins apart! You would think a society that values conformity would want their citizens to look as alike as possible, that way no one would be too ugly or too beautiful. Why does his father hide the fact that he killed the twin? In this society, nobody is allowed to lie. Why does he used the word \\"released\\" instead of saying his killed the baby? In this book we are given multiple examples of how important it is to use the accurate words - for example, Jonas uses the word \\"love\\" in conversation and his family corrects him. Indeed, the book opens with Jonas frightened by an airplane flying overhead, but then he corrects himself and uses the proper word - he wasn't frightened, he was apprehensive. If the society is so precise in its word usage, why does it say \\"released\\" instead of killed?Why does a plane flying overhead frighten Jonas? It should be routine to see a plane in the air, the planes land at the edge of the village with cargo all the time. After Jonas makes his escape, planes fly overhead searching for him - but won't these planes frighten all the other people who remain in their villages? Why use planes to look for him - they know he is on a stolen bicycle carrying Gabe, so obviously Jonas is escaping along the road - just put up a few road blocks!! There is no logic in anything that happens in this novel.At the end of the novel, Jonas makes his way to the society that is just like our world - with snow and lights and families. But if it is just like our world, it is also full of violence, crime and poverty. Jonas probably ends up in a foster home, abused and treated terribly. Why don't these other people, who know about violence and warfare, invade the Utopian societies? In our world, if a country was as defenseless as the Utopians, then they would be quickly conquered. A dictator would lead an army to overrun the stupid villages, and they would all be \\"released\\"!I can't believe the Giver won a Newberry award. It is riddled with inconsistencies, portrays an unbelievable world (no warmth in sunshine? No color?), and doesn't properly get across its intended Message. What a lousy book. Good thing it was short and I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really wanted to like this one too...I enjoy the dystopia type society and what could be world. I was into this about the first 50 pages or so and then the rest of the book just left me feeling bleh. It's been done before and better with A Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451. (with the first two, so I've been told, but with Fahrenheit definitely.)I got the feeling throughout the last half of the book that she was telling me what was good and what was bad and how I should feel. Like with The Adoration of Jenna Fox I want these types of books to lay out the questions and themes without answering them for me.I can see why people enjoy this book; it's horrific and kind of thrusts the creepiness and icky factor upon you with a sense of relief that you're sure glad your life isn't like this...but it just answered for me instead letting me answer for myself. I guess it's an OK read if you don't try to take too many things from it, but I know Lowry was trying to teach here and thus my displeasure."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The writer has a high opinion of herself. In my opinion. She tried too hard to condense a surrel idea tightly between the covers of a short novel. There are questions left unanswered at the end and for Lowry to say in the interview that it is \\"up to the reader to decide\\" is confirmation of the fact that she has no idea herself what the ending is. Being esoteric and mysterious is not the answer. To live like they did in the story takes fear,(flying a plane), love (bringing up a child) and anger (bringing up a child). Ludicrous to think such tasks are impossible without the associated emotions. For a start.At the end, he glides through the snow towrds the light and the music.

The storyline and plot of the book was entertaining. It was creative, and I did like it. I found the actually story to be hard to get into though, but that was mostly because of the writing style. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the fantasy or futuristic type stories. The ideas in the plot were original, but sometimes it got a little confusing what the characters were talking about or meant - especially in the beginning of the book. I felt that the wording the author used made parts of the story a little boring, but other parts kept you interested in reading more. I would rate The Giver three stars because the story itself was good, it just needed to be written with a little bit different words, so that the story flowed more."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book had a good plot. However, the author didn't do an exceptional job describing the communist-like enviorment. In the &quot;community&quot;, where the story is set, everyone works for the good of the community. In this so-called perfect world which Lois Lowry has set the story, everyone is the same. Jonas, the main character in the story, gets his role in the community at the age of twelve along with all of the other children his age. He gets the role of reciever meaning he gets memories from the Giver. No one else in the community has the memories. As the plot thickens, Jonas tried to leave the community so that in turn the rest of the community will receive the memories. I disliked this book since it doesn't relate to our lives and the community is a fantasy world that we won't ever experience. The author also left out a lot of essential parts of the story including an introduction and an ending! Parts of the story were vague."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really like this book because it makes you think about what life could be like if everything was the same. The story is about Jonas, a boy who lives in a community where there is a condition called &quot;Sameness&quot;. Sameness is when all people are the same. No color is seen. There is a rule for everything. When Jonas is selected as Receiver of Memory, an honored postion of the only person who has memories of what life used to be like, he learns of all the things that used to occur and do not anymore. He is unhappy, and wants to get out of Sameness and into &quot;Elsewhere&quot;. Lois Lowry has such a great writing style and I love to read her books. She is so descriptive and she makes you feel like you're there, living the story with Jonas. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites. It has got to be one of the best books of all time. Yes I'm being sappy, but The Giver shows people that yes there is pain in life, but look at all you have!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a outstanding book about a community that is perfect until one boy changes it. The Giver is moderately simple but awesome. It begins as if everything is perfect until Jonas gets his new job as The Receiver. My story has a little bit of mystery.The mystery is:Is Jonas seeing things? What is going to become of him? The main characters are Jonas and the Giver; they both are virtuous. If you like intense stories you'll love The Giver. It's all yours."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is really great for people that think about things in a different way then most people would. I think this book would be pretty confusing for smaller children. The first time I read it, I was even sort of confused! It is about a world where everything is the same. There is a special commitee that makes all of the choices for the people. They choose the people's occupation, spouse, children and other things. In the community is a boy named Jonas. When it is his time to recieve what job he will take on he recives the one called &quot;The Reciever&quot; The reciever is the one person in the community that has memories of all the things of our world. When Jonas learns the truth of things, he decides to put things right in his community. This is a very interesting book that really makes you think of things in a totally different light. I hope you enjoy &quot;The Giver&quot; by Lois Lowry."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is really great for people that think about things in a different way then most people would.

I felt the emotion that Jonas felt. Jonas had been deprived of feelings and color. We might wish for an 'eequal' world, but this book changed my point of view on that subject. I think that this book must be read. It teaches so much. If you want a book with symbolism this is the book is the book. Jonas is proving that things can be changed. I think that his attitude in his life should be shared. This was an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought tha book The Giver was a good book. It was interesting to thinkabout our community and how much better it is than Jona's. In tha book The Giver, Jonas lived in a community where everything was the same.They can't see color or pick their own jobs. Communities today are a lot different. The ending was a lot better than the beggining because Jonas could die and second. Every move he makes counts. The beginning just explained what his community was like and it got boring after a while."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is a young boy about to start the rest of his life in a world that has no feelings, color, nothing to make things separate from everything else. There are rules for everything, no words of meaning for anything, and all that is done is to protect the town from the dangers of the way things used to be.When you are born, you do not have a mother and father with whom you grow up. After birth, you are given a name, and then given to a new family who will raise you. Each year in honor of your birth, a ceremony is held for you and the others in your group. On some ceremonies you are given new clothes, one you a haircut, one a new bicycle, but the most important ceremony of all is the ceremony of 12. The ceremony of 12 is very special, for that is when you find out what job you will be given to have as long as you work. (When you are growing up, before the ceremony of 12, you begin to volunteer at a job site that interests you, and that could help determine your life long job.)The elders in the town all live in a home until they are released. No one knows what it is like or what happens at a release, and no one talks about anyone being released.Some of the elders are in charge of assigning the 12's their jobs. So at the ceremony of 12's, going through the numbers of the children, Jonas waited to be called on. For some time now he had been wondering and worrying about what his job would be, and noticing some strange things happening to him that he could not explain, but would later find out, that had to do with his job. When Jonas' turn came to receive his job, everyone fell silent as he was passed. His number had not been called. All through the rest of the ceremony Jonas wondered what could have happened. How could they have passed him? But his question was answered soon enough. When the ceremony ended, an announcement was made that one of the numbers had been passed. Not forgotten, but passed for a reason. Jonas was then called to the stage like all the other numbers had been, and was told that the job he was about to receive was the most important job of all. Jonas was to be the new Receiver. His training would start soon and his duties were not to be spoken of. He had a new set of rules to follow now. The Receiver was to spend his training hours with the old Receiver, also called the Giver. The Giver was very old and would soon be released. But before he can be released he must give all of his memories, good and bad, to the Receiver. The Receiver's job then came into affect. He was to hold all the memories for the entire town, so that they wouldn't have mixed feelings and not know what to do. It was his job to protect the town from having the feelings they never had before.The Giver is a great book that portrays the life of a young boy having to reach adulthood quickly, experience true pain and happiness, and meet all the challenges thrown his way. To meet the responsibilities as the Receiver, to follow all the new rules, to receive all the memories, to protect the town from the memories, and the journey that lies ahead for Jonas to be able to do all that he must, and to also change the town in a way that could ruin everything or make it a better place, the way it once was long ago."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would give the book &quot;The Giver&quot; 5 stars because it was very interesting and ordinary. But there were some parts in the book that were sort of inappropriate for young adolescents, Like the part when they stuck a needle through a babies head, which was called &quot;release.&quot; There are some parts that are so heart- warming and so touching that it astounded me. I love the part when Jonas risks his life for a baby named Gabrial. This book is highly recomended. 5 stars!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverThe novel, the Giver, by Lois Lowry is about a boy who is called Jonas. Helives in a community which seems to be a perfect world. In the Ceremony of 12Jonas becomes the new Receiver of Memory. His live changes rapidely, becausehe learns how the real world looks like. At last he escapes.We find that its a nice story. The first part of the story was very boring,because it describes the Community. When Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memorythe story began to be exciting. In the whole story there is not muchaction!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is more than a book for young people. Its unusual approach to a too perfect world will leave more mature readers considering some of today's social practices. Lowry uses everyday characters in this utopia to ease the reader into her spellbinding fantasy. After one too many murder mysteries, I found this story to be refreshing but never predictable. This book calls into question the practice of euphemizing the truth for children. Clearly, this story points out the importance of valuing all stages of human life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book in elementary school shortly after it came out. The book was shocking and disturbing to me then. Now, the book provides a striking commentary and warning about and to modern society. In this age, when genetic and psychological manipulation does not seem far-fetched, Lowry's story depicts a world where a centrally-controlled, perfectionistic society proves that man cannot be truly happy and determine the most fundamental relationships of society. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was asked to read this book because it was assigned to 5th grade students. I must admit I had a variety of feelings concerning book as I read through the pages. My first reaction was of concern for the life style and some of the situations described. As I read further, I began to see some real value to the story and actually did enjoy the book. However, I do have concerns about this book being assigned to children younger than in the 7th or 8th grade. There is alot in this book which I think would be better for older children to read and discuss....not 11 year olds. Parents, if your child is asked to read this book or wants to read it on his/her own, I highly suggest that you read it first. If you think it is appropriate for your child, please take the time for discussion afterwards. This is not a light-hearted book....."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I REALLY LOVE THIS BOOK.ITS SO GOOD. I FIND IT VERY TOUCHING AT THE END OF THE BOOK.TO FIND OUT WHAT I THINK IS TOUCHING GO READ IT.SO BUY IT."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a wonderful book that helps us remember what is truly important. Loes Lowry is a master storyteller who paints a picture of a Utopian world in which everyone is confident and happy but a chosen few. Is this the only way that we can truly be free of our modern problems? The story of the giver is nearly as sad as it is compelling."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I enjoyed the Giver emmensely. Most of the charechtors were fake which once you read the book you will realise why that is a good thing. It is written in first person and that weaves a beautiful taspetry of words. Th e plot is very well done. But I believe that some people find it threatening. I would not recomend this book for anybody under 10 because it is very insightful book and it would be hard to really get what was going on. Not that a 9 year old couldn't understand the words its tht may have trouble grasping the concept."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver may have won the Newberry Book Award, but there are acouple of places in the book that didn't make sense, such as the ending.

What exactly happened to him?We as a class hade to read this book and are tolled to write a review at Amazon, because thats were we got the books.

I am only up to chapter 2 so I'm not that familiar with the book. I have a question for Lois Lowry. Why did you choose to capitilize PILOT and SEVENS, EIGHTS, ELEVENS... and so on? That is really wierd. I don't get it. So far I like the book but there is a lot of hard vocabulary. I hope people like me will read THE GIVER and enjoy it as much as I do."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry has crafted a book that is as challenging for adults as it is appropriate for middle-schoolers.

This book is fabulous! The action is &quot;edge of your seat&quot; reading! READ IT!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book. It keeps you thinking because the author leaves many things for you as the reader, to decide what they mean. I would reccomend this book to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that the book was great. My class read it for a project and we all loved it. I, including the rest of the students, read ahead of the schedule because we couldn't wait the extra day to see what happened. Although, at some spots of the book, it seems a little non-informative, it is still a great book. I would incourage everyone to read this book. You can sometimes predict what will happen but anyone would like it. At first, I thought that it was far-fetched, but it speeds up and you get caught in the book. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; was one of the most unique books I've read. It's somewhat like a folklore with a story based on a society that isn't real in comparison with today's society which is filled with a variety of people and styles. The people in the controlled community are like robots with no variation and no feelings. Since the people in the community chose not to have feelings, they gave the responsibility of carrying everyone's feelings to a chosen one such as Jonas and The Giver.The &quot;shared rememberence&quot; between Jonas and The Giver resembles a fortune teller showing someone's future or a witch implanting images or thoughts one may or may not want in their minds."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book, for a couple of reasons. One is that it subtly incorporates the concept of traditions and urban legends. Because this community didn't have any folklore, just rules and regulations, there was nothing to tie the community together. The only reason why the community felt any connection was because they were ingrained with the sense that they were a part of the community since they were born. But what community were they really apart of? Without the stories that are passed down from generation to generation, there is no real link. There are superficial links, necessary for order and survival, but when you come right down to it, there is nothing. This book reminds us of that, and teaches us to not take our roots for granted. The other thing I like about The Giver is that it makes the reader pause and reflect on his or her own life. What would we do if we didn't have any choices, not even what we eat for breakfast? I for one would go crazy. It makes us appreciate the choices we have in life, even the ones we really don't want to make."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was a great book. The intensity and realism of the book made me want to read and read and read. There was something about the book that didn't make it so mickey mousy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a good laugh."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"was not way beyond expectations. It was based on a utopian society, without feelings. Only the Receiver of Memory and The Giver knows the truth from the past. Now Jonas, the Receiver of Memory, has had enough. Without feelings its not worth living. He's on his way through elsewhere in search for a place where people have memories and there's no turning back. I like the way the book was told, but the ending wasn't bad or good, in the middle rather."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I felt that it was a cool book and was very creative. I now feel that I can appreciate my life more, because I know how much worse it could be. I liked it becasue it was original and now I know how bad our past and present are very painful and this is going to effect our future generations. It taught me that we should try to make our environment a better place for us and the people of the next generation. I alos liked the ending because it left you hanging. Some people don't appreciate that, but I do because it can leave the rest to your imagination."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We thought these people were completely satisfy with ignorance because they just did everything they were told to do and had no idea what they were missing. We liked that the author introduced to us a whole different view point of what a Utopian society is."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Bizarre, disturbing, twisted: that is what I think of the Giver.Imagine a world where you are told how to act, think, and what your future is going to be. That is the life of Jonas in which there is no laughter, no color, and no induviduality. As Jonas reaches twelve his life changes forever as his place in society.As the new \\"Receiver of Memories\\" Jonas finds out the powerful memnories of the community. He also learns that his predacessor went stir crazy and \\"released\\" herself. As he sees these memories Jonas realizes that there's trouble in paradise. As yu read this book the plot thickens as Jonas suffers a blow on the homefront. It's a great book, but quite on the eerie side."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a book written by Lois Lowry. I think she was trying to tell everyone that there's a possibility there's more out there than we even know about. The book's about a community where you go to school,do volunteer work, the meals are brought to your family and you have a choice to have a spouse or childeren. Everyone has there birthdays together every year. When you turn twelve they try to help find out what your's good at and what you like. Then they tell you what you'll do for the rest of your life in that community. A boy turned twelve he was chosen to be a very powerfull leader in his community. He has no rules. He findes out what his father does and what things meant in the community. The way things were wants to changes things but, how would he go about that. I think its a good book to read for someone who dont like to read it kinda gets your attention."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is written for teens, and I as an adult could not put it down once I started it, I mean I sat and read it from beginning to end, no breaks. This is the only book I have ever done that with. I was facinated with the society, where everyone is given volunteer work as a older child and then a career is determined for you by a group of older members (of the society). Jonas is given an unusual assignment: The Giver. It is very secretive and he is not allowed to share his learnings with anyone. I was compelled by this society that tries to make life good for everyone but yet contains such subtle horrors: such as if a twin is born, one must be killed! And then there is what is revealed to Jonas through an old man called the Giver, that Jonas didn't even know about love (amongst other things!) I recommend that if you haven't read this yet, READ IT s it is a quite facinating and different book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This incredible book had me hanging on till the end! I couldn't belive the incredible twists and turns! In a society where the leaders choose everything, your spouse, your profession and your children, a boy stands out. He is the chosen one. He is going to be the most crucial part of their society.You have got to read this book! It's fantastic!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver-a book dealing with the possible development of societies searching for perfection.Jonas, a twelve year old boy, lives in such a community,whose only aim is to achieve sameness and free its citizens of wrong decisions.Throughout his development as a \\"Receiver Of Memory\\" he finds out the faults and mistakes of the system.Lois Lowry illustrates Jonas\`development very carefully and it seems as if she actually once lived in that community.The book does never seem exaggerated, it only descibes a possible way our lifes could one time look like.She includes criticism in cloning,A.I. and change of DNA in \\"The Giver\\". It is not only a science-fiction book,but also a scream for showing more feelings in our computer-ruled society of today."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in world where everything is under control. Everything is planned out for everyone, and everyone is the same. If someone breaks a rule, they are released from the community. Jonas is selected to be the next 'Receiver of Memories' the person who gathers the memories of the past. This job includes pain, sorrow, and happiness. Jonas realizes that the world he lives in is not all that great after all.I have heard that this book has been banned from some schools, and personally, I think that is ridiculous. These are the only reasons that the book has been banned: a 12 year old having sensual feelings toward a girl he likes, and injecting a deadly needle into someone who is being released. Ok, well the injecting is not really pleasant, but the reader does not need to focus on that. For this book focuses on more important issues that that.The Giver gives an important message to people: Living in a world where there is independence and choices is better than living in a world where everything is perfect.Lois Lowry did an awesome job making this book. I like the way she always kind of hinted that the perfect world was not that good after all. I recommend this book to people ages 10 and up.HAPPY READING!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a really thought provoking book, and ventures into a realm that nearly everybody, secretly wants.

You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"No one can truly review this book because it has many meanings within it that speak differently to different personalities. This is a beautifull book that for most, helps them realize that they shouldnt take things for granted. To some this is religious.

Anyone should read this book because it will open your mind to new thoughts."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was one of the best books that I have ever read.I had to read the book for school and at first I thought it would be very boring because normally, school books are. The Giver made me see things in a whole new perspective. Jonas' world is one without weather, feelings, color, animals or diseases. Nobody ever feels pain or experiences bad weather. Jonas realises this when he becomes the receiver of memory. He starts to see the Giver who transfers memories over to Jonas. Memories about color, kittens, Christmas, warefare and more. For the first time, Jonas sees how limited his community is and becomes very angry. He cannot understand why nobody can experience colors or choice. Everything is done for them, including their jobs and who they marry.Lois Lowry writes the most extrodinary and breathetaking book I have ever read. I urge any and everyone to pick up this amazing book. It will definitely be worth your while."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that this book was OK. In parts of the book you would just think, \\"When is this going to end?\\" But then towards the end of the book it got a little better and more interesting.

In every family their has to be two kids Female and male and a mom and dad. The elders of the comunity choose your job when you turn 12 years old.

I've told all of my friends about this great book and they enjoy it too."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverBy Lois LowryThe Giver is about a future society where everything has gone to \\"sameness.\\" The weather, colors, and daily routine are the same for everybody in the community every single day. The government has done this to create a \\"perfect\\" life for everyone. They have completely eliminated choices! The only problem is that they have to store the memories with one person. No one else besides the Receiver knows a thing about the past,. It is a huge burden to bear. The Giver, the old Receiver, and Jonas, the young, new Receiver have decided that it is time to release memories to the rest of the community.Through this book, Lois Lowry warns against the dangers of losing our rights of basic freedom. This book has been banned because of the references to euthanasia, infanticide, and violence and sexuality, but I feel that this book is appropriate for the age group to which it was directed. The issues that this book reveals are very real in today's times and today's children are the ones who need to learn how to deal with these topics. I feel that she did a favor for the society of the future by introducing young readers to these topics that could very possibly get out of hand if not dealt with."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowry is an exceptional book to say the least. It grabbes your eye and your attention and takes you along for a whirlwind ride to a time and place unimaginable to even the most creative of minds.Within a moment of opening the book, one is thrashed abrubtly into a fairy tale land in which emotions and freedom of choice are nonexistant. What I particuarly liked about this book was its ability to strech ones mind and imagination far beyond any normal boundaries. Being an American citizen and thus, accustomed to the American belief systems of freedom of choice, speech, religion, ext. it was fascinating to visit a place which was the complete antithesis of all that America stands for. One almost wonders while reading &quot;The Giver&quot; whether the major conceptual ideas relate to world history, with possibly America as &quot;Elsewhere&quot; which Jonas and The Giver frequently talk about, and a communist/fascist/dictatorship being where they are up until that point. I am unaware at this point during which time peroid &quot;The Giver&quot; was written, however, it is an interesting thought to say the least.Regardless, although I thought The Giver's compliance with Jonas's precipitious ideas came rather quickly (their runaway mission to Elsewhere), prehaps too quickly to say the least, I enjoyed the book and would list that as my only complaint if asked to do so. Also, I thought &quot;The Giver&quot; was extremly well written and not too verbose as many novels tend to with their superflous words which only confuse and slow the process of reading as opposed to intriguing and interesting which they are intended to do.Therefore, I truely enjoy the book &quot;The Giver&quot; and would recommend it to anyone looking for an escape, as I was at the time. For &quot;The Giver&quot; does just that, takes you to a faraway land where you can forget all your troubles and bask in the simple pleasures that belong (hopefully) to you, such as freedom of speech, religion, ext., that unfourtunatly, Jonas did not."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As I began this story I really enjoyed it. I love stories involving utopias and this book embodies such a society perfectly. But as you round towards the end of the book in utter excitement the story takes a turn that I found disapointing.

I am sure everyone has their own idea of an &quot;ideal world&quot; and I could bet most would view that a real utopia allowed the people within more freedom of decision and action."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My family is working our way through Newbery books, as our bedtime read aloud novels. I read this book before reading it to my children and was glad that I did. I felt that the subject matter was too sophisticated and intense (a la Brave New World) for my kids -- all under 9.

I did, however, enjoy the book myself."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is of a boy that lives in a world without color, excitement, fun, or anything out of the ordinary.

Although the story is a science fiction story I really liked it.The story seems less unrealistic as it seems at first sight.It makes you think about the problems of progress and genetic manipulation without seeming to be a warning.The resder likes to read the book chapter by chapter in order to experience something new.Life is described in details and the reader can form a clear picture what life in the community is like and what the different characters in the book are feeling.The story has an open ending.The reader doesn't really get to know what happens to Jonas or the community.I would have liked to know it but this ending only makes you hope that everything changes for the better."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think &quot;The Giver is a very good book which touches the worries we have - that one day there will perhaps be a planned society by gen manipulation.

For years I didn't know I had missed anything. What I realize now is that I lacked the adult that could steer me toward enjoyable but well written and thought provoking novels for young adults. My English teacher was busy pushing the classics and I can't fault her for that. The school librarian was more of a multi-media manager and while I liked him and spent hours in the library, I can't remember him ever suggesting a book. My parents weren't big readers at the time and my \\"adult friend/mentor\\" was letting me borrow her Jack Weyland novels.This is what I regret now as I discover amazingly well written Young Adult novels such as The Giver by Lois Lowry (I do remember reading her Anastasia books). During a conversation with a friend last week who had borrowed and read my copies of the Hunger Games trilogy, she asked if I had ever read The Giver. I had not. Neal is assigned to read Lowry's novel Number the Stars this month for school, so while I was buying it, I added The Giver to the order.The Giver is a dystopian novel. Published in 1993, it predates the current popular dystopian novels and it is obvious that it inspired at least a few of them. Living in a \\"utopian\\" society, Jonas and all the other twelve year old children are given their work assignments at a ceremony. Surprisingly, Jonas's assignment is a great and rare honor. He will be the new Receiver of Memories. The former Receiver becomes The Giver as he transfers all the memories to Jonas.The Giver is cerebral. It has depth and symbolism and irony and wit and could have inspired a very interesting discussion in my high school English class (I graduated in 1993, so I would have missed it even if my teacher had included Young Adult lit in her curriculum). It is a beautiful novel--one that I will suggest to all the young and old adults within my meager influence."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I LOVE the book The Giver, which is why I was so excited to see a gift edition. I bought this because it looked genuinely deluxe. Well, it really isn't.The illustrations in the text are nice, but the binding of the book is a big disappointment. That lovely image shown above is not what the physical book looks like, it is merely an image printed onto a dust jacket. I was expecting something along the lines of the gift edition of Lamb by Christopher Moore (seen here [..])Don't buy this if you are expecting something really special. If you just want an illustrated copy, then this might be fine. For me, it's just a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book many years ago, and had re-read this book once again. Finished it just now, and must say that it has lead me to contemplate life, the meaning of it, how precious your choices are, and how expressive and individual humanity needs to be. I'm not going to add to the details, as I see there's an abundant of that in previous reviews before mine.I just wanted to add my spark of praise to the book. It even manage to strike a few tears from me.It granted me more insight than I had collected when I first read the book as a teen. Giving me such a gift automatically makes it live up to it's own title: \\"The Giver\\""},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I should probably preface this review by saying that I first read this amazing novel in the 7th grade (age 13). I say this because of the many 1-star reviews warning parents of the \\"dangers\\" of children reading this book. I have to agree with this on some levels, but probably not on the level as most of the reviewers. More on this later.The Giver is a very complex and enthralling novel about what life would be like if our society strived to exist as a \\"perfect\\" utopia-like community. Jonas, along with all his friends, have their careers chosen for them, the less intelligent children being forced into laborers or \\"birthmothers\\". Jonas is decided by the elders to be a very special child, and is sent to study with an old man who can transfer memories of a distant life to him. Jonas must now carry the burden of these memories alone.The overall tone of the novel I found to be quite sorrowful. From The Giver's own loss to the society's way of dealing with overpopulation, I found myself tearing up on occasion. The idea that no one, except perhaps for Jonas and the Giver, can experience \\"love\\" is just beyond horrible. However, there were many parts of the novel I found to be uplifting and just plain fun to read, such as the interaction between Jonas and his sister, Lilly.Bringing in my original statements about children reading this, I do feel that the novel's true meaning might be a little out of reach for younger children. That would be my one reservation when recommending it. HOWEVER, I don't think denying this book to children simply because of the \\"violent\\" sections (it was what, one paragraph?) is doing anyone any good. If a child has the intellectual capacity to understand the book's point, let them read it. I read it at the young age of 13 and have read it many, many times since. While I found the goings-on of the society quite shocking, I did not have nightmares and to be quite honest, I found myself remembering other parts of the book more than the parts that seem to be so controversial on here.My point is, this book is a classic. Every now and then, I find myself picking it up and reading it in the span of a few hours. Each and every time, I gain a new perspective on the characters and story. It's one that should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lowry, L. (1993). The giver. New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell Books for Young ReadersSynopsis: Life is perfect when everything is given to you. Jonas lives a happy life with his family unit. All his life, Jonas has lived in utopia, a perfect society where no one feels pain, experiences starvation or is ever left to want more. There are no wars, crimes or fears in his world. There are rules and guidelines for how each person dresses, wears their hair, and apologizes for transgressions. Everything is under perfect control. Or so it seems! On his 12th birthday, Jonas receives an important assignment and has no idea how it will change his life forever. After the assignment ceremony, nothing remains the same. Suddenly Jonas' world is turned upside down. All the value he found in his life is now a web of lies and a controlled environment. Set in a futuristic small community environment, Jonas, who has been sheltered from pain and pleasure his whole life, will now become The Receiver of these suppressed memories from the community's past. As he receives memories, Jonas realizes that all the choices in life are made for the citizens by the Elders. He begins to understand that the control of their entire lives is the price that the citizens must pay for the community's utopian society. Once Jonas receives the truth, it \\"colors\\" his whole world forever.Evaluation: Readers quickly realize this story is fantasy. When Jonas describes the \\"sameness\\", population control, lack of pain, suffering and pleasure, the reader is sure to understand that Jonas' world is a utopian society full of necessity and lacking freedom of choices. The citizens' experiences do not include color, music, or love. When Jonas realizes the level of control in his society, he uses this knowledge to become assertive and change his destiny. Lowry carefully balances the values of freedom with the necessity of security in our lives. The plot is full of surprises and leaves readers hanging on the edge of their seats. This book provides an abundance of conversational topics appropriate in multiple settings. Used in the home or school environments, children are encouraged to analyze the benefits and deficits of a society like Jonas'. Educators are bound to use this text to compare students' lives with Jonas'. Students aged 10-17 are likely to find this story captivating."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My middle school teacher recently used \\"The Giver\\" for a reading class assignment. Several years ago I read \\"Gathering Blue\\" for my own enjoyment. Both of these books are by the author Lois Lowry.Overall, I think these books are great. In \\"The Giver\\", Lois Lowry creates a world where society is peaceful but very boring. The people in the Community know nothing about true pain, or love, or death because they are sheltered from it. At birth, they are born into a world which is shielded from anything in life that can harm them physically or mentally. Lois Lowry uses interesting dialogue and unexpected plot twists to keep the reader interested in this world and its people. The main characters are mostly children around 7 to 12 years old. Some adults interact with these characters. Some are teachers and others are parents. In fact, The Giver himself is an old man.I would not say that this is a happy book. In fact, there are some disturbing ideas in it. There is a part of the book that refers to children being deliberately killed.The parents of younger readers may not want their children exposed to this kind of subject matter.However, I and other kids in my class found Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" to be a very interesting read. I loved it, and went on to read her book \\"The Messenger\\" which uses characters from The Giver and Gathering Blue.If you like science fiction/fantasy literature, then you might like these books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really can't describe the impact this book left on my life. I was originally assigned to read this for my philosophy class and its been a big life changer since. The book is a quick read, and seeing its under 2 dollars used, I would say its definitely worth the time to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's eye opening novel, The Giver, really does make you think, ''Is the grass greener on the other side?''The story takes place in an imaginary, timeless society where people are assigned roles or tasks in life, even child bearing and memories. Twelve year old Jonas lived a very normal life in his community. With strict rules and many deadlines to follow, everything was perfect and as normal as could be. All that changed when he is assigned the job of Reciever of Memory. The Giver, a very old man, was very nice and wise. He withheld many secrets awaiting his new Reciever. Jonas takes on many wonderful memories, yet harsh ones too, especially when he finds out the terrible truth about the Community, their past, and himself!My favorite scene is when he is recieving the memory of when the people are poaching an elephant and when they run away from the dead animal with its tusks. Another elephant comes out and gives a big roar and places a tree branch covered in leaves on the body and walks away. To me that is very touching and shows that even the animals are very loving. Jonas found it very sad because he had not ever seen anything die. It showed great feeling to people or things we care about, but Jonas was very saddened by the elephant who died and the elephart that was left behind.I say this book was very good. At the beginning, it was a little confusing, but it all folds out it the end. It really makes you think about differences of how you and Jonas live. This book was just right for me. I found it fun to read and would recommend it to anyone. You will find great descriptions and a wonderful imagination, so if you like to be on the edge of your seat while reading, go get that book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this book was AWESOME! i loved it. i thought it was very interesting. the book is about a boy named Jonas in the future. he lives in a perfect community. he becomes the reciever of memory and has a very importiant job. this is a book everyone should read. there are alot of good points in this book. you will never expect what happens next."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought this was a very thought provoking and well written book. It's an easy book to read (most people probably read it in a day or two). This would be a perfect book for people who enjoy going to book clubs and discussing a book. You could have a discussion on it for hours.I however DID NOT like how the ending ended like that..... leaving it up for you to decide how you wanted it to end. The book needed to go into a more detailed ending leaving it as it did to me was a little unacceptable. (But that's why it is also a good book to discuss in a book club)I thought the book also did a poor job of explaining things that are kind of important like why no one could see color, how the Giver can pass on a memory with only a touch of his hand.... etc.....Regardless of the ending I think its great that elementary/junior high schools are having kids read this book. It's a book that's easy to read, it makes you think, it's a book that gives you something to talk about, it's a book where you can draw several different opinions on and have a very lively discussion which is all the qualities you look for in a book, especially for young people whose minds are still developing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book about 5 years ago at the age of 12 or a little younger. I thought It was amazing. I love the \\"utopian\\" community idea Lowry used. I loved how the boy in the story was the only one who got to see the memories of colorful sailboats and happy thoughts and music. I cried when the boy gave the baby a memory of a colorful sailboat to comfort him. The last chapter is my absolute favorite. I really do advise you to read this book and other books by Lois Lowry. I'm also in love with her book Gathering Blue which has the same \\"utopian\\" society. I read that book years ago too and fell in love with it. Come to think of it I should reread it sometime.thank you for you time,Loranp.s.- definitely read this book and Lowry's other bookGathering Blue."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"After reading this book years ago, I came across the title when searching for a book for a younger cousin. This book is capable of conveying several observations without requiring a thousand pages to do it. This ability is very similar to how Billy Budd and Bartleby, the Scrivner(in my opinion)far surpasses Moby Dick as the best of Herman Melville, yet both are often overlooked for their compact size. This book is far too oftern overlooked as being a \\"children's\\" book. I believe as an \\"adult\\" it is these terms which narrow the mind. It is as absurd as considering Oliver Twist just for children. As far as the plot goes, consider this the \\"youth-friendly\\" version of Ayn Rand's Anthem. It is an excellent read; heavy, yet hopeful."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book. This was one of my favorite books. I love to read and reading that book makes me want to read more. I buy at least one book each year and i will buy the Giver this year.Next time I look for a book to check in i will look for one by Lois Lowry."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In the beginning, the book is a little hard to understand, but once you do not want to put it down. It is a great book with a good plot and it has a lot of unexpeted turns. Jonas lives in a community where everything is suposed to be perfect, but as you keep reading you find out what they are missing. The Giver is a great book with an ending that makes you want to read more."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, an amazing book you need to make time for. In the begining of the book, it is slightly confusing and yet fun at the same time. Jonas the main charicter brings what perfestion is like right out in the open, and is yet has a mysterious side. The Giver gives memories and is liike god to Jonas because he is a teacher. I was assighned to read only a certian amount of the book at a time and it was torturous. You will not want to put this book down. This book is amazing!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Why this book is pigeonholed as Children's Literature is a mystery to me, perhaps merely because the protagonist is a twelve-year old, perhaps owing to the author's past works--I'm just glad to have found it. \\"The Giver\\" treats the most profound issues in a manner that speaks of deep understanding; the book will ring you like a bell, the ideas resonate and can not be forgotten. For this reason I call this the rarest of books; once read it will immediately and forever be a part of the reader--in a sense, our author becomes her own creation, she becomes the Giver of memory and her reader a Receiver.It is a spare presentation of a dystopic future world where the \\"problems\\" of humanity have all been neatly resolved; everyone is polite, happy with their job, unthreatened by pain, sickness, conflict and even death. Though it becomes quickly evident that what the author really gives us is a rather convincing rationalization for the fact that evil, pain and suffering are necessary. Foes of religious belief often claim that the idea of pain and suffering is inconsistent with a loving God; but, even for the secular among us, Ms. Lowry shows how suffering and joy are linked. \\"The Giver\\" argues that granting unlimited license to those who would sacrifice individual choice in their attempts to achieve relief from war, famine and economic inequality could very well eliminate that which makes life worth living. \\"The Giver\\" says much about the danger of placing the interests of the community above the interests of individuals.To say much about the story risks spoiling the slow exposition of the underlying flaws in the utopia, which was exceptionally well paced. At first the \\"community\\" seems vaguely creepy, by the end of the book it is horrifying. \\"The Giver\\" is a novel of ideas that begs to be discussed and argued over as the part of any moral education. It is powerful beyond my ability to express and like any truth, it offers something of value to any reader at any level.Highest Recommendation."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and looking back I realize it has an amazing plot. Though the theme of government control and totalitarianism is evident in many books, this specific story is very original in its field. I particularly liked the loss of seeing color in this futuristic society and the whole idea of \\"release\\" if a citizen didn't meet certain standards.Though the plot is enough to make you shiver with excitement, the writing destroyed it for me. Lowry disappointed me with a dry narrative and not enough suspense. The main character Jonas seems to take himself too seriously for a boy of twelve, even before he finds out about what he is training for. Since the society he lives in is not powerful enough to control the mentality of a child, it is Jonas's own personality, one that seems unlikely for a boy of his age.For a book about government corruption and control, I would recomment something riveting and suspenseful, such as I Am the Cheese by Robert Cormier, rather than The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book is somewhat creepy through the idea of Sameness but delivers the message of individualism and courage. I would recommend this book to everyone who thinks you need to be society to be part of society."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I give \\"The Giver\\", by Lois Lowry, a four-star rating. I think that if the author would have explained things, such as \\"release\\", sonner, the book would have been easier to understand. However, the storyline was wonderful. Jonas lives in a community where nothing ever goes wrong. There is no crime, no poverty, no hunger, nothing. The people of the community are put in groups by age. For example, the nine year olds are the \\"Nines\\", the ten year olds are the \\"Tens\\", etc. When a peron becomes a \\"Twelve\\", they are given their \\"assignment\\", or job. I enjoyed the suspense Lois Lowry gave to the story while the \\"Twelves\\" were being called one-by-one to recieve there assignments. Jonas is made the \\"Reciever of Memory\\", a very honorable position in the community. However, he is soon questioning his ability to uphold his responsibility. It comes with pain and terror. But at the same time, it comes with pleasure and joy. The Giver and Jonas decide on a plan to end the pain and terror in the memories...I am a seventh grader and I would suggest this book to any interested readers. I would also suggest \\"The Bridge to Terabithia\\", by Katherine Paterson, \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", by C.S. Lewis, and \\"Number the Stars\\", by Lois Lowry."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It's dark and shocking! Therefore, Lois Lowry's 'The Giver' is not what you might expect from a children's book. It's still very good though.I think it makes some valid points. For example, if we try to hard to be perfect, we will end up destroying each other in the process. However, if we don't care how our lives work out, the same result is likely to happen due to our, um, laziness.On the subject of it being dark and shocking, I think it needed to be that way because that's how it sticks in your head! For example, every kid has had at least one moment where their parent[s] lied to them for their own selfish reasons, but can you try to imagine what if would be like if you were in Jonas' shoes? How would it feel if you watched a tape one day that exposed your father as a murderer? It may be one of the reasons that the book was banned in many schools, but it was still part of a classic book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book had a great plot, and message context. I felt that this not only told the story but also showed it to me in my mind. It had a terrific beginning, which started, at a very crucial part of the life of the character in this certain place. The wording in the book was easily comprehended. I felt that through out the book it deserved a perfect rating, but i also felt that the ending was a tad bit plain. It needed to go further in depth of what was happening to everything around the character and the rest of the subjects through out the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a community where people know nothing about real life, Jonas must learn the memories of humankind that have been hidden for generations. His simple, yet new and amazing, discoveries open his eyes to the miserable, opressive conditions under which people in his society live, and his relationship with the giver develops into a strong bond as the novel progresses.An excellent piece of juvenile literature, The Giver provides a warning for civilization not to become too \\"civilized.\\""},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book &quot;The Giver&quot; is an excellent book! I have read it twice, and I am not tired of it at all. In fact, I could probably read it over and over again, because there is so much emotion in it. When I read the book, I became overwhelmed at how society could become so uncaring, how all of the memories from the past could have been eliminated and forgotten. Sometimes, the society in the book didn't seem that far off from our society today, which is a little scary! I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good narrative story that is a little out there and that really makes you stop and think, &quot;Wow, could this really happen today?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's, &quot;The Giver&quot;, is the best book that I have read in a long time! I couldn't put it down and I read it in less than a day! It is thought provoking and original!In our world of war and contention it is a major eye opener to see a picture of what could happen if we became overzealous in our efforts to &quot;purify&quot; our world from the affects of pain and suffering. This is a great example of the consequences that come from trying too hard to completely separate ourselves from the sometimes-horrifying world we live in.This is a book that I will read over and over again. I would recommend this book to anyone for a class project or a plain ol' good read. If you haven't read &quot;The Giver&quot;, then you are missing out! Run as fast as you can to the nearest bookstore or log on to the first website you can find and purchase this book. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverImagine living in a world where someone else is controlling your life. Those people make important life decisions like whom you will marry and what your career will be. This is what Jonas's life is like. He lives in a perfect world where there is no hurt or fear. Jonas figures his life is good, until he receives his lifetime assignment and his eyes are opened to all of the things he has been missing out on.The village elders control everything in the community where Jonas lives. When Jonas turns twelve he is given his life assignment as the next receiver of memory. The present receiver is Jonas's teacher and trains him by giving Jonas memories.Through his training Jonas learns about things like colors, choices, love, hate, and war. These things didn't happen where he lived because they were thought to be dangerous. Jonas's job is to remember lessons of the past when people made their own choices. The Giver shows Jonas people in the past making bad choices that lead to hate and war. However, he also shared happy memories of people making good choices that led to things like love. Jonas is angered that his world cannot have these things. He wants to live in his own world where he can make his own choices.This book reads quickly but is very well written. Lois Lowry did an incredible job of showing us what a &quot;perfect&quot; world would be like and makes you realize that you would never want to live in one."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was an excellent by literary standards and engaging storyline. The story of seclude community that has controlled actions of all the citizens. Everyone is assigned a job at the \\"Ceremony of Twelve\\" and from there families are put together and babies are given to you. One boy, Jonas, becomes the chosen to receive memories. From there on, the story goes into a detail what the community has given up to avoid the past memoirs of their humanity. This book to me was interesting from the start. I was really disappointed that the book ended so fast. Still, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think that The Giver, by Lois Lowry was a very good book. It showed society through the eyes of an adolescent boy who felt different from everybody else. This novel is particularly well-written in that it shows if someone feels different from society, they do not have to try to change. In The Giver, Jonas does not agree with the rest of society's views, and that is okay. Jonas does not change his personal morals and opinion, which takes great strength but is shown to be worth it in the end. Staying true to one's own beliefs is a very important lesson that is taught through this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's The Giver at first strikes the reader as the ideal and utopian society, however it is quickly turned around to show how monotone the life is. I myself am still half and half on this book because it seemed to be lacking something. At some points in the later chapters in particular it seemed to be rushed through which detracted from the book. That is why I've given it 4 stars, it was able to hold my attention for the entire book, but it seemed to be lacking that crucial element to be even better."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"... The giver, a very mysterious and new kind of book, did not sounded interesting because of its simple title. Instead of boring, I found it to be very interesting. I did like it more than the books I have read in school like A Separate Peace or Great Expectation. This book was different from the others; it was a mysterious and fantasized book. I love books that are out of the ordinary. For instance, the part where they said that people were being release. I did not know where they were going. That made me want to read it and find out. Another part was when the 12th years got their job assigned to them. It was intense because Jonas number was skipped. The other part that got me going was what was the name of the girl before Jonas that was Receiver. All this and more in this exciting novel. I do not want to give away the ending, but anyone who picks up this book cannot stop reading it.I give this book a 4 because it is the best of the books I have read for an English class."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It was a wonderful book. I found it very enjoyable but also very suprising. To chose Sameness over Diversity and black and white over color. What a world to live in. Reading this book makes you look at the world you see everyday in a new light and think of what it might be like without color or hills or real emotions."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is an amazing story of a world in \\"sameness\\". Jonas thinks about why and how things work, and tries to understand it all. They way that Jonas slowly discovers things that we normally take for granted, i.e.: color, hills/valleys, sunlight, and smell, its all very thrilling and exciting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure, or to someone who likes to read about heroes. Jonas definitely has an act of heroism."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry hits another one out of the park with THE GIVER. She gives us a wonderful taste of how boring life would be if we were all the same and had life decisions made for us. The community is as boring as watching coal turning to diamonds, basically sameness.The book was done so well as Lowry out does her self this time while portraying a boy with a lost soul. Jonas (main character) is growing up in a world of no terror or fear, no hunger. Until he is given the job assignment as Receiver of Memory, he likes the life. As he sees all of these wonderful things that were before, he panics. This is easily understandable. If I were living in this world of no love or color or memory I would panic if I saw memories of holidays and love. He is too stressed, so he runs off to a journey of self-discovery."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book that makes you think. It demonstrates how revolutionary thoughts come to mind in a society where you are constantly watched and told what to do. The Giver demonstrates a utopian society in which everyone follows the rules, and no one knows of anything different. The people of this city do not feel pain, or have emotions. People of the society live without having their own opinion, and can not demonstrate how they feel in any way. The people live with no purpose but to do their assigned role in the community.I feel this books plot and setting are a masterpiece. If you want to understand how a utopian society should work, it should help you understand how different societies could work; besides the capitalistic society we live in today. The story will helps visualize a perspective of a utopian society, and can bring out flaws in such a society. It helps to understand political problems within such a government. Overall the story just helps in one to think better, and broaden knowledge of how a society can work. This book broadened my view on society where everything is perfect, but it also showed me such a society could only work if the citizens feel no pain, or emotions. To me it demonstrated how a perfect society like Marxism, cannot work in our world, because people do have emotions, and do want to voice their own opinion. I recommend The Giver to young children, because it is an easy to understand the story. I also recommend it to adults, because they can take the story's message on step further and give one a new perspective."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book that makes you think.

Like many other books that she's written, the story tells itself well- but there's just a bit of a problem. The story itself (just in general) is really WEIRD! First of all the boy in the story where it takes place lives in this whole metropolis of people who are consistantly apologizing an speaking very good english, and are completly and totally brain-washed by the \\"rules.\\" But also in an intresting sort of again weird way the whole entire story kind of wraps itself around the main focus of the story leaving you or the reader dazed and confused but yet at the same time, charmed and delighted."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is one of the best short books that I have read. It uses a lot of unusual ideas and dialogue, and the book makes you think of what the future holds for us. In the book, Jonas an 11-year-old boy is about ready to become a man in his community. The community in the book is a utopia, where everything is perfect. He lives in a community where the citizens have never heard of war or pain. Children are assigned to married couples and you have to take pills that will not allow you to have any ... fantasies. Anything that isn't perfect is \\"released\\" from the community, including people!When a young man turns 12 in his community, many responsibilities are put upon him. He is assigned a job according to his abilities and what is good for the community. When Jonas turns 12, he is assigned the job of being the Receiver. The Receiver is one of the highest-ranking jobs in the community. Jonas would have to go the Giver's dwellings and receive all of the memories from the past. The Giver shows him memories of war and pain, which Jonas is devastated by. He also shows him memories of good things like snow and sled-riding, both of which Jonas as never heard of.The book goes on with Jonas receiving many memories and wanting to experience these feelings. But, he knows that there is no way to experience them there, so he decides to take action."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book by Louis Lowry. It is about a boy in a society far different from our own. They have their own rules and don't make contact with anybody out of their community. They get paired up if they want to be parents, and don't even give birth to their own children.This book is about Jonas, a thirteen-year-old boy who is preparing for the ceremony of twelve. At the ceremony of twelve, they are given their jobs that they train for, and later have as their job for life. They don't make money off of these jobs; here there is no such thing as money. There are many different jobs, birthmother or someone who takes care of the old. Jonas got a very unusual job. During the ceremony of twelve, he got skipped and they did not call him up to receive his job until everyone else had gone up on stage and received their jobs. He was going to be the Receiver. A Receiver was only picked every once in a while. It was very rare to be Receiver. He got a new set of rules and in these rules was something that shocked Jonas. He could not talk to anybody about his job with anybody.Every day after school he went to a small house where the Giver lived. When Jonas first went in, he had no idea what he was in for. What happened was the Giver had the power to transmit memories into people's mind. The people in the community had no pain, no feelings, nothing to hurt them. They could not even see color, but the Giver could. He could see color and he had feelings. Every time Jonas came to the Giver, the Giver would transmit memories. This went on for a year. Some memories were the Giver's, and some were from generations. Some of the memories were happy, and some were sad. Jonas began to see color and have feelings. Eventually he could see everything in color and had feelings for everything. At the end of the story, Jonas gets on his bike and goes on a journey to a place where he had seen in many of his memories, a place far away from his home. He went somewhere far, far away.This is a great book and I would recommend it to almost anybody. It is great for kids as young as nine to an adult. This book is not good for people who only love action books or mystery books. This book is great for anybody who loves to read good writing. The Giver also has a very unusual plot. All and all, this is a great book for any true reader."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I read the Giver, it really made me stop and think how the world would be like if it was like Jonas's land. Imagine there being no color, no feeling, no taste or sharpness to anything. Jonas, being appointed the next Giver, realizes how much he doesn't know. The Giver infuses pleasant and unpleasant memories into Jonas, giving him a taste of the world we live in. There are also very strict things in Jonas's world, such as there only being two children in a family, and exiting the world is deemed as a peaceful operation, but it means death, as Jonas finds out.I think this was a very good book, and it makes you realize that what may seem utopian may not be so utopian at all."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This books is truly great. It is easy to read and yet wonderfully written. You won't want to put it down because you'll be too interested in what's going on in that place? Why is everything so different?

No other book has showed me this like this has. The giver is not light, three day then quit reading. Most people will read it to the end on sihgt, like I did.To avoid giveing away the valuable plot, I will say that the world of civilization is a disturbingly organized, planed, emotionless land. People lack anything \\"Bad,\\" but also lack anything good. The great thing is, this will challenge your definition of good for the rest of your life. You will never look at war and hate the same way again. Hell really is repitition.~Lowelife"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a utopian story that is written in a style and language understandable by all ages, even those as young as sixth grade. The main idea revolves around the concept of a perfect society and what must be sacrificed in order to achieve that, most significantly personal freedom and expression. A uniform, restricted, colorless, apathetic, malevolent society ironically results from the attempt to create an ideal community. Younger readers may be particularly shocked by the lack of regard for human life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was expecting a boring book. Wow, was I wrong. This is a fascinating look at a scary future, where society is orderly and seems almost perfect in a dull, predictable way, but not everything is what it seems to be. The truth is, this future society has no real sense of right or wrong. Everything is done just to keep law and order, even if that means some cruel, heartless acts. When Jonas reaches the age of twelve, he is selected to be a Receiver of Memories. Only then does he find out how soulless society has become, and questions if it's right to not have joy, sorrow, love and other human emotions just to keep the peace. While the future society is a tranquil place, Jonas realizes we've sacrificed too much to achieve that tranquility. The ending doesn't come to any easy, simple answers or solutions, but that just adds to the warning the book gives us about the society we might become someday. And- the warning is- once there, it might be too late to change back. For that important message, I give The Giver five stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver introduces the reader to a fictional society where nothing lacks structure. There is a time and place for everything. The extremely strict conditions in the novel awaken the reader to the nature of the world we all live in.

I recommend this book to any reader who is looking for a strange but exciting adventure."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is a kid who lives in the perfect world; nothing goes wrong.

This time around, I stopped to think about the concept of everything having \\"sameness\\". My first instinct was to compare the society of The Giver to that of a Communist society, but the main themes go further than that. In The Giver, the society strove to repress all memories, painful or otherwise, in order to form a more perfect world. But would this really serve an important purpose? I think even if the world could somehow convert itself into an equal playing field for everyone, the lack of independence and personal choice would stifle society's ability to function. It's an interesting concept.I also think the reader can draw comparisons from the society to today's. The emphasis on the Twelves to pass from childhood to the adult world is comparable to today's high school senior. After that certain age, the child is left to make the decisions of their future and to train for the path they choose. There are many other such similarities throughout the novel as well.Overall, the book had an interesting concept and was quite thought-provoking. At times, the pace was a bit slow for my liking, and some of the events seemed rushed or out of place, but in general the book was very well-written. It was able to maintain an easy reading style while at the same time contained matter that adults could relate too. Plus, it's different than the traditional youth story.

First of all I have to say that in fact it IS a novel for young adults, its quite easy written and I think easy to follow the story. I liked especially the great imagination of the author, who created a whole new world which is really frightening sometimes. However I detested the open ending, in which the reader is left with a lack of information. Some fantasy-elements, like memory-transmitting, are disturbing the sf-atmosphere, like I want it to be. In contrast to \\"BNW\\" and \\"1984\\" I can hardly imagine any solution or advise for our future which the author might have been thinking of while writing this novel.All in all it is a good experience to read but if one is one of this hardcore-science-fiction readers (like me) one is dissapointed.

The 1994 Newbery Medal winning-book by Lois Lowry. The Newbery Medal honors the most outstanding contribution to children's literature published in the prior year.The Giver provides fantasy with enough realism that you find yourself comparing things to the world we live in. The Giver is about Jonas, a child living in a particular community. In his community, individuals do not get to choose their own careers. You are observed throughout your schooling and required volunteer hours, and a job that fits your aptitudes is selected for you. So Jonas is looking forward to the ceremony where he receives his assignment, or job.Jonas soon discovers that he has not received any ordinary job. He has been named as the new \\"Receiver of Memories.\\" Only one person has this job at any time, and the old one is ready to retire.

The more he finds out about other societies, the more dissatisfied he becomes with his own. However, his society can only be changed in one way, and that way can be deadly. What does Jonas decide to do? You'll have to read and find out!The best thing about this book was the way it kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Wherever I thought the story was going, that's not where it went. New twists, turns, and ideas were found on every page of every chapter. Even things that are familiar to you will be seen from a new perspective."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This story takes place in a utopia-like society. One of the most unusual elements of the community was that the members were only able to perceive their surroundings in black and white. The central piece of the story was that one person (The Giver) was the sole owner of all past memories and the time had arrived to pass that information along to a successor (Jonas).The only persons experiencing any form of conflict in the story were Jonas and the Giver. Being without memories, the rest of the society, including the Elders who ran the society, were ignorant of any other way of doing things and were, therefore, content. Jonas was given the ability to see things from new perspectives, taking into account past pleasures and pains. He began to understand different moralities of situations and seriously doubted the way of doing things that he had previously accepted without question.This book is not necessarily a question of good versus evil, but rather a matter of learning from past experiences. Was the decision of 'sameness' the correct one for their community? Why wasn't euthanization (being released) a question of morality? Were the decisions of doing things for the good of the community really good for the community? And without memories, what was left to compare their lives to?I don't think that many children who read this story would care to live in that type of society. Middle School students (and I don't think that this book is appropriate for students younger than that) pride themselves on their originality. However, the topics addressed in this book are interesting for any students ready to consider them."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A Review by JasonThe Giver is about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a \\"community\\" with his mother, father and little sister Lilly. Jonas is eleven and turns twelve during the course of the book. Every year the community has a ceremony of 12 where the children who will be turning 12 for that year will get the assignment for the job they will do for the rest of their lives in the community. Jonas is assigned as the giver, and finds out that his assignment is the most important in the community.This book is an easy read for most people who in 6th grade or above but it is a book that I enjoyed from front to back. This book seems to be very well written and flows very naturally with very few unnecessary words or information, everything seems to tie into something that previously happened so you are always gathering new information about something you may not have gotten earlier in the book. The only thing I did not lie about this book was the ending, I think Jonas could have handled the situation that was eventually the end of the book better than what he did. I like how Lois Lowry describes how important the ceremony of twelve is and how Jonas and the rest of his peers have many apprehensions just before the ceremony, \\"the entire community attended the ceremony each year. For the parents, it meant two days holiday from work; they sat together in the huge hall. Children sat with their groups until the went, one by one, to the stage.\\"I would recommend this book for any person that likes a science fiction book about what the future might be like for us. This book is about a 6th grade reading level but it can be read by 4th and 5th graders without much trouble. This is a great book and an interesting one about what our future might be like."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverBy: Lois LowryReviewed By: Jason YehPer. 2This book is about a community where Jonas lives and Jonas life. The community was normal and everything was Sameness. They had the annual ceremonies which celebrated the aging of children and selection of new jobs for the Twelves. Jonas spent his volunteer hours as an Eleven at many different places. When the day of Jona's ceremony finally begins, everything goes by slowly until all the Elevens were Twelves and started working. The headperson skipped Jonas number and gave the rest jobs. The citizens figured out and started wondering. The headperson apologizes and tells Jonas that he was going to be given the job as next receiver of memory which was a highly honored job. When his job began, Jonas met the current receiver and became friends with him very quickly.The next few weeks, Jonas learned much information from the Giver. He received memories of pleasant things at first, but the Giver knew that it was his job to transfer pain to him.He transferred light memories of pain and finally transferred a great pain to Jonas, \\"poverty.\\" Jonas lives this life until the day he ran away with a newborn, Gabriel, who was about to be released. With the help of the Giver, Jonas escaped to another community. With few memories, he and Gabriel traveled many miles to try and reach another community. Finally, hey hear some music in the distance and knew they had reached their goal.My favorite part of the book was when Jonas received the memories. He was forced to bear with the pain but was relieved with a dose of happiness, love, and warmth. Receiving the memories seemed exciting and unexpecting. He didn't know how much pain he would receive.I enjoyed this book because it was very tense and had a good plot line to it. \\"JONAS, JONAS, JONAS, JONAS.\\" This quote explains how the community was accepting the selection of Jonas as the next receiver. Unfortunately, he doesn't last very long. He decides to run away. \\"'He lied to me!' sobbed Jonas\\" This might have been one of the reasons Jonas wanted to run away. Since he was not used to being lied to, Jonas felt angry at his father when he lied to him. Overall, this book was still a wonderful piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverBy: Lois LowryReviewed by: E. LeePeriod: 5In this book, Jonas, the main character, lives in a perfect world. Here, all the people are assigned jobs and there isn&iexcl;t any war or pain. As time goes by, Jonas becomes a Twelve and receives an assignment. As easy it may seem, Jonas becomes encouraged for it is a big change that is going to appear. Now as a Twelve, everyone is counting on him for he receives a special assignment. Jonas receives the assignment of being the next Receiver of Memory.The reason why I like this book, The Giver, is that it showed the same experience as what I went through. In this book, Jonas goes through a stage where he receives a job that he has to complete. &iexcl; Jonas was identified as a possible Receiver many years ago. We have observed him meticulously. There were no dreams of uncertainty.&iexcl; This reminds me of all the things I had to do as I reached a certain age. Every time I read this book, it showed me that even though you receive a job, you should always try to accomplish it without a complaint. In other words, this book showed me of all the burdens that might pull you down, but you should always try to do your best to release the burden. For that, The Giver was a book I was fond by.Another reason The Giver was my favorite book is where this book took place. Here in the world where Jonas lives, the people can&iexcl;t feel pain. &iexcl; Jonas&iexcl;s world is perfect. Everything is under control. There is no war or fear or pain.&iexcl; Also, the world is peaceful without a war to be insight. Comparing this world to the world we live in, there is a big difference. In our world, wars and pain are all felt by the citizens while in Jonas&iexcl;s world, they don&iexcl;t. It always seemed to come into my mind the fact that our world can&iexcl;t be in peace while Jonas&iexcl;s can. For this, I desire to live a world in peace and somewhere with out pain.My favorite part would have to be when Jonas&iexcl;s friend, Asher, called &iexcl;snacks&iexcl; &iexcl;smacks&iexcl; when he was in hi Threes. Long ago, Asher wanted a snack for he was hungry. When he went to the Chief Elder, he asked, &iexcl; Can I have some smacks?&iexcl; After that, all the other Threes started laughing and told Asher that it was &iexcl;snacks&iexcl; not &iexcl;smacks&iexcl;. This was my favorite part because when Asher said &iexcl;smacks&iexcl;, I thought he wanted a slap. This was my favorite part for it provided a sense of humor as the book continued."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read The Giver as a school book.

Lois also does a great job of telling detail using show don't tell!I was really disappointed with the ending. I thought that Lois Lowry needs a different ending or a epiloge. If she doesn't want either of those then she should simply write a sequal to the book. She leaves you hanging with no clues as of what happens. She never tells you what happens to the community, do they suffer? Does The Giver help them? There are so many wquestions that she doesn't answer and she could answer. One of the previous years classes wrote a letter to Lois Lowry and recieved an auto response stating that Lois liked the ending because she liked letting the reader take the book where ever he or she wanted. She doesn't really give any clues as to where to take the book. The reader really has to decide on his or her own.I would strongly reccomend this book. Lois takes you on a fun adventure of one charachter, Jonas. He has a special job called The Reciever. He suffers pain and gets happiness, he is the only one seeing color and the only one whon knows what war is. He is the only one to know about death. Go jojin Lois on an adventure through the life of a 12 year old kid in his community. Just one thing, when you don't like the ending because it doesn't end don't come complaining to me. I don't think the book ends. I finished the book yet i did it unwillinglly. Up until the end, the book is happy and then it gets really sad! Read the book to find out about what would happen if you lived in a utopia!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"FROM A UNIVERSITY STUDENT:I originally had to read this book for a children's literature class that I am taking. As I got through the book I realized that this \\"children's\\" book had made me reevaluate how we look at what we would consider to be a \\"perfect\\" society. Many people criticize the societies that we live in now and would even suggest that the norms and values practiced in this book would be ideal. The Giver makes us realize that though there are consequences to having choices in a society- choice is freedom from imprisonment of conformity"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry provides readers with a disturbing look at a world without ardor or happiness. Lowry draws the reader in with the enigmatic workings of this world, and ultimately reveals this seemingly utopian society for what it truly is: a cold and cruel place where people are forced to conform or be destroyed. This is a fantastic novel which captures the reader's interest and does not relent. Perhaps the only drawback to the story is that it is too short. There are a few major plot threads left untied at the end of the book which left me curious about the aftermath to the events which played out within the novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In the wonderfully imaginative mind of Lois Lowry, a futuristic Community has been created where there is no more war, no more suffering, no more starvation, no more unemployment, no more choices. Everyone is seemingly happy. This is where a Twelve named Jonas lives. He is selected one day to be the Receiver of Memory of his society by the Elders of the Community. This is the highest honor to receive and at first Jonas is nervous, but excited to start training. But once under the instruction of his mentor, The Giver, who teaches him the truth about the choices his ancestors made, Jonas begins to understand the pain involved in bearing the burden of truth. Together with the Giver, he makes the tough decision to initiate change, if he can survive long enough to do so.This book was one of the most engaging books I have ever read. Lowry has a talent for creating memorable characters and uses stark details that place the reader right alongside Jonas. She also has a knack for lucid pacing and dialogue. This book examines the question of the choices we might make to &quot;make this world a better place,&quot; and the sacrifice that comes with comfort. I recommend this novel to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver takes place in a society, that at first, seems perfect. It seems to be free from crime or societal problems. This however, leads to no freedom to make personal decisions or experience true freedom. This novels main character is Jonas and centers around his coming of age at twelve years old. At the magic age of twelve his society decides what his career and purpose in life is going to be. His discovery into his assigned job as &quot;the giver&quot; is one that is troubling and leads him to search outside of his community to find a better life. Follow Jonas as he learns of the true problems of his community and how maybe the grass is greener on the other side of the mountain. We recommend this book for children at least 13 years or older due to some of the life and death aspects of this story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read &quot;The Giver&quot; when I was in the 6th grade (I'm now a senior in High School) and the book only gets better every time I read it. I have read many other books concerning the issue of ideal and Utopian societies. These books are very deep and often disturbing. &quot;The Giver&quot; touches on these issues but in a very chilish and delicate manner which makes it perfect for young children to read. It mildly exposes them to the idea that society cannot be perfect and that the more perfection a government strives for, the less privelaged its citizens become. I can personally say that &quot;The Giver&quot; gave me my first real sense of pride in my country and the rights and liberties it grants me simply for living on its grounds. The story also provoked my first thoughts of appreciation of life in general. Although my senses of pride and appreciation have grown much more since the 6th grade, &quot;The Giver&quot; was a thought-provoking and inspirational introduction to the adult world I was soon to face. It is, by far, one of my favorite novellas ever (and I have read many). I would highly reccommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"THE GIVER is an edge of your seat reader, which will not alllow you to put it down. It is a book in which describes the life of a 12 year old boy, who lives in a future community with his family unit. He is assigned a job which is one among the community, and he is trained by the giver.The community in which this excellent book takes place in, has climate control, where it is never hot, and it is never cold. The've never seen rain;the've never seen snow. Read and find out about this good but bad, adventrous story, and like I said;you will never want it to end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is often overlooked by adults because of its &quot;young adult&quot; label, which is too bad. I have never met anyone--adult or child--who has not been moved by this book.Lois Lowry is a master of storytelling, and this book is no exception. This is such a departure from her normal style of writing, and it is an absolutely amazing book. The idea of this &quot;perfect&quot; utopia and the restrictions placed upon its members are fodder for unbelievable conversation.I teach this novel to middle school students, and it never fails to amaze me how they respond to this novel. I recommend that this book be read and discussed by people of ALL ages. What a wonderful book for families to read together!(Be sure to check out Lowry's newest book, Gathering Blue, the long-awaited companion to The Giver!)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In the story The Giver, a boy, named Jonas, lives in a community that the people think is a utopia, but he learns it is the exact opposite. The community is interesting because everything is chosen and done for you. For example, your job is picked for you by a group of elders, and your bike is given to you at the age of nine. At first, Jonas likes his community very much because everything that is needed is provided, and he has nothing to worry about. Then, he is selected to be the receiver of memory, the person who keeps all the memories from different generations. He goes to the Giver who trains him and soon finds that his world is not so great after all. The conflict in this &quot;utopian&quot; world is that Jonas wants everything his community does not have. He learns that there are things called love, color, and music. He decides he wants to run away and, in the process, breaks most of the community's rules. If Jonas is caught, he will be severely punished. After successfully running away, Jonas is miles down the road from where he began his journey and is struggling to keep moving. Jonas sees a colorful house with people inside who seem to love each other, and he hears what he thinks is music. Lowry leaves you there to make up your own ending. The Giver is very well written, for example, the language that is used is not too advanced but at just the right level for a sixth or seventh grader. However, the book gets into a slump in the very beginning and becomes very boring because there is nothing happening in Jonas' life. Even his escape is not very suspenseful because whenever he is about to be caught, he uses a very dull strategy to get out of the situation. If you're looking for a book with a lot of action and suspense, keep on looking. I would give this book two out of five stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What if you lived in an society that had no pain, no hunger, no color, everything's the same, no unemployment, and no crimes. Well twelve year old Jonas lived in such an community. Jonas and all his other twelve year old friends are scared, worried and carious about the Ceremony of twelve. People receive their assignments for the community at this annual ceremony. There were different jobs, such as the caretaker, and the assistant director of recreation. Jonas received the most important job out of all of them. Jonas was chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. He was chosen for this job for a special reason that Jonas has experienced, but still doesn't know what it is. The Giver, an elderly man who was also chosen to be the receiver of memories, now has the responsibility to teach Jonas. Jonas gradually learns just how costly this pain-free society can be.This is really the best book ever, Lois Lowry used great descriptive words to bring the book to life. Once you pick this book up you will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about a community that has no pain, no wars, and no hunger. Sounds like a perfect community, right? Actually, the community also has no feelings, assigned jobs, spouses, and number per kid. The community also lacks color and music. When children become 12 they are assigned a job. Instead of assigned, 12 year old Jonas is &quot;selected&quot;. This means he is givven the job of the Receiver. He receives memories of color, war, animals, and love. Jonas is determined to share these things with the community, but how? Jonas and the Giver, the only other person in the community who can see color, hear music, and who gives Jonas the memories, devise a plan which could save or destroy the community. The Giver is a really great book, but I only recommend it for kids 11 years old and up, because it's really upsetting at times. All in all, a terrific book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was one of the most interesting books to read. It was very easy to read, and I would really recommend it to people of all ages. These people lived in a world where there were restrictions on practically everything. Even left over food was to be recycled. But for a community that was to be so perfect, well I've got my own response. When Jonas was picked to be the new reciever he was very scared because he really did not know what to think. Jonas and the Giver developed a friendship that could last forever. But I believe that the best thing that could ever happen to him was to just plain and simply leave his home. But what really got to me was the fact of how they decieved others of what being released really meant. The fact that they killed the lighter of the twins just because there could not be two of them was one of the most cruelest things yet. But in a so called perfect society I believe things like that would happen every day. It's just the only two people who knew what feelings where just couldn't take it anymore. Jonas left and the Giver had been living ten years of grief because his only daughter Rosemary had wanted to be realeased. So if you have an hour or so to spare this book would be a great one for you to read. Or if you were interested in what you might think the future would be like in another 100 years I believe this would give you some insight."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"By ShaniJonas was a happy, twelve-year-old boy, who lived his day to day life with a rigid routine: going to school, playing with friends, doing volunteer hours and spending time with family in his dwelling. He lived a peaceful, perfect life of Sameness. He and his fellow members of society each went through the many ceremonies, each providing new opportunities. All of these later led to the very last one: The Ceremony of Twelve, the much anticipated celebration into adulthood. This is where they get their life's assignment. When the time came for Jonas' Ceremony of Twelve, he was in for the shock of his life. In just one day, Jonas was given an honorable position in his society. No one would look at him the same way again. During his training, Jonas learned the truth about his society and its past. Slowly, Jonas' life changed and so did his thoughts until they transformed into something more. He was determined to know what lay Elsewhere, outside of his utopian society. His thoughts transformed into an action, and off he went into the darkness.The Giver is written so differently from any other book that I have read. It is the type of book that many adolescents may not be able to fully understand, since it is describing a society so different from ours. From the way Lowry described Jonas' society, it would be classified as a utopian society. There are no troubles, except for very superficial emotions that the people feel, minimal choices, and rigid rules. The society is dull, civilized, and focused on perfection. Lowry seems to have developed her own vocabulary especially for The Giver. She uses words like, Sameness, Elsewhere and stirrings, which can only be fully understood after carefully reading the context in which it is used. I also notice that she is fond of using cliffhangers. At the end of each chapter, the very last sentence is either shocking or a riveting description. Regardless, it was a page-turner.The Giver turned out to be one of my favorite books. It was interesting for me to picture our society being similar to Jonas'. I thought that maybe it would be a good thing because there would be no wars, no poverty, and no worries. As I got to the end of the book, I began to think that maybe it is not such a good idea after all-a life without freedom. What makes life worth living is the different problems we face and how we use our ingenuity to solve them and I think that Lowry was successful in opening my eyes towards this fact. I feel that this is an important message for children aged twelve and above."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just got done reading this excellent book! It is about a boy named Jonas. He lives in the community with his friend Asher. At age 12 you are assigned a job by th elders. Jonas's job is to be the Reciever of Memory which is a very important job. He meets the Giver and he trains him. Jonas job is to recieve memories. It's a very painful task. But he gets through it. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and adventure.P.S.

I was a little skeptical at first, but then I decided I might as well read it, because if I didn't like it I could always stop.I was very surprised at the plot, because it was so interesting. Imagine living in a world where there was no poverty or pain, but there were no feelings, success, or emotions. It would be awful if your \\"parents\\" were really just two adults chosen to raise you.There is an element of suspense because the main character discovers something that he can't describe. That thing is color. It would be very weird if we had no color.It teaches you that everything has an opposite, so if you get rid of pain, you'll get rid of pleasure. I don't mean to say that the whole book has moral lessons, but it does teach you things.I'm not saying that this is light reading, because it is the exact opposite. You should get this book, but I would recommend that you take breaks from reading it (although it is very hard to put down) because if you don't you'll get overwhelmed. It is still a good book, though."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think that The Giver was a great book. It has great detail and makes you want to keep reading it until you're done with the book. If I were to compare this book to something it would probably be the movie \\"Pleasantville.\\" The town that they live in is very predictable and boring. Everything in the town is planned out and scheduled. Even births are scheduled and couples register for a child. All of the people in the town except for the Receiver see everything in black and white. I could see this book turning into a movie in five years from now. If they did make it a movie I would definitely go and see it ten times.

I usually like futuristic stories, and out of all of them i have rea, this has to be one of the wierdest by far. First off, the settting takes place int his little town that has a bundle of rules that the whole town has to obey. The main carachter, Jonas, is assigned to the role of the reciever. He recieves memoreis from this old dude and realizes how much the community is messed up. It's a good book, and it keeps you interested in the story, though through the middle of book, it starts to get alittle boring. Good news is that is starts to get more exciting when he leaves the town. The only thing i didn't like about the book was the ending. The author left us hanging there, but i guess the point of this ending is to let the reader think of the ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It was my child's assignment to read this book but as I was just listening to her read it, I got hooked and had to finish it off by myself! It was excellent and I could not put it down! What a great way to open up one's mind to a different way of life. Things are NOT always as they appear to us when we look from an entirely different perspective! What an important lesson for our children and ourselves (parents) to realize. Jonas had a DREAM of freedom and he was able to attain it against all odds! We CAN to ANYTHING if we believe in our HEARTS and want it bad enough! Pick a terrific DREAM for you life and you CAN do it.If you are looking for something really practical and a very different way of seeing life by creating everything you want right now WHAT EVER you would like (gold medal in gymnastics, horseback riding lessons, turtle, nute, dog, my children's creations...) try \\"The One Minute Guide to Prosperity and Enlightenment\\" by Sri Siva. You will need a very open mind for this one because one of the governing criteria is that your life will NOT have any suffering or anything negative in it. It's a great way for children to create the life they want without bringing along all the garbage us adults have! and... it only takes a minute!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read a great book, The Giver by Lois Lowry. The Giver is a page-turner. It is so suspenseful it kept me reading the whole book through.In The Giver, I think the message is, \\"Be thankful for what you have.\\" The people in The Giver live in a colorless world where you get assigned a job for life. Other people control your life. In The Giver you can get, children; but they won't be related to you and will come from someone who was assigned as a birthmother. The people who are old live in a special place. There are also a set of rules everyone has to follow. Another thing; there are no more regular holidays (Easter, Christmas, etc) and everything you do is monitored by a speaker. All the good things of today were where taken away to stop wars and starvation.In this colorless community where the weak children are killed, Jonas is selected to be the new Receiver of Memory. He is given memories of things long taken away. Jonas wants everyone to have the memories. He also wants to do something about it. He wants grandparents, snow, sledding and all the things that have been taken away.Even though this book doesn't start out in an interesting way it sure does get better. The Giver has a lot of mystery, action, and suspense. The main character, Jonas, shows a ton of courage and strength. I never would have guessed the ending in a million years. The Giver is a great book. I couldn't put it down! Be sure to read it. It was marvelous!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What an interesting story! We need this now. I think anyone from the age of ten and up would benefit from reading it or hearing it read by the wonderfully expressive, Ron Rifkin. This is a cautionary tale about a society in which political correctness has been taken to an extreme. With just a few twists to the kind of yuppie-liberal, correct way, of behaving and thinking that seems to prevail at least in America now, the community of The Giver could be our own. Younger readers could find more meaning in this story of a utopia gone bad, if they can discuss the book with other youngsters and adults who have read it also."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"You never know what you have until it's gone\\", is the best way to sum up this book. In a perfect society where everything is planned out to the smallest detail there is very little room for change. This book shows how well a planned out society could work. There would be no one homeless, starving, or underprivileged. Everyone would live comfortably but they also would have to give up certain details of their everyday life. Something as simple as color could make a world of difference. The Giver was a wonderfully thought out book that helped to show that nothing can be perfect, at least not forever."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I don't usually just get sucked into reading books... I usually just read chapter one and put the book down. This book has depth, and I really enjoyed its interesting features throughout the entire novel. I think the age level should be at about 12+ because of its content."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Louis Lowry's the Giver is offers an extremely interesting look at a possible future in a Utopian society that is both well written and philosophically interesting. Of these positive aspects the most significant are the philosophical problems and ideas suggested by the work. Most notable of these is the balance of safety and elimination of the negative aspects of the world with the elimination of the truly beautiful and wonderful things exist as well. These along with other musings on individuality form a novel that is intellectually stimulating as well as simply enjoyable. The book is plainly written and should be easily accessible to anyone over the age of twelve or even eleven (although they may not quite grasp the full implications of the novel). I would recommend this book to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is a well written novel with an exceptional insight into the future. I personally enjoyed how the author created her characters to live and function in a normal society, without the many luxiouries that we enjoy today. The idea of not being able to see color was an interesting detail that really made me enjoy the fact that people have not tried to make humans all the same. I could not imagine going through like without ever sliding on a sled, or feeling the warmth of the sun, or the frigid of snow. It must be hard for Jonas to receive these memories now that he has grown up in a well protected community. Lois Lowry did an amazing job describing her characters reaction through this brilliantly written story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is a young, eleven year old boy. He lives in what is typically referred to as a Utopia. In this society, everything appears to be perfect and no one has any problems.

Jonas is chosen to be the next \\"Receiver of Memory.\\" This is the highest position in his community and he must learn everything from \\"The Giver,\\" who holds all of the world's memories. Jonas goes through a difficult journey, learning some things that change his life forever.\\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry was an enjoyable book and I would recommend it. It expresses a different type of life, far different from the one we know today. The community of people in \\"The Giver\\" do not get to experience life in the way that we do, and it gives more meaning to life. They do not get to experience all the things that make people who they are, such as love, pain, feelings and emotions. They cannot even see things in color. The only person who has all of these abilities is the \\"Receiver of Memory.\\" This book may seem a little strange at times, but that is what makes it so interesting. It captivates the reader and brings you into a different world. This book has a wonderful, creative storyline that requires one to use their imagination. It brings you into the book and makes you feel like one of the characters. It lets you see into the characters frame of mind and allows the reader to visualize what it must be like to live a life of such conformity.I would give this book four stars out of five. There were some minor things that I was confused about, but otherwise it was an excellent book. Although it is mostly read by young children, it is a great book for any age. I would definitely recommend \\"The Giver.\\""},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is one of those futuristic books that really makes you think about what people would sacrifice for a perfect world - that really isn't perfect. This is what twelve-year-old Jonas finds out when he is selected to be the Receiver of Memories.Because it is about one of those perfect, controlling societies, this book reminded me strongly of This Time of Darkness by H.M. Hoover. Both are futuristic, about children who learn the truth and want to escape. One of the biggest differences is that in This Time of Darkness, the world doesn't appear as perfect, but the people's lives are just as controlling.The Giver is even more harsh when it comes to the power of the authorities and the level of humanity taken away for perfectionism. In this book, children's lives are thought out from day one, where they are assigned to caregivers and named in a ceremony at the end of the year. They are placed with adoptive parents (and even the parents are chosen for each other), with two children, a male and female, to each \\"family unit.\\" The children are then observed all through school until the Ceremony of Twelve, when the get their assignments for the rest of their lives.But there is more hidden. Abnormal babies and old people are \\"released\\" to make society better. Also, if you're a younger reader, I wouldn't read the scene where Jonas finds out about the release of a twin baby. It's not for those who don't want to be freaked out. That's why I gave this book four stars. It's too heavy for younger readers (such as under 7th or 8th grades). Also, the only ending that can be found to this book is in Gathering Blue, where a reference is made to a pale-eyed boy.So, if you like futuristic stuff, you'll probably like this, but please don't read it if you don't like the severity of the concepts."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"= Thought ProvokingReviewer: H. D. from Quaboag Regional, VHSI thoroughly enjoyed reading Lois Lowry&#65533;s novel, The Giver. The book details the life of a young boy named Jonas. He grows up in a safe, sheltered community of conformity where all his decisions are made for him, and enjoys the simple life of following orders without independent thinking. He has no idea what else the world has to offer, until he meets the Giver. He opens Jonas' eyes to the wonders and the pains of the world that had been kept from him. Then a big decision comes his way, and he looks to the Giver to help him shape the rest of his life and find out what living really is.I was deeply engrossed in this book. Lois Lowry vividly created the Community and brought it to life. The morals presented are applicable to everyday life. The issues expressed are some that most of us never consider, taking the freedom of our lives for granted. This book explored questions like, where would we all be if we couldn&#65533;t remember our pasts? What would the world be like if you couldn&#65533;t understand love? Should any organization have the authority to demand conformity? As Jonas had to face crucial decisions, the reader was able to consider their feelings and learn some important life lessons.My only complaint with the book was that because I was so interested in Jonas, I wanted to know if he was able to live the life he hoped for. The reader is able to draw inferences and assume what Jonas&#65533; life would be like, but I would have enjoyed a more concrete conclusion after such a thought-provoking novel. I think everyone should read The Giver and take part in Jonas&#65533; journey towards a life of freedom and individuality."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry, was and is an excellent book. I have since read it twice and about to begin my third time around and everytime it gets better. This book is enlighting, and makes a person really think about everyday things that society takes for granted. What if all people couldn't see color? What if you couldn't choose your own spouse, or job? If everything was choosen for you, life would be boring, and almost not worth living. This book is an eye opener. It really makes you think. I believe that every person out there should read this book and not just to say that you read it, but to say that you learned from it.Mary Gere Newport, NH"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In less than two hundred pages, Lois Lowry's, The Giver, presents a chilling view of a future world whose citizens are lulled into the belief that a perfect world can be had with a happy pill. Order and success are the goals of the community that has accepted the philosophy for generations. In Lowry's world, everyone has a place and a function, and all lack the capacity to love, feel, or know pain. The perfect world is without color, shades of gray; all enjoy a sublime sameness. This is an exceptional book.

Lowry's imagination is amazing and I thorougly enjoyed reading this book. It is one of my favorites. I myself am a twenty-year old college student and had to read this for an adolescent literature class. I've seen the book in the past but was never attracted to the cover of it, so I did not give it the chance. However, now that I've read it I've have a new appreciation for it.Jonas lives in a community where everything seems perfect- no violence, illness, unemployment, etc. Everything has been established so that life is enjoyable and content- yet what it has really created is a world of no emotion and free will. On the day Jonas becomes twelve, he and all of the other children are to get their assignments that will state what they will become in the future- it will train them for professions. However, Jonas is not assigned. Instead he is selected to become the Receiver of Memory and to train with one of the elders of the community. Only called The Giver, this man gives Jonas knowledge, wisdom, and a vision of Elsewhere- the world in which the community has shut itself off.If you like a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and a desire to find out what happens next, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A wonderful book written by Lois Lowery. The Giver is about a little boy growing up in a very different environment than children are accostomed to today. The book very discreatly deals with problems facing our world today.

It tells of the future being a perfect place. There is no pain, no colors, and no freedom of choice. Everything is just sameness and nobody can judge any person because of their differences. In every community, there is a person who holds all the memories of pain and pleasure. Every once in a while, a twelve year old would be chosen to be the Receiver of MemoryJones, the main character of the book, is chosen to be the next receiver of memory. At first, he was very scared because the person who announced him being the receiver said that he will experience pain. When he started his first day of training, he felt it wasn&iexcl;t really bad. On the first day, he met the trainer who calls himself the giver. The giver is a very old man, and he is very kind to Jones. Jones now finds himself learning about the true meaning of life.My favorite part of the story is when the giver gives Jones the memory of a really good Christmas. The memory is described as a very warm and loving memory. Through the memory, Jones saw a fireplace, windows with snow outside, and grandparents. That day was the first time Jones has ever seen children with their grandparents. I liked that part because it shows the true love of humans. That was my favorite part of the book so far.That reason why I chose this book is because my brother suggested it to me. He told me that the book was good when I was in fifth grade. But at that time, I didn&iexcl;t really like to read, so I abandoned the book. Then this year, I finally realized that reading is fun, so I checked out the book from the library. After I started the first page, I liked it. So now I&iexcl;m almost done with the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an amazing piece of work.

HorngPer.6This book is about a young boy who, suprisingly, got the most important and rare job, the Reciever of Memory. At the Ceremony of Twelve, every twleve year old boys and girls get the job of their life. They usually get the job that they wanted the most. Jonas was called on last and was announced the Reciver of Memory. The Receiver's job is to store all of the memory of a person including pain, love, hate, and etc. Jonas's townspeople doesn't have any feelings and their life are always predictable.I like this book because it has adventures and the part about a person keeping all of the memory that no one else has. Tht's pretty cool, however, then you'll have to be a loner of some kind because you can't share any of your memory and you can't talk to your parents about it either. The other trouble of being a reciver of Memory is the bad memories that are like nightmares! I wouldn't want to be a Reciver because I want to share my feelings with my family and I can not hide them to myself.My favorite part of the book is when Jonas got his first happy memory. The Reciver all get a set of rules. Guess what, in one of the rules, the Reciver can lie to anybody if he has to, he can even lie to his parents! \\"He had never, within his memory, been tempted to lie.\\" That's what Jonas thought about lying to people. After a few more trainings, Jonas is starting to see colors. The first color that Jonas saw was red. Jonas loved every class going to the House of the Old and getting a new and happy memory, until now....That's when the part that I dislike comes up. The memories are not all good, there are always some bad ones. The first bad memory that the Giver gave to Jonas was the pain of sunburn, then the pain of falling down, breaking your leg,and scraping your face against jagged egdes of ice. This is Jonas's feelings when he first got the pain of breaking a leg: \\"He sat, and looked at his own leg, where it lay stright on the bed, unbroken. The brutal slice of pain was gone. But the leg ached horribly, still, and his face felt raw.\\" If you think that's overwhelming, wait until Jonas first got the memory of war. The experience was frightning, people running for their lives, orphans crying over their family member's death, and soldiers dying at war. Now that's overwhelming for me. Think about it, you even have to carry that memory around you for the rest of your life until you transfer your memory to a new Reciver of Memory."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read the Giver as a school book.

This boy has ben given the task to have the memories of the outside world. He will get these memories by a man that already has the memories who transfers the memories to him.

I envisioned a boring, hard to understand and relate to book. I got the extreme opposite. I discovered Jonas, a twelve year old boy living in a world where sameness was the game. Imperfection was disposed of and impractical things vanquished. Jonas' journey in the book was one like no other. He fought everything he had believed in and all because of his \\"assignment\\" to be a reciever of memory. He recieved memories from times before sameness took place in the community. Memories of snow, and Christmas. As to his dismay, memories of pain. He realized through these memories that everything he knew was not realistic. It was all a plan. he was not an individual, but a robot living in a world of sameness.Lois Lowry amazed me in this true story of faith and uniqueness.

Novels provide an safe avenue for family discussions about important issues.At some point in high school students will read George Orwell's 1984.

There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\\" However, what about creating heaven on earth? What price would people be willing to pay for a world in which there is no more war, hunger, or social strife? Lois Lowry gives a frightening look at one such answer in her book The Giver.Through a young boy named Jonas, we are introduced to a community whose citizens live in nearly total conformity to society's rules. At first glance, the order and homogeneity of the community appears to have created a nearly perfect society. However, as we look more carefully at the eerie extrapolation of the trend to sacrifice liberties for law and order at any cost, we see that Jonas' community has lost many of the basic freedoms we take for granted: privacy, choice of occupation, the ability to express disagreement with society's norms, the ability to learn from the past, the choice of whom to marry and where to live, the ability to reproduce and experience sexual pleasure, even the ability to continue to live when not a productive member of society. This future society has even gone so far as to rob people of the memories normally passed down as stories from generation to generation. Incorporated into the storyline of the book is the ultimate symbol of the blandness of their regulated lives, the inability of the people to perceive color: they see the world only in terms of black and white.Interwoven with flashbacks to illustrate, Lowry skillfully introduces concepts in a terminology that is easily understood, yet different from the way we normally speak: newchildren, birthmothers, nurturers, the Receiver, the Committee of Elders, the House of the Old, release, seeing beyond, and elsewhere. There are also various ceremonies: The Naming, The Ceremony of Twelve, Murmur-of-Replacement Ceremony, Ceremony of Loss, etc. This layered description produces a sense of \\"otherness,\\" while the detail which it affords lends an air of reality to the story. Each of these words has a connotation special to the environment of the community. In fact, one realizes that the citizens have been trained to think that apart from the rigid structure of the community, there is no real meaning to life. To fulfill one's given purpose in service to the community has become the all in all. We learn later in the book that although any citizen is given the ability to ask for release from the community, to reject service to the community is in reality to ask for a summary execution.When Jonas, a dutiful child, is chosen to be the next \\"receiver,\\" the faade of perfection is ripped apart. He is stunned with the realization that release means execution, something foreshadowed as early as the second page of the book when a beginning pilot veers off course and a voice announces in an ironic tone, \\"Needless to say, he will be released.\\" Jonas experiences true feelings and a depth of emotion which the average citizen is not allowed. With his new found emotions he is overwhelmed and abhorred by the thought of his father casually murdering babies who do not measure up to society's standards. And together, the old receiver and the new receiver determine to give something to their community which has been lacking for countless generations.The conflict with society which Jonas experiences as the seed of individuality germinates within him is what makes his character development such an integral part of the story. Fascination with his increasing realization of reality and the struggle to fight against the wrong he perceives rivets the attention of the reader. In the beginning, there was no question as to what he would do when the ubiquitous Big Brother-like speakers announced that an unauthorized snack must be returned. But his exchange with the Receiver about color shows that his eyes have been opened in more than one way: \\"It isn't fair that nothing has color!... If everything's the same, then there aren't any choices! I want to wake up in the morning and decide things!\\" The continued conversation reveals the reason why the community's founders took away choices from people. Jonas muses, \\"We don't dare to let people make choices of their own.\\" And with uncertainty adds, \\"Definitely not safe.\\" This juxtaposition of words \\"uncertainty\\" and definitely\\" is merely one example of how beautifully Lowry uses language to dynamically portray the conflicting emotions roiling within Jonas.The growing conflict as Jonas' character develops is not the only thing that attracts and holds the reader's attention. It is his interaction with those in his life as his feelings develop that we can identify with. Along with the black and white view of the world, the people in the community have no ability to distinguish beyond the superficial. They may know likes and dislikes, but they don't know what it is to abhor or love with depth of meaning. When Jonas asks whether his parents love him, we realize just how meaningless the word is to them as they fail to relate to the question. The reader begins to realize the tremendous price that Jonas' society has paid for a lack of conflict. Their eyes cannot see color because their souls are vapid. On the other hand, as Jonas interacts with the Giver we are fascinated by the deepening understanding in the Giver's heart of what must be done for the good of the society. As the Receiver remembers his daughter's death and discusses his grief with Jonas, it is the stimulus for a new way of thinking. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, we see the Giver's spirit renewed at the thought of giving a new way of life to his community.Truly this book succeeds in bringing to the fore many social questions. However, it succeeds on a deeper level by challenging our emotional IQ. The courage and strength which Jonas shows as he shoulders a burden for the ultimate benefit of his society is heartwarming and inspiring. The ending is left ambiguous on purpose, but it matters not. Lowry's purpose was not to provide a resolution, but rather to inspire further thought."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, was an excellent book. It has medals such as the Newberry Medal and A.L.A. best book. Lowry has written more extraordinary books like The Anastasia series, The Sam series and Number The Stars. The Giver is a science fiction book. Lowry is known through out the world for her wonderful books.The Giver is about a boy named Jonas. Jonas lives in a town where everyone can't see any colors and no one has memories except the Giver. When Jonas became twelve he was picked to be the next giver. If you become the Giver, you are in luck because it is the best job you can get it is also the most honored and biggest job in the city. Some of the memories that Jonas receives are harsh to him. For example a memory of going down a hill on a sled and breaking your leg with a burning hatchet wiping into your leg. But for becoming the receiver he has to learn things he doesn't want to know. After about a year the Giver and Jonas decide that something has to change about the town. So the two of them start to form a plan. The plan involves something he doesn't want to do!The Giver was a very descriptive book. When I was reading it I could tell what every thing looked like or tasted like. It kind of seemed like watching a movie. Also when any body was talking it felt like I was that person. Lowry was so descriptive that I could see an old scar on a persons face. When Jonas was hungry I could feel my stomach ach with hunger.In The Giver the town that Jonas lives in is very strange. In the town every one is the same. Also everyone can't see colors accept The Giver and Jonas. Even though every one is the same there can't be doubles of any one or names. So they have to kill old and identical twins. The town is also very cashes. They have important people called elders. The elders make every decision like giving people jobs or giving boy's wife's.The Giver was one of the best books I have ever read. The action the suspense it was all good. I recommend this book to people 12 and older because the lexile is 760 so it might me difficult for kids under 12. There are also some sad and gruesome parts. There are also some inappropriate parts. Personally I could read it again and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Try to imagine a huge idea of a team of twisted scientists come to life: solitary, colourless, perfect communities. No one is stressed, no one is hateful, and everyone ACTUALLY uses precise language ( Eh-hem, unlike some places now... ). However, all this changes when one Utopian citizen, Jonas, is selected to &quot;recieve&quot; memories of the past, when pain was inevitable, and love was treasured, not called &quot;obsolete and general.&quot;I am 12-going-on-13, and have read The Giver for 7th Grade. But, oh, how it has touched me. There is something about Lowry's admirable writing that is slightly sci-fi and simple, but extremely beautiful. I've probably read this book 6 times over already, and my teacher has indicated my potential as being a Receiver of Memory, like Jonas ( don't ask ).This book is UNDENIABLY thought-provoking and an amazing treasure. It will keep you thinking about our world again and again, how such SIMPLE things like hugs and music and COLOUR should be treasured. The Giver definetely deserves 5 stars of 5!P.S: Read &quot;The Face of Love&quot; by Apple Pie on Fanfiction.net.

In a community empowered by The Elders, Jonas is assigned to be the next Receiver. The Receiver's job is to receive ancient memories of old civilizations from The Giver. The memories include war, pain, hurt, hunger, and love. The memories of these feelings have never been experienced before by Jonas. Jonas divises a plot to escape the community and travel to a place where \\"real\\" life exists. The Giver is a great book that will keep your attention.

She also gives you a greater appreciation of the feelings that we experience in life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a good and interesting book even though I hated the ending. Anyway, I still give the book five stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just finished reading The Giver. It is a phenomenal book about a young boy who lives in a community of rules and laws. The young boy, Jonas, got the most important job of all--the Receiver. The Receiver is the only person who knows what is going on in the community. Jonas did not mind his job even though he had to do the same thing every day until they chose a new Receiver and that would be decades. He was angry that they lied to him, and he ran away to save Gabriel.I think this book is good because it shows that it is a great thing to have choices. Jonas did not have the freedom we have to live how we want. He had to follow all the rules of the community. Also, his parents weren't able to help him either because they had to follow the rules too.I think Jonas should have gone through with his job because it is only fair to the others who do their assigned jobs.Lois Lowry is a really good writer. She can really make the story come alive in your mind. She taught us how lucky we are to have freedom.7.3sjk"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my opinion this was a very good book.

This is what I like about the book.In a less positive not I think that because this was such a detailed and descriptive book the author just go tired of it. But to get to the point there could have been a better ending. I think that a sequel would have been too much, but at the same time maybe 10 extra pages woundn't have hurt.

Lois Lowry should be proud of all her work. This book is about a curious young boy who just became a man. He got the most important job of them all--to be the new Receiver.Getting his new job means that he will have to carry out the same job every day until the picking of a new Receiver. The time he would have to be the Receiver would be so long. Jonas would have to handle the pressure of knowing what's going on in the community. I think he should handle the job because it's only fair to the others who are doing their part.I also agree that they should be able to choose their jobs, but that's why their community is supposed to be perfect. It's like a secure little box where no one can get out of. No ones feelings are supposed to matter. They just do what they are told. That would be very boring. Like Jonas, other twelve year-old kids would get a job, maybe the law-maker who comes up with the rules.This book is great because it teaches you about what it's like not living a life how you want to live it. It shows the importance of having freedom.7.3SJK"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book 'The Giver' was a book that could tech you lessons.

He had left his dwelling at night, taken a new child and had stolen food from the community. He knew that if he was caught, he would be condemed.

The lesson that it taught us was having an opinion and being an individual. It makes us think outside the box and it helped us to understand how fortunate we are. I believe this book has a good lesson and is not about courage, but breaking the rules. The author had such good discription and action that it seemed so realistic. That is one thing that isn't always in a book. But, at the end of the book it just ended and you didn't know what happened.Although some parts were good others weren't as good. Like when Jonas said that the apple had changed ,but not in shape or in any other way I didn't know what he meant. Along with when Jonas got mad at the children when they were playing war. I thought that it was confusing with what he felt. It was like he was all mixed up. Then the last part that wasn't as good was when I realized that Jonas's father killed babies that weren't normal. That was very sad. Some things that I liked about The Giver was when Jonas would receive the memories and would be happy. It felt like you were actually there. My other favorite was the Ceremony of the Twelves. That is what I thought of the review."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a &quot;perfect&quot; world where war, disease, and suffering have all been eradicated. Everything is in order; everything is under control. The people have no worries or cares. The Community strives for &quot;sameness,&quot; in which everyone and everything are the same and equal. To help the Community function as a cohesive unit, each member is assigned a position in society. When Jonas turns twelve, the Community selects him to be the new &quot;Receiver of Memories.&quot; Only the &quot;Giver&quot; knows the truth and memories of the past, and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas.The Giver is a wonderful book. Lois Lowry skillfully crafted an intriguing and profoundly thoughtful story. She subtly creates an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with this &quot;perfect world.&quot; The Community's advisors intend to establish security within utopian society, but they really establish a stifling dystopia. To protect people from the risks of making poor or wrong decisions in life, the advisors plan and dictate the lives of the people. In effect, the citizens have no freedom of choice; they do not choose their job or even their spouse. Moreover, the advisors inhibit the people's ability to feel because they want to spare them from the hardships and pain of life. For instance, individuals must take a pill everyday, which suppresses passionate feelings. The citizens do not know or experience true emotions like love. One of the goals of the Community is to achieve &quot;sameness&quot; so that no one feels embarrassed or gets excluded for being different. However, this limits individuality and freedom of expression because everyone conforms to a certain desired image. Finally, to relieve the population of the horrors and devastation of the world and the past, the advisors isolate the Community from the rest of the world (also known as &quot;Elsewhere) and give the burden of holding the memories of the past to a single member of society: the &quot;Receiver.&quot; Therefore, the Community lives only in the present, and the people have a narrow perspective of life because they only know their community and way of life. They are naive; they do not gain knowledge or wisdom from the memories. While receiving the memories, Jonas learns a different and better way to live and realizes what he and the Community have been missing. He decides that something must be done to change the current conditions and enlighten his community.Although it is a Newbery Award Winner, The Giver is a controversial book that has been challenged and even banned. After parents complained that the violent and sexual passages were inappropriate for children, the Bonita Unified School District in California temporarily banned the novel from classes. The Giver has been challenged in other school districts around the country for its &quot;mature themes&quot; of euthanasia, infanticide, and suicide. I do not agree with banning and challenging of this novel. It is a great book, and part of what makes it so great is the incorporation of these controversial issues. They force readers to wrestle with their own thoughts and figure out their stance on the issues. Good literature makes readers think. Banning this book takes away the freedom of speech, the freedom to read, and the freedom to learn and explore. The banning of The Giver is ironically similar to the actions of the Community that lead the Community to its suppressive and stifling state. A powerful story, The Giver keeps readers in suspense, touches them, and stays with them for a long time. I love this book, and I encourage everyone to read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas, an Eleven when THE GIVER opens, lives in a Community where everything is meticulously ordered: houses look alike, people dress alike, each family unit includes a father and a mother (who can apply for one male and one female child). Children begin their volunteer hours when they are Eights, and the Committee of Elders assigns them their roles in the Community at the Ceremony of Twelves. Because the people have chosen Sameness, nothing in their Community is unexpected, inconvenient, or unusual. They have no hills, no color, no cold, no sunshine. Their feelings are only superficial; their memories encompass only one generation. Pain is relieved instantly by taking a pill. They have abdicated choices.The Receiver of Memory holds the position of highest honor within the Community, serving as the repository for the memories and knowledge of generations. Whenever the Committee of Elders are faced with a new situation, they are able to seek the counsel and advice of the Receiver. They have the benefit of experience without having to bear its pain.Because of his intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, and Capacity to See Beyond, Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory. The current Receiver, who has held the position for decades, then becomes the Giver.Ms. Lowry paints a vivid picture of this Community. Referring to everyday concepts in a slightly unusual way helps to set that society apart from our own. Babies younger than one year are called &quot;newchildren,&quot; for example; children of the same age are &quot;groupmates&quot;; the elderly, the unhealthy, or those who have broken the rules three times may be &quot;released.&quot;Why might parents or teachers consider THE GIVER inappropriate for their children? I can only speculate on this since I find the book profoundly original and commendable:1. The setting being a community without freedom. It should be noted, however, that citizens relinquished their freedom years earlier in order to escape the accompanying chaos. They are perfectly satisfied with their arrangement and are not oppressed.2. The family being depicted as a temporary sociological unit rather than a permanent socio-biological unit. Nevertheless, this family unit provides a very nurturing atmosphere.3. References to &quot;Stirrings&quot; (sexual arousal). These occur only a few times in the book and are only vaguely described. Since Stirrings are forbidden in the Community, young people begin taking a preventative pill upon first experiencing them and continue taking it daily until they enter the House of the Old.4. The idea of young people bathing the elderly of the opposite gender. This happens only once in the book. It is a gentle, caring, and (given the ages of the participants) asexual experience.5. The concept of &quot;release.&quot; This pervades the book, but its meaning remains uncertain until Chapter 19, when Jonas witnesses a release.I would think that for many readers these concerns would be assuaged by Jonas, the young protagonist who, in the course of his instruction, recognizes the advantages of previous systems and selflessly tries to better his Community.Although there are aspects of this Community that we may find unsettling, we must remember that Lowry is not advocating this system. She is, in fact, inviting us to consider whether our own society has any of the characteristics of the Community that disturb us:Do we attempt to make our lives pain free?Do we attempt to erase unpleasant memories?Do we use euphemisms?Do we use robotic phrases, as for apologies?Do we have anything resembling the &quot;House of the Old&quot;?Do we have a ritual that might be called a &quot;Ceremony of Loss&quot;?Do we attempt Climate Control?Do we avoid talking about ways in which we differ from each other?In our own Society, without a designated Receiver of Memory, that responsibility -- with its inherent pain and exhilaration -- falls to each of us. Vital questions for us to consider are Which memories will we receive? Which will we give?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a community that is all the same lives Jonas, who discovers he is very different. Jonas is the main character in the book The Giver, my favorite book. I loved The Giver because the plot was very creative, the theme was magnificent, and the setting was vivid. I think you should read this book for many reasons. The theme of this book is clearly represented: freedom, the right to make your own choices, uniqueness, and individuality are worth dying for. In Jonas's community, a commitee selects one's job, war is unheard of, all people wear the same attire, and all are assigned spouses and families. When Jonas is given the special, wonder-filled occupation of becoming the Receiver of Memory, he finds that there is much more to life. Through his task of becoming the Receiver of Memory, he discovers the meaning of love, pain, frustration, color, and cold. That is when Jonas realizes how much more there really is. Life soon becomes overwhelmingly unbearable in his world of &quot;sameness.&quot; He finds life isn't worth living without the qualities (often that we take for granted) he discovered. That is when Jonas goes on a dangerous journey to find a land that is different. The setting in this book made it quite a pleasure. Everything in the community was predictable and pre-planned. The housing units were all the same. There were designated spots for everything. The setting helped develop the plot and theme. The mysterious ending leaves one filled with curiousity and wonder. The book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry is guaranteed enjoyment, especially for someone who likes a good theme and plot that ties in with the setting. I loved the boook The Giver, and I truly believe that everybody should read it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a kid named Jonas, who lives in a controlled world, with no fear, no pain, or no war. You might think he lives in a perfect world, Right? Wrong! In the Community, there is no choices, colors, pleasure, weather,love, emotions, etc. You can not choose your job, spouse, or anything like that. In the &quot;Ceremony of Twelve&quot;, 12 year olds are assigned a job in the Community. Jonas is singled out, and gets special training from The Giver. When Jonas becomes the &quot;Receiver of Memory&quot;, The Giver gives him the memories of the far past; memories of pain, fear, war, pleasure, colors,and love. (This book takes place in the future) Jonas receives the truth.......This book is VERY original in it's plot, and it is interesting to see the point of view in Jonas's controlled world. I like how Lois Lowry decribes the memories that The Giver gave to him. She also well describes the way Jonas is feeling. It is a very thought-provoking book, which really makes you ponder. The ending sort of leaves you hanging though. I have read this book 3 times, and every time you read it, you understand more of this remarkable book. It just never gets dull. I read it first when I was in 4th grade,(I'm a good reader) although I would recommend it to kids 11 and up. 5 STARS!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Perhaps because it's so lauded I expected more. It's just a 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451, Animal Farm or Clockwork Orange for kids -- I guess. It just made me want to read those books instead.There were many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I would have liked to have known why the community was the way it was and how it got there. How did people only see in black and white? How did they get rid of the sun? How did they grow crops if there was no sun? Why are the birth mothers considered so stupid and low, yet they're giving birth to the entire community -- therefore giving birth to stupid kids? How come Jonas isn't stupid?Where is he at the end? It wasn't clear. Or I'm just too dumb to read into things. I would have liked more of a \\"fleshing out\\" of the community instead of the bare bones we are given. I'll buy anything -- just sell it to me."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book,as distrubing as it was, was an excellent sci-fi book that, though odd, makes us all see that there is not, on the Earth we know, a place where everything is perfect as we can not know true happines or pleasure without first expiriancing pain and suffering. Jonas makes me think more, though this is a reach, more about the freedom of choice, for in the Community, there is none. The book striked as a powerful reminder that there is not a better world than that the one we live in, for there would be no happieness if it were the same as the Community, and no feelings. Without feelings, we are not human, and the people in this book scared me that some day there really may be a place that comes around here or in some other life where there are no feelings, color, or, most importantly, love.I also recommend, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and The Price of Immortality"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry is one of those unique authors who has won the John Newbery Medal for children's literature twice. Once for the first book in this trilogy and once for a book about the Holocaust called Number the Stars. (Just as an aside only one other author has ever done that Madeleine L'Engle who I would also recommend highly.) I would begin by recommending any of her books; they are all worth the time and the effort. This trilogy is set in a post apocalyptic world. The first two books each focus on different community's who have recovered from the devastation differently, both have strengths and both have weaknesses. And a young boy must heal them both and the land if either is to survive.The GiverLois LowryLaurel-Leaf BooksISBN:0440219078Jonas is a young boy who lives in a community with a lot of technology and many rules about it.

It didn't worry him, how could someone not fit in? The Community was so meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made.\\" However all the other Twelve's were assigned and Jonas was skipped then at the end of the ceremony it was announced that he had been selected he was chosen to become the \`receiver of memory.' He was to learn all the history and story of the people and become an advisor to the council that ruled the village. It only happened every so many generations and only 1 keeper of memories was installed in each village. Jonas and his family take in an infant who is not maturing and growing quickly enough. The child is given a year extension, when the child is marked to me replaced (abandoned and killed). Jonas takes the child and runs away. Through the winter Jonas knows he will not make it and pours all the memories he has learnt into the child. But can he save the child? What will happen to him and his community?

As an artisan she is installed in the palatial Council Edifice and spends the whole year working her trade, her primary task is to care for the Robe of Remembrance that tell's the story of this community.

Can the Leader save the village, can the world be healed, what will happen to Kira, her father and Matty?These three books will challenge you, after reading The Giver the first time I was overwhelmed and it haunted me for a long time. I went back and have reread it many many times. All three books raise questions about community, love, friendship, and care for other people. They also show dark paths that we as a people can go down, and how it can devastate all around us when we make the wrong choices for the wrong reasons."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" is one of the most provocative and thoughtful books that has an intriguing story line as well. Right from the first sentences, readers meet Jonas, a 13 year old boy, who's thoughts and observations sound very natural and familiar, like somebody you already know and care for.Page by page, a new world that is set in some distant future unfolds with its \\"dangerous simplicity\\". The wrong and right is not spelled out in the beginning of the book, so the reader has a chance to follow Jonas and to see everything and to decide for themselves. Jonas observations add up to questions, and he starts to see everything a bit differently, he starts to question himself if everything around him is exactly as it seems.Further, the story flows into a beautiful climax - Jonas meets the Giver - a person who has an ability to \\"see beyond\\", the ability that Jonas himself has as well and was chosen to develop it further as Giver's student. The Giver \\"gives\\" Jonas all kind of feelings and memories that humanity has accumulated but denied to burden themselves with. Instead, it was up to one person to know all there is to know and to \\"shelter\\" everyone else from it. But Jonas knows too much now, and he decides to take action - something that no one have ever succeeded at in the community - he decides to flee in search of other, \\"real\\" way of living.The book ends at even more provoking and intense note. But Jonas knows the truth now, and he is free to choose for himself. He is free to feel all there is to feel - excitement and pain equally...Julia ShpakAuthor of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

I try to read it about every three years because it is the kind of book that you'll love hte first time you read it, but the more you read it, the more you understand. This book is touching, and it makes one think about our own society and where our future might be. If taken seriously, this book is a work of art, written so both children and adults can enjoy it. Definitely I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a different point of view on where technology and the media might be leading us!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"One of the few books that I can ever read past the first few chapters, Lois Lowry's &quot;The Giver&quot; has easily made its way into one of my favorite books. It's amazing how many only 170 some odd pages can work on so many levels- emotionally, socially, politically- and still pull it off. Lowry perfectly brings a coming-of-age boy (Jonas) forced to live in a seemingly &quot;perfect&quot; community into receiving the truth about the past, a past where pain existed, a past where feelings existed. Jonas' own naivete towards the world is the most interesting part of the book; watching him come to his own revelations about the very society he lives in, and the pure simplicity of his convictions: &quot;But we SHOULD have choices!&quot; Lowry leaves a lot of the book open for you to fill in the structure- she never really explains the whole concept of why people moved to &quot;Sameness,&quot; and I really think that's for the best. I think it gives the message that maybe we really aren't made for perfection- because, perhaps, beauty comes in imperfection. A classic."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an excellent book. This book is filled with happiness, sadness, joyful tmes, and hard times. Jona is the main character in the book. He is a young boy turning into a twelve and recieves a special assignment of the Keeper of Memories. He starts his training and soon his teacher dies. Now, he is the official Keeper of the Memories. Jona has his parents, a sister, and a new baby brother. The only thing in the book is his new baby brother isn't developing right. So they have to give him one year to see if he will develop. If not, he will be sent back and they will receive a new baby. This is a sad part of the book. When I read that I thought about how people do that. These people live in a world where there is not any pain, fear, or war. the people work together and never fight. They watch over each other. The book is very interesting. The way the people live is amazing. The kids are called by things likes eight's, or twelve's. This is like there age. They can do certain things once they turn a certain age. Like Jona's sister Lily turned into an eight and you can start to volunteer at places. Lily would like to volunteer at the nursery in the book. Her mom says only volunteer work. You aren't respected as much if that is your assignment once your get older. For Jona since he is turning into a tweleve they receive an assignment to do for the rest of his life. The world the people live in here is different, neat, and also so caring. There world is very different from ours. The world is peaceful. The people work on the assignments they are given; and they also watch and loe their families very much. the Giver is an excellent book to read, and it is a good recommendation."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this book was great.

Everything and everybody is black and white, the temperature outside is always the same, and it never rains, snows, and there are no violent storms. No one ever told a lie or did something wrong. If they did do something wrong, they had to say \\"I apologize for my inconvenience\\" and the people who were present had to say, \\"I accept your apology.\\" It was just perfect. Jonas, one of the main characters, is an 11. There are 12 age groups, with 40-50 people in each group. They each had numbers. Jonas' number is 19. Jonas has a younger sister named Lily, she a 7. Each family in their community has a father, a mother, a boy, and a girl. That is as big as their family was aloud to get. Jonas' father worked as a worker at the Child Care Center, where there were birth mothers and newborn babies. Then, on the ceremony day, they are given to a family on the waiting list. Jonas' dad was very worried about a little boy who could not sleep at night. He was worried because if he could not sleep quietly before the ceremony he would be released from the community. Being released was a horrible thing. One day, after school, in his free time Jonas went to the park with his friends. They picked an apple off of the apple tree and started tossing it to each other. Every time Jonas threw it, it seemed to have changed in mid-air. He did not know what he was seeing. Finally, the time had come for Jonas to move from an eleven to a twelve. When you became a twelve, you were given a job and you were to start your training. Jonas' number was 19. He was getting very anxious when the Chief Elder had announced number eighteen, Fiona. He was next. Jonas was finally going to find out what he was going to do the rest of his life. The Chief Elder was ready to make the next announcement. She said, \\"Twenty, Pierre.\\" Jonas was terrified, he had been skipped. He thought it may have been a mistake, but it wasn't. After all of the jobs had been given away, the Chief Elder called Jonas to the stage. She said, \\"Jonas has been selected to be the new Receiver of Memory.\\" Jonas started reading his job booklet right away, he read through the rules and he was quite surprised by the last one. It said \`You are allowed to lie.' Jonas did not know what to think, he had never lied before in his life. He started his job training right away the next day. The old Receiver of Memory put his hands on Jonas'back and he gave him all of the knowledge of life he did not have. He was happy with the good things, but he was terrified with the memories of killing and wars. But, worst of all, he found out what release was. To be released, you were taken to the Child Care Center, young or old, and you were given a shot. Immediately after that you fell limp onto the ground and died. Jonas was very upset with this. He had came up with a plan to run away. Late that night he sneaked out on his bike and biked far, far away. He had biked into a place where there was snow and rain. He had to hide from search helicopters during the day and bike at night. Jonas had not eaten in days and he was never going back to his community. He had heard a sound coming from down a hill, he did not know what it was, maybe, he thought, it was a memory the old Receiver of Knowledge did not give him. What was the sound down the hill? Will Jonas survive the snow storm? Find out for yourself by reading The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It was o.k. until the very ending. It was very confusing and hard to understand.

Throughout the book the idea of sameness angered me more and more, Jonas's society thought that through nothingness they they could avoid pain. This is true, but they are also avoiding the happiness that they could have. I think that having your own wonderful memories is one of the best parts of life, and it seems almost not worth living if we can not have them. The Elders in the book think that they are learning from past mistakes and bettering the lives of people, but they are not, you have to take the good with the bad. The concept of &quot;shared remembrance&quot; should be very important to each and every culture, this is how we learn, as well as how we are entertained. The Giver is an appropriate book for the study of folklore because it shows the importance of being different, like almost all cultures are.

It's the one area in publishing where there is never a glut of material in the slush pile. Perhaps this is the cause of so few classic brilliant books in this genre: Heidi, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\", \\"The Borrowers\\", A Wrinkle In Time\\" and \\"Things Unseen\\". The mark of excellent adolescent literature is that it is equally brilliant when read by a fifty year old; that the characters are well defined and sympathetic and that the theme of the book si clear and universal. Lois Lowry is famous now for her best seller \\"The Giver\\" and the final installment of this quadrilogy, \\"Son\\" is just released. To remind everyone of \\"the Giver\\" is most apt.The community in which our central character has grown up in is much like what Karl Marx envisioned in \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". Lowry calls it Sameness, not equality and like REAL communism, regardless of what appears on paper it's an impossible dream. With the Soviet Union it was about human greed and power. With the community where Jonas lives with his family unit it's about the lack of extreme feelings. In order to eliminate the pain and sadness they had to eliminate exuberance and love. The book reaches the halfway point and we learn that Jonas is to be the next \\"Receiver\\" for the community: the keeper of historic memories. And he is trained by an old man who is now called \\"The Giver.\\" Jonas see's that there are some serious flaws in their way of life and he is forced to make a choice of massive consequence.The books is so well crafted, not a single word or moment is waste3d, whether it is a snow sled that later becomes highly critical or the ominous casual method of residents who must be released. The relationships that occur in the book shift as Jonas grows and receives more memories and suddenly he finds that what has been \\"real\\" his entire life is not at all true. What then is truth?To begin with, Lowry has found a brilliant way to try to teach our young that joy and pain are partners in life and that both carry lessons with them. So much literature, both adult and children, tries to teach this lesson, from Frost's \\"The Road Not Taken\\" to Camus' \\"The Stranger\\". The truth is that these books and poems (and films and theatre works and songs) are more effective for those who have already learned the lessons of life. And the only way to learn them is to live life. We cannot deny our youth the right to learn these lessons as we did.This is what the community from \\"The Giver\\" has denied the population the greatest meaning of life: that which is learned by life and not from a book.Depending upon your age and your place on life's journey, the book will provide you with many shocks and surprises. Certainly for the young the shocking moments will take their breath. Some may call it science fiction- after all, the first half of the book is reminiscent of the planet on which IT lives in Madeleine L'Engle's \\"a Wrinkle In Time\\" except the control is more subtle. Halfway through the book we shift to something that William Styron may have written, and the setting becomes nothing more than a backdrop for a very human story.This is a must read. And it is a must lend. This book is taught in many Middle Schools, having pushed \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" and \\"The Lottery\\" aside. As parents you must make sure you read the books your children are reading because you want to experience what they are experiencing; you want to be able to discuss the hard issues that they will bring up; you have to add to their reading lists so that \\"Huck Finn\\" and \\"The Lottery\\" remain on their reading list.And you must add to your own reading list. Start with \\"The Giver.\\""},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book many years ago when it was first released, I have vague memory of it, I remembered liking it, I think I remembered crying over it, but I didn't really remember what it was about. With the quartet completed I decided to go back and re-read this book and it took me awhile to get into it. It's written very simplistically (of course it's written for kids) but there is just So much depth to it. I don't think I could have possibly grasped all that was going on when I first read this book as a kid, but reading it as an adult it was just heart wrenching. This society has existed for many generations and science has somehow made it so everyone is the same, there is no color, there are no feelings, no one has choices and if you don't fit into the mold you're released. To be released sounds so gloriously wonderful to everyone until you realize what it entails. It's just heartbreaking. What's really sad is I bet if we could have this perfect society someone would try to go there, someone would try for sameness, for a perfectly moldable society that had no war, famine or strife but with the loss of everything that makes us human. It's a well written book, it truly is, the beginning is slow, but gives you everything to understand the society that Jonas lives in, so when everything becomes clear there is just a great impact. Loved it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My 10-year old daughter 'feeds' me with delicious, small book-snacks that I can read in a few hours. After reading 'The Giver', I was stunned. This was no snack. This was a medicinal.The meat of the story is compelling enough as Lowry sets for us the proposition of a Utopian society where all children are wanted and all members of a community productive and neighborly. But lurking therein is an odor of something not right, which becomes much stronger and definitive as we learn with Jonas just what his Assignment is to be.In my opinion, the bone of the story is revealed in Jonas' decision to leave the Community. Jonas carried me along on his journey, so much so that when we come to the end of the book, teetering on the snowy hill, Jonas faded and I was left there to decide what happened, not only to him, but, in a very disconcerting way, to me.All day I've been thinking about Jonas. It is cold and snowing today and I've been thinking, &quot;Could I walk in the snow, not knowing where I was going?&quot; I got a little hungry and thought, &quot;But, could I be starving and still go forward?&quot; Jonas' bravery and newly gained hope against all odds has stirred me. I've read and re-read the text to get some definitive answer about what finally becomes of Jonas, and have decided that it is enough to launch down the hill with him, hoping.That is what my daughter so much as said, when I ran to her room after finishing the book, distraught, and scared that the author had devised a truly sneaky way to cover his death. I asked her, &quot;What do you think it means?&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; she replied, &quot;of course he lives.&quot; Yes, he does. In me."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I absolutely loved this book! i haven't read anything by Lois Lowry since i was a pre-teen and i am so glad to have revisited her! This is a phenominal story of a boy's journey and growth. In a community based on sameness he has the courage to break free and make a difference, although he has to abandon everything he has ever known. it's amazing, it appealed to my science-fiction side as well as the side that loves a good, interesting story about humanity. The book isn't a lesson, it's a journey... almost like the memories the protagonist receives. This is must read, contemporary classic, if there is such a catagory! Enjoy. (PS- does anyone know if there is a sequel?)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I recommend The Giver by Lois Lowry.

Our class read the Giver. We liked it a lot but the ending was not so well done. We think that you could of made a better ending or at least made a continuation because this book could continue for a little while and make it much better a much book. You could of writin what would happen if Jonas came back and what happened to Jonas if he died or made it elsewhere and what was it like there. I think that you are a very good other because I have read some other books of yours and they were great so I think that you could of made the ending a little better because you have a lot of talent.

Try it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The most peculiar book that I really enjoyed is entitled The Giver by Lois Lowry. The Giver is about a boy named Jonas whose world is perfect. Everything is under control. There is no war or fear or pain. There are no choices. Every person is assigned a role in the community. When Jonas turns twelve, he is singled out to receive special training from the giver. The giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and of life. Now it's time for Jonas to receive and hear with the truth. This will cause a problem that Jonas cannot turn back on. Some of the things I learned from this book are that many people share fear and pain in the real world. But no one forces the pain on one person or another because that is selfish and cruel. However that is exactly what the members of the community forced on Jonas and the giver, which is completely wrong. I would recommend this excellent book to readers who are interested in weird, complicated, and different books. If I could compare this book to another such as The Pearl, I would rank them the same because they both were excellent books that I really enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you want to read a wonderful novel choose to read &quot;The Giver.&quot; At times this excellant book might seen out of this world, but it shows many descriptions of our world. The book features a boy named Jonas who is stuck in a world of sameness. This community is banded from many of the beautiful daily happenings of life. The members of the community cannot see colors or even feel different emotions. You are set into age groups by what year you were born in and do not have birthdays. After you turn twelve and you have received your assignment your assignment for and occupation you don't keep track of your age at all! Jonas is having a great life with his friends Asher and Fiona until he becomes a twelve and receives his assignment of receiver of memory. Slowly his friendships start to disappear as Jonas gathers restrictions given to him from his rules for his occupation like being able to lie. Jonas starts to see colors such as red and orange while even more come to him everyday for he has the power to &quot;see beyond.&quot; Jonas goes to the old receiver of memory or now known as the Giver to receive his training. The Giver gives Jonas many memories of joy and happiness, but is also forced to give him memories of fear and pain. As Jonas learns more about the life in Elsewhere the more eager he becomes to travel to Elsewhere no matter how far he must travel.

During the training for his assignment, he realizes that it can not go on like this with the community and he tries to change it. Normally, I would not read such a book, because I don't like science-fiction stories. I read it at school and in my oppinion, the book ist quite good. It makes you realize how life would be without natural things like colours or love. The only thing I did not like much was the end. I think the story ended too fast and I consider the end too vague. But all in all I think the book is absolutely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Hey! I'm in Seventh grade, we read this book for school. At first I thought it was going to be really boring, but it turned out to be an Awesome book. This book is set far into the Future. Jonas' world is Perfect, or so he thinks until be becomes the Reciever of Memory. When he is selected to be the Reciever, he recieves memories about the Worlds Past, Pain, Love, and Color. The thing is, Jonas' World has some good things: The weather is always sunny, you don't have to worry what your job will be when you get older (the Elders choose it for you), and their transportation is bicycles (So there would be no polution). A few Bad things are: Their world is Black and White, They are only allowed to have 2 children in each family (1 girl, 1 boy), They don't have their own children (someone is assigned to that job), they perform Release (I wont say what that is, because it kind of ruins the suspense), and No one has memories of how the World used to be.

I was completely absorbed. I can actually envision our society moving in that direction, the direction of &quot;oneness&quot;. It seems that the more we strive to be individuals in this country, the more we are criticized for being different.

This book is frightening in its cold portrayal of the future; horrifying in its descriptions of emotionless, ignorant people, yet it is an ultimately touching, eye-opening story. Lois Lowry's straightforward, simple writing style makes it possible for people of almost all ages to read The Giver; her interwoven themes of unrelenting hope and love in a lost, scared community make The Giver an absolutely necessary read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I felt that the Giver was a good book that showed kids the importance of emotions and their historical backround. I enjoyed the easy reading of Lowry's novel because I was never lost in it. It was also cool that the book took place in some &quot;other&quot; world that isn't like ours."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a fabulous book! When this book first came out, I read the reviews and decided that I needed to read this one, even though I am an adult. It was very good! I couldn't wait for my daughter to become old enough to read it as well, she was in the 3rd grade at the time. Well, my daughter read the book this last year and she now lidts it as one of her favorite books as well, right up there with &quot;The Phantom Tollboth&quot;, &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; and the Harry Potter books! What makes this book so wonderful, is that it makes you think beyond the black and whites in life. It helps put importance on memories of pain and sadness as a necessary part of hapiness. I would strongly recomend this book to anyone from the 5th grade and up!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book and how it was a different world were there was no colors and no memories the only person who had all the memories was the giver.

I loved this book and you will too. This is a great pick."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in 8th grade, 2 years ago. I can only say one thing about this book: amazing. The style in which Lowery writes is perfect, wonderful, spell-binding. While this book has come under much criticism for being too &quot;sexed&quot;, it definetly isn't. I recommend this book for anyone in 6th grade or above. It contains a strong message that only a talented writer could convey; and that Lois Lowery is."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book has such vivid details of an unfair world. Sure, everyone is employed, fed, and cared for, but our daily treasures - snow, family, choice - is gone. But when Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memory, he learns what life should be. This life is not the life that existed in his Communtity, but the life that existed before - and still should exist today."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My 7th grade class is currently reading the giver by Lois Lowry. The setting is in a futuristic perfect community. As a child, the members of the community are observed by a comity and their jobs are selected for them. The main character in this book, Jonas, is selected to be the receiver of memory. Jonas no longer has to follow the rules of the community. He has the most important job in the entire community. He goes through strenuous training to absorb the information that his tutor, the giver, is passing to him. He is a very important person to have in the community because if something bad was about to happen he could warn them of what happened before. The wording in the book is very difficult to understand. It takes a lot of thinking to understand the concepts in this book. This book is supposed to portray a perfect world but I think that the community is far from perfect. Everything in the community is based on sameness. This means that there are no advances and no differences among people. I think a world like that would be very boring because you would wake up every day and know what was going to happen. There is very little change in the daily schedule. A major reason why I think this wasn't a very good book is because the author's idea of a perfect world isn't mine.I gave this book two out of five star for three simple reasons. First of all I didn't agree with her idea of a perfect world. Jonas's world is far from anything that I would consider perfect. Secondly, I didn't think this book was very interesting. I had trouble reading more than two chapters at a time because the concepts of the book bored me. And lastly, I disliked the ending. I can't tell you about it but if you read this book after my review you will probably agree with my opinion of the ending. I would recommend this book only to those who like slow reading books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very gratifying book. And it's not just for kids. Children will be fasinated by the story of Jonas, the Giver, and the perfect world they live in. Adults will find a sufficiently good read here too. Lowry is a very talented writer, and with The Giver has fabricated an awesome idea, flexing her muscles with a good plot and memorable, likeable characters. My only complaint was this book could have been so much more. As an older reader (still young at heart I assure you :) I found myself grimising at how underdeveloped the Giver character was. He's such a remarkable creation, show us and tell us more about him Lois! I realize this is a Young Adult book, and that explains the shortness of it, but still, even as a kid I think I would want to know more. More about the other communities, a little bit more about Jonas, and mostly, so much more about the Giver! Towards the end, he simply disappears too. Still, despite Lowry's lack of giving us much on the Giver, her novel is a very exceptional read for the youth, and a good, quick and easy read for the adult, that will make you think."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The way Lois Lowry wrote this book is great. It is pretty confusing at first, but it clears up. It is weard how they think of our world and we think of theirs.

When finished I was speechless, I wanted to read it again. It was a kind of book I had never read before. Since reading the giver I have read about ten books ( which is very good for me)with excitement and enthusiasm and plan to do read more. The Giver opened many doors for me, one I have explained already, my new love for reading. The other, gave me a sense of what I want to do when I am older, I want to be a writer.

It may be hard to understand at times, or really hard to understand, but it will all come together in the end.

He gets elected the new receiver of memories, and has to accept painful, pleasant,fun and disturbing memories of the &quot;bad times&quot; from the Giver, or the old receiver.( We are living in &quot;bad times&quot;) Sounds kind of confusing already, doesn't it?

It was slightly creepy at some parts, but you have to accept that. It is incredibly well written. At the end of every chapter, there is a cliffhanger. I had the hardest time putting the book down!

I read this book in my 6th grade English class and I loved it. We had been reading books all year in there, and when we got to this book, my friends and I never complained about having to read it. We all loved it, and most of us even have read it again in our spare time. Everyone in my class (not just my friends) said after that year of reading that this was by far the best book we had read. It had great suspense and a amazing plot. I read science fiction books like this all the time now.

The main character, Jonas, has a lot of depth, and by the end I really felt like I knew him. This is a definite buy!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In his so called &quot;utopian&quot; world that has noloce,colors, piverty, or even choices, Jonas, a twelve-year-old boy,is chosen to be the Receiver of Memory. He receives other people's good and bad memories, which allow him to see colors and have feelings. He decides to run away, so he can change the community. He plans a risky scheme to escape from the community. While he is accomplishing his task, he has to face the hardships or winter, a season that his community does not have. When he reaches his destination, a community with love, choices, and family; he realizes how much better this new community is opposed to his old one. After I finished reading this book, I felt that jonas received what he desered because he was not a foolish kid, and he was very brave. The message that Lowry gives is that nothing is perfect because jonas thought that his world was great, but when he saw the memories, and compared them with his community, he changed his mind. I think that there are a lot of things that happen that way, for example, when you are buying a house, you think this one house is great, but when you see another, you think it is a lot better and choose that one. From my point of view, this is a very intersting book because it takes place in the future, and the author writes the book from her point of view on what the future would be like. I find the charecters very interesting also; when the the people in the community are given their assignments(their jobs), they are given a bunch of rules to follow, so that basically controls how thet behave. For example, if they are told that they can lie, they lie, and if they are told that the can be rude, they are rude. If i were Jonas, I would not have taken the job of the Receicer of Memory because you have to go through physical pain. The conflict in this book is that Jonas wants everyboy to see what he can see and to feel what he can feel. he does not know how to do that a t frist, but then, he decides to run away. He wants to do this because once he is gone from the community, the memories will come back to the other people, so they can experience them. I give this book a five star rating because it is very well-written, and the plot was well-planned. I couldn't put the book down!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was recommended to me by my granddaughter as her favorite book. I found the early chapters a bit confusing as to how the community structure was evolving in such a foreign way. It mystified me if this story was a human, animal, or unknown species. As the story unfolded I felt for young readers could be frightened or mislead by the structure and rules of the community, on how the community tolerated inhumane rules and violations of human dignity perpetrated on all ages. From the killing of young babies, the elderly, and the match making of couples in order to marry, as well as only allowing 2 children per family unit. Where did democracy, freedom, and individual choice disappear to, especially after all the past wars fought to protect FREEDOM for ALL!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book not knowing she was a &#34;children's author&#34;.

Somehow, I forgot that it was a \\"young adult\\" book so had to keep that in mind while I read it. It's a very short book, and very thought-provoking, but not incredibly engaging. Although I enjoyed the story and definitely recommend it, it wasn't an overly-exciting page-turner for me. I think it would be wonderful for a parent to read along with their young teenager. It reveals a very interesting societal concept and I think would open up quite a few channels for real-world communication for a parent/\\"child\\".(Would give it 4-stars for young-adult readers.)Good read - just make sure you remember its literary level and target audience while reading and you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I bought it to read to my class but loved it for myself!

It is a planned utopian society governed by Sameness, with no war, fear, or pain, but also no choices. The weather is perfectly controlled, no hills exist, no live animals are seen, and there is even no color or music. At age twelve, all people are assigned their roles in the community. The old, young children who do not thrive, and even those who rebel are \\"released.\\" Jonas is singled out to receive special training from the Receiver, who alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life and now becomes \\"the Giver,\\" so that Jonas can be trained as the new Receiver. Jonas's father is a nurturer and the family has been caring for a newborn named Gabriel who is not thriving, so the decision is eventually made that the infant will be released. Now that he has received the truth, how will Jonas react when he learns what it really means to be released? And what will he do?The Giver is well-written and quite interesting to read. However, to be truthful, I really did not care for it. And I think that my reaction basically involves the issue of age-appropriateness. The book is said to be written on an age nine to eleven reading level and is usually listed as being for age twelve and above, so it was apparently aimed at middle-grade students. However, I noticed that the Random House edition which I read is found in their \\"Teens\\" section, and others have recommended it basically for upper grades. There may be some value in the book for high school students to consider the consequences of a controlled society where people give up freedom for safety. However, there are certain aspects of the story--the infanticide, the euthanasia, and some rather oblique sexual references--which I think are just too heavy and thus are not appropriate for younger readers.Also, the ending is rather odd. Whether it is happy or not I guess all depends on the eye of the beholder. Is The Giver a horrific book? Not necessarily, although it has some things horrible to contemplate in it. Is it a useful book? Perhaps, under certain circumstances. Is it a good book? Each person will have to make up his or her own mind on that question. I do agree with the assessment that it is \\"For mature audiences, as there is an episode of euthanasia. The story questions values we take for granted. Caution, and probably pre-reading recommended.\\" There are three \\"companion\\" novels--Gathering Blue, Messenger, and now Son."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've probably read this book tons of times since I was a child, but I couldn't recite it for you. Every time I read it, it's like I have never read it before. The Giver always feels new and fresh to me. I continue to read it with surprise and heartbreak; and even now I find myself tearing up or down right crying at different parts in the novel. Sometimes I feel that Lois Lowry wrote this masterpiece with me in mind, like it was written just for me.The novel is relatively short and simple to read, but is full of powerful themes and deep meaning. Lowry shows the power of our senses, the importance of memories (good and bad), and the significance of being different. The world in The Giver is supposedly a perfect society, but that doesn't make it a Utopia. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, especially young adults and older children. I believe this book shaped me in some way to be the woman I am today."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is great juvenile reading. I've read this book several times and it is always good each time I read it. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Although ,I am a senior citizen, I thought this book was thought provoking. I would especially recommend it for young adults. It would provoke interesting discussions for a Book Club of any age.It stirred my senses."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"at the end of the book it leaves you hanging I don't like when books hang but i liked the booke i wonder if they die"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Terribly slow and old fashioned. I really did not like it and struggled to get through it. The story is original and different to most things I read, it just was outdated. Sorry.Ages 18-99"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver did not spark my attention. It was very boring and I found myself thinking of other thignss while reading this book. What I didn't like about The Giver specifically was the ending. I found it very difficult to read because you don't know what is happening to Jonas. The ending just plain didn't make sense to me as the reader."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is a good, easy read, probably able to be read in one sitting if there is sufficient time and determination. The plot is interesting and mysterious and draws the reader in quite quickly. If you're into these kind of books, this is the one I would recommend reading first, since it is the simplest. The book has a solid main character who is relate-able to young readers, so I would say this would be a better book for middle school age rather than high school and beyond it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was an alright dystopian at best. The book itself is an easy read and considered a middle-school level read. For an adult, this is a quick and easy read. The novel itself is short and leaves the reader on a cliff hanger of what is to come in other novels. The book is no more, than an introductory for people those who want to get into the genre of stories and novels under dystopia. At best, this book will hook you at first, but to reread this simple novel is not worth the trouble. It is a good one shot read and a good start for late readers who are starting to read in middle school at the grade level of seventh or eighth grade."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When my friend told me about this book I didn't think that I was going to like it. But when I read the whole thing I was surprised that I liked it. I love the way that Lois Lowry wrote the book. I was very pleased with how the story followed Jonas and overall, I liked the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book came in within the time guaranteed. great condition! Thank you! I am very happy with the service that Amazon provides for its users. It's reliable and always a go-to for gifts and school books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry was an interesting book to read. It was really interesting how the former giver had to pass on information that the former one gained through the years it is like passing down fighting techniques down to your pupil. That what makes a book like this interesting to see what happens next. If a lot of books were like that they would be more interesting to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"beggining is kind of bland and non descriptive but starts to get interesting a little bit later. the setting sounds communist and dull and not really intruiging until later but still a good read"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Had to read it in third grade. The book tries too hard. Post apocalyptic scenario, everyone's a mindless slave, etc. The book is alright if you're into apocalyptic scenarios and don't like violence. Definitely a bit out there compared to everyone else which is why I can see this book having so many stars. Does it deserve 5 stars, I definitely don't think so. Should you read it? Meh. Borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When there is a need to censor something, there is a lack of confidence, and when there is a lack of confidence, there is fear. For example, in The Giver, by Lois Lowry, many things were censored. One thing being that there were no books allowed in the community. The only books people were allowed to have and read were the dictionary, and a yellow pages-like book. That shows many things about a community, but it shows most of all that they don't want their people knowing about alternative ways of life, and also that the community is weak. There was also something called sameness. That meant that everyone of the same gender had the same characteristics. In the Giver there is absolutely nothing that is different, if there are identical twins, on of them is released from the community. In my opinion it is wrong to stop people from knowing what is there right to know. The book was good, but it was extremely confusing. The end of the book left a lot for the reader to think about. If you don't like books without a clear ending then this isn't the book for you. I didn't like the book because of how much It did end up confusing me. There was so much left to the imagination at the end that I didn't know what to think about."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an excellent book and one I would highly recommend. There is much deeper philosophy than meets the eye within this small novel. I was intrigued by the society found within it; The Giver is a book enjoyable as a simple read on one level, and an excellent treatise on the human state on the other. As you read it, make parallels between the book and our current society. The book itself is a metaphor hearkening to modern society, and defiantly deserved the 4 stars I am giving it. A 5th star was not achieved for a couple reasons; one, the book is perhaps a bit on the short side. Finally, the ending of the book was, for me, a bit of a drop. We will see how you like it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I love \\"The Giver\\" more and more each time I read it. It is an absolutely unique story that forces the reader to ask many questions concerning life and society. Reading \\"The Giver\\" means stepping into a world where expectations are that everyone is the same. Slight differences are frowned upon and everyone in the community is assigned a specific role. Jonas is a character that displays a vast range of human emotions which makes him easier to relate to. Watching Jonas' life change throughout the novel is painful and thrilling. This book will leave you wanting more and yet questioning what you've just read. I highly recommend \\"The Giver\\". It is a great read and I guarantee you won't soon forget it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed reading The Giver. At first I thought the book was a little strange and I didn't understand it much, but as I got further and further into it it became more interesting. I felt myself being pulled into the society in which Jonas and his family live. This society is so very different than our own and it is interesting to see what the world would be like if we were all the same. The book really stresses the importance of individuality, emotions, and memories. As you read through the story you find that the \\"perfect\\" society isn't so perfect. There are many flaws and things that people can no longer enjoy. I've always wondered what it would be like if everyone was the same and now I have my answer. I think The Giver is well worth reading. It's not hard to understand yet it brings up many questions and really makes you think. It's a nice book that you can sit down and easily enjoy in one day."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is definitely worth your time to stop and read. Lois Lowry has created this brilliant novel about a young boy in a world where order rules everything. As the plot unravels, you start to realize some of the things that you have taken for granted in our world of imperfection. You are introduced to a community where your life is planned out and free-will is no longer existent. As you finish this novel, you will be questioning whether or not you could thrive in a world like that. If you value your individuality, then you will more than likely enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved The Giver. I thought it was one of the most insightful and thought-provoking books that I have ever read. What intrigued me the most was the society that Lois Lowry created in this book; a society where everyone and everything is the same. It seems like it would be completely impossible, but is it? Could our government, in the hopes of making life easier for us, slowly turn our society into this one? I don't know the answer, but it's something to think about.I also liked the way she explained the importance of memories. It's true that memories can often be painful, as both the Giver and Jonas experience, but they can also bring joy. In the Elders attempt at making life painless, they also took away that joy. No one in this society really lives, they just go through the motions of life contently, but they aren't really happy. It is memories and the ability to choose that make life worth living."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an excellent book that not only has one inparticular moral or meaning, but many that can be interpreted differently. It's also a quick read that I wish was longer!! I enjoyed the complexity of characters like Jonas, and the Giver as well as the simplicity of characters like Asher, and Jonas's mom and dad. It is a very interesting story; the very setting of this story drew me into it as well as the actual content of the book. It is amazing how much intelligent well though through information they put in this book. At first the book may seem a bit strange, but if you keep reading it becomes relatable in some way to our own lives. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, quick read. Also to anyone who enjoys books that make you think!! If you don't get into it right away hang in there the endings the best part!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I highly encourage everyone to read the book The Giver. The setting for the story is in what would seem to me to be a cold, dark, colorless world, in which Jonas, a 12 year old boy, lives. As the book progresses, you learn to understand Jonas and that world in which he lives, and by the end, you totally root for him to accomplish what he sets out to do. I think that if you enjoy a good book, this one would be an excellent one to read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I first began the Giver, I was not entirely sure that I liked it. The Community was so orderly and repressed, not my usual type of story. However, by the time I was about halfway through, I had come to really like the story. Jonas, the lead character grows and matures, drawing in the audience in the process. The missing pieces fit together, and by the intriguing conclusion, the reader is sure to be rooting for Jonas. I recomend this to everyone, it is a really great book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I believe this book is a must-read for everybody. The background information in the story is very thorough while managing to not be revealing. By the end of the story pieces of the plot that may have initially seemed jagged fit together and leave you with a powerful message about the superiority of an imperfect world to a perfect one and the tendencies of human nature. The unfolding of the plot was very well crafted as well as the the conclusion of the story and its illustration of the strength, courage, and humanity each of of us possess. The result of these constituents is a superior piece of literature and a must-read book for everyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I first started to read this book, I didn't like it at all, but it gets a WHOLE lot better and it is the best sci-fic book I have ever read!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a pretty good book overall but I felt that it needed more for the ending. I can't imagine living in a world without color, pain or feelings. The end of every chapter had a cliffhanger which was really annoying. Memories of war, fun, pleasure, it made little sense how you can remember things from past generations. Why do they call babies by numbers for their first year of life?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a great book. Lois Lowry was the perfect author for writing this book. She made the end of every chapter with suspence. There are many twists and turns through the book. There are parts that will make you say, \\"Oh my gosh.\\" You will not want to put this book down. Read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book. It is very mysterious and suprising. It is also strange and unusual. It was strange because the community is different. There are no problems, sicknesses, or hunger. Lois Lowry made the book interesting. She also makes you think. After you start reading it you won't want to put it down. The ending ruined the whole book. The Giver is not a book I would buy, but I would read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found the Giver to be a very easy book to enjoy. This book was great because it had suspence and to me every good book needs to keep the reader on the edge. Even if you don't like fiction books The Giver is good because in some way everyone can relate to the the main character Jonas. I recommend this book to anyone of any age."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think The Giver was a pretty good book, however I did not like the ending. I gave this book only 3 stars because it was unrealistic. At first the beginning does not make much sense, but then you start to understand it. I think Lois Lowry was very creative while writing the Giver. I think she should make a sequal to The Giver because it left you so blank with all these questions. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes to make up their own endings to a book and wonder about it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is an okay book, but may leave you hungry for more. It is a thinking book, making you ask questions to yourself most of the time.The book is good in the beginning but it has a terrible ending.

It could have been great but the ending brought it down."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a spectacular book written by Lois Lowry. With every new chapter, comes another cliff hanger.

Aside from that, the plot is ever thickening. The book is amazingly descriptive, but not over descriptive. You feel as if you are actually in the book!

The only negative is the cliffhanger ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Can you imagine living in a world where there are no memories or feelings? This book written by Lois Lowry, was alright until the ending. It was pretty cool how you found out that these people are color blind but it was totally unrealistic. There were many surprises that I didn't expect to happen but it was kind of odd that the community didn't even know what pain or love was. I personaly hated the end of the book because they left many things unanswered like what happened to the Giver, what happened to the community, and what happened to Jonas and Gabriel.I would recommend this book to someone who likes wierd books but not to someone who likes good books like me."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Have you seen in black and white?

The problem with the neighborhood that the people think they have a life of perfection but really, they have no freedom because every single person has someone else decide what the people will and wont do.Jonas is chosen to be The Giver by the elders. The Giver is the person who holds the memories of before the neighborhood was supposed to be perfect. Jonas runs away from the neighborhood because he doesn't think anything should be perfect.The Giver was an O.K. book to me. This book was fiction, I recommend this book to people 12 and up and who like morals in stories and who like adventurous books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a good book, but isn't my absolute favorite. It tends to be a bit boring in the beginning, but once the pace picks up, it's a great read all the way until the end. Books that talk about a Utopia, like Jonas' are a nice contrast to our society. I think everyone should read this book or a book like it to know that not everything is always as it seems. There are always things that affect us and our society, even when we don't notice it. As a twelve year old boy, Jonas has to realize these things. He realizes what is good and bad about how his community is run. He discovers new and beautiful things along the way. But is it enough to keep him grounded when he realizes activities and happenings that just don't seem quiet right, and some that are completely chilling? I loved Jonas' discovery journey all the way until the very end. The book has a great ending, I loved it. Even though in one moment everything seems to go bad, there is always a good ending to everyday.Brittany Clevenger,A Virual High School Student."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said in these 2,000 plus reviews. I have read this book many times since grade school and the words still echo in my head.

When he is a Twelve (Twelve years old) his role in the community is to be the Receiver of Memory. The Giver (his \\"boss\\") gives him the memories of the past, like color, pain, war, love, and other things unavailable to their community. They both want the community to have those things, so Jonas does something no one else has ever done, with his friend Gabe.

I saw this book and thought it looked interesting. I loved the wholes series so much that I bought them so my son would have them when he got a little bit older.

Just one more view of what the future of humankind might hold."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It is not often that you come to a book that is as thought provoking as The Giver. This book has a good life lessons found within it without being didatic.

The Giver is a futuristic story of a boy named Jonas who's world is perfect. In his life there is no fear, no war, no pain, no feeling, no hunger, nothing. Everything is made to be exactly the same. Everything is done according to the community leaders. Everybody in the community is given their job when they turn twelve. Jonas turns twelve and is chosen to become the receiver of memory. As he trains with The Giver, he finds out that the community he lives in is not fair. Everyone is not being able to feel the good things in life but the good side of it is they can't feel the bad things in life either. The people who don't live to the rules of the community are \\"released\\". Jonas finds out that this release process is like death. He decides that it is his job to return what he has been taken from the community and its people. With the help of The Giver, Jonas exscapes from the community which will result in the release of all memories to the community. The memory release shows the members of the community the unfelt feelings of pain, famine, war, as well as human differences, love, and happiness from before. This book reminds me of a movie that I saw called \\"Equilibrium\\". It's almost exactly the same but they take some kind of drug to keep them so they don't feel any emotion because they believe that human emotion causes wars. So if they don't take this drug they are killed. It is almost the same except there's alot of fighting scenes. That's why I like this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book that keeps you captivated and wanting to read more. The world Lois Lowry writes about is easy to get caught up in and makes you feel like your there right beside Jonas living what he is living. The journey of Jonas makes you think and see things and in various new ways. This is a book that you could read over and over and always have a new question pop into your head."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is really good because it takes you into a whole new world like alice and wonderland. Well this book is a really creepy book because its a distopia world because they think they're living the perfect life when they're really living a sick life and take away the true colors of life by taking pain and pleasure from life. I'm sure if you read it you'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you haven't read the book yet, be careful reading the reviews on this page. Some of them give away a great deal about the plot.The most important theme, to me, was seeing the society through the perspective of its members. From our own society, we look at it and disagree with the rules, the structures, the lack of choice. We see so much that is missing. From within the society, nobody knows that it could be different. It's hard to understand this point of view, but _The Giver_ illustrates it clearly.Another reviewer has complained that the community members could not call their society &quot;ideal&quot; because they have no comparisons. He's right to point this out, but in fact the community members never do make that comparison. Life is for them is the same always and everywhere.I can understand parents' complaints about the scenes of killing. I would like to point out, though, that they may be overestimating the innocence of their children. I'm in my thirties now, but I clearly remember that most of my 5th grade class was fascinated by books about the Holocaust. The scenes in _The Giver_ are sterile, emotionless, clean; far from the horrors we hear of in the news.On the other hand, I have no idea why anyone would object to the dream Jonas has early in the book. Sick? No way. It's about the healthiest thing that happens to him."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a brilliant but incredibly grim book. The perfect world that young Jonas lives in is really a nightmare and the situations that are described here might be too much for a younger or sensitive child."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am a fifth grade teacher and read this novel silently during Reading Workshop. Each day, reading workshop would last longer and longer because I was so absorbed in the book. Many of my students inquired about this book while I was reading it during Reading Workshop. I told everyone who asked that it was an absolutely wonderful book; however, I also only recommended the book to those students who had an open mind. The book has some deep topics that might frighten some parents when they find their child is reading this book. However, as a parent, myself, I wouldn't discourage my own child from reading it. I love books that make you think. This is one of those books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you have ever wondered what it would be like to live in utopia, this book is something you should take a look at. The Giver is one of my all time favorite novels because it brings me to a new world. I find that every time I read this novel, I enjoy it even more than the last time. The story of Jonas and his journey to become &quot;The Giver&quot; of his particular society. The story becomes interesting when Jonas has to decide whether or not he can deal with this great honor. I loved the novel as a whole, but I have a problem with the abrupt ending. It just goes to show that nothing in this world is perfect.-Ernest Bennett(Avon High School) ;-&gt;"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a great book. I enjoyed it very much, even though I thought it was a little weird. I couldn't quite grasp the concept, but about 9 pages into the book I completely got the book. I gave it 5 stars because of the imagery, the concept of the city, and the total realization of this place that it was almost real like I could just touch it. As reading the book I was kind of thrown off the subject I could not understand what was happening. Jonas to me seemed different from all the other people in the book. Like he had some kind of special power over the others. When I reached the part about the &quot;Giver&quot; or boss I completely understood what Jonas was to do. I could never imagine live in a place where you couldn't be free to think and do. Where you where told what you where to for the rest of your life. The concept of this book was so surreal that you can picture it happening and you can create the scene inside to your head. Jonas didn't like the way things were being run. When he finally understood what was happening, like for example when he finally saw what being &quot;released&quot; meant when his father killed the other twin or how you had to apply for a child. When he came to harsh reality that the game he often par took in was actually a sing of war and the other kids didn't know what was happening, but Jonas knew what pain was and told them to stop. Over all the book was very well written and I wish they would make a squel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Some books seem to focus on just delivering the point the author is trying to make and getting it over with as quickly as possible, but the author of The Giver spends the entire book illustrating her point, and really making a wonderful little novel out of it. I enjoyed the way that Jonas interacted with his parents, and the way that Lois Lowry depicted a socitey without any shared memories. I really think that The Giver is a wonderful balance of great storytelling wrapped around a thought-provoking premise, that will captivate all readers for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book for the first time in fourth grade and now as a freshman in high school, I still read this book at least once every year. No book I've ever read has effected me so deeply. It has shaped the way I see things in our society and caused me to care about thnigs I otherwise might not have. I think it should be required reading for everyone. If you can't appreciate this book, you're a bonehead."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am now almost 18 and I hav probably read this book a billion times. Just this past school year, I used this book for a psychology paper. This book is a classic and anyone who reads it should also one day read &quot;Brave New World.&quot; Good job, Ms. Lowry."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"There were hundreds of reviews before mine, so I won't waste trying to describe the book and I'll get to the point. I had to read The Giver as a novel study in my class and it was my first venture into science fiction. I loved it so much I even bought my own paperback copy of it. It's a novel that is at first dark, but in the ambiguous end plants a seed of hope in Jonas' brainwashed society. It is a truly amazing story that made me question the way our world is today. Is the increasingly important role of technology slowly taking over the humans that created it? What are winning and what are we losing when taking away the ability to see color? These questions will leave you wondering for years after you read The Giver.Something that is very much argued about is the ambiguity of the ending. Sometimes, I do admit it was frustrating to be left with so many questions unanswered, but think about it this way; would you like a magician as much if he told the audience exactly how he did every trick? A true entertainer always leaves something to the mind of the audience. All in all, this book is either love-it-or hate-it. It all boils down to your own personal beliefs, morals, and upbringing. I think this is why the author didn't want to put in her own personal beliefs into the ending, and decided to leave it up to the reader's imagination. This book will never rust and will stand the test of time. Read it twenty-five years later and it will still be as relevant as it is today."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think the book, \\"The Giver\\", is an interesting, but slow book. It is interesting because it uses odd ideas, but the ideas are not hard to understand. In The Giver, people could not see colour, be in love or sad. If someone were sad, they would want something, and if someone wanted something, that person would want to steal, and if someone steals, people would hate each other and if people hated each other war would break out. If there was colour, people might prefer a certain colour. If people preferred a certain colour, they would want that colour, so colour is removed from the community The Giver is told in.Some people may censer this book because of nudity and people killing themselves, but the events in this book are very important to the plot. In the book, if someone does something wrong, they are released. Release is death, but no one in the community knows what death is. All people in The Giver are happy and feel they are in paradise, but no one knows anything better then their life.If I had to rate The Giver, I would give it a three and a half stars. The reason i would give this book three and a half stars is because I found the book a bit slow. The book was a bit slow because nothing happened till about half way into the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, written by Lois Lowry, is not only a strange but an interesting novel.It is based on the theme on Utopia.

So the story line was really good in this book but did not tell me what I wanted to know. The other thing that bugs me is that it tells you that they don't have colour and weather but they do not tell you how they got rid of it.Becky Holden mr.C's grade 7 class"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver leads you on a wild fantasy ride through a perfect civilization. It captivates you with it's interesting storyline and it's very diverse characters. This book is different from all others that I've seen with it's original storyline and plot.It all begins when Jonas, a simple twelve year old in the community, gets selected to be the new Receiver of Memory for all of the community. In the Giver's hands over the course of a year, Jonas experiences things he has never known. Pain, love, death and so many other feelings and colours his community has and never will know. This is when Jonas realizes things must change.This book opens the eyes of it's readers and makes you see how good our world really is. We have choices we can make, colours we can see and feelings we can express towards others around us. In Jonas's world they don't have any of these things. Though people in our world sometimes express feelings of hate and anger, we still are lucky to now what these things are and how to fix themI thought this book written by Lois Lowry was original, fascinating and provocative. Though Lois Lowry has been accused of being a pessimistic in the end of the book, I think the opposite. I believe that in the final chapter the storyline is meant to be that of joy and happiness.Traci Verleyen"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I give this book 5 stars. I am just a simple 12 year old boy, but this book inspired me. The Giver told me what might be the future. I think 12 year olds should read this book because it makes them use their brains and think. Lois Lowry wrote this book well, except for the dream Jonas had , and the needle in gabs head . Overall , I thought she had good detail on the memories and how the community was run. It was very intriguing in many ways and no matter what , I was always on my heels because of all the action going on. It taught me some ways of life, and the truth. It made me re-think what I have and what I've got. It was a different book for me because i usually read mystery or murder books but to me this was an \\"everything\\" book. It was an ambiguous book that means it makes you decide for yourself. It treats you like an adult so you can make choices. When I first read this book I felt more mature. It is an amazing book , that's why I gave it 5 out of 5 stars. If I were you I would read this book . Lois Lowry is a great writer and I wish she would write a sequel. Treat Lois Lowry and read this book. In my 12 years of life I will say this was one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think this book is the best book I have ever read in my life.

It makes us appreciate what we have in life and what Jonas did not have. It has a lot of the same ideas from the book I Am David like how they both escaped from places to get elsewhere.It is like the movie Pleasantville, they are both in black and white like the olden day's. I would not recommend this to young children because it has some bad scenes but it would be okay for teachers in grade 7 and above. I would highly recommend this book to people it is a very good book.

I rate this book four out of five because of this reason."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I recommend this book because the author, Lois Lowry, wrote it with great detail describing everything and putting a picture in your head. The book is about a boy named Jonas, he is 11 3/4 years old. In the place he lives, his community has a ceremony for when you become twelve. You get assigned a permanent job that you have to keep. Jonas is worried about what job he will get and none of the jobs seem quite right for him. The only bad part of the book is the ending seems sped up and rushed, but overall the book is a good book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I liked &quot;The Giver&quot;, by Louis Lowry very much. I recomend it to everyone. It is about a perfect world where everyone is the same exept for Jonas, the main charecter. I liked the idea of a perfect world, but his was not perfect in my opinion. Jonas thinks outside the box and tries to understand the reality of his life. I think we as Americans should try to do this also. We thought that no one could harm us, and Jonas thought that his life would always be the same. We were wrong as was Jonas. If there ever is a sequal it will answer many questions."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I liked the Giver because it was exciting. I liked the adventorous things Jonas did in the book. I thought that Jonas being selected as the Receiver of Memory was cool because he is the only child in the community who is special.

At the end of each chapter ,the author, Lois Lowry leaves you questioning and wanting more. I liked this book because it gives you a shocking look of what the past or present looks like.

I have read many books in my years. The plot is cool, and I won't give it away. The ending is a little sketchy but you get to understand it if you think about it. I gave the book only 4 stars because of the ending. Don't \\"dis\\" the book because it's fiction or because its weird. That's the point- FICTION. Not real! Just read the book.

Everything is diffrent."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is an adventurous and interesting book. This book is about a unique and different society that humans have never adapted to and will never adapt to. I thought this book was interesting and different than others that I have read in the past few years.

His \\"community\\" takes place in the future. In Jonas' community no one can see colors, hear music, or make choices. Everything is peaceful. No one is hungry or sick, or even different. There is only one person in the community who knows how the community came to be. This is The Giver, and young Jonas has been selected to become the next Giver. Soon Jonas and The Giver are the only ones who know about animals, hills, emotions, wars, Christmas, and sled rides in the snow. They are the only ones who know what happens when you are released.This book is an awkward and often difficult read if you like to read for enjoyment. Lois Lowry's The Giver, however, takes a unique look at the mind of an adolescent put into an adult unique story of mind games and adventure, memories, and fear. Jonas experiences all of these things for the first time and you as the reader get to see what that feels like. As with many tales of future utopias, Jonas's once perfect world becomes a nightmare. Can The Giver help his community understand who they really are? Can Jonas find peace in a place called Elsewhere? Find out in Lois Lowry's The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great novel that makes you think. Have you ever wished the world could be rid of all the pain and suffering we all must live through? A world without warfare and poverty would be perfect...and it seemed so to Jonas and everyone else in his community. Jonas was happy, until he slowly learns that living in a world where everyone is equal is not worth what they are sacrificing. Without hurricanes there is no sunlight, and without hate there is no love. He learns ignorance is not bliss and he does not live in a perfect world after all. This book takes you into this \\"perfect world\\" and then into Jonas's new one. It is both a page turner and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very fascinating book. Lois Lowry creats a very well thought out community without anything that the citicenz can do or think about negative. Everthing has to be preciece and perfect.

Joanas takes Gabriel (mabey his brother) and his memories he goes to another community or sies getting their. TWO THUMBS UP."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've read The Giver twice, once as a confused fifth grade student and recently as part of an online class assignment as a high school Junior. This book never fails to entertain my senses and keep me clutching on to its paperback until I finish the very last page. It's an amazingly artful weaving of words that keeps the attention of all its readers, young and old. It's intriguing to try to fathom a world in which there is no yesterday. This is a world where social classing is non existent. Each and every individual of this community has the same house, the same size family, the same hair style and clothing. If that is not challenging enough, imagine a life built on ignorance rather than past experience and knowledge. A life without memory, without pain, without feeling whatsoever. The story centers on Jonas, on the brink of turning twelve at the beginning of the novel, in a utopian society. Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory for the colony. Jonas, and those Receivers before him, stores the collective memories of those things which their society has managed to forget over the time they've been apart from the rest of the world. Jonas's then can see his world as it really is. This is definitely a thought provoking tale and full of twists and turns. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found this to be truly incredible book. It is able to display effectively why individuality should be celebrated and how a society that encourages sameness will only force it's members to a sort of pointless existence. It also gives a rather meaningful life lesson. That without feeling the true pain and anguish that life has to offer, you cannot feel the full extent of its love and happiness either. It offers a sense of extremes that everyone is meant to meet and deal with in order to fully appreciate what they have. Without that balance between the very bad in our lives and the very good, we lead a mundane existence, because we don't know how to truly know emotion and live."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a wonderful book for all ages. THE GIVER provides a startling example of the importance of shared experiences and the impossibilty of utopian societies. The concept of opposites not existing without the other is also explored in THE GIVER, when pain cannot be eradicated without also eradicating pleasure. Lois Lowry has created a beautifully written book that you will think about for days after reading it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is probably one of the best in its genre. It provides such an amazing storyline and settings of a perfect society but with no feelings, memories, differences, or even colors. The society was erased of memories, feelings, differences, and colors to ensure an society of no crimes, dangers, and horrors. A society where everyone shall come together as one with no complaint, worries, or facing any problems/dangers. But this wasn't the right society, the way of life the world was built up to be. To have peace is to have war, to have good is to have evil, and to be happy is to be sad. The world can't be perfect without mistakes to allow the term of perfection occurs. Jonas, a boy born different than others and who was able to see the world with colors, saw the same purpose. At the age of 12, where kids of age 12 must be sent off to jobs, he was sent to The Giver... And the story of the true perfect human, Jonas, begins..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If I didn't have to read this book for a class I would have read three pages and put it back on the shelf. After reading it and and understanding the message the author was trying to send I realized that the book was a nice little bit of literature. It put across to me that all of the little differences in the world should be celebrated, not shunned. All of the little things in life aren't appreciated, and I think Lois Lawry is trying to tell us to wake up and look around at all of the beauty in our world before we destroy it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Looking for a quick read that you just cannot put down? Well sit back and prepare to be emerged into another amazing world of fantasy. Author Lois Lowry has created a place in our hearts and in time where conformity and sameness rules all. Welcome to a world where you can not choose anything, not even your spouse or your job. To a place where strong emotions, like tears, anger, pain, and even love, are kept from you. Imagine living in such a place, not knowing anything about the way we live now. Then, imagine receiving all of the knowledge: of war, of peace, of pain, of hunger, of love. The Giver takes you inside a life like this. You follow a young boy through all the pains and joys of our own lives, learning and growing along side him. This magical fantasy is ridiculously thought-provoking. Prepare to open your mind to new possibilities, to ask yourself: \\"what if?\\" This most enjoyable book will leave you with heart-warming experiences and a story you can play out in your own mind. I strongly suggest this book to those with great imaginations and those who are ready to be captured into a solemn truth of growing up and entering an entirely new world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, was an excellent book. It gave a lot of insight into what the world would be like if there was no love, and a rule and role for everyone in the community. The main character, Jonas, is a young boy at the age of 12. He is a typical boy, who loves to play with his friends, and is very bored of school. When he gets chosen for his specific job in the community at the Ceremony of Twelve, it was no surprise. Jonas's best friend, Asher, is a very loveable, carefree character; so much so that it almost makes the reader sorry for him because he cannot love. I would recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would reccomend this book because it is like something no one has ever experienced. The feeling of no color symbolized things Jonas thinks is amazing that we take for granted. Family units show how we take our parents for granted, siblings, pets. The feeling of love towards Gabe that Jonas experienced is something we can all relate to.Elsewhere is like Heaven. The sled, the beautiful lights... a feeling of joy. This book is full of emotions; happiness, love, sorrow, anger; true anger, and pain.The Giver is THE best!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would tell people about this story b/c its a good boo it shows what the world could be if we had sameness.But I think most people I told them about it they wouldnt really like it b/c of the release part b/c everyone would just want to die of old age.But some I think some really wouldnt understand b/c they don't have kids.But if they did I think they would dislike the book.So I would tell them about the book.But to certain people NOT all people i know b/c they wouldnt enjoy it but yet agan some people would enjoy it but at the same time dislike it at times!."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"THE GIVERI would give the GIVER 5 stars because it has Vary Vary Good description.

He had everything going great. His friends were always there for him, there was no war, and no pain at all. Everything was in peace. When he turned twelve, he was assigned a special role like no other. Jonas was selected to receive special training from an elder man, who was called the Giver. The Giver showed him things that happen in the real world, introduced Jonas to things such as snow, sleds, runners, colors, downhill, and many other things that we experience in normal life. Then it was finally time for Jonas to get the truth, so he showed him the pain and pleasure of living a \\"real\\" life.My favorite part in this book was when the \\"Ceremony on Twelve's.\\" It just came around the corner. This event shows a group of children who are to turn twelve. All of the children were assigned a job. These are the jobs that they must attend to for the rest of their lives. During this event, Jonas was the last to receive a task. This part was very exciting.Overall, I think that this book was great! It had a lot of cliffhangers. I couldn't stop reading on and on.

Still a must read book:)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that \\"The Giver\\" was a very good book. I liked it because it kept you thinking a lot and was very interesting and exiting. The part I don't like is the confusing words and sentences it uses. I also don't like how it lets you decide what happens at the end.

The people each year at the ceremony of twelve which is when the children get their jobs they choose a giver. A giver holds all the memories and can see colors and hear music. Also they are the only people besides the people who perform the release to know the truth ( release is instead of death you'll have to read the book to find out what it is). The book really makes you think and can jog your mind about the future."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book starts out in the twentieth century just like us. Everything in their own little world on earth is the same. There is complete control over everything and everyone. No one in their community has any choices of what they can do or what they can feal. They have lost it all and only one person in their community is holding all of the memories to advise their town on choices that they may have. HIs name is the Giver and he starts to pass on the memories to the new reciever named Jonas. Jonas experiences happy thoughts and pain that he has never felt before. As he recieves these new memories he relizes that this isn't the way to live and he tries to change it. Jonas and the Giver come up with a plan to send back all the memories to the community so that everyone can feal happiness and pain again.I give this bok a four out of five stars. The author cought my attention and held onto it though out the whole book. The author did a good jod with not going into deep detail. She was very concise though out the book. SHe explained the characters with good detail and the setting of the book. I would spend hours reading and telling myself, \\"just one more chapter\\". The only thing that bugged me a little was the ending. They got me all worked up in the end and i really wanted to find out what happended next but the author ended it kind of in a funny way. After i was done I wished that she had written more and not ended so soon. That ending bothered me for awhile and I had to read another book to get that one off my mind.

The main charactors are a boy named Jonas,who is 12 years old, the Giver,and a little boy name Gabe. They live in a comunity away from everyone else where they dont have feelings and everyone in equal. I don't like this selection because they're trying to be perfect and when they were doing that, they killed people for no reason, like if they're old or if they dont mature fast enough. Also they dont have love or familys.by... Lydia Barrett"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This particular book, has many characterics that we did not like, and many that we did. We both enjoyed reading about a futuristic novel, conerning children our own age. If you are younger, you may not understand some concepts wthin this book. If you are older, however, you will enjoy this book a great deal. This book has lots of good details about a small community that does not exist. You have the power to create a scenery to this book, and use your imagination. This book has many other concepts. If you are immature, you may not react the way your age is expected to.Other than that, it was an okay book and I would reccommend it to other people. I think this is the kind of book that many people may feel very weird in the beginning.When you first start to read The Giver, you will be confused a bit, but as your read further in the book, you will realize all of this makes sense Yet you will enjoy it at the end.

The story begins in a perfect community,where there is no color, a lot of rules, and the community has sameness.An example of that is that the only one who has books is the reciever of memory.Also, no one has individual birthdays, and all members of the community only see black and white.Some of the characters are, Asher, Lily, Mother, Father,Fiona, and the Chief Elder. The three main characters are, a smart boy named, Jonas, a wise old man called, The Giver, and last but not least, a baby named Gabriel.The book &quot;The Giver&quot; is about a perfect community.In the community, Jonas (the little boy), feels apprehensive because the ceremony of Twelve is rapidly approaching. That is a ceremony where twelveyear old children are chosen for their job. Jonas gets assigned a very important job, but when he finds out the secrets that the community is hiding he has to make a difficult decision.I would recommend the book, &quot;The Giver&quot; by:Lois Lowry to anyone because this book has won the Newberry Award, and the author has a good writing style.

The Giver must give up the memories he received, of the past,to Jonas, even if they are painful. This story takes place in a community that is &quot;perfect&quot; but very dull. The reason I say that is because the citizens are not aloud to have feelings of love and hate.In the beginning of the story Jonas is an 11 that is apprehensive about the up coming ceremony. During the ceremony his number (19) was skipped over. When the Cheif Elder was done with telling the other 12s their accupation, she came back to Jonas.

But sometimes I see something, and maybe its beyond!&quot; Thats how I felt at the end of the exiting and adventurous book the Giver by Lois Lowry. That quote was made by one of the main charachters Jonas. Jonas has light eyes and Dark hair. He has the gift of seeing beyond with one other person,The Giver. Some of the other characters are, Mother, Father, Lily, Asher, Chief Elder&lt;and Gabriel! The setting of the Giver is in a place of sameness,no color and borindness,just picture the oppisite of our world and you got it!!I thought the author,Lois Lowry did a great job with detail and discription.I like the suspense ans sadness at the end of the book.The book has an exiting end and leaves you to decide the fate and destiny of Jonas and his friends and family! I was very impressed by the vocabulary of Lois Lowry. One quote that shows that is the following one: &quot;I'm apprehensive,thats what Iam!&quot;,by Jonas!The plot of the book is odd. First Jonas becomes the new Reciever. Then he wants to make his own decisions ect. because of his memories.Then they make a plan!! You have to read the book to figure out what happens. All and all this book is great and I recomend this book to anyone!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry has put together a choppy and strangely writtenchronicle of conformity. Young Jonas lives in a community of samness and safety--- that provides the extremely dull basis for the first few chapters.Maybe it would be better if the action started sooner, thedetail might please, oh, how about a professor of grammar? BORING! For a kid, defintely too physcological.The character were quite realistic however."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is on n amzing subbject.

Jonas, while reaching the age of twelve, is assighned to a job for the rest of his life, along with all the other twelve year olds. Growing up in a set community where all he knows is what he has been told.His whole life is a lie, but he does not realize that.After the ceremony in December, Jonas receives a job assignment unlike any other. His friends receive jobs such as Caretaker, and Recreation Director, while he recieves the mysterious job of being the Reciever. This is the start of everything he has ever known beginning to unfold. He is faced with many choices, and decisions that the rest of the community could never even understand.I recommend this book to anyone who is bored with their life, and feel the need for stimulation. This book definatley makes you think, and leaves you with a suprise ending that can be interpreted in many ways."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver related the story of Jonas, a child growing up in a world where \\"sameness\\" is the order of the day. All actions, events and behaviors are well defined and regulated by \\"the leaders\\". The \\"leaders\\" believe they have created a Utopian society of general comfort and well-being, good health and absence of fear.The fact remains, however, that this is nevertheless a human society and there are complications. The basic animal urges of the human species must be managed. There are \\"communities\\" beyond this one's border with different practices and customs. There are unforeseen events to be dealt with. There are old technologies and practices that must be avoided to maintain sameness. How to do that is managed through the office of The Receiver of Memory, a lonely and solitary member of the community who has been imprinted with all the historical, emotional and other human \\"memories\\" that need to be kept alive (for those who forget history are doomed to repeat it, a scenario definitely not in the game plan for this community). He is a figure of great respect within the community whose role is to use his memories to advise the \\"leaders' in times of crisis and/or confusion.Jonas' world is turned upside down when he is selected to become the next Receiver of Memory. He not only experiences the pain and grief of all the long forgotten, yet stored memories-grief, starvation, war, hate and so on-but also learns the cruel tradeoffs and the intrinsic hypocrisy that the \\"leader\\" engage in to maintain their Utopian society. And as he continues to train, Jonas eventually is faced with a situation that forces him to choose whether he personally can be part of the hypocrisy and deception that maintains that system.A thoughtful, well written, extraordinarily moving story with lovingly created characters, the Giver is a book that can-and will-offer philosophical challenges to readers of any age.One of the best books for younger adolescents I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book about a boy named Jonas. Jonas is 11 years old and is growing up in a time where everyone and everything is the same. He lives with his family unit which consists of his mother, his father, his little sister, and himself. When he turns the age of 12 he is assigned a job in the comunity. But he doesn't recieve any ordinary job, he is assinged the Reciever. The Reciever is a job of great wisdom and honor. But when he starts the job he relizes how different the world used to be. Than he is faced with the dicision of wheather or not he wants to do anything about it.The Giver was a great book just becuase it isn't like anything else. Jonas is in the struggle of his life that leads to much suspence and hard disicion making. I would definetly recomend this book to anyone who likes books that present new ideas and that are very suspenceful."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Of all books I have read, I strongly feel that this one ranks up in the top three. I feel as though it was a very well written story which, if you think about it, it isn't the easiest topic to write about. Well, at least I can't see how anyone can come up with a story about such an abstract concept as the way that the people in the novel lived. Nonetheless, this novel was written masterfully.The only flaw that I found was at the very end. While I was reading it, I noticed I was running out of pages. However, I was not running out of questions. I feel as though this book really leaves the reader hanging on a lot of questions which, I for one, would have liked to have answered. I actually went to my friend the next day who read it and took his answers to my questions, even though he can not be fully sure if he is correct or not. However, it eased my mind to have at least some sort of answers. Other than the ending, I feel as though this book was really well written and I would recommend it to anyone, young and old, as long as they enjoy reading good books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The gist of THE GIVER is given in the other reviews, so there's no need to explain it here again. I bought this book at a book fair when I was still in elementary school. I read it then, and found the book to be fascinating, yet somewhat confusing. Now I am in college, and have reread the book. The category listed for the book is \\"Young Adult\\" but do not let that keep you from ever reading this book. Lois Lowry delves into subjects that some people would shy away from: How far will people go to perfect themselves? What is life like without stimulus? The contemplation of these things and the realization of how important the experiences we have every day are at the heart of the book. What defines humanity, and what happens if we take that away? This is a fantastic book. One should read it, and then reflect upon it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found this book to be very good for the reason that it made you think about what it means to live in a \\"perfect\\" world, and if you really want to. You may think that harmony in every way is a good thing, but after reading this book, I disagree. I would rather have imperfections and occasional bad people than being unable to feel real emotions or know my mother loves me. A little love goes a long way, right?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thougth the book \\"The Giver\\" was an alright book. It was written nicely. The beginning was a little boring, and it took awhile for me to really get into the story line. Jonas was a fabulous character and was interested in all sorts of things. I felt there wasn't really a need for Asher to be there though. But he was a good character. When I finally did get into the book, I found myself wanting more. When I reached the closing chapter I couldn't wait for the ending. When I finally reached it.. I was very disappointed. At first, I was like \\"Okay, well there's probably going to be a sequel\\", but then I realized there wasn't and was a little disappointed. So, basically I was very surprised that I like this book, because I don't usually like to read. So, that is why I gave it 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought the giver was an O.K. book. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that it left you wondering at the end. It tells about a whole new journey on their way somewhere else but it doesn't tell what happened in this new place. The mystery in the middle of the book was good but the beginning was really confusing. I didn't understand what was happening until the third paragraph. My suggestions for any one who is going to read this book is don't give up after the first paragraph because it does get better."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a great book. It's about a boy named Jonas who live's in a strict community. They can't fight, they can't see colors. Each family is assigned a boy and a girl and at the age of 12 a job for life. Jonas is a boy who stands out as being very different from the others in his community. When Jonas gets older, he is selected to become the next Receiver of Memory. This is not an ordinary job but one that has a lot of honor. The story tells how Jonas gets to \\"receive\\" his memories. It's a really exciting book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a terrificly written book about a boy named Jonas and his life, in this strange community. A town without happiness,pain,color,difference. Everyone does certain things at the same time. Every year there is a moving up ceremony. The 9's get a bike while the 12's get their assignments. The committee of Elders assigns each child the perfect job. Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memory, the only one who has memories of long ago. Jonas learns pain, see color, feels happiness like never before. He recieves memories of everything. The memories that were cast out when there was no difference. This is a great book and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"You start the book watching an eleven year old boy, Jonas, who is excited about a coming of age celebration and getting to know his family. After the celebration a stunned and nervous Jonas starts his training for the future and begins to learn that life isn't quite as perfect in his town as people would have you believe. Lois Lowry paints the picture of this world, and its characters, so vividly that you lose yourself and find it almost impossible to put the book down!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Like many other students, I was assigned to read The Giver two years ago, when I was in the seventh grade. I figured it would be like all the other stories that students are often required to read - boring, meaningless, and leaving the reader nothing but a feeling of gratefulness that the book is finally complete. However, I immediately knew that The Giver was different. Many stories, especially those assigned to students, are hard to get involved with, but I was intrigued with the Giver right from the beginning. It was almost addicting, and gripped me from the provocative beginning to the vague but suspenseful finish. Since we had only a classroom set of The Giver, we were not permitted to take a copy home, so when I went to the bookstore that weekend I sneaked a peek at the chapter to come. When my younger sister, now in seventh grade herself, was given the same assignment, I couldn't help but to take her copy away from her and read it again. Two years later, I continue to be impressed by how Lois Lowry's tone drives you to become part of Jonas' community of Sameness, helps you to experience the memories he receives, and even causes you to feel his joy, his wisdom, and his pain."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's The Giver, which one the Newberry Award,is a well written cliffhanger that will leave you on the edge of your seat.In a world without color, music, weather, or memories, eleven-going-on-twelve Jonas lives in his perfect community with his family and friends. Once the children turn twelve in this community, they are assigned their job for the rest of their life.Instead of being assigned to a job, Jonas is chosen as the next Reciver in his community. The Reciver is the most honored man in the community.

Be lucky of what you have and who you are. Be glad to have choices and to be an individual.This novel is an extravagant, have-to-read book. As wonderful as it is, it's also very sad. Everyone in The Community except for the Receiver and Giver cannot see color and they have no memories of the past. When twins are born, the one who weighs the least is Released or killed. I don't think that it is very fair to be killed because you look like another person.I give this book five stars for its imaginative text and creativity.(7.3rcn)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is about a boy who lives in a Community where everything is the same because of something called Sameness. I liked this book because of the job the boy, Jonas, was assigned and how it changes the way he looks at his life and the lives of his family. In December at the Ceremony of the Twelve's, all the Twelve's get their jobs. While the Twelve's where being called on stage Jonas was skipped over. After everyone had their jobs Jonas was called on stage. Jonas had been selected for the most honored job in the community, The Receiver. The Receiver is the person in the Community who holds all the memories from many generations before, and is called upon for wisdom and guidance. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because of how Jonas's life is so different from what we could imagine, because of Sameness. For instance, everybody in the Community is assigned a job, spouse, and two children, and everybody, with the exception of Jonas, can only see in black and white. They also do not have any hills, mountains, rain, sunshine, or animals and most citizens don't even know they exist. The final reason I enjoyed this book is because of the relationship between Jonas and The Giver, the previous Receiver. He acquires much wisdom and discovers unknown bravery during his time with The Giver. The Giver is a great book for people who enjoy the unusual and stories of bravery."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This little book is titled \\"The Giver,\\" but the message is easily received. It is written for young readers, but the message is timely for most adults as well. Recognizing that this book has a young audience in mind, it is not surprising that the \\"message\\" is somewhat in your face. You don't have to take a college course in philosophy to figure out what Lois Lowry is trying to say. But that doesn't mean there isn't plenty to think about...there is! In the perfect little world of sameness that the story takes place, the ideas of knowledge, history, personal choice, diversity, death (and others) are considered bad and not useful for a successful society. The result seems, on the surface, to work just fine, but you discover that their denial is so great that they don't even see the deepest, darkest secrets of their own existence. They can't! Not because they're blind, not because they're brain damaged, but because their paradigms are so carefully shaped for them that they don't even know to ask certain questions. Only one member of the community at a time has any knowledge of the dark side of their collective experience, the Receiver of Memories.As engaging as the story is, it is also timely. Looking at my religious tradition, I can see elements of this story all over it. Looking at other fundamentalist movements, I see the same thing. Everywhere you look you see movements to reduce our personal choices and freedom, denying and re-shaping history to fit our wants rather reflecting reality. It's all packaged by those who claim special or even divine knowledge that they \\"know what is best for us, even though we, ourselves, cannot see it.\\" Like sheep we follow, and that following results in such tragedies as the Mountain Meadows Massacre in our own western history, the Jonestown massacres, the Branch Dividians, and most recently the spate of Islamic terrorism that spans the globe. Each act is perpetrated by well-meaning followers who have sacrificed their personal freedoms, their personal choice, their personal knowledge, their personal awareness for good of the society, only to find that sacrifice of self equals sacrifice of society.This is a great little book, and one well worth the three hours it takes to read (though the premis is nothing new...it borrows shamelessly from other Utopian themes, such as B.F. Skinner's \\"Walden Two\\"). My copy is a \\"Readers Circle\\" copy, with discussion questions included. I strongly recomend reading this book with a group of others and discussing it together. The message will be that much more profound!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Personally, ever since reading this book in 4th grade I have loved it. it shows true emotion, speaks of struggles that are understandable, and provokes thought.

I have read it at least 5 times and am still wanting to read it over and over. this book teaches me so much about life, and the value of what we have. it made me happy to know that i live in a \\"functional\\" (compared to disfunctional.. the way they live) community! i would definitely reccomend this book to any age, any gender, any time! this is my all-time favorite book!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a pretty good book. It had exciting parts in it. It is about a community that has no color or pain. Everyone is equal there except the Giver and Jonas. They have to experience pain and suffering. Then one day they think of a good plan. Jonas leaves so that the community can experience the pain and memories. Jonas found out what they did when people got releast. He was horrified when he found out that they were killed with a poision. He didn't want that to happen to the baby that lived with him till it wouldn't cry during the night. So when Jonas left the community, he took the baby with him. He pedalled for days and days. Sometimes he had to hide from jet-planes that flew overhead looking for him. He pedalled till it snowed and finally reached a place called Elsewhere where no one ever went to before. The ending kind of leaves you hanging. But it is still a good book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was an amazing book. Once i got reading the book i did not want to put it down, thats how good the book was.

I enjoyed it and would recomend it to any person who loves a little sci-fi."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of my favorite books, and I truly believe anyone who enjoys reading will enjoy this book, especially those who enjoy books such as 1984. The main character is Jonas who is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory for his community. (The community is striving to be a \\"perfect\\" community and gives out life assignments to the children of the community when they turn twelve.) Jonas meets the Giver who is a truly remarkable old man who has all sorts of knowledge and memories which he passes slowly onto Jonas. No one else in the community has these memories of color, sleigh riding, feelings, etc. Jonas starts to hate the way his community is controlling the lives of those in it. He steals the child which his family was taking care of that was about to be destroyed and runs away. The ending of the book is very vague and ambiguous. It is up to the reader to determine Jonas's fate, and there is no right or wrong answer. Truthfully, I chose to go with a more positive ending. I believe he really did come across a town, not a memory, and that he will have the life that he so wanted, but others may chose to believe that it was just a memory he had before perishing. The ending is the only part of the book I believe may annoy the reader because it does leave the reader hanging and some people don't like that - some people need closure. Overall, what makes this book so interesting and intriguing is that it is very realistic. A situation like this could happen to us in the future. It's not too far-fetched and is a wonderful, non-boring read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I don't know what it is about some books but I tend to fall asleep reading them.

In The Giver, Lois Lowry creates such a life in a fictional utopian community. The plot follows the main character Jonas's coming-of-age as he realizes the possibilities of a life beyond his controlled world of black-and-white, of good and bad. Though the characters' lifestyle is so different from our own, the reader is able to sympathize with the confusion felt by this adolescent boy, who truly \`knows no better'.Lowry's style of writing draws the reader's attention, and as each chapter ends the reader is left yearning for more. Though initially seeming far-fetched, ultimately the plot has an eery possibilty. Could we really be lead to a life of Sameness?Lowry's novel is a must-read for all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read this book 5 years ago and it is still the best book I've ever read. I own over 600 books and this is still my favourite!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Kiddoes, I just finished rereading this book for about the eighth time, but I'll try to transport my mind back in time to when I first read it. I think you'll get a better perspective that way.It's about a society that wants to be 'perfect'. Well, actually, 'perfect' wouldn't be the best word. I suppose that they want everything to be structured and uniform. They call it in the book 'Sameness'.There are books and movies about futures that stink, but, let me tell you, this is an especially insane one.The land is climate-controlled, and completely the same. Flat; no hills, no valleys. No colors, even. And it isn't just the outside that's controlled... The people don't love, aren't sad or guilty... basically, they don't feel human emotions. Only the Receiver is allowed to experience those things, and he is the keeper for the entire community... without him, the memories would be unleashed and the community would revert to chaos.People have their jobs chosen for them, their mates chosen, even their children. You get to old? You're 'released'. (Releasing is killing, if you haven't figured that out.) A twin, and smaller than your brother or sister? You're released. Make a mistake, like flying in the wrong direction? Released. It's scary about what you can't do...Jonas is chosen as the new Receiver, and (surprise) he's the character that the book centers around. We read about his life before he is selected, during, and afterwards, and I don't know about you, but it was a major shock to me that there wasn't color.I'm not sure if I can say that I LOVED this book. Loving would imply that I loved the concepts, and also would imply that I wasn't horrified while I was reading it. Happy little kiddoes in America aren't really exposed to this kind of stuff... not even CLOSE to it.But I really respect it, and totally understand why it's a classic. Lois Lowry got a fan with this book; Number the Stars didn't quite do it for me.And another thing I think people need to understand about this book is that even though the text is simple and that youngsters can READ it, the concepts are meant for older kids."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was so good! i loved it and couldn't put it down. It is different from other books. I am so glad that everyone is differnt(youl get me when you have read the book)Set in a future in which communities are entirely regulated, all life patterns ordered for maximum security, uniformity, painless existence, and pleasant, if uneventful family life, this novel unfolds the story of Jonas, a promising boy who, with all his age peers, will receive his adult assignment from the elders on the yearly day of advancement celebrated for all children going through carefully calibrated developmental stages. Jonas's assignment, however, sets him apart from his peers, and ultimately from the whole community.He is selected as the next Receiver of Memories, a post that allows him access to knowledge of the past carefully guarded from all but one Receiver in each generation. His lot will be to bear the pain of bearing, not only in his mind and imagination, but in his body, feelings and sensations suppressed in others by lifelong administration of biochemical regulators.Besides the old Receiver of Memories, whom Jonas calls The Giver, he becomes the only one able to see colors, feel pain, desire, loss, hunger, and to remember a world in which people felt something deeper than superficial stirrings. Among other things, he discovers what it is to feel love. Horrified at the blankness in which his people live, he chooses, with the Giver's blessing, and at great risk, to escape the community, and thus to release into it the memories he will not keep to himself.Rescuing a child destined for \\"release\\" for nonstandard development, Jonas embarks on a journey that leads him to a faraway place where the old life survives, leaving behind him a community that will emerge from their anaesthetized condition into the costly terms on which the gifts of ecstasy, joy, awareness, grief, and pain give life its value."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a totally safe and predictable world. The Elders make all the community's decisions, and every aspect of life is governed by detailed rules. One of those rules says that when an Eleven becomes a Twelve, childhood ends. That's about to happen to Jonas. He is nervous, even apprehensive, but he is also eager because at the transition ceremony he will receive his lifetime assignment. More years of schooling lie ahead, and for now he'll continue to live with his family; but the day after the ceremony he will also begin training for his new role as a contributing adult member of the community. Will he become a Nurturer like his father? Will he be an attendant at the House of the Old? An instructor for Threes, who need to learn the precise use of language? He can't guess. But no one could have guessed the assignment that he actually gets.Jonas will become the community's Receiver of Memories. He will carry what everyone else has forgotten long ago - the knowledge of what life was like before climate control, medicine to repress desire, and all the rest of the present world's safeguards were introduced. He alone will know what it's like to feel unrestrained emotions, and he alone will be capable of making genuine choices. He will have great honor, but he will bear a burden the rest of the community can't even imagine.What is safety, and what does it really cost? This is a surprisingly original take on a familiar speculative fiction device, that of the future community in which every aspect of an individual's life is rigidly controlled. Lowry's young hero discovers his world's secrets gradually and believably, taking the reader with him on a journey that forces the boy raised without choices to make decisions almost beyond imagining.--(...)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I first began to read \\"The Giver,\\" I thought it was going to be a good book, but I had no clue what a great book Lois Lowry had in store! This book has sad parts, surprising parts, and happy parts. I loved the main character, he had so much determination, courage, and he is so kind. This is truly a great book!A boy named Jonas lives in a \`perfect' community. Everyone has their own family unit. And they're all assigned their own jobs. When Jonas is about to turn 12 he is chosen to be the new Receiver. He now is in training to receive all the memories from the past. He is being trained by the Giver. The Giver is the only one in the community who holds all the memories of the past, now he must give them to Jonas. All of the new things he's learing from the past, he never knew about, does Jonas really want to be the new Receiver?A lot of my friends have read the Giver and told me it was a great book. And they all told they truth! When I first looked at the cover it got my attention, then when I began to read, I became hooked. Lois Lowry is one of my favorite authors, all of the books I've read that she has written have all had me at the edge of my seat. This is most deffinatly one of my favorite books! A wonderful book by Lois Lowry."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry, a prolific young adult author with many titles to her name, has stepped outside of her usual lighthearted and humorous works to write a science fiction novel that may surprise many of her readers. In The Giver, Lowry creates a safe utopian society, where the people act and look the same, where everyone abides by the same rules. On the surface there are no problems, yet the characters in the novel are human enough to make the reader sympathetic to their fate. Conflicts begin to arise when the main character becomes aware of many inherent problems in the society. Jonas, the major character, is a boy who lives in this society and the plot of the novel is based in part on the transformation of Jonas from a model and very important citizen to a rebel who chooses to turn his back on his family and world. The climax is reached when the characters are forced to find a solution to their conflict, however the ending of the novel is inconclusive and the readers must supply for themselves what happens in the end. Recommended for all school Libraries.Michael J. Spencer"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is one of the best books I have ever read! It has a very good plot and a lot of suspence.

He wants to be free of this colorless world he lives in. Hewants to be part of a society where he is not \\"controlled\\". Jonas goes on a very dangerous mission benefiting him and his fellow citizens. Will he survive?The Giver is especially a good read because it has no specific ending. You get to use your imagination and the facts you have been given ato create your own. The Giver is definetly one of Lois Lowry's best books ever! All junior high student's should read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In The Giver the reader meets a young boy named Jonas who lives in a utopian community of harmony, peace and contentment. No one is hungry, no one is unemployed, all have shelter and security.The reader follows Jonas as he goes through a very important ceremony. Upon turning twelve, all boys and girls are given their lifetime job assignments. Jonas is bewildered and astonished to learn that he has been selected for the prestigious job of the new Receiver of memories.As Jonas receives the memories of the world from the old Receiver, now called the Giver, several astonishing truths become clear. Jonas's community is peaceful and content, but this peace comes at a steep price. The Giver's memories open Jonas's eyes to a wonderful new world of weather and color and love that the community is totally ignorant of. With the awareness of these joyful things Jonas must also learn of the horrors of starvation, agony and war.When Jonas learns that the baby his family unit has been caring for has been scheduled to be killed, he must decide, based on his new wisdom and knowledge, if he can find a way to save the life of the baby he has grown to love.In this Newbery Award Winning utopia (or is it a distopia?) Lowry excellently reframes the eternal question of safety versus the freedom to choose for oneself.This is one of those books that hits you like a ton of bricks, and then sticks in your head for days. Very thought-provoking and well done. One of my personal favorites."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"(...) I didn't know what i wanted, so i asked my best friend.... who has probably read every book in the library by now. anyway, she said that the giver was an excellent book and that i should read it. i decided \\"well..... she looks like she knows what she is talking about when she says to read something\\" so i checked it out immediatly. i got home and i started reading it. i admit, it starts a little slow, but once you get to chapter 3 you just can't put it down. i'm sure someday they will make a movie about it, so if you aren't a book fan then you could wait until then, but if you read for the fun of it, BUY THIS BOOK IMMEDIATLY!(...) i have also heard that gathering blue is the capanion, so if you buy the giver, make sure you buy that too! i hope you find this review helpful. hope you read it! read more of my reviews!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am a middle school teacher, and my 8th graders read this book each winter.

There is so much here, and the ambiguous ending is a great discussion itself! I will probably use this book in my classroom for a long time!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"With sameness in a community, no one can experience real pain. In The Giver, written by Lois Lowry, no one has inflicted pain on him or her. Even if they fall off their bike they have never felt it. In the ending I think that he went to a community that actually has pain and suffering. He also hasn't heard music before. He has only heard it in his memories. With these memories that are giver by the giver, he has to suffer with them.I think that the ending really implies that he has re-entered his old community. They have taken in the memories while he was gone. Just like when Rosemary \\"Released\\" herself and the community got all of the lost memories. With these new memories, they have been able to see the colors and feel love. Now they have opened a door to the past that is a memory. These memories are the key for how they survive.I recommend this book to a person that has really good imagination. With this imagination, you can understand the ending very well and that is why I have comprehended the ending. The ending is a little hard to understand because of the sudden stop that is on the last page, it just says all of the things about the community, and it never states what the community says or does to him. The ending is very hard to understand, but I think I chose the right one. I chose this ending because there have been many hints to describe it. For example, the planes just stopped coming. I think that someone had seen them when they had that really close encounter. Another reason is that they had described many curves in the road. This has given an obvious reason that they had gone in a circle. He had also said that he had recognized the face in the crowd. That makes it just plain obvious that he had come back to his old community when he saw this.I think that Lois Lowry should come out with The Giver 2. In this book she should write about the new community. This should put a better ending on the book. Then people wouldn't think this book is so weird. I'm not saying that this book is bad or anything, I'm just saying that this book was had to understand for some people.If this book were banned from all schools, then the people wouldn't know what it would be like to be in this kind of community. If this book is banned, then many books like this will be banned. For example, a book with Hitler in it will be banned. If this book is banned, then people won't learn about history and a book that talks about drugs or war will be banned. If this happens then the whole world will change."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an interesting book that deals with the idea of suppressing ideas. In fact everything [the society] runs the way it does only because no one questions the how or why it runs the way it does, not even the elders who run it. The book focuses, on one character, Jonas, who receives new ideas from the Giver. In stark contrast to the human controlled weather and \\"comfort objects\\", based on what was once real animals, the Giver begins giving him memories from all the past, all of which he stores, ranging from the primitive warfare at its worst to a pleasant trip on a sailing boat. It focuses hugely on the handling of the memories by Jonas, and how he attempts to change the idea suppressing ideas in the town."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"People can't ban books forever. People can't ban ideas. Anyone who tries to ban ideas and books will lose eventually. Ideas are the only thing that can counter bad ideas.In the society in The Giver, every idea is censored, very though of individualism is crushed. Books are banned, color is taken away, and memories removed. However, there is one man that keeps all the memories so that other people don't' have to. When he gets old, The Giver passes on the memories to Jonas. They both plot to release the memories to the public, and they are successful in this, although it did not go as planned. The book The Giver is a \\"banned book\\" in our society today. Many people do not like the ideas included in the book, and to not want other people to read it. I personally like it. There is suspense about the whole story; how are the controlling the society, what will Jonas do with this information. The society in itself is rather eerie, but not all-out creepy. The ending is rather inadequate for it is left open to whatever the reader wants to think. In a way this is good, but it is unfulfilling nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver takes place in a perfect society. In the community the invalid are killed.

It's so bizarre to envision another world completely, one that we find the thought of appalling, but then see how we would be able to get used to it. This book opens up an entire new realm of possibility. It is extremely well written, and allows u to identify with Johan, the main character very well. The book is about a \\"perfect\\" society, where everything is monitored, and everything is monotonous. Only one person, The Giver, has the power to see outside the monotony, and Johan is selected to obtain this same power. It is a fascinating book, and it even outshines Lois Lowry's other work. It is well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think it's a good book because it tells a beautiful story very well. The story could be percieved as an anti-communist book, showing how sameness is bad for people. The story is enriched by the main character as he learns how things used to be.

He seems like me cuz i think im different from everyone else too.i had to read this book for my 6th grade class. I ended it 2 weeks ago. I give this book 4 stars because the book makes you want to think and because there is only more than one answer. The down side is that the ending is sad and the ending doesnt tell you what happend next. Its like anyone could make a seqel out of the ending. This would go in my faveorite catigories. I hope it does w/ you too!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I like this book {The Giver} because its like a whole new world in our mind that we just dont know where it is. My faviorte charicter is Jonas because he is the star of the book is Jonas. Jonas is a smart young man that always likes goming up with ideas because he is very smart.I like jonas because he soo samrt and i think thats why he gets to be the reciver f memory.I can relate to Jonas because in the book Jonas is turning twelve and my birthday is coming up as I turn twelve. my secend part is in the book i lke aow lois lowwry is open ended i like how at the end of the end of the book she leaves it blank , i think thats cool. And Jonas has a sister and i have a sister to so thatscool to. I also like the giver because he is the most wise man in all of the very cood book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book by Lois Lowry. It really makes me think. The biggest question that I thought about was, will we be like that one day, will we all be like robots? By the road we are going down it really looks like it. In the times I understand it I feel smart, realy, realy smart. Sometimes I cant make heads or tails of it. The end is pretty much open ended, but, one end I've heard a lot is, Jonas dies at the top of the hill the sled, the celebration, and the love, were all just his imagination. They were his favorite memorys given by the giver. I think that the charactor the giver is made after Lois Lowry's dad, who was the one that influanced the book because of his memory loss.sincerly: 12 year old 6th grader"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Is life that perfect? Well, that is how it is in Jonas's life. Welcome to the Community, a place with no color, crime, free will, individuality, guilt, or pain, a place where your life is picked out for you by someone else and public apologies must be given for even the smallest thing. A community that's perfect, but the question is, what is perfect? You wouldn't want your life chosen, do you want to like everyone else? Do we even know? We don't know what its like to live in those conditions would it be better or worse? That's why Jonas doesn't realize it until he became the receiver of memories when he realizes color, pain, and feelings he's never felt before"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Perfect.Can you imagine a life that's perfect?Well, that is how life is in Jonas's world. Welcome to the Community; A place with no color, crime, free will, individuality or pain; a place where your life is picked out for you by someone else and public apologies must constantly be given for even the smallest thing; a place that's...perfect. Or so that's what Jonas thought until he learned that his role in the Community was to be The Receiver. His job is to receive all of the world's memories and emotion from The Giver. With this job lies a heavy responsibility on young Jonas who must now deal with knowing about war, pain, love and heartache while the rest of his world doesn't.With thought provoking issues and detailed descriptions, I would reccomend this book to any reader who likes thiking outside of the box."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just finished reading The Giver a few days ago and it was really good. I found it entertaining yet disturbing at the same time. The fact that everything is so perfect is almost scary. Jonas, the main character is faced with so many things after he turns Twelve. That's what kind of made it disturbing to me because in my eyes Twelve is still a child, yet in this book they are treated as adults at this age. The Giver himself was like an omen of what was to come for Jonas and I think that's what sets this book apart from any other like it. I really liked this book and I found that I couldn't stop reading it until the end...which was sort of disappointing to me because I have so many questions.-Alicia LadueChicopee High School"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book ten years ago when I was in the seventh grade. I really do not know why I actually read this book because I was not an avid reading back in the day; but, never-the-less, I read it. I remember it being \\"a good book.\\" I remember it being thought-provoking and interesting. Maybe that was just the class discussion.Anyway, ten years later, I read it again. Boy oh boy it was excellent! All the powerful scenes returned to me. I remember the imagery that I saw in my head and the feelings that was deep within myself, even as a seventh grader. Now, with my added maturity and life experiences this book still resonates a provocative story.I remembered the scene with the apple vaguely. I remembered the, dare I say, mind-blowing nature of Jonas (and the reader) learning about this Apple. I remember the memories and learning with Jonas about these foreign \\"things\\" and when he starts to classify his \\"feelings.\\" Reading this book again was not only a walk down memory lane, but it was also a reminder that superb writing and moving books do not need to be 700 pages long and listed in the \\"big kids\\" part of the bookstore.In my opinion, one of the best things about this book is the ability to take it at face value. If you want to develop the deeper messages in the book, and apply some possible ethics and lessons to life, you may do so. However, if you would just like to read an interesting story with wonderful imagery and emotion, you may also do so.My version of the book also had discussion questions at the end which I quickly glanced over. These questions were generally pretty good and thought provoking. However, many of them are also obvious so most people would have already thought about them or at least realized there was something deeper within those pages.I find it hard to believe that such a simple book gave me such complex emotions and feelings. What I find harder to believe is that reading it again reminded me that I felt those things ten years ago when I was thirteen years old. I only wish now that I had read more of the required texts in English class."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this book is long if you read it by yourself, but I hade a tape so if you want to read it fast you should get the tape. I think that you should read it yourself then you understand it better.I think that you should read this book because it has a very good story line. Also it can make you think of things you wouldin't think of."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a great book! And I don't really like to read books. But The Giver was different. It contained tons of interesting scenes. Therefore I recommend this book to everyone who can read.READ IT!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think I missed a chapter or something because it was confusing.It was about Jonas, a 12 year old boy, who,with the rest of his classmates, gets assigned a job. His is to keep all the memories of the world, and the whole community doesn't feel a thing. Everything the people do, is routine. They do the samething everyday. Any person, baby to elder, will get \\"released\\" from the community if they did not meet the towns expectations. One day Jonas watches a baby being \\"released\\" then he decides to run away from his community with a two year old named Gaberail to a different town. It also comes with a very weird ending. I wouldn't recommend this book to people who like excitement."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" is a novel which takes place in a community of the future. This community has strict rules. The people have no memories about their history and they don't see any colours. Only one man has the memories how life was in th epast. This man is the receiver of memories. His name is Jonas and he is 12 years old. He is trained by the Giver who was thr receiver before. They make a plan to change the community. They want to give the memories back to the people so that the get back their individuality. Will this plan work? Read the book and u will see it!I think the book is great. It has a very good story. However, there are some logical mistakes in the plot and the end isn't the best I've ever read. But if you are not irritated by the mistakes and like future novels you have to buy and read this bookHave Fun!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It was a little good at first but then it started to get boring.the conflict was lame, I could have solved it in less than an hour.I wauld recomend this book to people who like to read hoursand wont fall asleep."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was one of the first books I got that I really disliked. My mom got it for me when I was about 11 or 12 and I got all the way to the \\"baby part\\" (which I'm sure you all have heard about...uck!) I had to put it down because I was crying to hard. I decided to finish it because I really liked the main character and still wanted to know the ending but to this day I still don't know how it ended because that one chapter was haunting me and I could get it out of my head.

The Giver is one of those books. The writing style is deceptively simple; the prose conveys controversial and explosive ideas and issues with incredible clarity. This is truly an incredible book... for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is an interesting story. It is called The Giver.AlthoughI don't like to read, this story is great for anyone who likes toread. I do recimend this book The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverBY Tori HallI thought the book The Giver was ok. The beginning of the book started out good but as the book went on I found that it got strange. The book took on a very science fiction sense as it got into the book. The book changed from being a book about a different community to being a book that kept talking about people killing other people with shots. I found it changed around too much through out the book to really enjoy it. And last of all the ending left me confused. I did not know if the main character Jonas had died or if he found A different place or what. I think another factor that made me not really enjoy the book is the fact that we had to read it for school. When you are forced to read something you do not enjoy it as much as if you choose to read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Written at a 6th grade reading level, The Giver has very little literary or stylistic value. It is filled with cliched rhetoric such as \\"intelligence\\" \\"integrity\\", \\"courage\\", and \\"wisdom\\" -- words fit for a middle school graduation. Lowry creates a futuristic world that seems too much like a follow up of Orwell's *1984*, and is really a very bland version of *Brave New World*. The themes and ideas can hardly be called original. Though for a children's book, it is quite valuable in its effective warning against modern society's trend toward regimentation and sterilization. As for anyone over 12 years of age, read Brave New World if you want intellectual stimulation."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a great book to me. Unlike alot of other books this one kept me on the edge of my seat and I was always wondering what was going to happen next. It was the only book the teacher issued that I actually liked to read and didn't want to put down.When I read it I sometimes felt sorry for Jonas because he was so different and his friends couldn't even relate to what Jonas was going through. He wanted so much to tell his friends everything he knew but he wasn't allowed to. But he ending up being happy so I would definately recomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was not that very interesting since I really don't like reading.I thought this book could make me fall asleep even with loud sounds by me.It could have been since I hate reading long books like this one.But I still read it so I kind of liked some parts of it.I really didn't understand it that's why. Books bore me so don't take it personaly alright.I liked the idea of them trying to save Gabriel.The whole memories thing was dumb in away."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an interesting book. The part I liked about the book was when it talked about Sameness. Sameness was an amazing town. Everyone in the community got along, there wasn't any fighting or any body getting hurt. Also I liked Jonas because he used his gift or shall I say memories which is his job for a good cause. For example, when Gabriel couldn't sleep at all Jonas gave Gabriel a memory to help him dream good dreams that helped him sleep. There was also something I didn't like, like the part in Sameness,where children was put in groups by their age and everyone in that group had to look exactly alike. They had to wear their hair alike and the same exact clothes. I wouldn't won't to do that. I think that was a cruel thing to do to children. I really liked that in Samness no one goes hungry. In the world we live in there are lots of people going hungry.So over all The Giver was an excellent book and I would probably love to read it again!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think that the book was all right. It could have maybe been a little bit better. I was interested the way that it went to all the memories, it went deep into detail. Ex. The colors, sounds, smells, and fellings. I wasn't really interested at first, but as I read on I just couldn't put the book down. I would enjoy just sitting back and comparing mine and Jonas' world. I think I would rather just stay here. I couldn't have lived there because I love to be around animals, and they didn't even have dogs. They didn't even know what animals were. I would still recomend this book to someone else because it held most of my intrest."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver was very good book but at the same time it was a little bit mysterious and frightening. My favorite part of the book was betweeen Ch.13-15 when Jonas was selected as the giver and Jonas started going through his training lessons. The sadest part of this book was when the narrator started transferring the memory of the elephant getting the tusk cut of of him I thought it was so cruel. The character that I think I most would relate to is Fiona because she is very patient and kind. Over all I really had a fun time reading this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an interesting book in a weird kind of way. The boy Jonas had alot of experience with the five senses. I liked the Giver he was nice and gentle. He taught life lessons to Jonas. The is also different from our world. We don't have to dress alike all of the time. We can see the colors all around us. We are not put into groups by our age. We have different schools for just about all ages. The part I liked about the book is when Jonas was on the last sled ride right before the book ended he heard the people singing. He had never heard them sing before. It was a nice dream for him to have because it was a happy dream. The part I didn't like was when the people couldn't see any color. Seeing color is a wonderful thing. How could anyone live without color. Another thing I didn't really like was the Sameness. Me myself I couldn't live in a world of Sameness because I couldn't be the same as anyone else. I am a very unique person I do things different from a lot of people. I am athletic in which I don't think the people in this book were very athletic except for Jonas on the sled ride. Another thing was the very crucial punishment. They got in trouble for saying words wrong. Then they punished senior citizens with the discipline wand. In our world we consider rude to hit senior citizens. As far as the rest of the book I really enjoyed the book. It was very extraordinary!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was an OK book. It had some good parts and bad parts. I liked the middle of the book better than the end. The end kindof kept me hanging in mid-air. You kind of have to interpret your own ending. The way the writer described things was very vivid and easy the imagine. I like the way she made up her own world it basically made the whole book.~*~ Lawren ~*~"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book and goes into alot of detail. The book had me to where when I was reading it I didn't see or hear anything else. I was focussed on the reading every sigle line, sentence, and word. I didn't want it to end. Towards the middle of the book it gets a little depressing, when the giver is giving Jonas, the main character, memories of what it was like to feel feelings. Alot of the memories are very depressing, while some were happy, and exhilarating as The Giver would put it. The book was also very mysterious, like when an apple changed in mid-air I didn't realize that Jonas was noticing the color red, through this i found that every one in the community was color blind. I think if you are thinking of buying this book you should because, trust me its not a waste of time like some other books are."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The idea of an alernate reality is a good one. This book is definitely for those who think life should be controlled. Cons outweigh the pros in that world. It has creativity and pizzaz. Nice ending. I think alot of people will read this book and find not only enjoyment, but also advice. Lois Lowry has a great line of books, and this one definitely falls into that line. I hope to read more of her books. She is a really good author."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver really wasn't a bad book it was just kind of wierd at the beginning.

He is at the ceremony of twelve which is when he will receive his life long job. Jonas is the last child called and doesn't know what his future holds. In disbelief Jonas has been selected to be the new Receiver. Which is the honorable chosen one in the comunity that gets to hold all the memories of the past.The Giver (who was the old receiver) had been training Jonas for many months. But one day Jonas was telling The Giver about his father and how he (his father) had to releace (kill) one of the new twin babies. The Giver insisted that Jonas watches the tape of his fathers work. Of course Jonas doesn't know that releace means to kill. His father has lied to him. Jonas now realizes that the little boy Gabriel who his family unit has been taking care of might be killed. You're probably telling youself nothing can get worse but, you're wrong.As Jonas receives more memories, he begins to see more objects in color and no more \\"sameness\\". He then tells the Giver how great it is and he wishes that the whole comuntiy could see this way. The Giver tells him the only way the comunity can see in color is if the new Receiver (Jonas)leaves the comunity forever. This may sound easy but the outcomes of this are devastating. If Jonas were to leave the comunity he would never see his family or friends again. The comunity would not only receive good memories though. They would also receive memories like war and other painfull times. The Giver and Jonas agree that it is worth it. Jonas starts planing his escape when he finds out that Gabriel is going to be killed.Will Jonas ever escape so the comunity can be colorful? And will Gabriel even live? Find out by reading The Giver!I thought this book was O.K. It was slow in the begining but as I got to the last fifteen pages I couldn't put it down. If you enjoy serious books and love happy endings this book is for you. I gave this book a three out of five stars. What about you?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a very exciting book that keeps the reader on edge throughout the entire story.

I am not going to say really anything bad because I have never wrote a book myself. The book was kind of confusing but not much. The meaning of the book was ok. It was kind of wierd how every one there was the same. The people there did no wrong and if they did they would be hit with some kind of stick. So the book was alright there was nothing wrong with it. So \\"The Giver\\" is a good book to me."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I first saw this book I thought it would be not interesting and bad. Later on while I was reading the Giver I could not put it down. It is about a twelve year old boy named Joans. Joans lives in a community where there is no pain, no crime, no feelings, and no fear. In his community every one was assinged an assignment or as we know it a job. Except in that community you get assinged your job when you are twelve which is when you turn into an adult.When Joans was twelve he was an adult and his assignment was to be the next reciver.To be a reciver you need to have enough courage, intelligence, integrity, and wisdom, all of which Joans had. Joans job was basically to carry pleasureable and painful memories to carry on from an elderly woman known as the Giver.I would strongly recommend this book to everyone. If you have read the book Tuck Everlasting than you would like this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"IN Lois Lowry's The Giver, the reader follows Jonas as he confronts the realities of the highly controlled community he lives in. He discovers that the lack of illness and war in his community comes with a high p[ricetag of personal freedoms.I greatly enjoyed The Giver because it gave me a glimpse at the negative side of a scoiety in which others make all decisions for you. I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Wow! I can't believe how good this book was.If you've read my reveiw on My Side Of The Mountain than you know that I don't mess around with reading bad books.This book was great, and I read it in three days.The only reason why I didn't finish it earlier was my parents had to literally seperate me from the book.I know that I shouldn't say bad things about illiterate people I should write it instead, so that's why I'm here. So if you're illiterate you're really missing out. So learn how to read so you can read this book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a world of social deprevation and singularity, one without individuality and self discovery, there is one that is different... One that sees that which others take for granted, and that which others cannot...Jonas leads a regular life, and has no idea what the future will hold for him at the Ceremony of Twelve that draws near. Shock at his job assignment for life is quite evident on the face of every community member except for one.His tale of work with the most important individual of the community will bring him to the ultimate choice...----------------------------I personally liked this book, every time I read it, the book got easier to understand. My thoughts often time would be reflections of what I would day dream off as based from the reading I had to do.This book represents the ideas that several socities have thought of to some degree, and represents a form of socialism in a way."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What a surprising book.

This is a what if book on how things would be if everything were uniform. This book was interesting because it kept taking sharp and unexpected turns. You never knew where the author was taking you. Although I personally did not like how the book ended it didn't take much away from the book. I like much different endings than the one that this book had. I gave it a three because it became confusing at parts and as I previously mentioned I would have preferred a better, but overall the author makes you think about some very intriguing concepts and does a great job keeping my attention. This is hard, because I often like to doze off while reading, which I found really hard to do because I always wanted to know what came next."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think that this book was excellent. It defied the usual &quot;this happens, then this, blah blah&quot; standard of many other books I have read. It makes you think, and I like that. I can also relate to Jonas, because, like him, I feel that I am somewhat &quot;different&quot;. I recommend this book to anyone who feels unique or like there is a bigger, better place out there."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book absolutely blew me away! Lowry's portrayal of this futuristic utopia is both inviting and chilling. At the beginning, the easy simplicity of the life led by Jonas and his family seems like the perfect answer to our chaotic lifestyle. But as Jonas begins to receive the world's memories and to discover that his world is not perfect, &quot;utopia&quot; becomes eerie and even horrifying, as such secrets as the &quot;release&quot; of children are revealed. The ending, although somewhat predictable, is well suited to the story, and is the only feasable way that Jonas can continue to exist with the knowledge that he possess. Amazingly well written and a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read The Giver and the ideas of this book has remained with me (I am now in 11th grade).

I would recommend this to teens or anybody!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am a senior at UNC-Chapel Hill and I'm in a Young Adult Fiction class. So this semester we're reading many YA books. And we get to choose our own as long as we end up reading across the genre's of YA books.I choose The Giver because of the reviews I read on this website and I thought it was only appropriate after reading the book to contribute myself.This is an EXCELLENT book and I don't care if you're 8 years old or 80, you will gain something from it. The way Lois Lowry shows this world of &quot;sameness&quot; makes you physically ill sometimes but at the same time frightened because you can actually see our own world in bits and pieces of it.With the way she portrays &quot;the community&quot; it allows you to get more and more out of it the older you are. If you aren't aware of certain things, you don't understand them as much as a young reader, but the plot and story are so well written you still get a lot out of the book.If you are older and do understand, her statements are even more profound.Definitely worth your time and effort. I couldn't put it down once I read the first chapter."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was an awesome book because it is so interestng from the beginning. It was a real page turner and it told of a perfect community. This book is so good, it almost seems true. You really get to know the characters and start to like them. It is really easy to get into, and you will not want to put it down. Well, in conclusion, it was one of the best books I have ever read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am reading this book for school, and I think it is a very good book so far. Im only on chapter 15 but should be finished soon. When I first started reading it, I wasnt really into it; but the closer I got to the ceremony of twelve, the more interested I got.The thing that makes this book interesting is the fact that only one person knows the history of the world. This is a very good book for young people. Every school should assign this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book, no matter how well it is written, is a book that really has no ending or solution to the problems that the author puts forward. I found it to be extremely disturbing and could not wait for the happy ending to come, but it didn't.Some will like it because of its origianl theme but I for one did not enjoy it very much at all. People who read it should know that its ending is depressing (to me it was) and ultimately pointless."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The first time I read THE GIVER in 1994, I was absolutely mesmerized. What a compelling idea--a story similar to 1984, only with a darling twelve year old boy (Jonas) who is selected to receive all the memories of his community. What on earth does this mean? Evidently this story takes place in the future where everything is the same. People are all drugged so that they have no emotions. They no longer see a world in color; people who are old or sick are terminated. Only one baby is allowed to survive from a multiple birth. Only certain women are allowed to give birth; the baby is given to a selected man and woman to raise. When the child reaches maturity, the 'parents' are sent to live with other childless couples. There is no love, no pain, not even grandparents. The elders make all decisions. People don't even select their careers.At the age of twelve, Jonah is chosen to receive all the memories of preceding centuries from the grandfatherly 'giver of memories.'Anyone reading this book will know immediately why Lois Lowery received the Newbery award, which is given to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children. The first review I ever read for this book was in the newspaper. The article stated that THE GIVER would become a classic and suggested that readers immediately buy first editions (for an investment). After reading my copy, I bought books for both of my teenagers for Christmas. I loved the book and I really loved the fairytale ending. But then, not too long ago, I started reading some of the reviews on Amazon. People were complaining about the sad ending! What did I miss? When I read an outstanding book, I have a tendency to read way too fast. I can't help it; the better the book, the faster I read. I just can't wait to see what happens next! Consequently, I miss a lot. But, if the book is really outstanding, I'll eventually re-read it, savoring every word. Subsequently, I slowly read THE GIVER again, and now, I'm really not certain about the ending. Did Jonas live happily ever after or was he 'released?' Readers will have to make their own decisions. As for me, I'm going to retain my original, warm fuzzy, happy conclusion and forget I ever read a review!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverBy Louis LowryThe Giver is about a future society where everything has gone to sameness. The weather, colors, and daily routine are the same for everybody in the community every single day. The government has done this in order to create a \\"perfect\\" life for everyone. They have completely eliminated choices! The only problem is that they have to store the memories with one person. Not one other person knows a thing about the past. There are no memories for anyone, happy or sad, except for the Receiver. It is a huge burden to bear. The Giver, the old Receiver, and the Receiver have decided it is time to release memories to the rest of the community.Louis Lowry really warns against the dangers of losing our rights of basic freedom. The author is definitely one for freedom of choice. This book was banned because of the references to euthanasia, infanticide, and violent and sexual passages. I feel that this book is appropriate for the age group to which it was directed. These are real issues in today's times and today's children are the ones who will deal with these topics the most. I feel that she did a favor towards the future's society by introducing the youth to these topics that could very possibly get out of hand if not dealt with."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very compelling book, which kept my attention focused for hours with its many twists and turns. Jonas is a young man growing up in a futuristic society. Many moments of happiness occur, such as when Father brings home Gabriel (new child) and when Jonas is able to get Gabriel to sleep at night. There are also moments of sadness, such as when Jonas knows his &quot;duty&quot; and when he finds out what is meant by &quot;releasing&quot; someone from the village. On the day of the &quot;Ceremony,&quot; Jonas has an anxious heart and then becomes fearful that he is not good enough for an assignment and will be released. Lowry really can get to a person's heart with this book. She makes the reader think about what life is really about and how much it has to offer. She realizes what color and emotion do to a person. Jonas gets to feel all these emotions through the Giver when he becomes the Receiver. He gets to experience feelings that he has never felt before, and maybe you will too after you read this book. I would recommend this book to middle school and high school readers. The reason I give this book only three stars is because of doings in the book that are against my beliefs"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found The Giver to be an extremely satisfying book for several reasons. Firstly, it wasn't a long and boring story. It was easy to read and &quot;flowed&quot; rather well. Plus, there was enough actions or situations to keep you interested through the books entirety. Also, the words used were very easy to comprehend. It is quiet clear that Lowry wrote the book not for &quot;prestige,&quot; but for the purpose of conveying a message. Secondly, the story's plot was very interesting. It addressed several points about society, or concepts that I find myself contemplating at times. After reading this book I came to the realization that there probably is no perfect society, there will be some flaws in every situation. The story also made me appreciate certain things such as emotions, individuality, and the freedom to make my own decisions. It also makes me realize that rules are made to protect, but can easily take away peoples rights when over-used. Over-all, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys thinking, and has just a few hours to spare. Lowry obviously followed the famous old saying, &quot;keep it short and sweet!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry is one of those unique authors who has won the John Newbery Medal for children's literature twice. Once for the first book in this trilogy and once for a book about the Holocaust called Number the Stars. (Just as an aside only one other author has ever done that Madeleine L'Engle who I would also recommend highly.) I would begin by recommending any of her books; they are all worth the time and the effort. This trilogy is set in a post apocalyptic world. The first two books each focus on different community's who have recovered from the devastation differently, both have strengths and both have weaknesses. And a young boy must heal them both and the land if either is to survive.The GiverLois LowryLaurel-Leaf BooksISBN:0440219078Jonas is a young boy who lives in a community with a lot of technology and many rules about it. He has only seen an airplane twice for planes were not suppose to over fly villages, it was against the rules. Children of the same age are raised together and each December they move up a grade, when the reach the age of twelve they are selected for occupational training Jonas in talking to his friend states about selections: \\"Jonas Shrugged. It didn't worry him, how could someone not fit in? The Community was so meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made.\\" However all the other Twelve's were assigned and Jonas was skipped then at the end of the ceremony it was announced that he had been selected he was chosen to become the \`receiver of memory.' He was to learn all the history and story of the people and become an advisor to the council that ruled the village. It only happened every so many generations and only 1 keeper of memories was installed in each village. Jonas and his family take in an infant who is not maturing and growing quickly enough. The child is given a year extension, when the child is marked to me replaced (abandoned and killed). Jonas takes the child and runs away. Through the winter Jonas knows he will not make it and pours all the memories he has learnt into the child. But can he save the child? What will happen to him and his community? Jonas thought his world was perfect, that the elders had everything under control, that there would never be war again. But also a world without choices. Till he is given the knowledge of the past the choice to save a child or let it die?Gathering BlueLois LowryLaurel-Leaf BooksISBN:0440229499Kira, is an orphan and she has a twisted leg, she lives in a village with very little technology and one that casts aside those who do not contribute. The weak, injured, and helpless are abandoned. However things are starting to turn around for Kira, she has been spared by the all powerful Council of Guardians, for she has a gift she is a weaver and can die cloths in ways no other in the community can. As an artisan she is installed in the palatial Council Edifice and spends the whole year working her trade, her primary task is to care for the Robe of Remembrance that tell's the story of this community. But with her privilege comes expectations that she will do the council biddings. She befriends a young boy and his ragged dog, Matty \`The Fiercest of the Fierce'. Matt tells Kira about another village where people are not cast aside, where they share their food. Matt brings her a gift the color blue, and a blind man that is her father. She is torn between staying and leaving the life she knows, and the truths she can find out what will happen.MessengerLois LowryThomas Allen & SonISBN:0618404414Matt has returned he is with Kira's father and living in the new community from beyond yonder. This village is guided by love and compassion, and guided by the \`Leader' a seer arrived in this village one winter night many years ago on a sleigh with an older boy who did not survive the journey. The Seer can see the future and can often see for people what might be for his people. Matty is almost at the age where he will be named, he is hoping to be named \`Messenger' for he takes message both in the village and to other villages which many can not do. But things are changing, the village is becoming hostile, starting to turn people away and the woods are becoming ferial and people are dieing. Can the Leader save the village, can the world be healed, what will happen to Kira, her father and Matty?These three books will challenge you, after reading The Giver the first time I was overwhelmed and it haunted me for a long time. I went back and have reread it many many times. All three books raise questions about community, love, friendship, and care for other people. They also show dark paths that we as a people can go down, and how it can devastate all around us when we make the wrong choices for the wrong reasons."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book starts off well with a great story line. Jonas lives in a society where everything is controlled by rules. The rules were decided long ago to eliminate any individuality, any fear, any worry or anxiety. But, as he learns when he is made the Receiver of Memories, a lot has also been lost. There is no color, no music, no love and no pain. However, what starts off as a great story with great potential quickly looses its thrust. It's almost as though the author didn't know how to end the story and grabbed the first thing that came to mind. The ending leaves the reader with many questions. That in and of it self is not bad as long as they are thought provoking questions. But these are not. Rather, the reader is left asking where the rest of the story is. This book leaves the reader flat. There is no closure. Perhaps that is what the author wanted but, if it is, then she chose to give up the story for the sake of a momentary effect on the reader."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A deep novel that makes the reader think and reflect about their own experience.I went into this novel not knowing a thing about it. It slowly unravelled itself as I read on from chapter to chapter and found myself emotionally invested in teh characters and storyline.This is truly a gripping novel that everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In this book the future is made up of communities with rules and governed with a watchful eye. In these communities there is no war, no crime, no heartache. There is also no love, no feelings of want, no colors. So which would be better? Our ways now or the ones in the future? Jonas feels that the old ways (our ways now) would be the best. Jonas has been given the job of Receiver. That job entails learning all the memories from the past from the old Receiver. Only one person can be this Receiver and he must hold all the memories within himself so it will not be released to the others in the community. For pure chaos could happen. Jonas goes through many painful memories of loss, war, starvation, etc but he also experiences memories of happiness, love and starts seeing the colors in everything. He believes everyone should have these memories and these feelings and sets out to make this happen.I do admit that the ending boggled me for a bit. I realized that I could make the ending out to be the way I felt it should. You will be able to do the same. It is a very charming book that leaves you thinking long after you have finished."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is a boy who has never really known pain, suffering, or want. why? because he lives in a controlled environment where \\"choice\\" is a foreign concept.in jonas' society, children are raised to look, dress, and act a certain way. no one can see color or difference or variety in anything. EVERYTHING is the same. therefore, there is no such thing as race, minority, or majority.everyone is supposedly equal and the only way out of this controlled society is to petition a \\"release\\" which is none other than lethal injection.jonas is at an age where he is about to become an adult. becoming an adult in his society means being told what job he will take and possibly who he will marry, who his children will be, and where he will live.EVERYTHING is decided for the citizens and no one is allowed to make any real choices.jonas doesn't realize how vague, boring, and controlled his life is until he begins to see color. instead of tan -- a girl's hair in his class turns bright red and an apple goes from boring tan to green.because of his ability, jonas is deemed as the Giver's new apprentice -- that is, he will learn how things were in the past:he will learn about war, pain, suffering, race, gender, ethnicity, and all the things unknown to his society in their boring, lifeless, controlled world.learning to his horror how cruel and limited his society is, jonas resolves to find a better life -- without petitioning release."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver has now become my #1 favorite book.

I believe that the ending could have been better(and yes, i got it). A real great fantasy story. I loved it but it only gets a 4 dut to the ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really felt this book is a must read for people of all ages! The main reason is because I believe that within Lowis Lowry's THE GIVER, everyone can find something to relate to. For example, Jonas, the main character, is very worried about his future life, like many people are. From another view, Jonas also seems to feel left out, a feeling many younger people and adolescents can relate to. Another aspect of this book that I feel should strike a chord with anyone and everyone who reads it, is how wonderful it is to have variety. Just as had happened in the book, everyone ended up with the same birthday, not being able to see colors... dressing alike etc. Thank God we don't have to worry about that! I feel that people, when reading this book should focus on the feelings that Jonas experiences when being the Giver's tutoree... so to speak. He goes from confusion to understanding- from sadnees to overwhelming joy. The spectrum of emotion that Lowry reflects is amazing!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is great. I have read it many times over the years. It is one of my all-time favorite books. The world Lowry creates is so believable and realistic I can see the future turning out that way."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is the best book you will ever read if you ask me!. I mean this book has everything you want in a book and its for all ages there is nothing bad in there really unless your child doesn't know about death yet then you should wait. This book is perfect and it doesn't cost so much money so its worth it! trust me! once you read it you will understand!."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am currently reading the book &quot;The Giver&quot; by, Lois Lowry. I started it not too long ago, and I cant seem to put it down! It's definately a book that I would recommend to someone who enjoys reading about excitement, and suspense. It's a very ambiguous story. That goes into alot of detail. Their world is very different from ours, and it makes me thankful for the things i have. However, i wouldnt really mind being Jonas's character. He's the main character and goes through one exciting adventure! But i guess if you want to know what happens, then you'll have to read the book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I can't believe that woman/man thought that this book was sick! PLEASE! I mean, this could actually happen to us. That person said that this encourages violence and other bad things-well I think this book teaches children that violence and hurting others are bad. I mean, this book may have been graphic, but I believe that children (preferrably over 10) should read this book. It really teaches you to value the life you have. Okay, that was my outburst, but here is my summary of the book (which I myself have read 6 times)!The main character is Jonas. He lives in a world of routine and order-and no feelings. No one is allowed to choose there spouse or even have there own child! And the community picks there job (a.k.a. &quot;Assignment&quot;) Jonas is chosen as the reciever of memories. Now you see, the people can't feel anytning, good or bad, and they all have one generation memories. Which means thay only remember stuff that has happened since they were born. Like how we learn about war and stuff, they don't. They have no colors, music, and climate. Anyways, the reciever holds all of the memories from the past-good and bad. ALthought the good ones are great (such as LOVE, CHRISTMAS, and SNOW) the bad memories (such as WAR, RELEASE, and PAIN) really make the job hard. And no one knows anything about feelings because they don't allow them to feel them. Anyways, Jonas and the Giver decided on a plan to fix this. So......read the book to find out the rest, and I promise you that you won't be disappointed. I know that despite what others said, this book is a positive one and truly makes you think about right and wrong."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read The Giver, and I think it's really good. It has a totally unique plot, and a lot of conflict...It's one of those books that really makes you think about your life, and how it would be if you didn't have any emotions at all. I didn't really like the part where they describe how Jonah's dad killed the baby, but other than that, I think this book is A REALLY GOOD BOOK! YOU SHOULD READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The plot, I thought, was very imaginative. Lois Lowry added a lot of detail, and did a very good job describing the memories. I thought she did a very good job at showing how bad this type of soceity really was. The idea that no one was truly an individual is scary. I would have given this book 5 stars, but I didn't really like the end that much. It ended very abruptly, and left a lot to the imagination.~JP~ Ipswich High School"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"ok i can understand why this book got a newberry metal, it had a good plot and it is worth reading but i found that i didn't really like the characters and i thought that it was alittle too improbable even for a sci-fi book. as i said before you should get this book and it is worth reading at least to give you a new idea of what life might be like in the future."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of the most poignant books I've ever read, and I read it twice when I was in middle school. This science fiction book for young readers shows the perfect world of the future, and shows the many advantages and disadvantages of both perfect and imperfect worlds. It chronicles the experience of Jonas, who has lived happily in a perfect futurestic community, until he recieves memories from the giver. I don't want to give away too much from the book, but basically in an imperfect world there is pain, love, and knowledge. In a perfect world, there is no pain, no love, and no knowledge. Jonas starts to challenge many of the qualities of the world and the plot gets pretty exciting as the story advances more and more. At first I thought it was a little harsh, but I later realized that the message in the book not only touched the mind and heart ofthe reader, but the characters in the book as well. Both me and my sister enjoyed it. It's very good overview of the world and life, and it's also a very good book for young readers."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have read the giver and I enjoyed the book emensly. My onlypromblem was That the book didn't develope Jonas enough and justthrough the charecter derectly at you. I recomend this book to all ages for it is an intresting and entertaining book. So my question is WHY NOT READ THE GIVER."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book for my children's literature class. It dealt with in depth issues involving our society, such as euthenasia, individuality, and more. The book has some very in depth issues so I would not recommend it for anyone younger than 10th grade. As an adult and a mother I thought this was an excellent book. I think even an adult could get a lot out of this book. I commend Lois Lowry for her effort to deal with the tough issues that face our society today."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is not a really exciting. And it was boring becuse it was way to long and it was weird in parts. Becuse it was not what you think is going to be and it isent what you think it will be what you want to happen. Well have fun reading!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry came up with a great idea when she wrote &quot;The Giver.&quot; The Giver is an excellent science fiction book that gives the reader a taste of what our world would be really if we all were the same. The book itself is told in past tense by a narrator,which is the point of view. The main character,Jonas,is trapped in a world which he does not know truly about until he is elected the new receiver of memories in his community. He learns the ways of the past from a man called &quot;The Giver.&quot; He also learns how life and the world used to be. Jonas grows tired of these scary memories,however the Giver and Jonas decide to make a plan for Jonas to go to &quot;the beyond.&quot; The plan succeeds and Jonas makes it. This book is very exciting and kept me reading. I have no complaints what so ever!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Don't even try to put me in he Giver's world. It's a good read, but you have to be prepared for some depressing scenes. Try to imagine living in a place where snow, sunshine, and spring flowers are only a faint memory to a select few. Strong emotions such a love and anger are obsolete. Music has disappeared altogether. Everyone's &quot;birthday&quot; is on the same day, with only fifty people of each age. This is Jonas' community. When Jonas and the other Elevens turn twelve, they are selected for training in different professions, such as &quot;Doctor&quot; and &quot;Caretaker of the Old&quot;. After hours of anticipation, Jonas is chosen as the new &quot;Receiver of Memory&quot;. Wow, big deal. But it is a big deal! Now, he is one of only two people who know that sunbathing and war ever existed. You could call him extremely lucky. Or you could call him infinitely unfortunate. Take your pick. It's interesting in a twisted sort of way to read about a world without color. I just wouldn't want to live there. Read The Giver and decide for yourself what your opinion is."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a good book. When Jonas became Receiver, and everything leading up to it, it was good. Getting the memories-wonderful description. The great escape- a wonderful plot thickening twist. But when the ending came, I was so dissapointed, I could have thrown up. The ending left more questions unanswered than Full Disclosure. I hope that others can figure out what happens in the ending better than I can, because I want the satisfaction of closure over having to figure out (if it's possible) wha happens to our main character."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lowry's book about the future is very fascinating, because it shows very realistically what a future society might be like. It is written very easy, so that someone like me, a stupid pupil from Germany, can easily understand it. The first part, in which the community is described, is a little bit boring, but after chapter eight it is very impressive and interesting. I can only recommend the book,which I read at school, because it allows a completely different look at our society and shows what it might be like in the time to come."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book is great.It really makes you think about a perfect society.When you first start the book you think about there is no freedom and how you never would want one.then the more you get into the book you think about how the elders spend so much time choosing the your job and how suited it is to you.They have ritual ceremonies and everything is the same and there is no hate or crime and death is all because of natural causes not suicide or murder."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this book has a great story line, but a terrible ending. I really wish the auther would hve either taken off the last paragraph or so, or added a few more chapters. also i found that the way that people were released was a bit disturbing, but the way that jonas's dad releasesd the newborn child was the most disturbing of all, especially how he lied about it. Good book, just skip the ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm a little disappointed with the author. I feel like she came up with an incredible story, but just didn't take it where it needed to be taken. This story had the potential to be an amazing story about the triumphs and tragedies of human existence. It could have taken you to the graphic and horrible lows, and then right back up. But it fell flat. I understand that the book was for young adults, but I feel the memories were hurriedly described and could have been so much more poignant.One of the most poignant moments in the book is when Jonas sees his friends playing \\"war\\" immediately after experiencing a memory of real war and he is shocked and appalled. But even this scene doesn't make sense! They live in a community where you're not even allowed to say unkind things to people, and yet they let the children run around and pretend to shoot each other?To make matters worse, the ending made very little sense. There's a fine line between leaving it up to the reader's imagination and just not giving enough explanation, and I felt that the ending in The Giver fell on the wrong side of that line. It also seemed to have very little to do with the actual plot and moral of the story.I just feel like the author squandered the amazing gift that this story could have been.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"You know, I have heard a lot about this book over the years but for whatever reason have never felt the urge to buy it and read it.Maybe because in the past dystopian has never really been my thing but thanks to some recent great reads (mainly Lauren Oliver's Delirium series) that has changed.So, when I saw this go on sale in ebook form for only $.99 I thought what the heck and picked it up.I really wasn't sure what to expect for this read. I try not to listen to hype about books too much because more often than not, I find myself disappointed with books that have gotten fabulous reviews and well, that just sucks when that happens.So I tried going into this one with an open mind and no expectations whatsoever, which was probably a good thing.I am not going to say that I didn't enjoy this read because I did, I really did. It was imaginative and creative and down right poetic at times but yet...it just didn't grab me like it seemed to for others.It was kind of sad and even a little creepy the extent that the elders and council would go to to keep the Sameness and as the story unfolded you got glimpses of why things were the way they were and the extent of what life was like there.I felt for The Giver and for Jonas and the struggles and challenges that they had with their calling and with them wanting to make their lives better and to open the eyes of the others.I couldn't imagine living in a world devoid of life and emotions and color.How sad that would be.Maybe it was the ending that did it for me, or rather didn't quite do it for me. There really wasn't a definite \\"this is how it is\\" type of thing. You are left wondering if things really changed and what happened with Jonas, The Giver and even baby Gabe. Sometimes I like that definite ending to be there. I don't always want to make up my own happy ever after. And while this did hint at what was to come I just wish it would have been a little more detailed, but then again, this is a trilogy so maybe there is more of that in the next two books. One can only hope at any rate."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have been reading the book called The Giver for a while now. At first it was an odd topic and it made no sense to me. Then as I kept reading the story got intense and I did not want to stop reading it. I think this book is a really good book. The story is about a boy named Jonas living in a world of rules he gets assigned a role in his community but if I told you it I would ruin the story. The writer Lois Lowry is very good making you feel like you are actually there. I don't think I would change anything in this book if I were asked to because it is just wonderful! I personally like reading fantasy but, I think this book changed my mind about Science Fiction because I have never felt like I wanted to keep reading a science fiction ever but this book is so exciting! I recommend this book to 6th-8th graders; it is great but may be a little too intense for 6th grade and under."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I suppose the reason this book has no previous reviews would be because it is for a younger audience,but it is classic. For fear of giving spoilers I will make this short.It is a very original story about a boy living in a authoritarian culture, where there is an inability for free thought. After becoming apprenticed to the town's Giver the boy begins a journey of who he is, where he belongs, and the truth about humanity.I would recommend the book to younger readers and adults alike. It is surprising, emotional, and of all the books I've read one of the most memorable!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this first at 12 and it has been one of my favourite books ever since. Jonas lives with his parents and sister in a society where everything is strictly ordered. It's safe and everyone knows what to do and how to act in any thinkable situation. The society runs like clockwork. Jonas is turning 12 soon. For the children, every year is marked with a Ceremony. At the Ceremony the transition is marked with new clothes, a bike, new duties etc. for each age group. The Twelves are given their assignment - their job for the rest of their adult life.Jonas' Assignment is a shock to him and to the Community. But he soon learns to cope with it - and with a dangerous new world of feelings, memories, lost freedoms and the consequences of brutal equality. The story follows him through most of his twelfth year, where Jonas' thoughts of his home drastically changes. He grows up fast - and then has to make a choice for himself and for the Community."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Great series. Each book was great on its own, but Son really tied it together.

It is extremely well-written and is thought-provoking, I found it to be almost terrifying in that, are we not careful, we might have the imagined world Lowry creates in her book as a reality for our future world. I would hope that we would guard against allowing our families, as we know them, to be taken from us. The world of Jonas is one without any true happiness and lacks love and color. I was somewhat hopeful throughout the book that Jonas, the hero of the story, and his young charge, might find a better world. I suppose the message for all is to be aware. Sameness has been tried and found wanting in the world's history. I enjoyed the book as an adult. I would not have liked it as a young teen (the intended audience) because I would have found the parallels between the attempts of Germany to create such a world during World War II, where my father and uncles fought, and the world of the Giver too harsh for my tender young heart."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I haven't read all of it yet but I have read parts and I have read Gathering Blue (yes out of order) and Lois Lowry writes beautifully and the books plays out in front of me with so much detail."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My 12 year old son and I read this one and discussed it.

The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community that everything is the same. Jonas is selected to be the new reciever of memories, which is an extremely important job. The receiver of memories holds all of the memories of the past so the community doesn't have to bear them. As Jonas takes on these memories the excitement begins. I enjoyed the characters in the Giver because they were different and interesting. I loved the plot because it was exciting and suspenceful. The Giver is one of a triolgy of books. The second is called Gathering Blue and the last is The Messenger, they are all relitivily related."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is a coming of age novel that children and adults everywhere will adore. Jonas, the protagonist of the novel, learns that he has become the new \\"Receiver\\", when he turns twelve years old, which enables him to have memories that no one else in his utopian society obtains. Jonas's character takes on a different light than the others in the novel and his growth through the memories transferred to him by the Giver allow Jonas to face and overcome numerous obstacles in his society. By receiving these memories, Jonas feels as urge to break out from his perfect society which he learns is more of a dystopia than utopia. The Giver is an easy read and will capture your heart and imagination as you sympathize with Jonas's plight to reality.Jacqueline CarlsonMythology VHS"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book many, many years ago when I was in grade school. I'm sure it was compulsory back then, but I've read it dozens of times since then on my own, and our family's copy of it is well-worn and missing the cover.I am completely aghast at all of the reviews that stem from both parents and students questioning the values the book teaches. Many, many people are missing the point that while the community in which this takes place is painted as a utopia, it is decidedly not, which is what Jonas comes to realize by the end of the novel. Yes, in the book, the elderly are not valued, nor are birth mothers, lower-weight twins, the sick and mentally handicapped; however, as the book progresses, one realizes along with Jonas the absurdity of the values this \\"utopia\\" holds and comes to appreciate diversity in all forms. This book challenges the reader to examine their beliefs and embrace life.Yes, this book does touch on more adult topics like euthanasia, puberty and sexual urges, war, etc., but these are not topics that are foreign to everyone under the age of 14, and there is no reason a mature younger child should not be allowed to read and enjoy the book. Can it be scary to someone not ready for it? Yes, perhaps, but I would challenge the parents of the scared child to discuss the issues presented in the book with their child and help them realize that this is a \\"what if\\" story and does not, thankfully, represent reality - yet.I can appreciate how some might find this story boring and some younger readers may not understand what is happening, and therefore not appreciate it. However, I read it for the first time at a very young age and was never bored nor frightened by it, and I appreciate the story and timeliness of the events even now."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"So my second book in the Reading Newberry Books series and... wow! I read this book completely in one day so my thoughts are real fresh about the thing as a whole...I really liked this book and I ate it up but I still don't know what to feel about the ending. I, like many people, wanted to see the community affected by the memories and I wanted to have some sort-of better feeling about where Jonas ended up. He was so much a victim of his family and his community that I, in my most humane way, want to know that he ended up well. I don't want to spoil this for anyone who is thinking about reading it.I'm 31 years old and this is a book that will entertain and make anyone of any age just think. Not only the ramifications of Jonas' act but to go further back, the community itself. I knew what they were doing however I was still surprised. Especially Jonas' father. Other aspects of the community frightened me more. The hive mentality of the whole community. The fact that people are born from mothers that they will never know. And I'm guessing that the \\"fathers\\" are just \\"sperm pops!\\" There are aspects of the community that remind me of socialism, then the Amish, then 1984 in the control of the community. There are aspects of the community that are good. I found myself thinking about that but as a writer, the suppression of art and individuality bothers me so much! And to not see color. I'm surprised Jonas didn't just go mad that he could see it and no one else but the Giver could!I really loved this book and it made me angry, happy, upset, and nervous which is what good fiction does and is what this community had no concept of. It's an interesting statement of the Mrs. Lowry's skills."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a fascinating warning about our often misguided desire to achieve a perfect society, without crime, confrontations, or any kind of unpleasantness. Lowry takes that desire to the extreme by showing what we would have to surrender in order to reach that ideal (but unrealistic) goal. Unfortunately, that would include most of what makes us human- both the good and the bad. Although the ending has left some readers dissatisfied, I think Lowry's message would have been watered down had she tacked on some superficial, happy ending just to appease those who like their fiction sunny. As it stands, Lowry's warning is all the more convincing for showing how hard it is to change the status quo, particularly a status quo meticulously enforced and regulated. While this might seem on the surface to make the book inappropriate for younger readers, the opposite is true- they should read this book to understand the dangers of giving up too much of ourselves for some artificial culture that has the appearance of being civilized, but in fact is devoid of those very things that ultimately make us human and life worth living. I had read The Giver in tandem with An Audience for Einstein, another thoughtful book about memory and ethical choices."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In the book The Giver by Lois Lowery the community is flawless. There is no pain, fear, or personal choices. The community is controlled by the council who has total control of the world and its inhabitants. The main character is Jonas who is about to receive his job in the community. However as the book progresses it turns out that Jonas is to receive a special job. He is chosen to receive the memories of the past, memories that lead Jonas to believe that his community is not as flawless as it as it seems.This book is an exciting novel that keeps the readers on the edge of there seat yearning to find out what happens next. This book is best enjoyed by young people who understand that The Giver is not only a story, but also portrays real world issues such as ideas about government, economy and the flaws of a real world and a perfect world.As the reader progresses the reader will begin to uncover the horrors of a perfect society, a society in which people are devoid of emotion, and in which no one portrays any sense of emotion towards each other.This book is not entirely sad however. It is also a novel of finding conscience, and discovering true happiness even without being perfect. I know I really enjoyed this book and I hope you read and enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Overall, the book, The Giver was a very good story to read, partly because it wasn't your typical every day story. I think the author, Lois Lowry, did a very nice job writing this book. The main character, Jonas, was chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory, a very important job in the community. He held all the memories of the past so the community members wouldn't be troubled with painful memories. The author described all of the scenes to perfection by using descriptive language. The author also painted a very visual picture in my mind, and that helped me to understand what was happening in the story at that time. But the book was also full of suspense, so it kept me wondering what was going to happen next, and wanting to read more.Probably the worst part of the book was that it had a slow start, but then it quickly progressed from there. The best parts of the book were the descriptions, theme, and suspense, outweighed the bad part. Because of this, I think it is a book worth reading for all ages, both kids and adults, with a rating of four stars.Cameron a sixth grader from Maine"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am currently reading this as part of a class study on utopia and dystopia. My, but it was good! I'm supposed to read the book 45 pages at a time, but I read the whole thing instead, with chastisement from my teacher. At first Jonas' community seems like a fun place to be. You don't have to think for yourself, and, strangely enough, you don't want to because you're having too much fun. It is only when you see the truth behind these lies that the community seems only like a place to run away from. The book was very good. The characters were three-dimensional in a one-dimensional world, and the story was very well written. The only thing that really put me off was the description of what it really means to be released. That passage was horrific, gave me nightmares. The author could have made a milder statement that, while still making the point, didn't involve a newborn baby being murdered.Overall a very good story and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It's a quick read, and an intriguing story. If you liked Brave New World, 1984, or Fahrenheit 451, this should not disappoint. Another intriguing step into a land in which the powers that be make all the decisions, and lay the foundations of citizens' lives.I wish I had read a book like this in my adolescence. It certainly allows the reader to think outside the box and cherish the free will we so often take for granted."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Place yourself in a world where there is little or no emotion, an ordered community, ignorance of real life and where the word love is meaningless and you are in Jonas's world. This story makes you question whether or not you really want to live in that so-called perfect world. It also shows the horror of that perfect world. And when Jonas does begin to love he sets in motion events that can't be erased and are possibly devastating to the community.The second time that you read the novel, The Giver, by Lois Lowry the story and characters are even more real than they previously were and the story has so much more depth than before. This novel is not only a good read for younger kids, but also for teenagers and adults because there are things in the novel that everyone can relate to.~TA, Pembroke Academy"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is set in a futuristic setting where there is no crime and the world is just perfect.I suggest that you read the book a couple of times before you will begin to understand the concept."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book takes place in a community.This is about how children are raised and grow up. The two main children are Jonas and Lily. We compare this book to our life. It is slow in the beginning but it gets exciting.Jonas seems like a good character because he seems nice and very helpful. If you want to compare it and enjoy a great book then think about The Giver. I liked the book because I like to compare it to my life. I also like to learn how other countries and different centuries live or did live. Whenever I have free time I sit down and read a couple of chapters of it.

It also confuses you. From one through five I rate it a four because it could of had a better ending. The ending was very boring and not exciting at all. I thought that it was going to have a better ending. Other than the ending, it was very cool. In some parts of the book it leaves you in suspense and makes you want to read more.

I read quite a few of the reviews, and was appaled! To think that someone could say that one should save their money and read a classic is HORRIFIC. This book by some is considered a classic. This book leaves a lasting but good impression. This book was an insight to another culture, real or not, and that is very valuable. I am in 8th grade and just read __The Giver__for the second time( I read it in 4th grade and have been meaning to read it ever since.) This time, though I understood it the first time, I really grasped it the second time around and picked up little things that I didn't the first which changed the whole picture only slightly, but made the book seem different, and if possible--even better.

This in itself isn't an original concept, but because the book is about a child's experience of this situation, it is a good addition to the genre of dystopian fiction.I've given this book three stars because the characters - particularly the main character - were not fully developed. I found the book to be a page-turner, but when I was done I realized that I didn't know the main character very well at all."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Ok, so I just finished the book, and have been reading all of the reviews on here. Let me explain my take on it.It seems like the majority of the people say it is very boring. Really? I read it in two days! It opens up and is very exciting, she creates a sense of something is going on. You don't know what it is, and then the story unfolds. When at the Ceremony of Twelves he is skipped, my heart skipped a beat too! Near the end when he realizes what must be done, I'm in there rooting for him! Go Jonas!!Now for the negative. The middle did go slow, and was kind of weird how he receives the memories. The emotions that come across are very real, but as far as action in the story, it does go slow. Also, the whole stirrings thing could have been dealt with differently. Actually, the whole stirrings thing was ok, I suppose, but getting to that point by washing naked people was completely inappropriate, and other ways could have been more effective in introducing puberty.People complain about it being boring - deathly boring!! THAT IS THE POINT!! The author is trying to show us that being the same - sameness - is bad. We are individuals, and God made us unique the way we are. Of course, that reasoning can be taken to extreme too. The theme of euthanasia - I took it as a warning. I don't know if you realize it or not, but our world is heading that way.Was it worth a read - yes. Worth a read for young kids or even middle school - uhh - parents you decide."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you haven't read it yet, you must. You just must. It's such an interesting idea for a book, one that is bound to interest all ages. I think I've read it 5 times. Oh, the sequels.. they aren't as great. But enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a book I wanted to film in my former life in Hollyweird, but alas I could not get the rights because Jeff Bridges owned them, and apparently has done nothing with them. A shame since this is a cinematic gold mine. Complex, inspiring conversations between the generations, this is a must-read for any one who can read. I've had energetic discussions with my children over the concepts in this beautifully written book, and look forward to gifting it to my grandchildren to discuss it with them"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's The Giver is one of those truly amazing books that actually changes the way you think. Though it is surprisingly brief, the message of the book will have you thinking for days. Jonas, the protagonist, is a beautifully written character and through him we experience his world and his ever increasing realization that something is horribly wrong there.An outstanding book for young adults and grown-ups."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A dystopian novel from a child's point of view. Most dystopian novels are written from the viewpoint of an adult who is fighting against the goverment and/or ideologies of the current world. In The Giver, Lowry gives us the other side, a child who is happy and content with the world he lives in. He later comes to see his world as oppressive and cruel, but it is this learning that makes this a unique and important work in the world of dystopian fiction. The prose and structure of the book are a bit more elementary (as this is a young adult book) and the story line more straight forward, but these do not detract from the lessons learned. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a great novel that many middle school aged students read as part of their school curriculum. As a teacher, I use the audio version to play in class to cover some chapters. Since I don't listen from beginning to end and have to reset and start at different points for each class period, the CD's are a bit awkward. The tracks are not recorded by chapter or page number so finding the spot where my students left off is sometimes tedious. Other than that, the recording is great and the kids like the reader's voice and the accompanying music for dramatic effect."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I rate the book, The Giver by Lois Lowry, a three. It is interesting when it's talking about the different lifestyles and the perfect community. But, it isn't nearly as detailed and descriptive as My Brother Sam is Dead by the Coulier brothers. The Giver would be for people who like science fiction. The purpose was to tell the readers there isn't such a thing as perfect. No one can be perfect, and that is the conflict, Jonas, the main character has to deal with. He finds out how phony and imperfect his community really is. Everything is controlled, even people's emotions. You can definitely tell through the words how Jonas feels about the whole situation and how everyone else is comfortable with it. In the end I thought it was an okay book, but the ending could've been written differently and more descriptive."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As much as I wanted to love this book, I cannot.I adore sci-fi and dystopic novels, but this books writing was just awful. Lowry leaves an absurd amount of questions unanswered and it's seriously like she just gave up on the ending. It's almost as if she decided it would be better left like that, so all the school kids who have to read this worthless book are forced to write an ending as part of their grade for \\"The Giver\\"'s unit.I don't believe in censorship (it basically says to teenagers \\"I'm banned! Therefore, I MUST be good if your teachers don't want you to read me.\\"), but I definitely don't believe this book belongs up there with all of the other great classics that kids are required to read, like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". If you are interested in bringing young adults into this genre, I suggest \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins.Such an amazing idea falls flat on its face.1 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is not good literature. The book is not good literature because it does not share an important message, the characters are not believable, and it is not full of feelings. The book does not have an important message. In the book it explains how everything is the same. In our town this will never happen. The characters in this book are not believable. They are not believable because they have pills that make them not have feelings for anyone. Also, they can't have their own kids. They have things called family units. One last reason of why they aren't believable is because they have a speaker that tells them everything to do. On page 23 it says, \\"Attention. This is a reminder for male elevens that objects are not to be removed from the recreation area and that snacks are to be eaten, not hoarded,\\" This is the speaker telling Jonas what to do. Lastly, the book is not full of feelings. A boy dies in the river and no one is even sad. Also, when people are released they are just killed. No one in the community is scared to do it or sad that it is happening. This is why I think that \\"The Giver\\" is not good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When my 7th grader was reading the Giver and said the book was very strange, I picked it up myself to read. It is a strangebook that is very sad, dark and about a society of people that does not experience life as it really is, but experiences life in a controlled way. There is no pain, love or self expression. The old are sent to the house of old to live until death, never to embrace grandchildren. The weakest in the community are \\"released\\" which means they are murdered. The scene in the book where the youngest twin (twins aren't allowed)is injected with a lethal injection,goes thru spasms, then goes limp and dies is ultra sad for anyone to read, let alone a young reader. The law doesn't apply to this community.

We're in a fantasy world (something I usually like), but one where the rules of the game are never really explained -- this means that incidents happen without, seemingly, making sense in the terms of the world we are plunged into. Also (and this is why my son wouldn't finish it) the book is depressing in a way I found not only cruel, but gratuitous. I have no problem letting my son read \\"The Yearling\\" or other books where the outcome is far from pleasant, but the ending of this one seemed nasty in a way that's acceptable perhaps because of the culture we live in. I felt a lesson was being pushed down my throat -- and I didn't like the lesson.

I thought Number The Stars was kind of boring. I liked how Jonas was my age, in The Giver, so I could relate to him a bit. And, even though Gabe wasn't Jonas' brother, I could relate to that, too. So, I could really get into the book, because of that.I didn't like the ending of The Giver, though. I don't think many people liked the ending either. So, I have a request, could you make another book, of the same topic, but with a better ending? I also didn't like the whole release thing. Especially with the twins, how they would kill the one who weighed the least.Overrall I would say this was a great book, and just forget about my rating I put!

It is a wonderful story with powerful imagery. In fact, there are several scenes that have never left my mind. The ending in particular is stunning.If I had to single out a best quality I would choose the originality of it. This book did something for me that I believe all books should do: it made me truly *think.* &quot;The Giver&quot; served as a springing board for my own examinations of our society and the things we take for granted. It is a book filled with written emotion, and Lowry's wording is exquisite. It is descriptive while being simplistic, and the meaning behind each word is sharp and clear. Initially there is an awe; an innocent wonder. As the plotline expands the awe turns to horror and pain.However, in the midst of it all there is a process of discovering beauty. In &quot;The Giver&quot; the main character learns what feelings are. In the course of reading this book, I felt as though I were being taught as well.This is one extraordinary piece of work."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've read The Giver a few times to Grade 4 students and they love it. While only a few kids that age could read it independently, it's one of those books that seems to lift students up to its level of sophistication and helps them mature by seeing our culture with a little removedness.Set in the future, it gives a horrifying glimpse into &quot;perfection&quot;. With everything safe and controlled, there's no tolerance or allowance for error, for real feelings, for true thought. It's a very colourless place! In fact, people have lost their ability to see colour -- all except for a few. Jonas is one of them, although at first he catches only brief glimpses and doesn't know what it is, just that for a moment something looks &quot;different&quot;. This is one of the very powerful, sublte threads of the plot, the discovery that this different look to things is actually colour. The reader doesn't know for a very long time that this perfect world is in fact colourless, and when it finally is revealed, my students are always shocked! (sorry if I'm giving away some plot, but if you're a teacher and haven't read this book, it's good to know to add some intrigue about this, as it is very subtle).One of the most wonderful aspects about this book is that it makes us so very thankful for the world we have, with all its imperfections. A perfectly safe world is not so appealing afterall! It's certainly not without a very dark, secret underbelly. What is &quot;Releasing?&quot; A discovery more shocking than no colour! And this plot thread I won't give away!A good &quot;while reading&quot; technique is to make a Venn diagram to compare &quot;The Future Community&quot; to &quot;Our Community&quot;, noting the similarities and differences. It makes a good, thoughtful focuser for the students.The ambiguous ending, I've found, leaves kids quite dissatisfied. Many of them feel cheated. Personally, I think this is wonderful, for it may be their first novel to not have all the loose ends neatly tied. Lowry leaves room for their own interpretation. What I like to do is not read the final chapter until after the kids have written their own endings. This way they can better deal with the amibiguity at the end, because they've thought it through to their own satisfaction already.I'd highly recommend this book if you love good, thought-provoking literature. Lowry shows true genius, and stimulates very high-level thinking."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Do you sometimes wish you lived in a utopia? do you wish you lived in a world with no poverty, no robbers, no pollution, no color, no love, and no warfare? Well, this story is about a boy named Jonas. Jonas is living in that world, and he thinks he lives like everyone else and has a pretty good lfe. He has a mom, a dad, and a sister, named Lily. He also has friends like Fiona and Asher. During the story, he meets the Giver who shows him how the world used to be when there was love and warfare. He makes Jonas have memories about warfare and love. jonas learns that his life is boring compared to what the world used to be. Jonas meets the Giver during the twelve ceremony whe the 12-year-old kids get their jobs. Jonas is skipped, but at the end of the ceremony , Jonas learns that he is the receiver of the community. Later in the book, Jonas decided that he has to leave the community and go where these memories are real. He brings his half brother, Gabe, with him because if didn't , Gabe would be killed. Gabe is a baby, who no one wants because he doesn't sleep through the night, so the leader of the community is going to release Gabe. Jonas' dad doesn't like this, so he taked the chold and makes Gabe one of his own, but the master says that they were going to release him, and it is out of Jonas' father's hands. Jonas decided to take Gabe and run away. At the end, Jonas gets to a community with color and love. I liked this book, and I recomend it to everyone because it has action and adventure, and it tells you a utopia isn't always a good thing. I though there could have been a better ending. Lowry didn't talk about Jonas' new community and if he liked it or not. I hope she makes another book about his new community. I give this book four out of five stars. I would have given it five stars if she had written a better ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Characters:Jonas, Lily, Jonas' Mom, Jonas' Dad,The Giver,GabrielSetting and Time: The setting is in so-called a perfect world with many different points of view of life. The time is really whenever you want it to be but I think it is in the future.Review: After reading the book, \\"The Giver,\\" written by Lois Lowry it changed my perspective towards life.Jonas, a 12-year-old boy, living in is what to be a Utopia has just been selected to become the next, \\"Receiver of Memory,\\" a very powerful job in the community. Everything is going well until Jonas finds out the truth about his community's past from The Giver. Jonas has feelings not many other people have and Jonas has a drastic plan to make the community differently. He takes with him his most precious being in his dwelling, Gabriel. Read this amazing book to find out its weird but great ending.This book, \\"The Giver,\\" conveys a feeling of confusion but as the story progresses all the knots in the story untie at the end of the book. This story is so abstract in most of the chapters you'll have to re-read the chapter for it to make sense. The book has a sense of belonging towards the end because of the book's actions. This book is well written and has been rewarded with a Newberry Honour Award. The book deserves this award for its continuous page turning action all the way to the end. The Giver is one of the best books I have read in my life. The Giver should have a chance to be read all cross the country by each student in grade 6, 7 and 8. This book should be read all over the world.I give this book a four and a half stars out of five because it deserves a great deal of respect ans has little flaws that do jump out at the reader. I recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 but they have to be mature enough to handle certain situations."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I bought this book to give as a gift, and ended up reading it myself. A scary and thought-provoking book, chillingly and beautifully written, right up to the ambiguous ending.I think this is a very worthwhile read. If you have not yet read this book I suggest you don't read many of the amazon reviews. Many of the reviews give away every single major plot point. I find this very disappointing and am glad I did not read many reviews before I read the book, as much of the power and gut-wrenching effect come from discovering the answers yourself as the story unfolds. Read the book. If you want to read other reader reviews wait until you've read the book first. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've read The Giver three times in my life. Once on my own in 6th grade and I didn't get to finish it; I still regret that to this day. Then I read it in reading class in eight grade. I was so amazed. It stunned me how it was so well written. Lois Lowry's imagination is outstanding. It felt as if I was right in the book with Jonas. I just finished it for the third time this year in my tenth grade English class, and still the book gets better every time I read it. It's about a twelve-year-old boy named Jonas, who lives in a real but yet far from reality world, where there is no crime, pain, or wrongdoing of any kind. The elders of Jonas's community assign he and his fellow Twelve's to their life occupation. You'll find out that Jonas is special and so he gets a job that only one person gets. He's chosen to be the receiver of memories in from the Giver. Jonas begins to find out things in his community that no one else except he and the Giver know about. The thing I like the most about the book is that Jonas's world has a controlled environment and they have a pill for everything like pain and feelings."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We read this for our 8th grade English class and really enjoyed it. It's one of those books that although confusing at first really makes you think. Lois Lowry paints the picture of what seems to be a perfect utopian community. The idea of such a utopian society can be incredibly tempting, especially when people today are experiencing things like the aftermath of the senseless shooting in Newtown, CT. The idea or promise of a society where there is order and no fear of such things ever happening again might be enough to convince people that living in such a world might be worth any sacrifice.But Lois Lowry's novel forces the reader to think about whether this feeling of safety and security is worth giving up your rights to be an individual. The community she created shows a very orderly, predictable and secure atmosphere. A select group of Elders every aspect of people's lives, from who they marry, what job they will have down to when each child receives his/her first bicycle.as well as other such rites of passage. This control over the lives of people in the community values sameness and ability to live without worry as they never experience pain or hardship. And who can blame them? Idealistically this sounds great, a world without pain and suffering where every member plays a role and contributes to their community. Even the weather is always perfect and everyone's basic needs are taken care of, no poverty, and no starvation. But in order to achieve this, the people must sacrifice freedom and individuality and the ability to think for themselves. It's as if they have been brainwashed and never question authority. Yes, it might be safer, but is that really the way you'd want to live?The book's main character, 12 year old Jonas is assigned the role of the Memory Keeper. There is only one other person that will mentor him, that in time he affectionately calls the Giver. They alone will hold the knowledge and memories of life's experiences, the good and the bad, the beauty and ugliness as well as the love and hate that truly make us human. By holding these memories, they spare the rest of their community from experiencing any pain and suffering. Yet through his training by his mentor, Jonas comes to realize that true wisdom can only come through experiencing life along with all of its emotions. It is the feelings and relationships that truly give our lives meaning.Jonas is saddened and angered through the realization that the people in his life truly have no real connection to others and feel no responsibility for their actions. This becomes most apparent when Jonas finally realizes what \\"Releasing\\" someone means. It is in actuality killing them. For the old, this may seem a humane way to keep them from suffering through old age after they are no longer productive, active members giving back to their society. Yet, the cruel idea of infanticide, killing innocent babies because they are born identical twins or do not measure up to certain standards is disgusting to him. He and his mentor devise a plan to bring the memories and real life back to their community...but things do not go as planned and as Jonas flees his community in an attempt to save an innocent child he has grown to love, we as the readers are left with so many unanswered questions? By leaving, did he experience a better life? Maybe that is left for us to decide."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was one of my favorite books growing up. Our teacher read it to us at lunch in 4th grade, and I've read it quite a few times since (which is a big thing, because unless I'm reading a series and need to remind myself of what happened, I NEVER reread books). Unfortunately, the end always left me wanting more of this great book. I thought I would get this from the next two books in the series, unfortunately they didn't quite involve this exact time and place.It was the first book that introduced me to the dystopian genre and really made me think about our way of life. What is right, what is wrong? How does human nature shape our way of living and how would we live without pieces of it? This is a great learning novel for older elementary kids!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm surprised I never came across this when I was younger. Probably best that I read it now as an adult so I can appreciate this book so much more!! Beautiful story!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am not sure how I lived to be 30 without reading this book but I am glad I did.Jonas lives in a society where \\"sameness\\" is a way of life. There is no individuality, no true love, no war, no famine, no weather, and no memories. No one says words they don't mean and everyone obeys the rules. When he celebrates becoming a Twelve with all of his classmates on their shared birthday he is assigned the highest honor in the community, the Receiver of Memory. He then begins the long painful task of receiving the memories from 'The Giver' from 'back and back and back'. He begins to experience loss, joy, pain, and love for the first time. He must absorb these feelings so the other people in the Community do not have to. He begins to see a way of life that no longer exists but that he thinks everyone should experience. He must then make some very difficult decisions regarding his own life. The ending was a little abrupt for my taste but still well written and allows you to draw your own conclusions (unless you go on to read the others in the series of course).A good read, with a few twists I didn't see coming. It is the very definition of a dystopian novel. It is easy to forget that Jonas is only 12 as his life and memories make him seem much more mature than the adults around him. Well written and a great cautionary tale of what society can become when individuality is eliminated, every movement,thought, and dream is monitored and decisions are made for you. It also makes you appreciate the feelings and memories you wished you could forget. Without pain there is no happiness.My only regret is that I had read this book earlier in life before reading other well known novels with similar premises. I definitely recommend every young adult read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book THE GIVER is about a teenage boy who lives a perfect life.

The Giver is such a well written bock and so I enjoyed reading it every second."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's book &quot;The Giver&quot; is an anti-utopian novel because it takes place in a future without any fear, warfare and hunger but it shows in that way how difficult it is for Jonas and the Giver to live in a perfect world like that. Lois Lowry is a famous author for child-books which are also interesting for adults.

The well described world in which Jonas lives is an reason for that. The other reason is the open ending so that everyone can choose his own end.

All of the world problems have been solved and the people live in the dark and are told nothing. Everything is assigned to each person from parents to job occupations. A good example is when Jonas the Main character is talking with is Father and Mother. They are talking to him about how soon he will be given his job assignment for life at age 12. He recalls back to when he was assigned his bike and even when he was assigned his comfort toy. Then his parents tell him how they were excited when they were assigned there jobs, and then they tell him how they felt when they were assigned his sister \\"Lily\\". They said they knew it would a girl because that is what they applied for and there application was accepted, and how the Commissioners of the town assigning everything with the help of the \\"Giver\\". It would soon be Jonas's turn to be assigned his occupation. I would recommend this book to people who like things of the future. It is a very scary environment where everything is monitored. It is a good book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a truly wonderful depiction of mankind attemping to preserve only the &quot;good&quot; characteristics of life. Lowry clearly shows us the benefits of both worlds; in one world, suffering and happiness coexisted, in the other only &quot;happiness&quot; existed; in the former, life was sometimes unfulfilling and stressful, in this world, life is predetermined and stressfree. However, as Lowry expertly shows, if we let go of the &quot;bad&quot; things in life, the &quot;good&quot; things cease to have as much value. To Love without knowing what it is to Hate; to be Happy, without knowing what Sadness is; in some way the value of our emotions is lessened if we do not know what the opposite emotion feels like. Lowry helps us to see the many good things which exist in our world today...as well as the necessity of some &quot;bad&quot; things."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved the book.It's great how the author describes the memorys extremly well.Its my absoulut favorite book.

But it's tight and emotional and I can't wait to read anything Lois Lowry has written."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in grade school back in the 90's, and I still love it today. It's one of my all-time favorites..everything about it. It really makes you think..and just appreciate people for their differences. Our flaws are what bring color to the world. I didn't find one bit of it boring or as some said \\"disturbing\\". I don't see why a 9 or 10 year old kid wouldn't be able to read it. It's not like a horror novel or something."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When author Lois Lowry regularly visited her parents in a nursing home, she noticed that her father was physically well but his memory was going, while her mother's memory was good but her body was failing.According to a 2004 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, this gave her the inspiration for her Newbery Award-winning novel, The Giver: \\"I began to think a lot about the concept of memory. When it was time for me to begin a new book, I began to create in my mind a place and a group of people who had somehow found the capacity to control memory.\\"Jonas lives in a utopian society where rules, discipline, politeness, similarity, and daily medication rule the day. The only time that differences are celebrated is during the Ceremony of 12: when twelve-year-old children are assigned their careers, based on meticulous observation of how they spend their volunteer hours.While his peers are given jobs like working with the elderly, and Assistant Director of Recreation, Jonas is selected to be the community's next Receiver of Memory. Training him is the current Receiver, whose task is to pass on all the community's \\"memories\\" to Jonas -- thus turning the Receiver into The Giver.It is during this long series of scenes that Lowry really gets her point across, as Jonas learns more about his fellow residents that anyone but other Receivers has ever known, and he slowly discovers just to what lengths his community has gone to get the result it desired.There is much more to the story, but describing it here would take away from the experience of reading this wonderful novel that has become a sort of Brave New World for modern readers. Lowry's ability to choose exactly the right word is not surprising for a story that considers a lack of \\"language precision\\" to be worthy of punishment. The way she reveals piece by piece the myriad things that this \\"perfect\\" community is lacking, making for a level of suspense that rivals an Alfred Hitchcock film, is nothing less than astonishing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My Book Review for The Giver by ChristinaThe Giver is a science fiction book by Lois Lowry. It's a very intriguing book because it draws you in and you wonder why their life is like that and how it affects their world and why.The Giver is about a boy named Jonas in a certain kind of community; in our world we say we're eleven years old, but in Jonas's community they are called \\"elevens\\". At certain ages they get special things. For example, when they're a \\"nine\\", they get their own bike to ride and when they are a \\"twelve\\", they are assigned a job in the community. Jonas is assigned as the receiver. It's a very important job that is painful while fun to him.This book is one of Lowry's best. It takes on a really powerful perspective and it shows that someone else's life could be a whole lot different than ours. Gathering Blue (another book with a similar plot) is a good companion to The Giver, because the main characters know how to deal with challenges that come through their life. They show that even if their world is different, we could have similar problems. Maybe it's not the same, but maybe it's a lot alike.Overall, I hope that many more people read this book. It's not really popular and well known, but I think it would be a very good book to enjoy while you are in 4th grade-Adult, if you've read it when you were younger or older than these ages, it's fine as long as you enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is powerful for its demonstration that life without tension is not really life at all. We can always try to smooth over or hide another bump in the road, another cause of stress or discomfort. But, in doing so, we only deceive ourselves and take away from the most worthwhile part of existence. Without pain, loss, and difference, we can not have love, hope, and the vibrancy of life. This is a warning that we must be willing to risk our deepest selves to truly live."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book when I was 10 years old. I finished it in one day. Then I read it again...and again...and again. I treasure it to this day, and each time I pick it up, I am easily sucked back in. It is deep yet accessable, thought proviking...ugh, words cannot adequately describe how and why I love this book! With it, my adiction to reading began. I have loved many other books since, but The Giver holds a special place in my heart (and book shelf), and I will pass it down to my children some day."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Put simply, this is a fantastic book. Following the character of Jonas, Lois Lowry tells the story of a world in which difference has been obliterated, rudeness is obliterated, and everything is controlled. However, beneath this Stepford-like perfection lies the truth--in order for this utopia to continue, lies must be told and atrocities must take place behind closed doors, in the dark and silence. At the start of the book the reader has only a vague (though persistent) feeling of creepiness, though as the story continues this escalates into full revulsion. As I was reading, I could not help but be reminded of Ayn Rand's book, \\"Anthem\\" (those who enjoyed the Giver might find that they enjoy this book as well, and for similar reasons). This book reminds us of the importance of pain and joy, and reminds us that even though life might sometimes hurt, the goods are worth fighting for. From a philosophical standpoint, this book is beyond fantastic in its implications and the issues it raises--a must read. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was really surprised by how deep this book goes. This is another book I bought for my 6th grade guys who need the audio of the book to help them gain the comprehension of the story. I listened to it from my house to school (20 minute drive) and I didn't ever want to get out of my car!! The themes in this story are really moral and deep, kind of a bit much for younger students. This would be a good book for an older more experienced reader, even though the reading level is somewhat low, the tones and the morals in it are somewhat out there for the reading level. It will make you think."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a genuine piece of literary art influential to people of all ages and genders that I can see more in every time I read. In The Giver, a boy named Jonas is selected to recieve memories in a community without any. Jonas experiences pain and hardships like we do today, but with a much bigger picture. I would reccomend The Giver to anyone with a reasonable sized vocabulary and knows how to read. A child younger than fourth grade may not understand some concepts in the plot of The Giver, but any other age level no matter how old should understand and connect to the book's meaning. Lois Lowry did such an excceptional job writing The Giver, that even if the reader does not like science fiction, this book would be an exception. The Giver is almost so fictional, that the story has has a quality of being real life. THe Giver gives messages to its readers through significant characters, a constant reminder of the importance of relationships, and the importance of love in our lives. The Giver is my favorite book so far in my life. I have read hundereds of books by all types of authors, and various genres of books, but The Giver filled my heart and mind with positive thoughts and feelings. I can always count on The Giver to put a smile on my face or bring tears to my eyes.

I would suggest this book to anyone, guy or girl!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This review will not reiterate the plot of the book. There are many others posted that do that very well. In passing, though, the book was very reminiscent of a movie closer to my generation, called Logan's Run. My grandson recently turned 13, and we took him out for ice cream on his birthday. We asked him how his school work was going because for the past several years he has had many problems. Among other things, he bores easily, doesn't connect with the learning process, and some subjects just come hard for him, all led to his being held back a year.To my surprise, he proceeded to describe The Giver to me, verbalizing the story in such a way, and without giving away the crucial parts, that I was intrigued enough to read it myself. It was also apparent from his telling that he has made a connection to reading, thought about the implications of the story, and actually wants to read more books. Even though I am 61, the book is written so that it captured my attention as well as my grandson's. My husband will be reading it next.The author's treatment of serious subjects, such as sexuality, suicide, and social order, in my opinion, were not in the least way inappropriate or offensive for a teenager. These are, at least so far, still aspects of life that should not be repressed in literature. I highly recommend this book and am giving it to my other two teenaged grandchildren to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"***WARNING: CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS!***The year is unknown.

The man has scruffy long hair and a long beard, and has memories of the past.However, this community is not what it seems. Jonas' family has a baby boy they adopted named Gabriel. Gabe can not sleep at night. and because of this, he is determined to be \\"released\\", which is death by lethal injection. Jonas does not know what release is until he sees a video of it happening. Now it's up to Jonas to flee the community.This is an epic and disturbing book. Lowry tells the tale in a third person POV, and intricately does it the way it should be done. It creates a movie in your head... the whole time you're seeing the story happen as you read. Now this book is NOT for the faint of heart. There\`s no gore, but it does deal with some very disturbing subjects. People may find its dystopian depiction of society disturbing, but this is a brilliant social commentary of today's society.

It is only one of two books I've ordered in hardcover after reading it. I'm a children's book author and read a lot, and this is the first book for our book club that I have loved from cover to cover.

This was one of the first books that I was able to just fly through without putting it down or wanting to stop. Lois Lowery creates a utopian society in which the goal is create and sustain what they call \\"sameness\\". The society has Elders in which dictate how the citizens should live their lives, for example, they can't choose their spouses, they can't choose their own jobs, and there are a number of rules that they must memorize, live by, and when not obeyed 3 times, they are \\"Released\\".A boy that is coming of age, Jonas, discusses all the events that he remembers and is worried about for the upcoming Ceremony of Age as he turns Twelve. At this age, they receive their jobs for training and Jonas receives the job as The Receiver, who holds all the memories of the past generations and time before sameness. He learns from The Giver who is the old receiver of all the things that used to be, including that of emotions/feelings. He finds out that the pill that everyone takes in the community is a pill that helps suppress emotions like love to help contribute to the goal of perfection. This soon however creates a problem for Jonas and also finds out that the Ceremony of Release is that of murder; so therefore he and the baby his family took in flee to go beyond. The author shows this in an increasing intensity showing the extent of the human instinct of survival!Overall, this book allows the reader to come up with how the community led to their idea/goal of \\"sameness\\". Also, the ending isn't concrete allowing the reader to think further of what was going to happen! Also, it showed how the human race isn't designed for perfection and our society works the way it currently is, allowing emotions, because, without emotion, there is no happiness.By: Paige Wittmer"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What if your whole world was all the same with no differences. That's how Jonas world is. His whole world changes, when he becomes the Receiver. Jonas' story is very compelling because he has been given the most honorable task in the community. But he feels scared and nervous. The ending is very exciting because the author leaves the story open about what truly happens. This is a great book that you won't forget that you've read it. It is one of my favorite books because once you've read the first one you have to read the next two. I would strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was always one of my favorite books growing up. When I thought about it the other day, i knew I had to buy it.

I just ordered the second book in the trilogy too.My motivation for writing a review is that another reviewer commented that the Kindle version is flawed with a black page for the last page. I downloaded the book tonight and the current version seems to be fine. The last page is very dark and almost unreadable - but it is the back cover of the book, not the last page of the text. So fear not and order the Kindle version if that's what was holding you back!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book, The Giver, is a book about a so called \\"utopia\\". This book follows a boy names Jonas and his life. Once he is chosen to be the new reciever, he starts to get a clue why his world is the way it is. But The Giver and Jonas soon comprimise a plan that will go against everything that his community is for. Jonas recieves shocking news the night before he goes through with the plan and things taske a turn for the worst.Come take a ride with Jonas and see how utopias are. Lois Lowrey is showing a utopia in this book. But if you notice, it is actually showing how utopias are impossible because humans are all interested in different things and all like different things. This book is called: The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"At 12 years old, kids in the community, a \\"perfect\\" society free from pain, suffering, emotion, color, etc., are given their assignments to train for the jobs they will have for the rest of their lives. Jonas gets a special \\"honor\\" rather than an assignment. He is to be trained to hold all the memories from all time for the community and he soon learns just what the community members have had to sacrifice to live this \\"perfect\\" life.I can see this book staying with me for a long time. It was not only an excellent story, but it gives you a lot of things to think about. I think Lois Lowry did a great job writing this book in a way that the target age group can understand the issues brought about. I would have liked to know a little more at the end, but it was a great read nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i read this book for the first time when i was 7th or 8th grade, for school and found myself thinking about it later and reading it again as a college student, for fun. it is a wonderful book"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The shipping was amazingly fast.

They could have given us a little more detail about what happened to Jonas and Gabe.

I really didn't enjoy reading what I read because it'sabout the future with a perfect society. Why would someone want to live in thatkind of place? No competition, and you're assigned your future job, your child(s),and your spouse. How Pathetic. What's the point in life if everything has to beperfect. No wars? No memories? I'm glad to have my memories and I don't want toforget them. The only reason why I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 isbecause Lois did a good job on descibing the characters and what's going on. Ijust don't like the storyline. Now, her other book 'Number the Stars' was fantasticand I rate that a 5 because it's also based on true events. It definatelycreates mood in the story of sarrow and pain. But 'The Giver' shouldn't have recievedthat award. But that's just my opinion."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read this book for 9th grade APP english.

This book is called The Giver and it was written by Lois Lowery. The main characters of this novel are Jonas, Gabrial, Mom, Dad and the giver. The setting in this novel is in the community. The main conflict in the novel is that Jonas doesn't like that world cause it is so terrible. I think that the community is a dystopia because they try so hard to make it perfect but they make it a nightmare. I think that book is an ok book because it wasn't my type.- Duane Duncan"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A boy named Jonas gets a job called the Reciever of Memory.

I would recommend this book to people who are intrested in the futer.By:Philip"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I remember reading this book when I was younger and now that I recently re-read the book I like it even more! The whole premise behind the story is great and seems ideal until you get toward the end of the book. The whole series is actually quite brilliant and you need to read all three books to get a full sense of the world that Lowry builds. All in all, its a wonderful book and a classic story in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I love reading dystopian stories. Although they seem like paranormal stories in a sense, they also have this feeling of \\"My God, this could actually happen.\\" That's how I felt reading The Giver. I was surprised with how monotone the Community was, and as I read along and found out the people chose this life, it felt real to me in a sense. If this life was a possibility, I wouldn't be surprised that people would chose it: It's a life with no hurt or pain, no anger or sadness, nor any negative feelings/emotions of any kind. The sacrifice is that people also feel no happiness, love, or any positive emotions. That was the choice. To live in Sameness.Because this was a book club read, my head is chocked full of questions with half-answers, and debates about the book. We had a lot to talk about with this one. It's hard to give any examples without giving spoilers, so I apologize that I can't really explain. I will say that it is definitely a book that will get you thinking, if you allow yourself. If you really think about the world they live in, how they function on a day-to-day basis, and then how Jonas shown the \\"way things once had been\\" and has to take it all in stride, it will have you feeling some strong things.As for the characters themselves, I thought that Jonas and the Giver were deep, thorough characters, while the rest were all the same. Considering the fact that the Community's number one goal was Sameness, I have to say that the characters were written perfectly. Aside from the two main characters, there were maybe 1 or 2 other characters that I felt anything towards, and that was because of the way Jonas felt about them. Lois Lowry definitely did a good job writing her characters so that you felt what Jonas felt.Whether you have to read this for school in Grade 7 or choose to read it years later, The Giver is a great dystopian that will open your eyes to the way things might be if we finally break and are too afraid to be different."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm not even sure how to rate this book honestly. I loved it....until it ended and I was left feeling like there had to have been something I missed...or pages I didn't receive during my Kindle download. If you've read the book and you're thinking I'm just someone that doesn't like to interpret things or think behind the obvious meaning then you're wrong. I love anything that gets me thinking! I just felt like I was left hanging with this book.The book was written beautifully and it definitely surprises you from time to time. It's a great concept, no doubt. I just felt confused and frustrated with the ending. I was convinced, when I found out that there were more books to the series, that the next book would still be about Jonas, but it's not. I'd love to read the rest of the books in the quartet but I'm worried they will all end the same way. The ending was especially surprising given it's a young adult fiction book. I felt like it didn't bring home the necessary conclusion that a book should bring for a young adult fiction. Ultimately it reminded me of the Seinfeld series...great show that ended in an unexpected and, in my opinion, disappointing fashion."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is amazing! My daughter had read this first several years ago and had just finished it again. I took it on a trip with me to read it, after she told me how good it was. Well, I couldn't wait to get back from my trip to discuss it with her. It will definitely make you think about life, and will stay with you for a long time. I definitely recommend it for anyone!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking children's book I have read. An important book that forced you to think. It's best for children, but people of all ages can enjoy it. It really inspires people to think about their values and beliefs, and encourages people to question everything. A great gift for any intuitive or curious child, as well as adults. The only downfall: it's over much too soon! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"(Rant)I recall the first time I read this book. The year was 2001 and it was my sixth grade reading assignment. I remember reading the books description and just knowing I would hate it. The reason I can remember this book so clearly is because this was the year I learned about life. Through the events of September 11th and this book .This was the year I learned the world wasn't perfect, that bad things do happen. (Rant finished)\\"The giver\\" offers the reader a lot to consider, and digest. What seems like a perfect community slowly morphs into a nightmare. It is a unique and fascinating read that leaves you questioning all aspects of society today, and life. I think the book has an underlying message about history and how not to forget the past, and to learn from mistakes.I don't know if they still read this in schools, but I would highly recommend it. It would be a great novel to have discussions about.I'm now 22, a senior in college, and I still read this book every couple of years. It never gets old, if anything I understand something new everytime.Over the years I have read hundreds of books, yet I still think this was the book that changed my mid about reading.Characters: 5/5Writing/error: 5/5Plot: 5/5Ending: 5/5"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I wonder why utopias are so frightening.Jonas has a childhood many people would wish for. He has structure, order, purpose, affection. He is never hungry or frightened. He knows his place in the world, and he is content with it. Then, as he turns 12, he is selected for a special job, one that destroys his world by making him look deeper into it, to understand why it happens the way it does, what the moral cost of his comfort is.I should have read this book years ago. My mom finally gave up and bought it for my Kindle because we were talking about THE TERRORISTS OF IRUSTAN, and bounded societies.The Sameness reminded me of the dys/utopia in Madeline L'Engle's A WRINKLE IN TIME, where all the children bounce balls at the same time, and all the mothers call the children in at the same time. There is obviously this thread of fear and horror in both books about being required to be regimented, or pay a terrible price. I wonder if it's a coincidence that THE GIVER and WRINKLE IN TIME were written by women at a time when women were fighting to get out of the regimented and nicey-nicey world. To go on one's own, beyond the boundaries of civilization and rules, is fearful and dangerous and you don't know how it's going to end, but sometimes you have to head for the woods, or the giant throbbing brain, whichever is relevant. Interestingly, Lowry's character, Jonas, is male, and I would perhaps have found the story less interesting if he were female, because the choice he made might be considered traditionally feminine. The gender roles were actually pretty interesting through the whole book.I thought the characters were sketched in lightly, but the plot and problem were compelling, and it almost makes sense that personality was not something Jonas thought a lot about. Lowry did a great job of capturing the incuriousity some children have about adult things.Read if: You want to think about what you are used to and the value or lack thereof in compliance and equality.Skip if: You are horrified by utopias, your issues are not about fear of being the same."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"hi i am 11yrs old and i read this in two days thats how interesting and awesome this book is i could totaly see a tv go on while reading this book.

The plot, setting, and charactors are all very interesting. The story keeps you interested, I couldnt put it down. I must have read it in two sittings. The best thing about the book is that it really makes you think. Anyone who hasn't read it, go out and read it. It's a good book for people of all ages and trust me you won't mind reading it. I am a very picky person when it comes to books and I get bored easily by some stories. I was a little skeptical at first but after reading the first chapter I was interested. It's a little confusing in the beginning but stick with it because it all comes together. Check it out!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is very well written. It is a book about a young boy named Jonas who is picked to be next receiver of memories. The story tells about his life in a perfect world. It turns out NOT to be very perfect after all.

Even my mom liked it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read The Giver when it came out in hard back, I was in the seventh grade and my teacher lent it to me. I had read many of Lois Lowry's books before, but I was completely unprepared for how wonderful this book was. When I finished I turned immediately to the first page and re-read it. I recieved my own copy as a present soon after, and I have read it more times than I can remember. This is a book for everyone. My mother and her reading group also read it and loved it.

Jonas lives in a community where everything is perfect, no color, no hate, no war, no love, no feelings, everything is the same. Jonas takes on an incredible duty, as well as honor, when he takes on the duty of being the Receiver of memory. He must bear all the burdens of the Community, so they can live a carefree, and ignorant life. When he chooses to change that, free himself, and save his brothers live, he must flee from the community. He leaves behind everyone that he loves, The giver, Asher, Fiona, and his family. He commits the ultimate sacrifice to do what he feels, and the giver feels is right. The end is very sad, almost a tear jerker."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is, by far, one of the best novels I have read in the eleven years I have had the ability to read. Jonas, a twelve year old boy, is trapped inside a society where no one experiences feelings, colours, or memories. The founders of this culture willingly gave up their right to individuality in order to create the &quot;perfect society.&quot; I myself value my own personal uniqueness far too much to ever let it go in favour or a dull life. The colours we see daily and take for granted would be replaced by varying hues of black, grey, and white, the only way we might be able to tell the difference between a ball and a table. This book might well serve a warning to present and future generations: don't sacrifice who you are simply so that everyone will be equal...because it isn't worth it. Not by a long shot."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Obvious to all of us our world is not the greatest.But who is to say Jonas' is?Despite the safety and security of a job and family there, there is no freedom.Everyone is trained like robots to do as there told.I think the reason this book is so popular among us all is because it brings a better lifestyle for most of us.this book is very well written and veryentertaining.

Each night we would approach the reading with great anticipation and each night end the reading with my son pleading for &quot;just one more chapter.&quot; We reacted to its provacatve ending so strongly that my whole family read the book to give an opinion. We all disagree in our interpretation, which causes the best thing a family can ask for--discussion about timeless human issues--courage, wisdom vs. knowledge, compassion, truth, emotion, etc. My son will read Siddhartha some day (when he is much older) and I'll bet that as he examines the West through Hesse's writing, he will also remember Jonas' painful and surprising journey into truth in The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Hello,my name is Kristy Okoren.

Everyone is assigned work at the age of twelve and Jonas is no different. But his work assignment certainly is. He's been selected to take on the most honored - and the most painful - assignment in the community. It is a work that no one else can do, except for the man who was selected for the work before Jonas - The Giver. He trains Jonas and prepares him to really understand and acquire the wisdom that comes from the work. Not only does Jonas remain brave and courageous throughout his training, but he goes beyond that and thinks of a way to try and save his community even if it thinks it doesn't need saving.Jonas' community has been developed into an isolated community devoid of free will and the people have been trained from infancy to accept it and to know no other way of life. Every December there is a ceremony held for each age group ages 1-12. Everyone in a given age group is given the same thing. For all the new children born that year they are assigned names; the eights are all given the same style jackets to signify their age group; the nines receive their bicycles; the tens have their hair cut in a particular style; the twelves are assigned their work. Everyone knows their place and the rules. Adults apply to be married and The Elders assign the partners. Those parents apply for children. They are allowed only one boy and one girl and those children are assigned to their parents during the ceremony where they are named. Dreams are scheduled for discussion in each family unit as a matter of course every morning. Feelings of the day are discussed at dinner. But soon Jonas learns that everything doesn't have to be this way.How would our real world change if everything was assigned and regulated? If no one was allowed free will, would we all be safer? What if we didn't know about free will - would our communities and societies be better? How long do you think a world like Jonas' would last?The Giver is a very popular book for children to read in schools and for good reason. We all do well to contemplate how we choose to act on our gift of free will.[...]"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is almost on a level with Plato's Republic. The difference is The Giver is more fun to read.Only a few of the characters have character! I really enjoy a story that reveals the secrets slowly & keeps the suspence until the end as The Giver does."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in English class and I loved it! This is such a good book! You should definetly think about reading it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is a young boy, roughly eleven years old, who lives in a world unlike our own. In Jonas's world there is no pain or suffering, no poverty, and no fighting. Also, in Jonas's world there is no choice or freedom, no love, and no sunshine. In Jonas's world everyone strives for sameness. Anything out of the ordinary is frowned upon by the elders.Up until the \\"Ceremony of Twelve\\" Jonas was just like every other Eleven in his community. He went to school, played with his friends, went to his volunteer hours afterwards, and on home to dinner with his family unit. However, the ceremony of twelve changes everything in Jonas's life. He is given his assignment, and he must then begin his studies on it. It is in his studies with The Giver that Jonas realizes that there are other ways to life than his own.The Giver is the first book in a trilogy written by Lois Lowry. It won the Newbery Medal in 1993. Lois Lowry (AKA Lois Ann Hammersberg) was first a photographer and journalist before becoming an author of children's books. She has written around thirty other children's novels including Number the Stars, which also won the Newbery Medal.At first, I didn't read The Giver myself. My eighth grade novels teacher read it to my class. I was mesmerized and truthfully a little scared by Jonas's world. Lowry does a wonderful job describing a community of sameness. Her descriptions of memories and color are vivid and lifelike. Jonas is such a relatable character that it makes it easy for a young person to imagine himself/herself in his position. The writing style is simple, yet poetic in the way she describes details. The story is also captivating and it keeps the reader wanting to come back to find out more about Jonas's fate and his community.After having not read the book in seven years, there were a few things that I was disappointed about. I wish Lowry would have given the book a true ending. I don't feel like there was much of an ending at all, and that she just didn't know where to go next so she ended it. After learning that it was a trilogy, I figured she picked his story up again in the next book. The next book in her series, Gathering Blue, is a different story altogether. However, Jonas's character does reappear in the third book of the trilogy, Messenger.I feel like the simplistic writing style is the only thing that makes this a children's book. The storyline is great, the writing is poetic, and there are many things that I took in as an adult reading it that I didn't catch the first time around as a younger person. This book is a wonderful example of fantasy fiction, and I think that anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction books, child, teen, or adult, would enjoy reading this novel. There is no other book, that I have read, that is like it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was moving, beautiful, and deep. The world reminded me a lot of Matched by Ally Condie. I'm glad I read it as an adult. It might have gone over my head if I'd read it in middle school. It was pretty deep and serious stuff. I'm still thinking about it. To be honest, I'm trying to figure out what happened at the end. It had a very high-brow literary feel to it, but it wasn't hard to read. Good literature has three things: first, excellent writing, second, lots and lots of feelings, and third, a nice, ambiguous ending. The Giver has all of this and more. As ambiguous as the ending was, it was still beautiful and I walked away from the book having a better appreciation for life in general."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an extremely well written book. My friends and family recommended it, so I decided to read it for my book project. I was pleasantly surprised because the book had such an interesting plot. One of my friends said it looked boring, but I told him to never judge a book by its cover!The protagonist, or main character, Jonas, is followed as he awaits the Ceremony of Twelve. Jonas lives in a standard family unit with his mother (a judge), his father (a \\"Nurturer\\") and his Seven (later becomes Eight) year old sister named Lily. Each person is part of an age group, but instead of calling them seven years old, for example, they would call them a Seven. Each aging ceremony, they get a new item, like a bicycle. When the day of the Ceremony of Twelve arrives, each of the Elevens is called up by their number, which corresponds to the order in which they were born, (Jonas is nineteen) and is given their Assignment. However, the Chief Elder skips Jonas' number and proceeds with twenty. After everyone has been given their Assignment, the Chief Elder calls up Jonas and apologizes for the confusion. It is revealed that Jonas has been selected to be the next Receiver of Memories. The Chief Elder reveals to him that training will involve physical pain that the community has never felt before. He is selected to be \\"Receiver of Memory\\" at the Ceremony of Twelve because of his unusual \\"Capacity to See-Beyond\\", which is the ability to see color), which the other people in the community cannot.After Jonas has been selected to be the Receiver of Memories, he is set aside to receive training through the Giver (who was the last Receiver of Memory), who becomes his teacher. Jonas telepathically receives memories of things eliminated from his world: violence, sadness, and loss, as well as true love, beauty, joy, adventure, animals, and family. Having knowledge of these complex and powerful concepts changes distinguishes Jonas from his friends and family, as well as making him more questioning towards his previously sheltered life, as he often discusses with the Giver. Eventually, Jonas attempts to seek to change in the community and return meaning to the world. He and the Giver plan on doing this by having Jonas leave the community, which would cause all of the memories he was given to be released to the rest of the people, allowing them to feel the powerful emotions that Jonas and the Giver feel. Eventually, Jonas asks the Giver if he ever thinks about his own release. This conversation leads to watching the release of a lighter child of a set of twin boys born that morning. Jonas watches in shock and horror as his father talks sweetly to the baby before giving the newborn a lethal injection, and then dumping the body down a garbage chute. It is also said by The Giver that the previous Receiver of Memory had applied for release, and had told them that she would prefer to inject herself, and this turned out to be the Giver's daughter.During the course of the novel, Jonas's family temporarily houses a baby named Gabriel, because he is unable to sleep throughout the night and disturbs the other babies in the \\"Nurturing Center\\". Jonas learns that unlike the other people in his community, Gabriel can receive memories from Jonas, which he uses to help calm the baby. Because Gabriel still cannot sleep through the night without crying after the extra year he was given to learn how to sleep soundly, he is now destined to be released. Jonas flees the community with Gabriel to save the baby's life. Also, he was given the instructions from the Giver to flee, and release all the memories that he had stored to the rest of the community. At first, the escape seemed successful, with all of the search planes finally giving up their search for Jonas. Soon, however, food runs out and they grow weak. Cold and hungry, Jonas and Gabriel begin to lose hope, but then remembering the memory of sunshine Jonas was given, he uses it and regains strength. Jonas begins to no longer care about himself, but only about Gabriel's safety; it is here that he feels happy as he remembers his parents and sister, his friends and The Giver. Jonas and Gabriel cross a snow-covered hill in the dark and find a sled on top, which Jonas remembers from the first memory he ever received. He and Gabriel board the sled and go down the hill where they seem to hear music coming from some houses.The ending is left on a cliffhanger, with Jonas depicted as experiencing symptoms of hypothermia. This leaves his and Gabriel's future unresolved. Many people today debate over whether Jonas died, or survived.In conclusion, the Giver is now my favorite book because of its amazing plot and the author's ability to describe an unreal society. I definitely recommended it to anybody grades 5 and up because the book can get a little mature at times and may scare young kids. Read the Giver as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Wonderful writing, great character development and an easy read. This book is full of surprises and I could't put it down. Thinking about giving it as Christmas presents for lots of friends."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's The Giver, is a wonderful book that describes an awful future where everything is the same due to \\"sameness\\". The main character Jonas is just an ordinary person of 11 until the ceremony of 12, then his whole life changes. I would totally recommend this book to someone whose an adult or at least very mature. This book makes you think and can touch you if you've experienced enough, i know it has for me. This book would get a 5 star rating from me, because it's that good, i hope you thoroughly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I must admit, I found that once I started this book, it was incredibly hard for me to put it down. Lois Lowry is such a good writer.The plot, I thought, was very interesting and unique. It's set in the future, in a world that is much different than what we know today. The memories that Jonas, the protagonist, must receive (as his job) are all things that we know of today. I found this interesting because it shares a view on what life could be like after many, many generations.Not only did I enjoy the plot, I also enjoyed the book as a well-written piece of literature. Imagery and other literary devices were used very well in this book, which I loved.I recommend this book if you're a fan of science fiction novels. It's an easy, fast read and I'm sure you'd enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I liked this book because I could relate to the main character. The words made clear images in my mind.

So, I warn you, that it really is up to you to decide if you like it or not.

I loved it when I read it in 5th grade, and I still adore it, 3 years later (unlike the Chronicles of Narnia or A Wrinkle in Time). The Giver is a very intriuging book about a utopia where people are accustomed to a certain world, and &quot;programmed&quot; into their emotionless way of life. And when the main character, Jonas, is selected to become the very honored Reciever or Memory of the community, his world suddenly changes. This book brought up a very interesting conversation in my class about what is and what isn't a utopia (perfect world), where the limits are, and how close our world is to becoming one. The Giver really gets people of all ages to think about and compare our freedom and emotions to those of the people in Jonas' world. This book is more of a juvenile book, and I also HIGHLY recommend Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell to any more mature reader who enjoyed The Giver. Like The Giver, 1984 is about a unique thinker in a programmed world, though it is a much more political book, about dictatorship and power, and abuse of power. 1984 and The Giver are EXCELENT reads, that WON'T let you down!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed the book! I hope that more people would read this book and see how this possibility could become reality. What a great book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It starts out strange and ends even stranger. I read this book for school and did those comp. ?'s to go with it which made it much more understandable. It makes you think about this &quot;community&quot; and the freakish lives of the characters and how much our society differs from it. The cover is a real turn off but the saying for once in mu life was true. Read this book!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book. It was marvelous with great text and characters. You get swept up in the story about Jonas and Gabriel and The Giver. It's very powerful and to me it is one of the best books ever written. You've probably heard all about it. And everyone should at some point get a taste of this book. It's one of the best. Lois Lowry is a great author with powerful writing for I also enjoyed Number The Stars!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is a real heart graber. It makes you think in ways that you never have before. After reading The Giver, you will never think the same again!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a book which I use in my high school and middle school reading classes. It is easy to read and it deals with the leaders of a futuristic society that try to make a better society for their people through the loss of freedoms and increased controls. Jonas finds that this order of control does not work for him and he tries to leave."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think this book must be read by all! Louis Lowry has become one of my best writers. This science-fiction story has meaning, unlike most books today. I first read this as a class book and couldn't put it down. One night I even sneaked out of my bedroom to read the book! I do like thinking about what I've read, but the ending isn't self-explanatory.Ronal Abraham, Muscat, Oman"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is unquestionably one of the best books that I have ever read. I read it as a seventh grader and I am now in tenth. Every year the book gains new meaning for me. The Giver was very contraversial when we read it but that is the whole point of this book. It causes us to ask some very tough questions that may take a long time to answer."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a &quot;NICE&quot; book, but there were TOO many questions that left you hanging. I think that I would have liked it a little bit more if there was an ending to the story. I can understand why the author, Lois Lowry, didn't though. I think that the reason this book was written was to let us know that we don't appreciate love and warmth that we have every day seriously enough. Jonas didn't know any of this until he was given the memory of this. I think that we all take seeing color, hearing music and birds sing, the animals, the mountains, the oceans, and love that we have in our families for granted."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is 1984 for young readers.Lois Lowery gives a comprehensive description of the life that Jonas leads. It allows young adults to question our society's strengths and weaknesses! EXCELENT!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's novel, The Giver, plants readers inside a utopian (or dystopian?) society that is difficult to comprehend. Jonas's job as Receiver of Memories shows the young man everything his community has given up in order to be free from pain and differences. Realizing that so much joy was sacrificed along with the pain, Jonas and the Giver of Memories collaborate to bring real emotions back to the community. This book really made me grateful that I have agency and can make my own decisions, and it also made me thankful for real feelings of happiness -- things we really take for granted."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This a great book full of feeling and emotian. The charectors are well described and the plot is really good. The only part that's differant is its bizzare ending. This is a well written book and it's a great book for young adults"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think I enjoyed this book, because I could relate to the main charactor. His want for understanding the giver, and what really happened around him. At first, he was scared and didn't think he had the 'magic' within him. I highy recommend this book for it's wonderful discribtion, understanding of the world, and interesting happenings. You never really know what's going to happen next. Therefore it is sooo hard to put down. Even as the novel ends, you'd wander what happened to him. I love a good book that 'changes' your theory of the world and it's people."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I rented the audiocassette to take on an 8 hour car trip. My husband and 11 year old son complained about having to listen to it--but were both saddened when it came to an end and wanted explanations! My 13 year old daughter and I loved it. I was so touched by Jonas strength and compassion for Gabe and I was so impressed by the ending of this story. I like it when the author leaves part of the story for the reader to figure out and think about. It is a sign of a good book if you have to actually go inside yourself for some of the answers.I thought about this book for days and was thorougly impressed with this newberry award winner."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As a book that most students are required to read around the eight grade, I wasn't sure if I would enjoy reading it again as a senior. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that this book has a catching storyline and characters that keep your attention. It is an easy read but also makes you think, which can be difficult to find in most school assigned books. I would recommend this book for free reading, and am glad I was assigned to read it again. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"must book ever i read this for a book group my friends and i thought the community was full of cannoballs . best series ever"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This has to be the creepiest young adult book I've ever read. Reminiscent of books like Brave New World, Anthem and 1984, it is set in a fictional future world in which \\"Sameness\\" is the order of the day, even to the point where color has been leached from the world. All choice is removed from society and everything is rigidly controlled by a group called the Elders -- clothes, appearance, occupation, family relationships, breeding -- and no deviation is permitted. The main character is a boy named Jonas, who begins to question why his world functions as it does and whether doing so makes sense when he is given the highly unusual occupation of Receiver of Memories, pursuant to which he becomes one of only two people in his entire community with knowledge and awareness of how the world was in the past. This is a great book, chilly in its implications and shockingly easy to imagine."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, recipient of the 1994 Newberry Medal, and considered by the American Library Association as one of the \\"100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000\\".The book is about a teen boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect community, a community that is sheltered from the world. In this community everyone has a special job; a job the council appoints them. The day called the Ceremony of Twelve. Jonas is 11 and his day to get his job is coming soon. He has no idea what his job will be. At the ceremony, he is called last. At the end, he finds out he's chosen to be the Receiver. The next day, Jonas meets his trainer, the old Receiver.Receivers \\"receive\\" memory from each other, and from generations of receivers past. With these memories, the Receiver gives advice to the council in making important decisions.Jonas is shocked by the memories, he feels and sees things he hasn't seen. He even feels pain, which he's never felt. He also learns of the startling truths in his community, which makes him want to escape, and he comes up with a plan to escape; a plan that could get him killed.The narration is told in third person. It will remind many readers of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and George Orwell's 1985 in the way that it deals with society, censorship, etc.Lowry uses simple language (unlike Fahrenheit 451) but it also could be the book's downfall if you like more expressive writers such as Michael Moorcock and Terry Brooks.The thing I enjoyed most about the book was the plot, especially when Jonas learns the dark secrets of what his community does behind everyone's back. I hope this book will give you the same suspense and chills as it gave me."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The CDs are great! Using them with struggling readers, makes my job a lot easier. The only downside is the packaging does not indicate which chapters are on each disk, so you have to figure out that part as you play them."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had seen this book on many lists these past few years and when I realized it was a dystopian-type novel I just had to add it to my YA-D2 Challenge. I cannot believe I have never read this before. It was a quick read as I was completely pulled into Jonas' world and kept flipping pages to see how this little society truly worked and what would happen.At first I was trying to pick out what I thought was happening in this utopian society, to figure out if it was truly people choosing to live without certain emotions and differences or if it were more like The Truamn Show. I just couldn't see living a life where everything was picked out for you from your family, your job, your food, how and when to express yourself. How can it be that everyone is content being exactly the same and not being an individual? Yes there are no wars, no issues about race or religion, but what about feeling things such as love and knowing true freedom? I absolutely loved how this book made you question everything.As we progress in the book and Jonas' is chosen to be the new Receiver for his chosen career path, we learn that only one person holds the memories and emotions of the collective population. Both the pleasure and pain of this job are depicted as The Giver transmits the memories to Jonas, which in turn makes Jonas question everything he is learning and everything he knows is true about his current community as a whole. I loved the passion that Jonas shows for the things he learns, his true compassion towards The Giver and his courage for being brave enough to be different from his peers.I would have to say the scene that hit me hardest was when Jonas asked his mother \\"Do you love me?\\", because he had just learned what love was that same day. And her reply, though correct for how their society has been raised, just crushes poor Jonas' little soul and shocked me. Her reply, \\"...you used a very generalized word, so meaningless that it's become almost bosolete.\\" And his thoughts about her reply were exactly what I thought after reading her comment: Meaningless? He had never before felt anything as meaningful as the memory [of love].Without giving away the story, I feel like Jonas is starting to make a change in his community, but we are left hanging at the end with no clear resolution. I suppose that we are left to draw our own conclusions about what truly happens. I did actually see that there are three books to this series that I didn't realize was actually a series in the first place. I will be on the lookout now for Gathering Blue and Messenger.I also read somewhere that it falls along the same lines of Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World, both of which I have not read. I must read these as well as they are based on utopian societies that feel they are offering the perfect communities for their people, yet are keeping them from enjoying the freedoms and passion in life as an individual."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Being an older reader, I found this book just by chance.
