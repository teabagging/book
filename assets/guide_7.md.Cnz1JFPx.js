For people who don't have a lot of background in Islamist politics, the first half is a hard read because the issues are extremely complicated. However, this is good place to start if you want to try to begin sorting the threads of religious and political Islam. For US citizens with even a modicum of political background, the rest is a piece of cake, and fascinating. Especially interesting is reading about how the Clinton administration was shackled and thwarted as it tried to accomplished some of its more humanitarian objectives. While I believe that Mamdani is not an apologist for 'suicide' bombings, some people are going to have difficulty with his explanation of this phenomenon, which he frames in light of Israeli aggression and compares to similar oppression and violent reactions in South Africa. In any case, it forced me to think of what drives this behavior, and how far humanity must be pushed to the wall in order to exhibit it. The final chapter is heart-wrenchingly poignant, and calls for a world-wide peace movement in the face of what the author believes to be one of the most volatile political scenarios in recorded history: the 'good vs. evil' standoff between the political Christian Right and militant political Islam, a standoff with no hope of negotiation or reconciliation - a fight to the finish resulting in total annihilation of the other."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"The book explodes the myth of the \`good' versus the \`bad' Muslim and renders baseless US claims that the war on terror is a war between good and evil, civilized and uncivilized peoples. Mamdani locates the origins of terror in American Cold War foreign policy and shows how Al Qaeda is a product of American efforts to \`contain' and \`rollback' communism. These efforts did not just produce \`Afghan jihad' with all the pernicious apparatuses for terror supplied by the CIA, it also created conditions for the movement to grow into an independent organization targeting the Soviet infiltration of Afghanistan and later directing its ire against Egypt, Saudi Arabia and yes, the US. But for Mamdani, terror is not simply an anti-American thing; rather, on many occasions American terror has had equally devastating consequences in Angola, Mozambique and Nicaragua. Reading this book leads you to understand whose definition of terror is in operation at the moment and why this definition receives lukewarm support in the international community. Mamdani knowledge of Islam in general and political Islam in particular is exceptional and his analysis of different strands of Islamic thought in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria is meticulously matched by his understanding of political processes in these countries. A must read book if you want to think outside the \`you are either with us or against us'box."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Mamdani, who is a professor of political science at Columbia, has written one of the best books on this topic. This book brings out issues that are often disregarded in the media. Mamdani provides a very clear and through analysis of the Islamic world and the origin of the modern tension between the U.S. and Muslim countries. I specifically liked his analysis of Reagan years. Overall, the book is well-written and all the claims in the book are supported with ample evidence."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"The blurb on the dust jacket says: &quot;a provocative and important book that will profoundly change our understanding both of Islamist politics and the way America is perceived in the world.&quot;This is probably true. The book presents a view of the Muslim world that is quite different from others such as Huntington's &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; which holds that the next big struggles between Muslims and the Christians will be the world's next big battlefield based on cultural differences. Mamdani sees the Muslim's current actions as an extension of the Cold War. (He grew up in Africa, among who's nations the US and the Soviet Union fought the war.) That he is probably right does not alter Huntington's view in my mind.I'd also like to see a chapter, maybe two, on the impact of oil on the crisis. Would 9/11 have happened if Iraq's invasion of Kuwait hadn't happened right over the oil we need to import?I further question some of his historical aspects. Mohammed was both a religious and military leader. (He was pretty good until he came up against one of the Greats - Genghis Kahn.) There seems to be to me more of an emphasis on uniting the two in the current Muslim thinking.I really like his closing statement: &quot;To win the fight against terrorism requires accepting that the world has changed, ... that to occupy foreig places will be expensive, in lives and money. America cannot occupy the world. It has to live in it."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Mr. Mamdani's book is a good read all through. His thesis is novel, arguments sound and conclusion is unbiased. His analysis of America's cold war policy of transition from containment to rollback is an eye-opener. Specially noteworthy is his observation of how covert operations undertaken during Reagan era in order to bypass obtaining funds from tax-payers' money through rampant act of aiding and abetting drug trafficking changed to Bush's approach of privatizing military with similar goal of keeping American people in dark regarding its imperial policy in Iraq and elsewhere. Also, his arguments showing parallel mind sets of imperial Europe and modern America regarding the practice of democratic despotism is laudable. European historians always argued in favor of colonizing &quot;lower&quot; races with the \`sacred' interest to civilise and enlighten them, the so called &quot;White men's burden&quot; (Rudyard Kippling) and that mass slaughter (genocide), mass starvation and plundering natural wealth and enslavement to feed industrial revolution in their home countries are but the \`collateral' damages. Similar \`collateral' damages inflicted on the Third world countries in the name of containment during cold war and globalisation following that era by America bears all the diagnostic features of imperial Europe. Finally, I share his frustration when he concludes by saying that whereas serious efforts are being made by the world at large to restrain the terrorism of Muslim origin, an absolute lack of similar efforts to check American and Israeli fundamentalism (the Judeo-Christian terrorism) gives a helpless feeling."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"First I must say this book is very well written and easy to read.The stated purpose of the author is to stimulate a deeper and more intelligent debate on how to tackle the problem of terrorism. To solve a problem, one needs to first understand it. The author explains why common presumptions often based on ignorance and racism should be dismissed since they are too simplistic and too inaccurate to provide a real understanding of the complex problem of radical political extremism. His thorough discussion of the various political and religious movements in the middle east (and in the US) helped me understand the various philosophies and alliances that have influenced politics in the middle east in the last few decades.In the second half of the book, Mamdani spends much time on the emergence of the jihadist movement in Afghanistan. He shows how an ideology that had gathered only marginal support since the 60's became so influencial as a result of the Russian invasion, and the involvement of Pakistan and the US. This section was very well written and very informative.Up to this point, I found the content of the book to be extremely enlightening and it indeed fulfilled its goal of stimulating a more intelligent debate on terrorism.When it came to discussing the post-9/11 period (namely, the US invasion of Iraq and Israel's policy in the occupied territories), I found more bias and partisan views than I found scholarly analysis. This disappointed me, it gave me the impression that the author finished the book in a hurry and just spoke with his heart instead of his mind... Instead of promoting rational debate, this section was more similar to the ridiculous partisan and self-interested debates we hear from our politicians!"},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"I was really excited to finally get a chance to read this book. It had been on my shelf for a while and I had heard quite a few good things about it. Sadly, it was not as good as I'd hoped.There are five chapters here. The first is more of a theoretical look at violence, terrorism, and religion. I found this chapter to be a bit difficult to digest. As a first chapter I don't think it really spoke to what the title of the book suggests, or to the rest of the book. There were a handful of mostly correct criticisms of people like Samuel Huntington and Bernard Lewis, but it didn't really talk about the roots of terror so much as it criticized the approach of others. This chapter simply felt like it didn't fit with the book.The second and third chapters were the best. These chapters really dealt with the subject matter in a meaningful way and demonstrated that the terrorism we face today is an outgrowth of Cold War policies. These policies may have helped the U.S. win the Cold War, but Mamdani clearly shows that they had far-reaching and unintended consequences.The fourth chapter was where I really started to be disappointed. Mamdani talks mostly about Iraq here. He correctly details all of the short-sighted and morally questionable things the U.S. did to Iraq during the Cold War (mostly the Iran-Iraq war period), but then he comes across as being clearly against the U.S. getting rid of Hussein in 2003. When you hear someone talk about all the bad things the U.S. did (and they're totally correct by the way), you'd think that that would lead a person to the conclusion that since we've done all these bad things, we now have a responsibility to get rid of the guy. Out of dislike or distrust of U.S. policies, are we to settle for leaving a dictator in place that we helped create and just say to hell with the Iraqi people? I've never been able to really wrap my head around this type of logic. I imagine that someone in Mamdani's position would never openly say that Hussein is a great leader or that he has any right to rule Iraq, but he offers no real alternative for dealing with the dictator.The biggest flaw that I found with chapter 4 was that Mamdani (whether intentionally or not) attributed a lot of behavior to the U.S. specifically. He talks about a disregard for international law and points a finger at the U.S. as if it was the only country that ever behaved this way. What Mamdani is describing is how powerful states act, not something special or unique to the U.S. The more powerful China and India become, make note of how their behavior will look like what the U.S. is doing now and this point will become clear.Chapter 5 serves as a conclusion that restates much of what was said earlier, save for a discussion of U.S./Israeli relations. It didn't really offer much in the sense of closure or recommendations (or at least not as much as I felt was warranted).Another thing that really bothered me about this book was the way Mamdani cited his sources. Instead of footnotes, he opts for endnotes. This isn't necessarily a problem, but he doesn't have any type of indicator in the text that demonstrates that something has been cited. If you look in the back you'll find page numbers and the last several words of the cited sentance. This makes it almost impossible to tell what's being cited. It's incredibly frustrating when you have no idea where the information is coming from and whether or not something is the author's or someone else's.To conclude, I had very high expectations for this book, and in my opinion it did not meet those expectations. Chapters 2 and 3 were very well written and get to the point of what the book title actually suggests, but the rest was either poorly executed or off the mark in my mind. It's hard to say who the target audience is here. For someone with a passing interest, this book seems a bit too dense; I don't think a novice would be able to read this book alone and come away with a good grasp of the material. On the other hand, for someone with a fair amount of experience in the subject, the book just doesn't seem to hold up."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Unfortunately, many Americans do not want to hear anything that criticizes the USA. If you prefer to keep you head in the sand and not learn a different perspective on history, please do not read this book.It is always important to keep an open mind and listen to others who view the world differently. Author Mamdani grew up in Africa, of Indian descent and teaches at Columbia University. In this book, he reviews the History of Islam & Politics, the Cold War, what has happened in Afghanistan and the current status of the \\"War on Terror\\".Americans are in a dangerous place right now - not physically, but politically. Much of the country is divided into \\"you're either with me, or against me\\" mentality. Many do not want to hear the truth, which is that the United States has made mistakes by supporting dictators, meddled in foreign affairs of governments and worst of all, have done so without a sound understanding of the people/regions we were trying to shape. The British too, made these mistakes and lost an Empire doing so.Will you always agree with the author? No. This is a very challenging book to read. It throws a lot of history at you, gives you a very different perspective of what you were taught in school and hear in the media today. But that makes it all the more important to read. In order to succeed in what we want to do, we have to understand the world, other religions and other perspectives as they are, not what we wish them to be."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"I thought this book offered an excellent depiction of the difference between most Muslims and the Muslims who have engaged in terrorism in recent years. I originally came by this book after reading a review by Jonathan Fantini, at the Collegiate Forum. His review offered an excellent critique of the book. If your looking for a short highlight of the book, capitalreader.com also has a very good version.I applaud Mahmood Mamdani on this excellent book."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"This book really opens up your eyes. Mamdani goes into extraordinary depth about why terrorism in its modern form has been created, and what the United States had to do with it. I don't think Mamdani is trying to defend terrorism or criminal acts at all; I think he's trying to provide rational backing to such acts, for the purpose of preventing a repeat twenty years down the road. Too often Americans play off muslims as crazy, primitive, unrational people who blow themselves up in the name of God, and their goal is simply to scare the masses. This is not true. Muslims and Middle Easterners in general are innately no different from anyone else, but they have unfortunately grown up in a part of the world that has been raped by the United States and colonial powers. Mamdani is trying to get us all to understand this grave history, so we can better understand the common Middle Easterner. If you walked into a High School classroom in the United States and asked how many students think that Middle Easterners still ride camels, your jaw would drop at the answer. We're simply ignorant of history, as a people, unless it makes us look good, and feel patriotic. The kind of proxy wars that Mamdani writes about are not written down in the common textbook, because it's something our government is not proud of. But we've got to look the truth in the face and start treating the Middle East the same way we treat ourselves. Any people, ragardless of race or religion, who have been used by the West to this extent would surely fight back for independence."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"I saw the cover and I grabbed it up without reading the back because I thought it would be about religion. Much to my surprise and delight, the book was a thorough account of America's foreign policy starting from Vietnam, Africa, South America, and then finally to Central Asia during what the author describes as the height of the Cold War: the American run, Muslim fought, Afghan war of the 1980s which was responsible for the recruitment and training of several current terrorists. Most notably, Bin Laden.I had never been exposed to this kind of information. I don't know if the author is being as factual as possible, but I do know that he worded his book quite well and that even with the undeniable bias of a Muslim man from Africa, I still found him very fair and analytical.Still, the way he describes how Americans like Oliver North engaged in proxy wars against the governments of many small nations, and how they funded these proxy wars with drug money... It's just so messed up that it has to be true. How the CIA wanted to 'bleed the Soviet white' by making the 1980s Afghan War 'their Vietnam.' How so many CIA trained and recruited veterans of the Afghan War are now on the FBI most wanted list. It's just....damn! That said, I think it's the perfect primer for someone just getting into non fictional books about U.S. foreign policy."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"When he tells us that the political sensibility of Western modernity \\"sees political violence as necessary to historical progress,\\" Mamdani reminds us of a fundamental flaw that should give us pause and elicit our individual and collective self-examination. When he tells us that this same sensibility \\"is not horrified by pervasive violence,\\" we should see ourselves as sharing in this same modern sensibility. And, in the same way that anticolonial violence was never merely \\"an irrational manifestation,\\" so we should see the rationality of contemporary terrorism as the political violence of \\"yesterday's victims.\\" Americans in particular need to learn, as Mamdani tells us, that this political violence has been sustained by American assertions of hegemony--a violence exercised by those who, as victims, have come to realize that the United States, as hegemon, \\"understands nothing but force.\\" Mamdani reminds us that we cannot understand the events of 9/11 without comprehending its connection to America's \\"brazen embrace\\" of political terror during the post-Vietnam Cold War era. I should think that we, as Americans, would be horrified, thereby, to realize that there is \\"growing common ground between the perpetrators of 9/11 and the official response to it called 'the war on terror.'\\" Mamdani's interpretive work is a must-read for anyone seeking a way beyond \\"a war to the finish.\\" Mamdani is a good teacher in our time in need of this teaching.

The author presents his case clearly and bluntly. However, it becomes obvious after only a few pages that the agenda is to shift attention from Muslims to the United States. Quickly the line of reasoning becomes stilted and strident - yet the language is still well crafted and the writing is masterful.Weaknesses start emerging only if one questions the assertions made by the author; i.e. The United States was defeated in Vietnam in 1975 (the US withdrew troops in 1973), Gerald Ford -on gaining the office of President- had never before been elected to any office of importance (election to the US Senate isn't important?). The list goes on and on and anyone interested in US history will quickly see multiple weaknesses and distortions in this book.What could have been a well written neutral observation ends up being a biased dig at the United States. I would have much preferred to have been presented with neutral facts and drawn my own conclusions than to have been presented with evidence and then told what to conclude. The United States may or may not be guilty of the accusations put forth in the book, but it is quite obvious that the author wants very much for the reader to decide that the United States is guilty."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"The author discusses the U.S. effort to overthrow Congo's leader Patrice Lumumba in 1960, because he was too independent. The West wouldn't help him suppress a rebellion in Katanga province sponsored by Belgian mining interests, so Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for aid. The U.S then had an excuse to get rid of him. Mamdani shows how the mercenaries the U.S. used to crush a Lumumbaist rebellion in Kivu province in 1964-65 committed horrible atrocities.. Then Lumumba's killer General Mobutu seized power and ravaged and looted the country with Western aid.The author notes that the U.S. and South African backed rebels in Angola,UNITA, were cited by Africas Watch as being behind the planting of the landmines that made Angola one of the amputee capitals of the world, laying siege to villages to starve civilians, kidnapping, and so on. This was another example of the U.S. opposing \\"ultra-nationalist regimes\\" that had to turn to the Cubans for aid. He shows how the U.S. encouraging of South Africa 's aggression against its neighbors undermined moderate tendencies in it and set back the end of apartheid. A State Department report concluded that the South African backed Renamo guerillas, which was supported by Bob Dole and the Heritage Foundation., were responsible for 95 percent of the atrocities in Mozambique's barbaric civil war. South Africa heavily invested in the U.S. media and Jerry Falwell.He discusses the libertarian tradition of Islam, i that allows for a participatory democratic and modernized \\"Itjihad\\" to interpret Sharia law. He shows how little jihad as \\"holy war\\" was part of the Islamic tradition before the Afghan war.He notes the U.S. began aiding the Mujahadeen at least six months before the Russians invaded. In March 1985, the immortal Reagan compared them, the Mujahadeen, to our founding fathers.. The CIA approved the Saudi selection of Bin Laden as leader of the \\"Arab Afghans\\" and gave him the contract to build the Khost tunnel complex. Training of trainers for Pakistan's mujahadeen camps took place in many bases in the U.S. The majority of U.S. aid went not to the most viable political and military Afghan groups but to Gullubdin Heckmatyar's Hizb-e-Islami.. Heckmatyar had during his younger days led mobs in throwing acid in the faces of women not wearing the veil. The CIA liked Heckmatyar's warriors because they were the most brutal. Pakistan's dictator General Zia and its ISI gave him control of Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan and he ruled them with murder and violence. He operated heroin factories just inside Pakistan, in Southern Helmand,. In 1988-89, Heckmatyar' and another Mujahadeen leader who enjoyed castrating landowners who refused to grow opium for him, fought the largest battle of the whole anti-Soviet war not against the Russians but each other for control of the opium growing and heroin processing business in the Helmand valley. Afghan war related CIA assets like Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and Ramzi Yousef went on to many infamies including the WTC bombing in 1993 (he notes the trouble that an FBI regional director got into for pointing this out). The CIA sponsored recruitment tours of the U.S. conducted by Sheikh Abdul Azzam, a founder of Hamas and Al Qaida. Today Pakistan produces 75 percent of the world's heroin., whereas before 1979 it produced almost none.The DEA was instructed to ignore Pakistan's facilitation of the Mujahadeen heroin trade. The CIA Afghan operations head later said that the CIA should have to apologize for all this. The author should have noted that U.S. forces have recently been trying to assassinate Heckmatyar. The author goes over the previous CIA facilitation of the drug trade in France, Burma and Laos.The CIA worked with military officers from the fascist regime in Argentina and Israel in order to support the Contras in their early years, which were made up of right wing politicians and military officers formerly allied with the barbarian dictator Somoza, as even some U.S. funded Contra leaders like Arturo Cruz began to complain. Israel as proxy for the U.S. had supplied Somoza with 98 percent of his weapon in the last horrific months of his rule. Former CIA analyst David MCMichael testified that the U.S. hoped by Contra terror to provoke the Sandanistas to various atrocities to get ammunition to use against them.Mamdani quotes Oliver North's notebook and the infamous 1985 CIA training manual about how U.S. backed Contra terror hoped to destroy Nicaragua's economy and make the people of the country loose faith in the ability of the Sandinistas to provide security. The Notebook also quoted reports by North's aide Robert Owen of drug running by Contra leaders. The biggest evidence is provided by the 1998 report of CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz. Despite Hitz's denials to the contrary the fine print of Volume 2 of the report revealed the CIA had worked with 58 drug running Contra officials and allied with the powerful Caribbean drug lord, Alan Hyde. The report also revealed that CIA director William Casey had made a deal in 1982 with the Justice Dept. that allowed the CIA not to report any drug dealings by its non-official employees.He points out how the U.S. deliberately destroyed Iraq's infrastructure necessary for the maintenance of civilian life during Gulf War I, a war crime, then blocked Iraqi repairs of such things as water treatment plants on ridiculous grounds, causing horrible epidemics. It's use of depleted uranium weapons in 91' and 03 has killed hundreds of thousands of children and infected U.S. troops with \\"the Gulf War Syndrome.\\" The U.S., after Rumsfeld's 1983-84 visits with Saddam, massively helped Saddam get materials for his WMD arsenal, and protected his gassing of Kurds from UN scrutiny. The U.S. then kept Saddam in power after Gulf War I, as the author quotes Thomas Friedman of the NYT. He notes the Shendon PR firm, the facilitators of the bogus baby incubator story back in 1990 was placed on contract in early 2002 by Rumsfeld's OSI."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Labeled Good Muslim Bad Muslim and with an introductory chapter concerning the misconception between fundamental and political Islam in Western discourse, I ASSUMED this book would have something to do with that.

That we created terrorism. He lays out the many sins of the USA but fails to include other nations/peoples/leaders. It's one sided.He says _America was built on two monumental crimes: the genocide of the Native American and the enslavement of the African American. The tendency of official America is to memorialize other peoples' crimes and to forget its own - to seek a high moral ground as a pretext to ignore real issues._The Islamic world had not seen an armed Jihad for centuries. But now the CIA was determined to create one. The CIA created the Mujaheddin and Bin Laden.From what I read Muslims are imperialists, they are invaders, conquers, occupiers. They have been fighting off and on for 1,400 yrs. to bring the world under the thumb of islam. The Umayyad Caliphate became the 6th largest contiguous empire to ever exist. So,imho, yes the U.S.A. has done some inexcusable rotten things for the past 250 yrs. but so have the muslims and for much longer. The only conclusion one can come to is that the human race in general as a whole is BAD.Go to Wikipedia and type in the search box Islamic empire and you will see what I mean.Also read Rory Stewart's books \\"The Places In Between\\" and The Prince of the Marshes: And Other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq\\" to get a more on the ground feel for these muslims.Islam is a particularly vile religion, imo. Barbaric in its view and treatment of females; founded by a pedophile, that gave the nod to pedophilia in the form of pre-pubescent marriage. So, imho, that makes all followers of islam BAD. Period. There is no explaining away their founder, muhammad, with a nine y/o. He must of had a heck of a time inserting his penis into her (sorry for being gross but that's what it is). A moral virtuous man would not of been able to perform with a child. But muslims claim that the prophet muhammad is \\"the exemplar of virtue in human form.\\" Muslims are to look to muhammad as a living example of the right way to live. So there you go. They think sex with a 9 y/o is A-OK....virtuous even. Muhammad: a pedophile slave owner, skilled businessman, married into wealth with 11+ wives..... anyway by claiming islam you condone these and it's other evils. The fact that it has lasted and is fast growing only proves to me personally just how evil man can be.Mahammad soon turned to violence and terror (beheadings, assassinations...) to spread his islam. Seems allah conveniently kept sending mahammad revisions too all along the way. And these updates were always more intolerant and violent than the last. Always just what mahammad needed at the time to spur his believers into more violent acts. And in fact they spred and conquered Mesopotamia and Persia, Roman Syria and Roman Egypt.

The terms good and bad are quasi-official names for those who support and oppose American foreign policy, and therefore, they are political in nature. It is precisely in explaining the root of political concerns behind the labels that this book comes into its markets and readers. In spite of the author's ambiguity about the audience of this book and the fact that this book seems overwhelm with irrelevant materials, it is still worth reading as a political memoir of an intellectual with roots in the Muslim world and the benefit of a Harvard education, and with residences both in New York and in Kampala, Uganda. Mamdani mourns the fate of Muslims who are not only unable to find a way out of the shackles of modernity, but who are also unable to define their own identity and therefore have become the objects of others and defined as either bad or good. Muslims, unless they can prove that they are \`good,' are collectively assumed to be bad. Perhaps the enthusiasm to prove that not all Muslims are bad, Mamdani convinced to dig into the historical setting of the emergence of political Islam during the Cold War and the political sequences that shaped this era. By introducing all this information, Mamdani tries to explain to Muslims their current situations and the system of knowledge by which they are identified. More over the entire contents of this book reflects the need for Muslims to think critically, not just to echo or to condemn the labels of good or bad. Muslims in this sense also must be able to criticize their own situation today. In addition this book also reminds the American power elite that \\"the world has changed, that the old colonialism is no more and will not return,\\" and \\"that to occupy foreign places will be expensive, in lives and money\\" (260). Mamdani turns off his sermon by saying that America must learn how to live in the world and he forgets to remind the Islamists how to live in the world in peace with others."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Let's see.

And I've been reading articles about the \\"Columbia disaster.\\" No, not the space shuttle, but Columbia University in New York City and its infamous Middle East Studies department. The author is a member of this department at Columbia. He's a signatory of the notorious divestment (from Israel) petition. He's a defender of fellow Middle East studies department member Joseph Massad, who calls Israel \\"racist,\\" and claims that Zionism is antisemitic! He's spoken out in favor of a Truth and Reconciliation tribunal in Israel to help achieve peace there (analagous to truth and reconciliation in South Africa). On this final point, I agree with Mamdani. We need exactly that. We need to put the Arab racists in front of the world community and get a big apology from them as well as a guarantee to stop their aggression and antizionist slanders.

His book Good Muslims Bad Muslims discusses the root causes of Islamic terrorismThe author tries to make 3 points.1. It is wrong to blame Islam for terrorism because everything is the fault of the United States. The author argues thusly. He says if I hit you don't blame my culture, blame your self. You deserve to get hit. Rather you deserve to get hit if you are an American.2. He denies that a core belief of Islam, that every human being is a slave, has any effect on how Muslims and Islamic States tend to view free countries.3. He claims that Ronald Reagan invented terrorism and the concept of holy war. Terrorist acts occurred long before Ronald Reagan was born. No one person or group should be blamed for terrorism. There is even a justification of terrorism in the Koran. The Koran 8.12:\\" When your Lord revealed to the angels: I am with you, therefore make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.\\" The author also claims that Reagan's use of the term Evil Empire as a means of referring to the USSR was the first time religion was ever used to justify war. This claim is so absurd that any comment by me would be over kill.Of course everything that has ever happened has an effect on every thing else. Certainly the US has done some out right evil things in the Middle East which has played part in causing the rise of terrorism. However there have been three main forces pushing international terrorism. The Middle Eastern Dictatorships have encouraged terrorism as a means of diverting people from engaging in internal politics. The fact that Al Qaeda has yet to attack any member of the Saudi Royal Family shows that it is a handmaiden of the House of Saud. People, including Muslims and Islamists also fear change. They know it has corrosive influence on all of culture and they know where freedom will lead. Then there is the Academe. Professors tell their charges what to do, how to think, and what to think. As such it is natural that they support tyranny and fear freedom. So consciously or unconsciously they blame every evil that exists in the world on America and Americans and teach this view to their students. Is it any wonder those who believe what their teachers tell them to believe, think that it makes sense to attack America and kill Americans?"},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"I saw the author on C-Span's BookTV and thought that he seemed reasonable, rational, and knowledgeable. Upon reading his book, I found him to be knowledgeable about Islamic history, but confused on Islamic motives. He is neither reasonable nor rational. His book is very biased. He cannot conceal his hatred for America, Christians, Israel, Jews, and the West in general. His book is laced with Marxist \\"code words\\" to the extent that he is rendered totally not credible. He explains that the US supported the Muslims in Afghanistan and trained Muslims to fight the Russian Army in the 1980's, and that somehow that caused them to later become terrorists against their former allies. He puts forth many specious arguments. It is true that we trained them to fight against the Soviet Army, but we did not train them or send them out to terrorize non-combatants located in Moscow, Leningrad, or anywhere else in the world. He cannot make the argument that providing support for their struggle against the Russians, we corrupted the morals and the sense of right and wrong of all Muslims to the extent that they now don't know the difference between a Soviet Army invading Afghanistan and innocent citizens of the Western World. Does he want us to believe that Muslims have no free will? Are Muslims so malleable and gullible that they cannot distinguish between events that occurred a thousand years ago during the Crusades and the geo-politics of today? The author seems to want to make that argument. I don't buy any of it."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Let's see.

And I also read some articles about the \\"Columbia disaster.\\" No, not the space shuttle, but Columbia University in New York City and its infamous Middle East Studies department. The author is a member of this department at Columbia. He's a signatory of the notorious divestment (from Israel) petition. He's a defender of fellow Middle East studies department member Joseph Massad, who calls Israel \\"racist,\\" and claims that Zionism is antisemitic! He's spoken out in favor of a Truth and Reconciliation tribunal in Israel to help achieve peace there (analagous to truth and reconciliation in South Africa). On this final point, I agree with Mamdani. We need exactly that. We need to put the Arab racists in front of the world community and get a big apology from them as well as a guarantee to stop their aggression and antizionist slanders. Unfortunately, Mamdani would turn this around, put the victims on trial and make them apologize to the thugs.In an age where a small but significant number of Muslims are terrorists and terrorist supporters, it becomes important to separate the sheep from the goats.

The author would have you believe that terrorism is reactionary in nature. That at the heart of the situation is a legitimate conflict. Almost the entire of human history, ESPECIALLY the history of Islam, reveals that to be a lie. Islam, from its inception is one long pattern of murder, mayhem, rape, pillage and enslavement against people who did it no wrong. That is the POINT of the \\"religion\\". The terrorists are not extremists. They are good muslims doing exactly what their religion demands with the full support (in word and deed) of near 100% of the muslim community in all countries. They are doing what they are doing because they perceive the western world as weak and ripe for conquest and no other reason. Or, to put it another way, there is nothing we did to influence them to do this and nothing we can do (short of exterminating every last one of them) to get them to stop what they are doing. Any attempts to negotiate will be used as a method to kill us. At least, that is what has happened to every single culture that has dealt with this problem with Islam in this way throughout history. The only ones to survive are the ones that fought them and gave no quarter. And that is exactly what we must do.This is very difficult for the western mind to grasp but Islam is the cause of terrorism. Terrorism is its reason d'etre."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"There are many good Muslims. Unfortunately, the author, Mr. Mamdani is not one of them. He is one of those verbal terrorists who continues to blame America and Israel for his own disastrous failures and the inability of the Arab and Muslim world to get past the 15th century. The chapters on America and Israel's Genocidal activities are filled with such ridiculous points that any 9 year old could refute them.If you would like to read a pathetic comedy, this is the right book. However, it is more of a waste of good trees. Mahmood is just another leftist professor who continues to criticize and abuse the hand that feeds him, America. He is no different than the troubled child who abuses his wonderful parents, and his silly book proves it.Irwin N.

Additionally, the author would have you believe that the terriorism that exists today is the fault of the U.S and the protestants that make the U.S. their home. It would seem that the author alines himself with Osama Bin Laden and those who wish to control the middle east. It's hard for me to imagine that this man is a professor at Columbia University. Instead of wasting his time here, he needs to return to his own country for the purpose of educating his own people."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"This is an excellent book rooting terrorism in its political/historical context and contingencies. Apart from \\"culture talk\\" which obscures more than it reveals, Prof. Mamdani provides a coherent theory for the development of al-Qaeda. The story started when the U.S. government chose to win the war against Communism with whatever means necessary. The main method after Vietnam was proxy wars and covert operations. Why? Because their conduct could be hidden from vigilant Congressional oversight and public scrutiny. The result was not only complicity in illicit trade (because covert operations cannot be easily financed by public funds) , but also the support of vicious terrorist groups and organizations that deliberately targeted civilians to undermine the \\"nationalist\\" governments they were fighting and, hence, brought into question their ability to provide safety and security for the citizens and their property.Initially the U.S. government did not think of Islam as a challenger civilization. In fact Islam was perceived as anti-Communist and anti-nationalist. (Anti-nationlist before the Iranian revolution and the response to that was to back Iraq, despite its secular nationalism, because its brand of nationalism was sort of the lesser of the two evils.) Therefore, the Afghan Jihadis were wholeheartedly supported and even described as the moral equivalents of the Founding Fathers. The Jihadis were taught the state-of-the-art techniques of killing and destruction because they represented a tool to bleed the Soviet Union to death.From there one can start the story of al-Qaeda which is often presented as if al-Qaeda appeared out of the blue. Terrorists are made, not born. The analysis of Prof. Mamdani is somewhat reductionist as it fails to address the internal circumstances of Muslim societies. However, it is a great step toward understanding the foundations of the catastrophes we are witnessing today."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Here is a book that will show you what is important about scholarship: not facts, but how they are interpreted and put in the right context. In explaining the roots of \\"modern\\" terrorism, Mamdani's main thesis is an anti-thesis to Huntington \\"Clash of Civilization\\" which has dominated Western and especially American scholarship. He develops this by using almost exclusively, secondary sources. The book goes above the journalistic approach of most writers who are influenced by the superficial and ideological (good versus evil) analysis of most in the media.Throughout the book, Mamdani explains (as he has done it elsewhere as in When Victims Become Killers for example) that students of conflicts must learn how to put an emphasis on \\"political identities\\" and move away from the almost non-important cultural side of identities. This is important in understand conflicts and other political processes such as terrorism, but as in When Victims Become Killers, Mamdani fails to connect the political dimension of identity politics discourse to its underlying economic dimension. In essence, he overpoliticizes the events he discusses at the risk of forgetting economics and the global economic context in which those events occur. (May God protect us from the fear of being blanded \\"Marxists\\"?) For this failure, which is also prevalent in his When Victims Become Killers, I lower my score. But for his success in refuting the anti/a-historical culture and civilization-centered arguments in the discussion of terrorism and for his global perspective in his analysis, I am forgiving and give him a 4. Perhaps I should be a little more generous when I think about the book's scope. But at the same time, I am attempting to cure what I have come to identify as chronic absence in his analysis: economic analysis! The book could have been more important had Mamdani discussed deeper the dangers (or advantages if any) of political Islam. But to this he may answer that it wasn't his point. And I would agree with him because political Islam has been disscussed extensively (under different names) elsewhere.What an interdisciplinary son Africa has given to the world!His books should be required reading for all students interested in a global perspective of global conflicts. The so-called \\"Third World\\" students of \\"international\\" politics will find his intellectual ability very inspiring. He shows how American education (Mamdani is a Harvard educated scholar from those early times when American education was serious, but seriously ideological, too--but is it different today?) can be good to Africans, Asians and other \\"developing\\" area students.I recommend two more books from him, namely, Citizen and Subject and When Victims Become Killers (The first few chapters will be enough if you're not interested in learning about Mamdani's interpretation of the Rwandan history and genocide. It goes without saying that the later is perhaps the most important explanatory work you'll ever read on the Rwandan genocide despite its errors in facts!) for those who want to know where he comes from.Of course the book and (sadly) the author have been and will continue to be attacked by those who are not ready to move way from the non-sense idea or ideology of \\"American Exceptionalism\\" and \\"The City Upon a Hill\\" slogans. Perhaps a reading from John Dinges' The Condor Years and Stephen Kinzer's Overthrow will help refute those who are not yet convinced about the ideology behind the so-called goodness of America. Every good American patriot should learn that America cannot be helped by self-denial, self-congratulatory and crooked histories.Every student who attempts to understand violent human events has always been attacked. It is as if we, human beings, prefer to keep those events obscure and classified among the \\"irrational\\" actions that are \\"demonic\\" in nature. However, without an attempt to understand what such violent events mean in the history of humanity, humans are headed towards distinction. Let Mamdani's work be critiqued and criticized, but let's refrain from using \\"uncivilized\\" attack toward this intellectual.I highly recommend this book. It will revolutionize the way you study and more importantly the way you watch the news.Yours trully from the Greatest City in America,Student Forever"},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"This book is a well-documented &amp; footnoted description of the process which spawned Al Qaeda and the global Jihadist movement. It carefully and painstakingly describes the roots, ideological, financial &amp; social of Islamic Terrorism. Interestingly, most publications about these terror groups seem to assume that history ceases around 1988 or so. Mamdani shows how the period between the late 1970s and the late 1980s was the crucial period during which various players, including and in no small part directly resulting from the actions of, the United States. His discussions of the Reagan-era of &quot;Rollback&quot; in many countries culminating in Afghanistan and how the techniques used by proxy armies which were trained by the CIA is particularly thoughtful and well documented.It is interesting to read other user posts who accuse mamdani of ignoring certain aspects of conventional US armed forces, such as the desire to and laudable attempts at avoiding civilian casualties. Because this book is largely about wars which were financed by the United States but fought by entities which were not made up of United States troops, this critique is essentially not valid since the target of Mamdani's examination is not conventional US troops.There are a few examples of global al-jihad al-akbhar (&quot;Lesser Jihad&quot; or physical struggle, as opposed to &quot;Greater Jihad&quot; which is an internal personal struggle for purity and faith) which Mamdani does not address which run counter to his argument. For instance, the period of arab conquest directly following the death of the Prophet Mohammad in the 7th century AD as well as the Mughul conquest of much of the Indian subcontinent in the 16th century AD. Both of these are examples of Jihad-for-Conquest where the idea of a holy war was applied NOT within the context of a political struggle against modernity, communism, or the west. I would have liked to see mamdani address these earlier examples."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"As a British reader, it's fascinating to read all the reviews of this book which describe it as \\"biased\\". Having lived in the US for several months now, it is a constant source of astonishment to me how biased (pro-Israeli government) the US media is in covering the Israel-Palestine conflict.I'm not just talking about the European media: Haaretz (a respectable left-wing newspaper in Israel) has the following to say about operation 'Cast Lead': \\"Six months ago Israel asked and received a cease-fire from Hamas. It unilaterally violated it when it blew up a tunnel, while still asking Egypt to get the Islamic group to hold its fire.\\" (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-mitchell/attack-on-gaza-as-usual-u_b_153757.html). You would never read anything like this in the mainstream US media.So I find Mamdani's analysis to be pretty even handed and insightful. He has done the research to back up his thoroughgoing historical analysis of the conflict. I urge people to read this account to see how much of the rest of the world views the Israel-Palestine conflict and the rest of the US' 'interventions' in other nations over the past fifty years. Unlike many US citizens, the rest of the world has neither forgiven nor forgotten the US' actions, and as a Brit I know only too well that the actions of an imperial nation have consequences that last decades and affect untold millions.Mamdani's thesis is simply this: only by understanding the historic context of current events and acting accordingly can we create a world of peace and mutual respect."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"\\"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim\\" presents a set of historical facts that are seldom heard in the U.S about the nurturing relationship that U.S foreign policy has played in the development of Islamic terrorism. I thought the book did a reasonably good job of showing how U.S. conservatives like Ronald Reagan trained and funded jihadists from many nations so that they could \\"bleed\\" the Soviet troops occupying Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden, of course, was one of those terrorists.Mamdani conclusions on how to deal political Islamic terrorism seem valuable and correct.The book is flawed only in the style of writing used by the author. The first chapter on \\"culture talk\\" was hard to read because it gathered together too many \\"insider\\" opinions on Middle Eastern historians and their approaches to Islamic studies for most readers to follow. I quit the chapter half-way through and moved on to Chapter 2.Despite Chapter 1 and some other disconnectedness in the Mamdani's presentation and style, his ideas in the remainder of the book present valuable insights on the genesis and development of Islamic terrorism. The book is very much worth reading -- particularly by Americans who, in most cases, are in the dark of this subject."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"I think that this book, \\"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim\\" is one of the finest books that I have read on US foreign policy that has been written in the past 50 years. I am very impressed with the quality of the author's scholarship and the quality of his writing and the quality of the insights that he makes. I agree with reviewer Steele, this might well be Nobel winning material. The author makes one gaff in which he provides constructive criticism regarding a US satellite nation's atrocities and the tendency of America to not want to even acknowledge that nation's errors. There were several times where I read material for which I wanted a reference, but it was not provided. The references are summed up in a scholarly manner at the end. I give the topic an A+ and I give the quality of the writing an A. This is an excellent read and it is well worth the purchase price, new. It is one of those books that, if read, will change your outlook."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"I went back and forth on how many stars to give this book, and I finally decided on four, perhaps against my better judgement. The first chapter of the book was amazing and that chapter, for me, alone made the book worth the time. In this one chapter he was able to formalize a lot of ideas that had been swirling around in my head from the other books I have been reading. It was a great chapter dealing with US concepts of what Muslims are and how those concepts influence our actions but are really based on a flawed and one-sided perspective. A \\"good\\" Muslim is considered someone who supports US actions even though those very same actions could be detrimental for the \\"good\\" Muslim, while the \\"bad\\" Muslim is the one who defies the US. The problem with the concept of the \\"bad\\" Muslim is that it lumps all Muslims who disagree with US policy into one group, but the fact is that some of these people are not terrorists hell bent on destroying us but instead are people who have legitimate grievances with US policy. The first chapter was excellent.After the first chapter, though, the author flies off topic and never returns. Instead of following the first chapter's theme and the tile's theme the author spends the rest of the book critiquing US foreign policy of the last forty years. While a lot of the author's critique is legitimate and well detailed, it has nothing to do with the title of the book. The author doesn't even focus any of the remaining book on Muslims or Islam but instead focuses on US policy and only writes of Muslims in an ancillary way. Muslims and Islam is put on the periphery. This would be fine if the title of the book was \\"US Foreign Policy\\" but it isn't.The reason why I still give the book a good rating is that the information is good. This book is the first I have read that focuses on the CIA and US interventionist policies and carries that focus to its contemporary conclusion in this way. It's linear which gives the reader a clear picture of where we were and how we got here.At the same time the author treats US policy as if it operates in a vacuum and is not affected by other factors domestic and foreign. Of course it is difficult to take that broad of a picture and condense it into three hundred pages, but I still see this as a flaw.All in all I do recommend this book. A lot of the material will be rehash for those well versed in the history of US foreign policy, but the way the author connects the dots I found to be worth the effort. Also the copy I read the notes were not numbered or identified in any way in the text, so the note section was completely worthless for me. I am assuming this was a mistake in my copy and not something that every other copy had as well."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"This book is yet another chronicle, and by a Muslim author too, of one of the momentous crimes of the 20th century, now coming to fruition in the 21st: Of how the United States of America used the drug trade and the institution of a culture of mafia-style political corruption implemented in Pakistan and Afghanistan, combined with the revival of the inherent extreme and backward tendencies in doctrinaire Islam (whose influence was on the wane) to fashion it into a viable ideology - to use to combat the Soviet Union and bring it down. That objective has been accomplished, but the US has ended up with a nightmare of an enemy that is far more harmful exponentially than the Soviet \\"threat\\" ever could have been. Afghanistan lies trashed beyond repair, while Pakistan is well on the way to becoming one of the world's most dangerous failed states. The book is an excellent read, however I do not agree with the author's attempt to distinguish US created \\"political Islam\\" from \\"normal/everyday Islam\\"; the Americans just amplified and fuelled the abominable, rigid characteristics latent in the very corpus of Islam itself to turn it into a formidable Frankenstein. As a former Muslim having been brought up and still living here in the Islamic world, I know that not only scholastically, but also from personal experience! Any regional variations in Islamic culture that can be described as moderations are in fact just that, dilutions of the original doctrine by the local milieu, and not vice versa. I give this book a five star rating on account of its rendering of the chronicle of events, not the author's opinions."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Mamdani is a highly intelligent academic and a skilled writer, but as the book progresses, his analyses become increasingly more biased and at times non-sequitur. He portrays the current conflict between militant/political Islam and the West as though it is largely America's doing. In his view, since Vietnam, the United States' strategy of waging proxy wars ultimately begot the current wave of Islamic terror against the west. He also holds the west responsible for the plight of the Iraqi people under Saddam Hussein. While the US has been far from being an innocent by-stander in world affairs over the past three decades, Mamdani gives US military and diplomatic influence a bit too much credit--as though the rest of the world were a marionette doll simply going along with the United State's grand design for history. On the flip side, he does not go far enough in holding terrorists and rogue leaders to account, or even appreciate the autonomy of their participation in those conflicts in which the US has taken part. Nor does he acknowledge the nuances and complexities involved in international relations and diplomacy, the importance for any country to protect its interests, and the utter unpredictability of future events.This book is worth reading to get a better idea of how the United States has contributed to the current state of affairs, but it requires a discerning eye."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"This book is a watershed in post 9/11 analysis. I am surprised that it was even published given how radically it departs from the propaganda machine of the Washington elite and the corporate media. While many experts on terrorism, Islam, and US foreign policy have discussed the US role in creating the Mujahideen and Osama Bin Laden, no one as dared to make the bold break from conventional wisdom that 9/11 is really about US foreign policy interests vis a vis the Cold War. In reading some of the other critical reviews, no one has really pointed out the weakness of this book, besides merely attaching labels like \\"blame America first\\" or \\"Marxists\\" or Terrorist Sympathizer\\", etc.One of the most important contributions from Professor Mamdani is his notion of \\"Culture Talk\\" in which he takes on the intellectuals of the right who advocated the Iraq invasion and other unnecessary brutal wars against Muslim world, namely Lewis and Huntington. Mamdani, harkens back to an Edward Said critique of Lewis and Huntington. He strips away and exposes the inherent, bigoted, and racist perspective of Lewis and Huntington who under the guise of an intellectual exercise, argue that Islamic culture is so different from the West and therefore requires some action on the part of the United States and Europe to modify or alter existing Muslim societies.He then sets out the roots causes which ultimately led to the rise of terrorism most notably al-Qaida and Usama Bin Laden, which in his view cannot be extricated from the importance of US foreign policy in the Cold War. I think this is the strength of the book. While many apologists of a phony nationalist tendency post 9/11 America will dismiss this section as a \\"blame America first\\" policy, they will not be able to offer a contrary analysis or point to any material misrepresentations of the US role in Africa and the Muslim world during the Cold War. Instead, as extreme red state warriors, they merely retort with nationalistic screeds, defamation and demagogy.The last section was surprisingly bold and offered a different view of the cultural reason as to American support for Israel. Interestingly, Mamdani did not merely resort to the view of many critics of Israel that the Israeli lobby is to blame for the ability of Israel to literally get away with murder of Palestinians and Arabs without any repercussions. I found the notion of returning settlers as more acceptable to American sensibilities quite interesting, though I am not convinced entirely by his argument. Today, the rise of the Christian right as squelched any chance of American politicians and the corporate media offering some semblance of a balanced or even fair analysis of Israel.Finally, I offer two critiques of the book. I thought that Professor Mamdani could have provided more historical data and information about African history. For example, his discussion of Liberia and Sierre Leone with respect to the settler issue was completely new to me and required further background. Second, i did not like the end notes approach. I kept flipping back and forth from the text to the notes to see his sources. From a marketing perspective, it may be more appropriate to exclude footnotes. But from a reading perspective it was cumbersome. In totality, this book is an important and necessary contribution to understand the world in which we live in."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Pushing Ice (2005) is a standalone SF novel. In the far future, eighteen millennia from now, some descendents of the Terran species were trying to establish a suitable memorial for their political organization. Some suggested a fountain or other public work. Chromis Pasqueflower Bowerbird proposed sending messages to the Benefactor, wherever she might be, by scattering artifacts to all possible locations.In this novel, Bella Lind is Captain and manager of the Rockhopper, a comet chaser owned by Deepshaft Corporation. She has called a special meeting of her top staff to discuss a new assignment from corporate headquarters. The United Economic Entities has requested that the company send the ship to chase Janus.The former moon of Saturn has left orbit and is accelerating out of the system, Its trajectory indicates that it is heading toward Spica. Synthetic aperture images suggest the presence of a very large Structure in that system.Rockhopper is the only vessel capable to intersecting with the former moon. At the most, it would only have enough fuel to follow the moon for five days before decelerating and returning to the inner planets. The UEE is convinced that this effort could pay off big in new scientific paradigms.Svetlana Bardeghian is head of the engineering staff on the Rockhopper. She becomes suspicious about the fuel supply after noticing a glitch in the monitoring equipment. She checks the onboard message buffers and finds a discrepancy. Apparently Deepshaft is manipulating the data and lying to the Rockhopper crew about the available fuel.Svetlana takes this information to her boss, but Bella insists on checking back with headquarters. Naturally, the suits suggest that Svetlana has gone loopy and ask that the buffer data be rechecked. When that data confirms the earlier corporate statements, Bella puts Svetlana under house arrest.Then Janus changes its propulsive mode once it is far enough from the Solar System. Now it is using some sort of frameshift drive and dragging Rockhopper along in its slipstream. They are going to Spica unless they decelerate out of its frame.In this story, Bella begins to believe Svetlana and decides to tag along with Janus rather than risking the return attempt. Craig Schrope -- the new second in command -- leads a mutiny against Bella in order to return the ship to its owners. Then another crewmember turns the tables on the mutineers and restores Bella as commander.Janus is actually a large machine camouflaged as an ice moon. During its flight, the ice melts or falls away from the bow surface, exposing large machines, lava rivers and other inexplicable artifacts. The crew members land the Rockhopper in an excavated cradle on the ice at the stern and build a hamlet around it.Traveling at almost the speed of light, Janus will take about thirteen shipboard years to reach the Structure at Spica. Yet the moon doesn't decelerate when they get close. Instead, it builds a shell completely around the moon.Shortly after they should have reached the Structure, seismic sensors record a shock toward the stern of the moon. Afterward, alien things appear to many of the crew in the vicinity of the seismic event. Several searches of the area are made, but nothing is found until a lander overflies the area.A circular piece is discovered on the ice within a shallow crater. The thing seems to be inert. Searching the shell above the crater, they find a hole to the outside. Apparently someone, or something, has cut their way into the shell.This story tells of the factions on Janus and their efforts to survive. Some of the machinery is adapted to generate power, but strange things happen to people within the machinery. Although they make themselves comfortable, tension becomes a way of life.After the aliens arrive, the Rockhopper crew begins to learn more about their surroundings. The Fountainheads are not the only aliens within the Structure. Then Bella touches an ancient artifact and the image of Chromis Pasqueflower Bowerbird appears before her as a hallucination. Her worldview has to undergo another change.The tale is enthralling most of the time, but the emotional reactions of the crew can drive the reader to distraction. Several times I had to put down the book and do other activities for a while. It was well worth the reading, but it was aggravating at times.Recommended for Reynolds fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of the far future, alien cultures, and human politics.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I've read all of the books Reynolds has published under the Ace imprint, and this is definitely my least favorite. The central conflict feels contrived. In a number of ways, the faction fights among the Rockhopper crew seem like a lite version of the (not wildly convincing either) even more bitter, but quite a bit more meaningful fights among the Martians in Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars series. More frustratingly, a very important disagreement over objective facts is central to the story but, even though the facts should be knowable, they are never revealed. Still, Reynolds still compels compulsive reading even when he's not at his best. I recommend the book to all Reynolds fans, but those not familiar with his work should read the Revelation Space series before considering this one."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"This is a great hard sf book by alastair reynolds, author of the somewhat anti-climatic inhibitors series. seamless use of time-dilation, future history and super-advanced tech, along with his penchant for writing aliens, make this a must-read.only major flaw is the somewhat prolonged rivalry/issues between the two main female characters. as others have noted later in the novel it becomes less of a logical plot development and becomes more of a plot device to move certain events forward.in any event, worth a read in hardback, particularly at the amazon price."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"The over-arching plot of this book is excellent. It's exactly the sort of Big Idea fiction I expect from Alistair Reynolds, and I'm generally a big fan of his work. However, in this case the story plays second fiddle to a childish spat between two completely unsympathetic characters. I feel like I was supposed to put down this book and contemplate who the Spicans really were and what happened to them. Instead I found myself wondering how two women who were so consistently childish in their spiteful bickering managed to hold down adult jobs, let alone take turns as the fascist figureheads of humanity's last colony. Why were these idiots not deposed? Neither of them made good decisions except by accident, and both of them made huge glaring errors that any reasonable person would have avoided.It would be one thing if it was just a dumb and uninteresting book, but this is actually worse in a way - Reynolds has a great story to tell, but the price of hearing it is that you have to hang out with some intolerable bickering babies for 457 pages. I spent the whole book thinking how much better it could have been if the characters weren't jerks."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"This was a decent book by a great sci-fi author, Alastair Reynolds. Reynolds is one of my favorite sci-fi writers, one of those in the vanguard of re-defining space opera with his Revelation Space series. The RS series is vast, mind-blowing sci-fi, crammed with hard science and the social evolution of human society alongside new technologies. It is in my opinion as good as sci-fi gets. Pushing Ice is the second novel by Reynolds that is not part of the RS space opera. It bears his trademark hard science approach to science fiction and is a memorable tale of comet cowboys retasked to rendevous with an alien artifact exiting the solar system. The ice miners then \\"accidently\\" get sucked out of our solar system trapped in the wake of the alien, moon-sized, spacecraft.The story follows how the several hundred ice-miners, shut-off from earth space and essentially marooned on the equivalent of a deserted isle, must come to grips with each other, their permanent isolation, and the loss of everyone and everything they have ever known, while at the same time trying to forge a dicey and bleak existence. Friendships are tried, a mutiny ensues, and the nascent society is polarized into opposing camps with long-running enmities. Enmities which fester even through building a new society, first contact with alien society, and stunning revelations that the tiny band of humans must confront as they progress in space and time.While this is a good story and a worthy, enjoyable read, I cannot say that I enjoyed it as much as the RS series and I suspect there is one reason why. In the RS series Reynolds creates multiple technologies which foster multiple societies over many star systems. This is a vast canvas upon which to paint ideas, and create, create, create. In Pushing Ice we have a micro-society with extremely limited resources who have neither the human or scientific capital to create mind-blowing societies driven by mind-blowing technologies. The story here is driven inter-personal rivalries more than science and while this creates an interesting story, in the end it simply can't compare to the inspiring visions Reynolds creates which he sets his hand to macro space opera rather than micro science fiction.If you have read the RS series and need an enjoyable science fiction fix then treat yourself to this one. It's a good story, with the occasional gem, such as the slogan: \\"We push ice. It's what we do.\\" If you haven't read the RS series though do yourself a favor and start in on that one. As I said, it's as good as science fiction gets."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"It is rare I can read 3 scifi novels in a row and want to rate them all with 4 or 5 stars. Rainbows End by Vernor Vinge and Glasshouse by Charles Stross were two of my favorites this year. Pushing Ice is at that level too. Alastair Reynolds has definitely been the author to watch and to continue to watch and read in the future. He ability to tell an interesting and thought provoking tale has gotten better with time. This was one of those books I could not put down. You can read previous reviews and tell what the book is about, I just wanted to give it 5 stars because it is hard to find a great scifi book on the level of the old Arthur Clarke or Robert Heinlein novels but this qualifies. I hope it is nominated for some awards this year!"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"This is the first book by Alastair Reynolds I have read. I must say I was disappointed. The idea behind the book is interesting. But Reynolds' writing is pedestrian at best. The pacing is terrible. The characterizations are thin. The book drags for hundreds of pages, then falls apart in the last 50. It seems like the editor got nervous at the length and told AR to wrap it up quick-smart.I would read other books by AR if they were given to me, but I won't be buying any others."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"First contact is a sci-fi staple. You'd think that about a hundred years into the genre everything had already been squeezed out of it, but that doesn't stop people from trying. Reynolds's Pushing Ice is a first-contact novel set in the not-too-distant future. Humanity has spread out into the solar system but not beyond. The asteroid belt and other bodies are being economically exploited. This is done by \\"ice pushers,\\" crews taking on long-duration missions in the outer Solar System to mine asteroids. The best part of the novel is the social dynamics and politics of the crew as they fight to survive in unexpectedly hostile circumstances. We meet some strong, well-written characters, too. Unfortunately, and as so commonly happens in such stories, the deep-space, deep-time d&eacute;nouement is a bit of a let-down. Reynolds's universe is bleak and pessimistic, and the story doesn't sugar-coat it; his aliens aren't quite as well imagined as in his Revelation Space series either, and a lot of their alien super-science seems to be in place more for the special effects than for any story-related reason.Despite the weaknesses, Pushing Ice was an enjoyable and thought-provoking read, but not up to Reynolds's highest standards. I would recommend Revelation Space, Chasm City, The Prefect, or his latest, Blue Remembered Earth over this one."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"In Alastair Reynold's Pushing Ice, the crew of the comet-mining spacecraft Rockhopper are sent on a mission by their company to investigate Saturn's moon Janus. The reason for the investigation...Janus has mysteriously begun accelerating away from Saturn and appears headed out of the Solar System. Long range images show the layer of ice encircling the moon breaking away as it accelerates, revealing tantalizing glimpses of very alien machinery. As the crew of the Rockhopper approach the former moon, new details are discovered about the alien device, details that lead the crew of the Rockhopper to take a desperate gamble, a gamble that they hope will lead to answers about what the former moon actually is and who sent it...but it is most certainly a gamble that will irrevocably change the lives of everyone aboard the Rockhopper.Pushing Ice is quintessential Reynolds. Humans living in a future society encounter something that is intrinsically alien (some kind of structure, machinery, etc.)...but not just alien, alien that is far, far superior to our technological level. The Humans then spend the story trying to determine why the aliens abandoned it, or left it to be found, many millenia later.Despite (or perhaps because of) Reynolds' formula, I can't help but enjoy his tales. They are simply littered with clever ideas and remarkable technologies. Pushing ice is no exception. Janus is a mystery worthy of the characters Reynolds creates. You hurt when they hurt, you care about what they care about, but more to the essence of the story, you feel wronged when they are wronged...either by each other, or outside entities. Characters like this are definitely worth turning the pages for.The main issue I had with the novel was that it took way, way too long for the story to really get moving. After more than seventy-five pages you knew that Reynolds what still setting up his story, providing exposition and background...but the exposition and background just kept going, it was well past the first third of the story before the book really started to pick up and progress to a point where it felt like \\"things\\" were actually happening, and not just more backstory being given.Nonetheless, I can't help but enjoy reading Reynolds' tales. They are simply fraught with the stuff that makes science fiction worth reading...great characterizations and a plot that ties up well, but still leaves you wanting more."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"There are a number of reviews which address both the \\"sci\\" and the \\"fi\\" of the novel and many which explain the premise and progression of the story. So I'm going to be brief and add an observation I don't think has been brought to the evaluation of the book. Yes, it's space opera. Yes, it addresses the near and far distant future and yes it includes a number of interactions with aliens. Interactions I found to be fascinating and plausible.My point here is that all of these things are revealed through the evolution of the love/hate relationship of the two women who are the windows through which these events are viewed. It's the \\"war\\" not the tech or the aliens, or even the time in space that is the real vehicle for the story of the Rockhopper. Whose perspective is the right one? How are the other officers and crew supposed to decide who or what to believe and to choose? Who will ultimately prove to be \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" and how do you restart a society if what you've left behind may never be regained and you really have no idea what the future may hold? Oh..... and how far do you follow leaders who make decisions you question when it's the good of the whole group that is still really at stake?Speaking as a woman who has had deep and long-lasting friendships that have been greatly tested by time and events I can tell you that love and hate both come from depth of feeling and it's not always easy to determine if what's necessary is also what's right. Do you trust the Fountainheads because Bella does? Do you take a chance on the Musk Dogs because Svieta so completely mistrusts Bella's decision-making process? Because in the end, the crew had made choices about who they believed and the \\"who is good and who is bad\\" played out through those filters.First contact will be made by individuals who may be in that position for any number of reasons. For that matter, the whole of human history has played out on the backs of those who made the big decisions, those who carried them out and the ones who wrote about it later.For good or ill, at it's heart, Pushing Ice is about people and a series of life-altering events as they experienced them and I enjoyed it immensely.But that's also just my opinion and I won't be exiling anyone who disagrees!"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"_Pushing Ice_ by Alastair Reynolds is a riveting space opera with an epic scope to it, yet at the same time an excellent tale of an unimaginably isolated community of people.I don't know how much to reveal in a review of this book for fear of spoiling it for a future reader. The premise is that the (starting) year is 2057 and the ship _Rockhopper_ was operating in the cold, distant reaches of our solar system. The ship, led by Captain Bella Lind, has as its mission mining comets. One day it got a new mission, completely unlike any it had ever gotten before. It seemed one of Saturn's ice moons, Janus, was leaving its orbit and heading out of the solar system at high speed under its own power. No human was doing this, so clearly aliens were responsible. Aliens have not been discovered prior to this and humanity had yet to leave the solar system so this is a major event. Who are these beings, how are they doing this, and why? _Rockhopper's_ masters back on Earth order Captain Lind to investigate, as they are the only ship close enough to Janus to reach it and examine it.Bella acknowledged the order, but apparently a strong thread of democracy ran through her command or perhaps ships in general in this setting and a vote is taken. Though it is pretty close and there are definite factions on the ship who want to return home, ending an already lengthy mission, Lind got the majority of the crew's blessing to continue on after the Janus.However not everyone was happy and there were people, even among those who initially gave at least tentative support to the mission, who developed what they felt were legitimate reasons not to proceed. One of them was Lind's best friend, Svetlana Barseghian, who in her position on _Rockhopper_ was concerned that they didn't have enough fuel to reach Janus and then return safely to Earth or even rendezvous with another ship. Bella listened to her friend and investigated but felt that Svetlana was wrong while Svetlana began to feel she was being belittled and not listened to or respected. When Bella pointed out that the ship's data didn't back up Svetlana's assertions, Svetlana then said that the data had been tampered with to get the crew of _Rockhopper_ to believe the mission to be a safe one. Thus began a conflict that would have major repercussions throughout the rest of the novel. The ship fractioned once again, one side convinced that they did have the fuel to make the mission work and that the mission was a important one, perhaps the most important ever in human history, the other side believing that the mission was a death sentence, that they were being sent on a suicide mission by an uncaring corporation and government that only wanted the data - not them - to return home.Just to end my review right there might be enough, as the tension was well done and I really didn't know how it was going to turn out. I will say that the book's scope spans many years of life among the crew of _Rockhopper_, that following and studying Janus was just the beginning of an introduction to a future and a wider universe that the crew would never have imagined. Many years past during the course of the book, the narration picking up after multiyear gaps, telling through the actions and words of the characters and the story itself what had happened in the interim. Though many things change one constant does remain through the book, the great enmity between Bella and Svetlana, an enmity that had shaped all events in the course of the novel.I liked the book, it was enjoyable. While it was not one of my all-time favorite space operas it had a lot going for it. The characters felt real, the aliens when they are encountered are pretty alien, and there are many unanswered mysteries at the end, which one might possibly view at least a few as loose ends but to me felt more like the author was trying to give to the reader a sense of wonder and awe about the universe. Humanity seemed kind of small sometimes, alone with few friends in a cold, vast, alien, uncaring universe, and that the powerful technology of the future can also similarly be cold, uncaring, and dangerous to humanity, not out of any sense of maliciousness but because it is almost like a force of nature, that once a certain threshold is passed humanity is more at its whims than its master (reminding me of some of the themes in one of Reynolds' other works, _Century Rain_). It is a stand alone novel though I wouldn't mind exploring what happened next to the various characters."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I must admit that I worried after the wonders of Revelation Space, Redemption Ark, and Absolution Gap that Pushing Ice would be just another novel riding off of the author's original fame. I was greatly happy to find that this was not the case.Pushing Ice is the story of a crew sent in desperation to follow a rouge planet as far as their fuel could take them. But everything they have been told, as well as everything they may think, is wrong. Throughout the ages that pass friendships are tested, enemies made, and a future scraped out on the ice. But, more than a wonderfully realistic and enveloping space opera, Reynolds provides a human drama that propels the crew of the spaceship Rockhopper into its inevitable destiny..."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"In \\"Pushing Ice,\\" Mr. Reynolds once again starts out with a classic sci-fi plot--a team of explorers sent on a new mission to explore a runaway moon of Saturn--and layer by layer turns it into fascinating speculation on future tech that ends with the highest possible tech--the kind that works exactly like magic.Along the way (and maybe that way is a bit too long) there's a first-contact story (complete with strange aliens indeed), accidents aboard the ship, a mutiny, and two great characters, the mission captain, Bella Lind, and her chief engineer, Svetlana Barseghian, who have a long-lasting love-hate relationship.Lind, the more cautious of the two, tends to be by the book, and to heed the caution signs. Barseghian, restless, claustrophic, stubborn (maybe you'll feel like you'd want to slap some sense into her if you ever met her), seems to like breaking the rules in order to right wrongs.Reynolds is great at taking genre cliches and turning them on their head. At the start, you're likely to feel superior and to think, \\"oh yeah--I know what's going to happen next.\\" But you won't.The plot resolves itself nicely, leaving only a few loose ends for a possible sequel, should the author care to write one. But that's hardly mandatory.Another great job by an always-fascinating author who's not afraid to challenge his readers."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I enjoyed this book, especially as it was on clearance. I didn't like some of the main character's motives, and some of the conflicts seemed manufactured, although I suppose I've never been rocketed away from home forever. I may read a few other of this author's books before I make a final decision on his quality. I suppose the most I can say is that this book left me ambivalent at best."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"For the first time in many a year I have read a book that makes you stop every chapter and go \\"Wow\\". Like the first time I read Childhood's End, or the first time I read Ringworld, or saw 2001 this book blew my mind over and over again.It has just about every SF concept going: Hard tech, relativity, quasi-time travel (2 different ways), love, betrayal, resurrection, First Contact, Second Contact and... a perfect throwaway nod to The Blues Brothers (think the scene before they meet ET's dad - no I'm not drunk).This is a book you will read over and over flicking back and forth as you try and graple with the ideas Reynolds bombards you with. All wrapped in a cloak of characters that are as real as you and me. Well you anyway.But... where's the sequel?"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"PUSHING ICE is a near-perfect science fiction space opera. Notice the operative words \\"near-perfect\\". My only complaints (small) are the title (mundane), the reference to contemporary themes, music & films (a common problem in sci-fi literature)and the sometimes confusing description of movement within structures (...\\"turning right down the gray encarpment was a low shiny mound veering outward, one arm leading to a low rampthat beneath a 3 km high dome with radiating swirls of paths that circled behind the second pathway.....\\") Alastair Reynolds has found his niche with this type of book and that is fortunate. There are not many tales this long that can hold your interest and retain suspense. Once again, the genius is the backflash (a common but commonly misused practice). In this case, the novel opens at a meeting of a Galactic Congress 18,000 years in the future. One politicians wants to honor the \\"Benefactor\\", an almoast mythical woman who somehow gave birth to a jump in technological progress. In fact they have her DNA and have recorded her voice which is played to the hushed gathering...\\"I'm Bella Lind...and you're watching CNN.\\" I was hooked.The story has been told and retold but Reynods is, if nothing else, a master storyteller and in his hands the saga becomes a new creature. A mining ship is ordered to follow Janus, a moon of Saturn that has suddenly departed from its orbit. Of course it is an alien vessel bound for a distant enormous tube-like structure (several solar systems could fit inside) that is divided into sections. The real story, as in all Reynold's novels, resides in the human relationships. Here, it is the story of two strong women - Bella, the captain and Svetlana, head engineer. Along the way there is a mutiny, end of friendship, murder, and First Contact.Each First Contact story approaches the idea from a different point of view and this is no exception. Like CONTACT, the galaxy is rife with intelligent life but the mystery is why they have not colonized the entire galaxy by now. Throwing a monkey wrench into the action is the politician mentioned in the prologue. She has pushed for the idea of sending an object back in time as a gift for the benefactor. Of course one is discovered and used....but that's enough - read the book.A+ for dialogue, characterization (particularly the minor ones that in many books appear and vanish), originality, story and resolution. Many times when male authors attempt a heroine, the result is not satisfactory but in this case, the author attempted not only one but two major heroines and the effort seemed flawless. Great Book."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"As other reviews mention, there are some problems with the SF nuts and bolts in this book. MacGyver could teach the protagonists a few lessons in EVA rescue techniques. But I found the problems to be minor distractions in an otherwise excellent story.Reynolds tried to do something pretty hard here: write a novel that has compelling main characters, plausible political intrigue, alien aliens, cool SF toys, a driving plotline, and biting social commentary. I think he pulled it off fairly well. The characters are very human, well rounded, never perfect, but never pointlessly evil. The politics are fairly complex and realistic for a hard SF novel, and keep you guessing a bit about what will happen next. I thought the aliens were pretty strange, but not *too* alien. The plot was a good page-turner and had a pretty solid ending for a British novel (but not quite the neatly and completely resolved wrapup typical of American stories). Overall, a very pleasant read, and a fun old-school hard SF yarn.As others mention, the tech and toys are a bit familiar, borrowed from Reynolds' own works and from those of other writers, but they're not the stars of this story. This is a book about people, how they (mis)treat each other, and how badly things go wrong when they start managing the truth and mistrusting each other as a result.(On a side note, I won't argue with Diogenes' comments, except to note that one of the main themes of the novel is the idea of \\"editing\\" and/or withholding the truth from others \\"for their own good\\", and the costs that such actions carry. I don't think that the protagonists or readers can be absolutely sure that there are no FTL ships in humanity's future; the provider of this information was a well-meaning \\"truth editor\\" like many others in the book, and may well have \\"forgotten\\" to mention that humanity moved beyond frameshift drives to true FTL--perhaps during a certain 4,000 year period.)"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Alastair Reynolds' PUSHING ICE deserves ongoing mention as a top pick, set in 2057 where humanity is making a living exploiting the solar system's riches - and telling of a nuclear-powered ship which makes its living mining comets.

Swift action and intrigue marks a story with many twists and turns.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"This is Reynolds's best storytelling yet. As a fan of hard science fiction, I've always immensely enjoyed his technological inventions, which this novel has to a somewhat lesser degree than in earlier works. The chief selling point of this novel: it has what is easily his most memorable storyline. It's a unique method (as far as I know) for humans to reach deep space. Also present here is a theme that runs through all of Reynolds's works: that our galaxy was once inhabited by beings far more advanced than us, but which have vanished, leaving behind powerful but incomprehensible artifacts. I hope this is the beginning of a series."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"The story is not a new one, its very similar to Arthur C. Clark's tales told in his \\"Rama\\" series. But it is well written and held my interest."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I was introduced to Reynolds through the \\"Revelation Space\\" series which I enjoyed greatly - though like many others I was more fond of the first two books in the series. I have read other Reynolds novels, and though I greatly admire his ideas, technology, and intricate plots - I must say that I never really care for his characters. It is not that they are not complex with well-defined motivations, I just don't like them - which sometimes makes it hard to turn the next page if you really are not rooting for the protagonist.\\"Pushing Ice\\" was they first of Reynolds novels where I really enjoyed and came to root for the players in the drama. It was actually a little tough to get moving for me from the outset, but by the time it comes around to the 3rd act, it is a wonderful, mind-bending read that stayed with me long after I had put the book down."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Reynolds has come up with an interesting idea of how alien races might actually make contact with each other in a universe whereintelligence is rare. This is hard science fiction, not seen much these days. No flashy warp drives. No aleins that look and thinklike humans. And as you would expect in the real world, difficult for humans to understand intelligent critters and machines thatare a couple of million years more advanced than they are.Matter of fact in some ways the aleins are more believeable than many of the human characters in the book. That and the fact thatthe story seems to ramble on in some places and then jump 10 or 20 years in others is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.While the characters and writing might have been a bit better, the basic story is fairly original. Or at least a freash take ona very old theme. I give Reynolds a lot of credit for that. And for doing it without taking too many liberties with the realphysical universe."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Unlike most of his space opera novels, Pushing Ice is set in a different universe than the one of the Inhibitors. This gives Reynolds the freedom of a new history and new ideas, but he keeps the high speed but not FTL travel that is a hallmark of much of his space opera.The story begins as a frame story set some thousands of years in the future, on a distant planet. The polity gathered there have done so to honor the person they consider responsible for the existence of their civilization and progress, and a debate is to be had on just what is to be done to honor her.The story then cuts back to that founder's story, in the 21st century solar system. Bella Lind operates the Rockhopper, a ship designed to mine comets for ice in the outer solar system. Its not the easiest work and job out there. And when the Saturnian moon Janus suddenly starts acting more like a high speed alien spacecraft than a moon, the Rockhopper is dispatched to try and rendevous with it before the moon leaves the solar system. However, events conspire so that the Rockhopper is caught and trapped in the moon's wake, for a long journey in store to the star Spica...Interesting and plausible factions aboard the rockhopper. Neat use of technology of medium-term human, far-future human, and alien technology. There are even multiple BDO (Big Dumb Objects), with Janus, and the strange complex at Spica that the moon speeds toward. It's a classic space opera part with 21st century sensibilities, and Reynolds works hard to make it work.Sure, his characterization skills aren't as strong as some authors, but Reynolds doesn't make them into complete cardboard cutouts--characters simply aren't his forte. (I can sympathize, believe me!) Reynolds does much better when he is playing with technology and ideas than with the faction leaders Bella and Svetlana, but one must admit that if this novel was written 20 or 30 years ago, its dead certain that these two characters would have been unavoidably male. I don't think that, even then, the characterization would have improved. The female characters never feel like they are \\"men in drag\\".Still, sometimes for a F&SF; reader, nothing less than space opera will do, and despite its relatively shallow faults, I was thoroughly and completely entertained and satisfied with the journey of the Rockhopper and its crew in Pushing Ice. Fans of Reynolds will enjoy this novel. If you haven't tried any of his Inhibitor novels, Pushing Ice works very well as a standalone introduction to Reynolds work and style."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"The start-up to this book was great: seemingly unconnected prologue, tight pacing, good hard SF tech, and then Reynolds inserts a conflict between characters that escalates into improbability. Some of the extremes that the two main female protagonists go to so satisfy their vendetta toward each other often descend into clich&eacute;d misogynism. Personally, I expected something a little more refined or, at least, logical thinking from people who obviously must come from a structured and disciplined background need for deep space mining.In the end, Reynolds channels Clarke's Rama but the one thing that kept nagging at me was that in decades marooned on the alien artifact, the crew of the Rockhopper hadn't explored Janus a little more."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"There's a Douglas Adams story about a culture in which a book is a certain number of words, no fewer than that numerical target and no more.This reader has the decided impression that something like that idea was governing the author of 'Pushing Ice' - an otherwise brilliant SciFi story that i reccommend to every SciFi Fan! Be honest, even those who enjoy a good techno-thriller are advised to seriously consider this against the works of dale brown, steven coonts & tom clancy!For 90% of the book, the story is a compelling page-turner, the characters believeable and have depth, - the reader has the sense that you're right alongside, watching the events as they unfold!In other words -the first 90% is exemplary as the author's craft at his best.Then he goes and throws it away in the last ten percent by just 'giving up'. Did he write without having a clear ending in mind, or did he just get fed up with the project? Or does it show really really bad editing by his publisher?Whichever, it's really not important. The story IS important. It works on a multitide of levels and shuld be made into a movie. But with a more satisfying conclusion. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"As we all know, it's getting harder and harder to find decent SF out there among all the swords and dragons. I had almost resigned myself to the fact that I'd outgrown science fiction, but this book gave me new hope. I bought Pushing Ice almost reluctantly, expecting another tired version of Sphere or Eon or Ringworld even, where the plot boils down to a group of adventurers ooh-ing and aah-ing as they wander aimlessly through an inconceivably immense and inscrutable alien artifact to no ultimate purpose whatsoever.Was I ever wrong. This book could have come right out of the Golden Age of Science Fiction -- right up there with the Foundation Trilogy. It's a bit hard to get into: it doesn't really get going until about a third of the way through, but it's absolutely worth it. Also, the author made a major artistic error when he gave away a major element of the plot in the Prologue -- my advice to a future reader is to skip it and read it with the Epilogue at the end.In short -- buy this book and rediscover what Science Fiction can be."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"The story starts off in the not too distant future with the crew of a ship that mines comets. When the Saturnian moon, Janus, suddenly pulls out of orbit around Saturn and starts heading for interstellar space it is apparent that it is not a moon at all but a long dormant alien artifact. The mining crew are the only ones in a position to try and intercept the fleeing ship and getting some sort of answers.There is a problem. Fuel is tight but the business consortium back home assures them that there is enough and that a rescue operation will be mounted. The company wants them to make the trip no matter what because their belief that the information beamed back will make them all rich. They are so greedy that they are willing to lie and sacrifice the crew making the trip: there is not enough fuel.The two main protagonists of the story are the captain and the chief engineer, both women, who are best friends. The engineer warns the captain that things are amiss and the captain is inclined to believe the company. This has tragic consequences. They cannot get back. Their only hope for survival is to try and hitch a ride on Janus and ride it to wherever it goes, tapping the \\"moon\\" itself for resources and energy. This causes a hateful rift between the two friends and polarizes the crew.Einsteinian time dilation enters the story in a big way here. When the moon gets to Spica, only a dozen years have passed for the crew but several hundred have passed back home. Everything familiar is long gone but the point is moot because the moon does not stop. It enters a gigantic artifact which captures it and further accelerates it. They have been caught in a \\"cosmic zoo\\" and not all of the other inhabitants are friendly. Worse, its hard to tell which ones are friendly.The added acceleration of their captivity leads to more time dilation. Its not clear how much except that it is A LOT. This becomes apparent when they do get some information from more than 18000 years into their own perceived future (and this proves to already be ancient).This is a story about personality struggles, alien contact and space travel but mostly it is a story about the vastness of space and time. It is well written and holds the interest but the epilog is unsatisfying and does not tie in well with the prolog. Still, it was a good read."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Once again, Alastair Reynolds shows us is ability to write stories able to renew our sense of wonder.His previuos stories in general and this one in particular have a scope which is often lacking in other authors.The momentum builds step by step, even if allowing for some respite form time to time, making the storyline more credible but still maintaining the general focus.The scope of the overall story is also magnified by the point of view of the narration, that of a small community with all its human, sometimes petty, interactions; this makes a nice contrast with the dramatic adventure they are living, something that would take away the breath of many but would also make every one dream about. It sometimes reminded me about Omero's Odissey, with a bunch of people thrown into something they didn't choose but that they go along with as best as they can.I also liked the way Alastair Reynolds takes relativity (which sincerely often sucks, giving you a sensation almost of \\"imprisonment\\" by the laws of phisics) and uses it to widen the time-scope of the story.Definitely a don't-miss if you like hard sf with some adventure added as a bonus; I can't wait for his next book."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"The writing was decent and given all the awards and recommendation this author has recieved, I gave this book a go.This book is similar to Arthur C. Clark's \\"Rama series\\". I liked the realism that the author managed to incorporate in the story line and characterization. UNfortunately, the author took a little too long getting to the good stuff, that is, the interaction between the humans and aliens and the main focus of the plot. There was also a bit of a lost opportunity in the way of conflicts between the protagonists and antagonists.In a nutshell, the author took too long setting things up then rushed through the climax and conflicts.Overall, I found this an okay read and will probably give the author another chance and read his next book."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Usually I write a review only if I dislike something about a book. I rarely bother to write good reviews, because every book gets so many of them. In this case, however, I have to make an exception. For any fan of hard science fiction, \\"Pushing Ice\\" is AWESOME! It's got everything: realistic characters, solid physics and astronomy, believable near-future society (circa 2050), glimpses of far future society (circa 20,000 A.D.), some REALLY far future, aliens which are somewhat comprehensible, aliens which are completely beyond comprehension, rivalry, broken friendships, betrayal, marooning in space (on multiple levels), struggle for survival, etc. Even asteroid mining and that perennial \\"stranded in space\\" trick - using electric motors as generators :)"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I am puzzled by the high ratings given this book. My last review of a Reynolds book was for Absolution Gap, and I speculated I might not ever read another of his books after that one. Where Absolution Gap had very little in the \\"middle\\" of the book, and even less at the end, Pushing Ice has substantial plot.I agree with the other reviewer stating that this is a story of a relationship between two women. However, it is also a commentary on the Fermi Paradox (etc), which is a common theme of Reynolds'.What I would say, and I hazard a guess here, is that Reynolds has done a lot of reading between his last book and this book. There are elements of Stephen Baxter (where else have you heard the concept of \\"non barionic life forms\\" but the Xeelee Sequence?) and Charles Stross. Neither of these are bad influences, as such, and I think that they helped Reynolds to become a better author.As such, I've given the book three stars. I was genuinely interested in the plot (that of Janus and where exactly he was going, figuratively speaking), but sorely, sorely disappointed by the anticlimactic, just plain boring end. It ended. Simply, with little fanfare or conflict. There wasn't much of a climax, or a point at which we knew an ending had to happen. It just ended.In that regard it is strikingly reminiscent of the ending of Absolution Gap. The reader is left holding the book thinking, \\"what? where's the ending?\\"Inasmuch as his writing *has* gotten better (hint: Reynolds: keep reading Baxter, RKM, and Stross), I'll pick up the next book. I considered this book a gamble, and it's about a wash. Nothing really gained, but then the book wasn't really inexcusably bad, either."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"It's true that one doesn't read Alastair Reynolds for deep characterization or profound emotional nuance. Those sorts of details simply aren't his forte. Indeed, he's just not very good at interpersonal relationships. There's a distinct lack of sophistication in his characters' motivations, and sometimes his dialogue is ham-fisted, cliched, trite or simply banal.But I still find myself rooting for his characters, rather than being too annoyed with them. I think it's because of what Reynolds is terribly, terribly good at -- the world-building and science and big ideas. Those parts are simply really, really good. And the good stuff is good enough to buffer me from what isn't. In fact, this is one of his better novels. Certainly better than the very mediocre Century Rain, which displayed some of his clunkiest dialogue and characterization ever.Recommended!"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"When I saw \\"Pushing Ice\\" in the bargain bin, I almost passed it up. I was not an Alistair Reynolds fan; the only novel I'd read had left me unimpressed. Still, for a few bucks, I gave it a shot. Am I ever glad that I did! \\"Pushing Ice\\" is a first-rate piece of science fiction, and I am now officially on the Reynolds bandwagon.The story follows the crew of the Rockhopper, a late 21st century comet-mining ship. On a routine mission, they are ordered to abandon operations and set a course to rendezvous with Janus, a moon of Saturn that has mysteriously broken orbit and begun accelerating toward the star Spica. The crew struggle against time and betrayal to reach the fleeing moon, now revealed to be an alien artifact of immense size and power. When the ship gets caught in Janus' spacetime wake, they face a life-or-death choice: do they make a desperate attempt to return home, or are they stuck riding Janus on its interstellar voyage? The rest of the book follows the group as they live through the consequences of their decision.\\"Pushing Ice\\" has a bit of everything for the sci fi fan. There is a near-future spacecraft with a plucky, likable crew. There is political intrigue and a fight to survive against the odds. There is an archaeological mystery to solve; and a bevy of cool, well-developed alien cultures. The characters have personality and depth, and the world is portrayed in enough detail to give it a gritty, lived-in feel.Though the plot seems a bit hokey at first, Reynolds makes it plausible by focusing on the concerns of the ship's crew. We follow events through the eyes of Bella and Svetlana, two headstrong women who wrestle for leadership of the group. The book is as much about their tortured relationship as it is about aliens and space travel. This provides the story with a human framework that makes the weird happenings on Janus somehow more believable.There were times where the action lulled, but overall, \\"Pushing Ice\\" is a balanced, well-crafted tale. The ending left many questions unanswered, and the world is rich enough for several sequels. I look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Reynolds continues to spin fine hard SF yarns - this one not set in his Revelation Space universe. Comet & asteroid miners are diverted from their task as one of Saturn's moons begins to exit the solar system. They are uniquely positioned to give chase, and the interstellar adventure begins. Credible character development and good science make this a must read for hard SF fans."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I picked this up on the strength of a short story I really enjoyed of Reynolds' in a \\"Best Sci Fi of the Year\\" compilation. The short story was so good that I'd even try reading another book of his even though I didn't like this one.Of course I'd recommend taking this with review with a grain of salt as I'll admit up front, I didn't make it all the way through the book. About 200 pages in I tucked the book into the seat pocket of the person in front of me and told my girlfriend that I was leaving the book on the plane. Otherwise, out of some weird affliction I have that won't let me abandon books unfinished no matter how bad they are, I might have wasted more time on it. There are a finite number of total hours in my entire life.Though it's not to say that the book was bad per sae. It's just completely unremarkable and heavy with tired sci fi clich&eacute;. There isn't an interesting character and the ones there are you've read about in other books if you've ever read sci fi before. The alien artifact premise of the story has been done and done better before as well. There are various attempts at twists and turns which really didn't grab my interest either.If you're interested in reading the same story only...you know...better. Try some Steven Baxter. Baxter, like Reynolds, can't write an interesting character either but the science and themes are so much more epic and interesting. Richard Morgan is another who has touched on the ancient alien artifact idea in a much more interesting way, though his style can turn off a lot of people.Either way, there's better stuff out there than this book. Perhaps even Reynolds other books, though I don't speak from personal knowledge there."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I really enjoy the science in science fiction, and believable characters. I have watched the movie Aliens many times and I have always wondered why you would pick really stupid people to go into space. Is there going to be a shortage of smart people in the future? Are we going to rely on a bunch of idiots to take us into the far reaches of space? Is mister Renolds watching too many soap operas on TV?"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I usually enjoy the thrill of grand space operas. No suspense in this one though. Everything was totally predictable. The conflict between Svetlana and Bella was tedious; the aliens were somehow uninspired. I enjoyed a couple of his other books, but this one was far too long and uneventful."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I found Pushing Ice an excellent tale, and further proof that for Alastair Reynolds there is definitely life after his Inhibitor novels. The crew of mining spacecraft Rockhopper find themselves embarking on an unexpected voyage of discovery, after Saturn's tiny moon Janus starts to behave very oddly. This has similarities with Clarke classic Rendezvous with Rama, with added corporate politics and interpersonal friction. Some characters remain relatively undeveloped, but most are convincing, as is the future technology, which is impressive but never infallible. Credible aliens and gigantic space structures help this novel to evoke a fine, old-fashioned sense of wonder."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"This is the second SF novel I've read written by Alastair Reynolds (the first wasRevelation Space). I've found both interesting, and I look forward to tracking down additional novels by Reynolds.In Pushing Ice, Reynolds develops unique situations, space cultures, and the correct mix of \\"Hard\\" and \\"soft\\" science fiction. The strangeness of Janus, mutiny in space, crime and punishment, the Fountainheads, Chromis... you should find all of these snippets interesting in themselves, but Reynolds weaves them into an entertaining yarn. I really couldn't wrap my mind around the \\"Musk Dogs\\" and their behaviors, but their description was not as significant as their actions.Entertaining SF! Enjoy."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"The very worst thing one can say about a hard science fiction story is that the hard science is WRONG! And of course I'm not talking about the NEW science, the OLD science is what's wrong. The entire novel hinges on that, so that's why it gets a low rating. This is ESPECIALLY troubling when the novel is written by an astronomer (as I happen to be a professional astronomer myself). Here's the simplest example: the novel hinges on humans arriving at a far destination after traveling at effectively the speed of light for 13 subjective years. Given time dilation, that subjective time can be very, very much larger in the \\"rest\\" frame of the galaxy, say. (we assume they're basically still in the Milky Way bc of plot developments but it doesn't really matter to the bad physics). They then run into human technology (within a few years after arriving) that post-dates their leaving earth by hundreds and as much as 18,000 years. That's IMPOSSIBLE without FTL travel, which is ruled out by the rest of the book. Here's an example: say you head off for Sgr A* at just under the speed of light. It'll take you 25,000 years to get there (plus or minus a few years bc I'm lazy). That's objective years for the folks you left behind on earth; subjective years for the ship's crew could be, oh say, 13 years. Then another ship follows you, after say, oh, 18000 years or so (also going just under c); it will arrive 18,000 years after you ARRIVED, (again, plus or minus a few). Thus you already will have been there for 18,000 years!Time dilation isn't magic, it's 100 year old physics!There's lots of other dumb physics in the book, but that's the deal breaker. For example, you obviously can't have an interstellar empire spanning thousands of light years with only slower than light travel (doesn't matter how long you live, once you get there, they're still going to be a LONG time in your future, ). You COULD have an interstellar community with STL travel but superluminal communication, but that makes the interstellar travel in the book pointless. And a final cultural point: if the idea of the \\"roach motel\\" is to collect galactic civilizations that have lived at different epochs before they go extinct (or evolve, or whatever), what's to keep the first civilization arriving at the motel from going extinct before the next one gets there? After all, we're talking about the same time periods whether or not you're free to roam the galaxy or not. So that invalidates another main point of the book, the \\"roach motel\\" idea.bad, bad, bad, and it will be the last book of Reynolds that I read.Read Greg Benford if you want hard science fiction where the OLD science is correct! (Benford is not really an astronomer, but he is a hot-**** astrophysicist.....)"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"One of his very best books to date. And that is saying something. Reynolds is the best hard Sci-Fi writer out these. His ideas are highly original AND he can tell a pacey exciting story. What a great read."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Musk Dogs...Fountainheads..and a spaceship that's been on the grill to long..Two crabby women that fight for 50 freakin' years or is 18,000 years! Yes I finished the book..I know why some wanted to leave the \\"structure\\".Granted the first part of the book is full of promise, chasing down Janus and the problems that ensue...but then the wheels fall off. Read the first 1/3 of the book then pick up something else."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Pushing Ice is at its core about a fight between two close friends. The twist is that this fight takes place on a comet mining ship that is pursuing an alien artifact, the conflict between the two quickly escalates to encompass the entire crew of the ship and advanced technologies come into play as the true nature of the alien artifact is revealed. Ok, it sounds a little familiar. After the more experimental Century City, Pushing Ice is Reynold's take a crack at some of the more established themes in hard SF and does a very good job of it.Not to say there aren't faults. Some parts of the novel, especially those dealing with the more advanced technological aspects seem pared back. Also, the novel starts slowly only to race to a finish as things get interesting. Still, at a little under 400 pages there is no dearth of material.As with his earlier work, Pushing Ice is loaded with scienctific concepts real (relativity) and hypothetical(femtotech). What is surprising is how well this technology is integrated into the story line. Infodumps are a mainstay of hard SF and it is refreshing to see it handled so well here. Another well handled device is to have the characters and by implication the reader essentially traveling blind. There is an element of mystery and surprise present throughout the entire novel which keeps the pages turning.For those who have enjoyed Reynolds' previous books this one will not dissapoint. For those who have not yet read his other work, this is the one to start with."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Alastair Reynolds's novels are reliably fascinating at the \\"big idea\\" level. He's got a truly first rate hard-SF imagination, and the chops to take cool ideas and reveal them via action plots, often hiding the really neat ideas convincingly until the end. He is a \\"light speed limit\\" author, and fascinated with Deep Time. And all this describes Pushing Ice quite excellently.The novel opens with a curious prologue set 18,000 years in the future, describing an ambitious plan to celebrate the legendary Benefactor who started humanity on the road toward expansion into the Galaxy. Then we get a flashback to 2057, and the story of this Benefactor, a woman named Bella Lind. Bella is the captain of an ice mining spaceship, the Rockhopper. This ship is diverted to chase a moon of Saturn, Janus, which has suddenly accelerated and headed out of the Solar System: clearly, it's an alien artifact of some sort. Bella, however, must convince her crew to go along: it's a highly dangerous mission, and their corporate bosses do not inspire confidence. One of Bella's key links to the crew is her close friend, engineer Svetlana Borghesian.Svetlana originally supports Bella, but when she later discovers that they have less fuel than they thought, and that the corporation seems to have been hiding his fact, she begs for a turnaround, and turns against Bella when she refuses. This sets up the central human conflict of the story, between Bella and Svetlana, who oscillate as leaders of the expedition over time. And what about the expedition? Eventually they reach a point of no return, and they are forced to essentially colonize Janus, while trying to unlock its secrets. Janus is traveling towards a Structure around the star Spica, 260 light years distant, which means a long journey is ahead of them. And in the end this journey turns out to be unimaginably longer than they can ever have expected.Pushing Ice gives us a dramatic, though not to my mind entirely convincing, human story of the conflict between the two women and their factions. Both have some reason for their actions, but both also do terrible things, commit tremendous betrayals. At the same time we are given a tense story of survival in an alien environment, which I found interesting but again not quite convincing. And finally we have a story about contact and communication with aliens, embroilment in inscrutable alien politics, and at the end, a story of confronting truly Deep Time, the very far future. This, to me, works best of all: the payoff here is very effective, mysterious and awe-inspiring.I've been known to suggest that Reynolds's novels are a bit too long, and this one is as long as his others, but I must say that I was gripped throughout. There's a lot going on: a lot of neat SFnal ideas, some \\"small\\" in the sense of being fairly near future technological speculation, and others \\"big\\" in the sense of dealing with the ultimate fate of intelligent races. It's not perfect: I've already quibbled about a couple of things, and I have to say that I could not quite believe in the main characters, even though I did manage to care for them. But it is, well... cool, and it pushes my SF reader buttons just right."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"After his hugely successful debut quartet (Revelation Space, Chasm City, Redemption Ark, and Absolution Gap) Alastair Reynolds has begun widening his range. Century Rain and his latest, Pushing Ice, are set in different universes from each other, and from the shared universe of the first four books. And whereas Century Rain takes place at a time intermediate between the present and that of Revelation Space, Pushing Ice starts in the near future - 2057, to be precise. As to where it ends... well, that would be telling.The action begins when Janus, one of Saturn's moons, mysteriously leaves orbit and accelerates towards the edge of the Solar System. The only vehicle in position to intercept its path is the nuclear-powered mining ship Rockhopper, with its crew of 145 captained by Bella Lind. At the request of Deepshaft, the owners, Bella asks the crew if they are willing to take the unknowable risks involved. Swayed by the promise of huge bonuses, a majority votes to go for it, and the chase is on. But instead of three days of high acceleration, a week of observation, and laughing all the way home to the bank, they soon find themselves fighting for their lives.It would be wrong to give away any more of the plot, as its effectiveness rests largely on a series of surprises that go on right to the end of the book. Suffice it to say that, while slowly but steadily building up the tension and introducing us to a wide cast of characters, Reynolds weaves in some fascinating technical ideas - from an effective method of freezing dying people for future resuscitation to the potential implications of femtotech (a step beyond nanotech) and relativistic time compression. Watch out, too, for some mind-boggling aliens: in 45 years of reading SF, I have never come across anything quite like the Musk Dogs or the Fountainheads.Other reviewers seem to have been disappointed at the obvious differences between Pushing Ice and Reynolds' first four books. It seems to me that these are the inevitable consequences of his decision to tackle a near-future scenario, along with slightly greater emphasis on characterisation and social relationships. The people of Absolution Gap, for example, are so alien to us - what with their nanotech implants and exotic lifestyles - that it is difficult to empathise with them. Hard SF writers are always being criticised for neglecting the \\"wetware element\\", but often their attempts to introduce it backfire badly. Reynolds does pretty well, I think: his people are believable, well differentiated, and easy to like or dislike. All in all, I still think he is the best SF writer active today, and this book is a worthy successor to his previous work. It certainly isn't Jane Austen, and it won't suit readers who want a brisk, action-packed, 200-page novel; but it is ideal for those of us who love to get stuck into a long, detailed SF saga."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Very nice near-future \\"hard\\" SF, the kind you don't see much of anymore. The science is solid enough for most fans to adequately suspend disbelief. The level of technology is not so displaced from our own that you can't relate, a problem I have had with some of Reynolds' other works.I, too, thought the main relationship theme was a bit overused. Most of it did add to the story, but after the halfway point it seemed more of a contrivance.I would have liked to have seen the main alien race fleshed out more, and some solid conclusions arrived at concerning their motives. I suppose if you're setting up for a series some of that is to be expected.All in all a great read. The best from this author since Chasm City."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I've enjoyed Alastair Reynolds' books since I stumbled upon Revelation Space. I was a bit disappointed by Century Rain - partly because I just wanted more in the Revelation Space series... partly because it didn't live up to the promise of Reynolds' earlier books. I enjoyed reading it, but not as much as I'd hoped.Pushing Ice is an improvement... it's a good solid epic space story. Reynolds has a knack for good ideas and good characters, and it shows in Pushing Ice. There's a particular conflict in the story that doesn't quite work for me; unfortunately it's central to the plot, but it felt a bit forced (like these people should have known better). I could have done with a bit more explanation/exploration of the bigger picture, too. Regardless, I really enjoyed the story and am looking forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Alastair Reynolds is excellent, sometimes brilliant, when it comes to science. Unfortunately he doesn't understand people as well as he understands physics. In his books \\"Revelation Space\\" and \\"Redemption Ark\\" the characters tend to lack depth and be a little two dimensional, but not so much that it interferes with the story. In \\"Pushing Ice\\", however, the characters make it very difficult to enjoy the book. The characters do things which are so incredibly stupid that you almost want them all to die. And it's not as if a character was written with a flaw that causes them to make a poor decision. Mr Reynolds needs to get the plot from point A to point B, and instead of thinking of a really clever way to make the transition, as he has in some of his other books, he makes a character do something completely retarded.I really enjoy Mr Reynolds' books, and regret giving this one a bad review. But not as much as I regret the huge flaws in \\"Pushing Ice\\". Read \\"Revelation Space\\" instead, it is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"For the most part I enjoy hard science fiction novels like this. But this one was hard going. A celestial object, thought to be the small moon of Saturn- Janus, suddenly takes off, leaving the solar system in a hurry. Long range scans and the the sudden acceleration reveal that the object is some type of alien artifact. The crew of Rockhopper, a giant ice mining spaceship, is assigned to rendevous with the mysterious object. This assignment comes because they are the only ship that can possibly catch up with the unknown artifact.The crew is divided as to the proper course of action. Some believe that they will expend so much fuel that they will be unable to return to earth. Tensions mount as they arrive at the point of no return. the female Captain, Bella insists that they push ahead while one her top engineers, Svetlana believes that their earth handlers are deliberately misleading them as to their chances to make a return journey home. Eventually they become stranded on this alien worldlet. And they have a long journey, many light years ahead of them. This middle portion of the book reminds me of the Garden of Rama saga as they are stranded on a huge alien space vehicle whose purpose is a total mystery.During this long journey the large crew is divided into 2 factions, supportive of either Bella or Svetlana. In order to survive the crew must unlock the secrets of Janus. All of this is an interesting big concept sci fi stuff. The trouble is the character development is so poor I lost interest in the plight of crew. Many key elements that should lead to character building are only briefly mentioned. For instance the author only casually mentions the birth of children on Janus and only briefly mentions how and why a murder was committed. The narrative concerning the scientific study of Janus is well detailed but there is much less of the important dialog that makes the reader care about the main characters."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"\\"Pushing Ice\\" tells the tale of a ship and its crew, originally meant to be harvesting comets, instead pulled along by an alien artifact to destinations and times unknown. The central relationship in the book is that of two women; acting captain Bella Lind and chief engineer Svetlana Barseghian. As the ship and its crew advance into the unknown, their relationship, both good and bad (and completely non-romantic) will define the future of the crew.This book is well written, and where it is SF it is great, although there are a few plot holes that Mr. Reynolds left in there. However, there aren't many and they are easy to overlook/forgive. However, in the human interaction side of the story, things seem very forced and melodramatic, not particularly believable. Certain things tie up too neatly, and some characters behave too predictably.Overall this is an enjoyable book, but unlike many of the reviews I read, I would describe it as \\"not all that and a bag of chips.\\""},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"There's a great sci-fi story in here. If someone were to sit and spin the outline over the watercooler, it'd sound like a must-read. But despite all the character building, when it comes to crunch time, Reynolds downs crafting tools and merely brutalizes the characters like an [...]with sock puppets.This book does have some of the cant-put-down qualities of Rama, calling it a space opera doesn't do some of the long, delightful sci-fi segments justice, but when the author intervenes to bully the characters into plot-conformance, I had to leave the book for several days until I could pretend those pages never happened."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Pushing Ice being my 9th Alastair Reynolds novel (excluding the already read Zima Blue and Galactic North story collections), you could say I'm kind of experienced when it comes to the realm of the science fiction of Reynolds, and of modern space opera at that.The start is a little confusing with a profusion of job oriented individuals aboard a mining ship. This is quickly dispensed with as the plot builds. With the sudden announcement that their mission will be refocused to intercept a self-powered moon of Saturn, the crew becomes split whether to head into deep space after the anomalous craft or to stay put closer to earth. As the time elapses during their solar system traversing, it becomes abundantly clear to engineer Svetlana that the fuel situation isn't as it should be. This is the major crux of the novel when Svetlana feels belittled by her knowledge even with years of experience, feels betrayed by her captain and friend and future arch enemy Bella, and feels victimized and persecuted by her own company. Her victimization and intuition play an important role in her stance among the sympathetic crew. This is only within the first third on the novel, too!The next third of Pushing Ice reads much like Kim Stanley Robinson's Red Mars where the colonists (unwilling colonists on the once-moon Janus) form a government, trek across a barren and mysterious landscape and deal with unending problem of a social being also being opinionated and fractional at the same time. Growing pains are felt, sentences are dealt and egos take a pelt.The remaining third reads much like Charles Stross' Accelerando, where the characters are subject to rapid changes in technological advancement towards the singularity. In Accelerando, this scientific singularity approaches rapidly when the cast are hammering out new thingamajigs every other page as they explore their every changing social standing. In Pushing Ice, this singularity is being limited by the aliens which have benevolently coddling them along in the years. We see the colony grow, the hate come to a slow and the possibilities glow.The only hitch holding back this niche of humanity is the witch-with-a-b cat fighting. Svetlana is a conniving demon breed of women who spits fire and never forgets past transgressions. Bella, on the other hand, has a mild temper, has the patience of a saint even while in exile and is able to forgive her captors. The reoccurring flares of Svetlana's hatred towards Bella and her distrust of any second-hand information is a serious annoyance, enough to drop the entire novel from a 4.5 star rating to a 3.5 star rating. You'll just want to yell at the book, \\"Get it over it woman! Jesus!\\"Reynolds pens a pretty good novel here. A great addition is added to the novel, that addition which we see in the opening: a future human civilization wants to pay tribute to Bella's great deed 18,000 years ago and does so by an unmentioned means. The means brings about a much greeted addition to the last third. The dialogue isn't nearly as dry as the Revelation Space series and it isn't as spastic or chronologically chaotic like Century Rain. It's a pretty easy read considering its nearly 600 pages. Some of it is a tad predictable but not in an overencompassing manner. I would have liked to have seen Janus better explored, the aliens better explored and the Object better explored. Having said this, the exploration of what Reynolds created wasn't satisfactory to me but left me with enough awe to be content with."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Enjoyable ride through time from modern ages to the far far future of the universe. The action starts out slowly enough as the crew begin their journey but it builds speed with a nice deliberate pace. The scope and depth of the book accelerate inevitably and irresistibly along with the central characters themselves. One of my favorite aspects of the book is that it is paced very much like climbing a mountain. Just when you reach what appears to be the peak, you realize there is even more to come, beyond what you had previously imagined.The physical description of the effects of close-to-light travel is also quite enjoyable and is one of the features one would expect from Reynolds, as a former scientist and a noted hard-sci-fi writer. I tend to have a soft spot for stories that follow human civilization through a rapidly accelerating future history, in particular those that explore technological singularity or singularity-like events, and this one satisfies."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"This was a very good read. It did start slow, but it really hooks you. And it felt to me as though it were several books in one. I loved the balance between political intrigue, personal passion, and science. While not perfect, it was a good adventure."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"This is the best scifi novel I have read for a while, goes above and beyond the author's revelation space series. It has real characters, good description of spaceflight in the next few decades, a mystery which really shocked me when revealed (didn't see that coming), plus big ideas and revalations about intelligent life in the universe. Everything fits together perfectly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"2057. In the depths of the Solar system, large spacecraft routinely intercept and redirect ice asteroids and comets into Earth orbit, where their raw materials can be used to fuel Earth's growing economy and incessant need for raw materials. When Saturn's moon Janus inexplicably leaves its orbit and heads out of the Solar system in the direction of the star Spica, an 'ice-pusher' ship named Rockhopper is the only vessel positioned to intercept it. The plan is for the ship to tail the anomaly for a week before returning to Earth. Naturally, complications ensue and the crew of Rockhopper are forced to make a home on Janus as it accelerates towards lightspeed, which will carry them to Spica in 250 years, although thanks to time dilation only a dozen years will pass for those on board.Pushing Ice is a hard SF novel in the 'Big Dumb Object' tradition, following in the footsteps of Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, Larry Niven's Ringworld and Greg Bear's Eon. However, unlike a lot of BDO books which tend to put characterisation way behind spectacle and awe, Pushing Ice is centred firmly on the relationship between two female crewmembers of the Rockhopper, Captain Bella Lind and navigator Svetlana Barseghian, two firm friends who suffer a catastrophic falling-out over the Rockhopper's new mission and whose subsequent relations colour much of the novel. This gives the book an emotional centre which helps make it easier to relate to the more traditional, awe-inspiring spectacle stuff that unfolds later on.Whilst unrelated to any of his other novels, Pushing Ice features Reynolds' trademark use of non-faster-than-light travel and the inevitable closer interrelationship between humanity and its machines, although broadly along more positive lines than his Revelation Space novels. Pushing Ice is also more relatable, as its technology is less exotic and much closer to current day levels, meaning his characters have to work even harder to survive in the hostile environments they find themselves in.Pushing Ice becomes a multi-generational tale as life on Janus during and after is voyage unfolds and Reynolds' story reaches impressive new levels of invention as we discover more about the alien Spicans and their goals. There is a strong similarity here to Clarke's Rama Cycle, but he makes more interesting and focused points in considerably less time and pages than Clarke's earlier work, and the characters he uses to achieve that goal are considerably more interesting.Pushing Ice (****) doesn't quite hit the same high as Reynolds' masterwork Chasm City, but it comes damn close. As a hard SF novel in the Big Dumb Object tradition, Pushing Ice is a triumph, but achieves its success with more emotion and heart than most such books. This novel is thoroughly recommended and is available from Gollancz in the UK and from Ace in the USA."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"The story starts off at a good pace and then the surprises start coming.The mission is no longer to collect an iceball comet but much much more. The interaction of the characters under different circumstances is as interesting as the story itself. A good read, I would hope for a sequel."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"After many years wandering lost amid fantasy mislabeled SF, and turning in desperation to the oldies but goodies written by Niven, Zelazny, and their ilk, I stumbled onPushing Ice. Fabulous! Enough explanation that this non-physics major can follow (or pretend to), with plenty of action. The typical male failure (sorry, guys) to track character development, but it is quite possible (sorry, girls) for a woman to hold an implacable grudge for 50 years or even 18,000. 5 stars for the pleasure to read some really good, and new, hard SF."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I've read Century Rain before this and thought that it was a rather average experience.Pushing Ice however had me absolutely hooked. Like other reviewers, I'll grant to have seen better character interaction elsewhere, but as alvays with good SF, it's really all about the setting and the plotline, and as a first encounter novel this ranks among the best.If you've enjoyed Peter Hamilton - the current master of Space Opera - but found him a bit long-winded and liked Arthur C. Clarke, but found him a bit too nerdy, you might give this one a try.It's been a while since I've had a reading experience that really made me loose myself to the story, but \\"Pushing Ice\\" did the trick. And then in one volume....IMO, there's too much crap in the space opera genre. Insofar this can be considered space opera - which I really don't think it is - this is definately a gold nugget."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I've wanted to try Alastair Reynolds for a while, but was a little turned off by the 'space opera' tag that hisRevelation Spacework is often saddled with. I was happy then to read the synopsis for Pushing Ice. A stand alone book set in the near future? An encounter with an alien artifact? Sign me up! I went into the book expecting something along the lines ofThe Abyssin space. What I got was something totally different. Grander and much, much better than I was expecting.I do have to say, Pushing Ice took me nearly a month to read. At first I think I was slightly put off by the style of the book. I wasn't too sure what to make of Alastair Reynold's writing. I was used to hard sci-fi in the vein ofArthur C. ClarkeandStephen Baxter. Periodic info-dumps and somewhat bland characters. Mr. Reynolds' style is much different than that, though I can't say I like it more. I happen to enjoy the info dumps and since the 'stars' of hard sci-fi tend to be scientists and astronauts, bland characters seem very true to life. It must be said though that he is a better writer. The information and science was much more naturally blended into the story and the lead characters were fleshed out three dimensional people that you could cheer for and even grow frustrated with. The group dynamics of the main characters were complicated and messy and realistic.On the downside, sometimes his description was lacking. I was never quite sure what Rockhopper looked like and had to keep checking the illustration on the cover. Also, as I mentioned, the info dumps are more woven into the narrative, but there were times when it felt like it was given a little too late. The forge vat for instance is introduced and made such a big deal of, yet he took quite a while to explain what it actually did (and how it did it).I usually give a general summary of the book in my reviews, but here I feel that doing that may ruin some of the mind boggling sense of discovery that was such a big part of my enjoyment of the book. I will say that the synopsis on the back of the book is really only the beginning of the story. Bella and the Rockhopper crew are chasing after the rogue ice moon within the first couple of hundred pages. What happens after that... you'll have to read it to find out. I would recommend this book. It does what I want my sci-fi to do, making a playground of science and blowing your mind with the possibilities while showing you a world unlike any you could imagine. I am going to have to try Alastair Reynold'sRevelation Spaceseries."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"This was the first Alastair Reynolds book I have ever read, and I loved it!!! It kept you guessing as to what would happen; the plot twists and ending were unexpected; the relationship between Bella and Svetlana was a complex balancing act of power, back and forth. I liked the aliens, which seemed fresh and original. The framing story was also different.Also, this book is a stand-alone book, and I think that Reynolds deserves special credit for that: you don't have to hunt down a lot of extra volumes. In a publishing world of open-ended series and never ending sequels, this book provides a lot of ideas, dynamic characters, and big-punch adventures in a single volume. Bravo, Alastair!!!"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"My favorite SF books include a dose of \\"sense of wonder\\" and Alastair Reynolds does it again here. I'd previously read \\"Chasm City\\" so I was looking forward to reading another by him.The story develops in a realistic and believable manner, though I was consistently surprised by a variety of twists. The grand themes of space travel, relativistic time dilation, alien contact, and big, dumb, objects are always a pleasure for me to read about and \\"Pushing Ice\\" has all of them.The largest gripe I had with the book, taking it down from a perfect rating, is the lack of believability in character actions, motivations, and their ultimate ramifications. Specifically, one of the primary characters suffers from Darth Vader-tosis, meaning that the author tries unsuccessfully to redeem her horrendous lifetime of bad behavior with a minor humane act at the end. Also, a major plot element at the beginning of the first part is dealt with in a completely unbelievable manner - unnecessarily, at that.The plot element in question is how the dispute between the two factions resolves regarding whether to cut and run from the Janus effect and try their luck in open space hoping an unlikely earth rescue mission would get to them in time vs. staying on the alien supership and making do with what they have. This is a great dilemma, but the final resolution of a character threatening to destroy the ship forcing the latter option makes no sense as that would be a bluff easily called. Unfortunately, this was not the only time plot drove character actions in ways that were unlikely and left me in disbelief.Overall, the book did not drag until near the end (Darth Vader moment), but then finishes in a hopeful and entertaining manner. I really liked the plot and the characters were mostly interesting minus their momentary lapses due to author rigging. I enjoyed this more than \\"Chasm City\\" so I'm on the lookout for my next read by this author."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"As with all Reynolds books, the journey is always thoroughly enjoyable, and the destination usually on a par. In this case, the destination was an \\"allocate on arrival\\" two star dissappointment.This is perhaps one of the greatest examples of the paretto principle in literature; 80% of the story in (the last) 20% of the book. Still, If Alistair REALLY thinks that around 400 pages are required to flesh out the characters and the establishment of the colony on Janus, who am I to argue? I am NOT saying I did not enjoy this part of the book - just the reverse, in fact - but it was infuriating that there were STILL huge chunks of information missing that would have been useful later. The establishment of Eddytown, the real function of the lava flows, what happened to Svetlana, the Symbolist wierdo's who lived in the maw etc etcI find it odd that in such a detailed story where, in reality, precious little has really gone on, that you keep asking yourself \\"did I miss something or is that the first time that has been mentioned?\\" ( Just how could those trees grow when they were under an iron sky? ... it would have been perpetual night! )I hate spoilers in reviews so I will keep them to a minimum, ( dont read this if you have not read the book ) but the real dissappointment to me was the fact that right at the end, when a key player is discussing the possibility of a monument to the central character, she refers to the fact that the \\"unseen\\" alien perpetrators of this whole story have died out .... PARDON? Did I miss something again? I thought the only time that was actually realised was when a hole was blown through the structure, many, many years into the future, and the escaping space craft saw the missing \\"hub\\".Similarly, were they in a structure or not? At the end they appeared to be in a VAST complex structure which was supposed to have been destroyed years ago ? Eh? I must have missed that tooand for the above two reasons we never really get an explanation, even a working hypothesis, of what this whole thing was about....on top of that the introduction of two alien species were, to say the least, pretty marginal, and certainly not clearly described, which again gave the impression that you had missed something important that would come back to haunt you ( not that it did, in reality )I am left with the impression that I should re-read it because I clearly missed large sections out !!.As always, a really ENJOYABLE journey, but unlike most of Reynolds other books, I WAS a bit dissapointed that justice was simply not done to such an imaginatively complex and brilliant story concept when it came to transfering it to paper!I will still be buying his next one though, because I love his journeys."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"What a fabulous read. This book stretched my mind to comprehend a worn out theme in a new light. This isn't just your same old \\"Lost in Space\\" adventure. It captures the hopelessness of a crew lost in deep space trying to unravel a mystery as they're hurtling not only through space but also through time."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"An exciting science fiction novel that pushes the limits of scientific imagination. Mr. Reynolds has a Phd in Astronomy and worked for The European Space Agency for 13 years. Now, he is a full time science fiction writer. This novel explores behavior of humans when presented with arduous undertakings and reveals our darkest fears and how we try to cope with them in our unique way. In a science fiction frame, Reynolds tries to state that what is wired in us is not pure evil or pure goodness but a mix of them both. How much of each component you have in you will determine your course of actions and makes who you are. Because I'm a total geek, I loved it. Give it try and you might love it too. @shakirbahzad"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Best SciFi book I've read in some time. I'm hoping that Mr. Reynolds comes up with some sequels.As for those who have problems with the science: maybe you would be happier reading a textbook. I'm sure I'm not qualified to declare that this book is SciFI, Hard SciFI or just a work of fiction, but I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone willing to not grouse about the science.My only complaint is that it was not available on Kindle."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I brought this book after reading some favorable reviews. I was not disapointed. I enjoyed the build of the story, which is a large story covering many years with many stories within. Would most definitely recommend to the space sifi addict who likes a good story with many twists."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"My first introduction to Alastair Reynolds, I enjoyed Pushing Ice. Often SF spends too much time on the technology (which I do enjoy), this spends much more time on the drama and politics (which I also enjoy) while not stinting an interesting interpretation of the future. It's not the \\"same-old same-old\\" space opera, and what I thought as a bit of framing story comes into it's own.For something so drama driven, I felt sometimes the characters were a bit two dimensional. Strong feelings that should fade with time didn't, and not having other focuses for the characters made them fall into a bit of a rut at points. Also, for a book that introduces so many characters, I would have like to see more of them fleshed out, and how they affect the drama. And change more over time.That said, the meta-plot of what's happening is a fresh twist, and the book felt believable. That got strained a bit right before the climax, but still was good. Also a great job of important technology without having it take over the focus.All in all, a very enjoyable introduction to AR and I'm looking forward to reading more."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Purchased this book on a friend's recommendation. Excellent writer, good story. I'll buy more of his work after reading this one."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Pushing Ice is only the second full novel that I have read from author Alastair Reynolds; the first being Revelation Space. These, coupled with a few short stories I have encountered in the past several years, have made it clear to me that Mr. Reynolds is a formidable talent whose skills are nothing short of brilliant!In this book, he takes a tested and true (if somewhat stale) science fiction formula - first contact with an alien craft and race - and bends it effortlessly to create a unique, compelling and highly enjoyable adventure through both space and time. His story presents a classic literary trap; he sets you up with a scenario that you think you already know and understand (Clarke's Rama series jumps to mind.) He then carries you along a story arc that is at the same time comfortably familiar and largely predictable, making you think you can see where this story is going. Then he springs the trap, twisting the whole thing around in his own fashion so that you are left wondering what just happened and at exactly what point did you lose control of the situation?Mr. Reynolds consistently presents a deep technical and scientific background to his stories that always sounds plausible, at least in the context of the tale being told. He amply describes the science without bogging the story down in tedious and overly arduous detail. In this story I could understand the principles behind femtotechology without really knowing anything about it, (or if it even exists at all - it doesn't matter.) Perhaps the most compelling elements of his stories are his descriptions of locations and alien beings; again without belaboring the story - one gets a very clear idea about the look, the feel, the textures, and in this story - even the smells of different locations. I know what his ships look like, I would recognize a picture of locations on his planets, I could identify alien characters in a police lineup. He paints a very vivid picture. His characters are interesting and compelling, if not always likable or sympathetic. In the final analysis, all good fiction is really about the characters, not the props or the locations. Reynolds makes his characters believable - if flawed - and makes you empathetic to them, sometimes against your own better judgement.I've enjoyed his stories so much, I can hardly wait to finish one book so I can move on to another. His stories move at a brisk pace and I'm always compelled to move on to the next chapter, unlike some books I've read where I couldn't wait for the tedious chapters to end. Alastair Reynolds is never less than fully entertaining. I highly recommend his work to any fan of great science fiction."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Other reviewers mention technologies and relationship to previous stories. Yes, but I would add that Pushing Ice is a major novel featuring complex, believable female protagonists. They deal with frustration and competition on an intellectual level; in a first-contact story, there is a lot of both. People change only gradually (clinging to old beliefs) as the universe changes drastically around them.Several chapters build toward crises, and I hesitated to start the next because some character faced certain defeat. But few disappeared, and new scientific concepts are thereby introduced. The last chapter really does not end the tale- you will find yourself wondering what the crew of Rockhopper will encounter next. This book really pulls you into their lives."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Alastair Reynolds' novel \\"Pushing Ice\\" is a stirring science fiction story that ignites the imagination and inspires the heart. The crew of the Rockhopper, a comet-mining vessel in the not-too-distant-future receives an unusual mission order- to tail and gain intelligence upon Janus, a moon of Saturn that left its orbit and began to move out of the solar system under its own power. When circumstances and human design conspire to rob the Rockhopper of the ability to return to Earth, a great adventure into the furthest reaches of the universe begins. Reynolds background in astrophysics is readily on display in this novel, as hard science pervades its pages. The characters are all generally believable and relateable , if at times a little two-dimensional. Despite its outer space setting and futuristic technology, the root of this story is a familiar one- a friendship gone sour. As in all great fiction a familiar, human story sets the stage for the epic events that follow. This is a fun science-fiction novel that fans of the genre will heartily enjoy."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing \\"object\\" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Apart from a reasonably length prologue, there is far more of the straight new future action-spaceship in trouble type book here. However, given that this is Reynolds writing, you know it won't stay like that. He then diverts a little into Greg Bear's Eon, to a degree, but, of course, the situation is probably even nastier. Excellent work again. Reynolds is still an author I will be happy enough to pay the outrageous prices books have got to these days, to own. With a growing body of work he has not let me down once."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I think some of the reviewers are a bit harsh. I really like Reynold's way of thinking - where most sci-fi just stops when it gets too hard - he just keeps on going with the fun. As for the science being bad - not sure I agree. We dont know what velocity the ship is travelling at any more that the characters did. Travelling at C is not possible if you have mass as you would be everywhere at once M = Mrest/sqroot ( v squared - C squared) so v = c means M is infinite. Travelling at C is arithmetically impossible because of this - infinite energy required etc. Einstein travelled at C - in his mind - on the edge of a light wave front. As far as the wavefront is concerned no time passes no matter how far it travels-It only appears to take time from the observers point of view. Reynolds travels at C with his imagination. Einstein also is purported to have said imagination is more important than fact. Reynolds cant be faulted for that then. So what's to stop a sci fi writer writing good fiction which plays with physics - The story as a concept has no mass - so - let there be light (or even levity).I like every Reynolds novel Ive read yet (most of them). I see them as an exercise in lateral thinking and fun. You dont have to like all the characters - you dont have to expect all the physics to be right - after all we cant get it right yet ( Relativity and Q mech )- but its been fun so far - absolution gap was beautiful, haunting, cold and dark and makes lots of fun of religion and science. Pushing ice was not entitled \\"pushing real physics\\"."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Lets start of with a statement - believable characterisation and character interactions are not a strength of Reynolds. There were times during Pushing Ice when I found myself thinking - That character would not have done that or I don't believe they would have reacted that way. Yet I gave Pushing Ice four stars.Because what Reynold's does very well is good old fashion big concept space opera. He takes a well worn theme - in the near future Jupiters moon Janus proves to be an alien craft mysteriously comes to life and proceeds to exit the solar system. The only UN sanctioned ship capable of intercepting it is the Rockhopper, an asteroid mining ship captained by Bella Lind.Pushing Ice follows the crew of the Rockhopper from the initial race to intercept, through the realisation that they lack the fuel to return to Earth and need to establish a colony on Janus to their eventual arrival at a giant space station near the star of Spica 260 Light years from Earth, where they encounter other alien species who like our viewpoint characters are trapped within the structure and are unaware of the orginal engineers and their intentions. Central to the story is the interaction and conflict between Bella and her friend and chief engineer Svetlana Borghesian, who initially advises abandoning the pursuit and who becomes the first leader of the human colony on Janus. As the story progresses leadership of the human group alternates between Bella and Svetlana as further interactions reveal that not all of the Aliens trapped within the structure are friendly and that they all may have traveled further in time and space than initially suspected.If you are looking for a space opera in the style of Arthur C Clarke then Pushing Ice is a good place to start.Good old fashioned Space Opera"},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"The biggest thing I like about this book comes from the author's background. With a Ph.D. in astronomy and working experience in space research he brings two real strengths to writing.First, because of his education, he understands the science behind the story. His comments about relativity are dead on. His projections as to future discoveries are within the understanding we have of how things work, but progressed logically.Knowing science is one thing, knowing people and especially management people is something else. His second strength comes from his working experience. Without going too much into the story, when the suggestions (orders) from Earth came to the ship, especially their response to questions about inaccurate data, well, the pointed hair manager in Dilworth comes right out.The story, is good old fashioned space opera. There are space ships, aliens (first contact), mysteries abound. But as you read it, remember to keep the Prologue in mind, especially the last sentence."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"It seems to becoming fashionable these days to reuse (notice I don't use the \\"P\\" word) the writing of others, and pass it off as original work. (A while back, sequels were all the rage. A.C. Clarke, with some help, wrote a slew of sequels to his famous Rendezvous with Rama. It's been a while, but I seem to recall they had titles like Rama Redux, Rama Run, and Rama at Rest. I think.) Take, for instance, the recent award-winner Old Man's War by John Scalzi. Nothing but recycled Heinlein there, and not a very good job of it, either. Or, look at the present volume up for consideration, Pushing Ice. Here we have yet another Rama incarnation, neither more nor less. Perhaps such blatant, er, borrowing would be acceptable if the story weren't so awfully boring. Reynolds has little flair for characterization or pacing, and, perhaps most damning for a writer of this genre, limited imagination. I find it hard to believe that, fifty years from now, people will be using our current-day slang. Let's hope that, come 2057, \\"Don't go there\\" will be remembered as a quaint phrase whose usage died out sometime in the 2010's. (Then again, back in 1990, if you told me that wearing a baseball hat backwards would still be considered trendy in 2006, I'd have laughed.) Reynolds \\"describes\\" his characters by telling us what TV shows they watch and what slogans are on their t-shirts. In fact, he does an awful lot of telling, and not enough showing. Well-written dialogue conveys the emotional tone. With Reynolds, technology and people each get plenty of infodumps, so that the book reads more like a user's manual than a novel. And of course, the lack of imagination is the real killer. I'd be willing to read another telling of Clarke's classic, if it was interesting. After 250 pages, Pushing Ice was just not worth the effort. More like Pulling Teeth, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"SPOILER ALERT: Don't read below if you haven't read the book.......................I loved this book, but I was a little confused about a couple of plot details. How did the cube get in orbit around Janus? Also, can relativistic time dilation alone account for the discrepancy between the characters' time frame and that of Earth? I must have missed some details there. Excellent book, however."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"Reynolds has again produced a novel of human nature that happens to be taking place in a very original SF setting. Along with John Scalzi and a few others, he presents hope that the SF genre will not continue its backslide to the pulp fiction market."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I do not fully understand how anyone could truly enjoy this type of science fiction. Create a pointlessly psychotic human drama that relentlessly goes sideways and doesn't fully resolve itself, involving over and under developed characters that cannot seem to get over themselves and never get what they deserve, and frame it all in a science fiction narrative that attempts to demonstrate how feeble and insignificant the human race is, and there you go - so called \\"first rate hard-SF\\". If you confess that you honestly enjoy this kind of pointless story, good on you. Just don't mind me blaming your proclamation on the fallacy of consensus.I have read and listened to my share of SF, but I am no authority. Though, over the years, I have come to discover that hard SF is hit or miss with me. Clarke's Rama series? Excellent. Asimov's Foundation? NO THANK YOU. Foundation was nothing more than a slap in the face of anyone who follows a religion, presented by means of a somewhat creative delivery. And, Pushing Ice was an ugly reminder to me that intellectual elitism still runs amok in the genre.I made it through the whole audiobook - only because I had to stay awake on a long drive, and I did not have a back-up plan. Serves me right. The best part of this book was finding out that I was able to return it and get my money back.Nothing personal Alastair Reynolds, but with Pushing Ice, you have given me no reason why I would ever want to read or listen to any of your other books."},{"Title":"Pushing Ice","review":"I am an avid fan of Alaistair Reynolds.Chasm City is among my all-time favorite books ever.

Bravo Reich!One of my favorite parts of the book is how Reich compares Christ in the temple cursing out the Pharisees and knocking over tables-to the Christ who tells us to \\"love our enemies\\"He said the correct translation is to \\"Understand our enemies\\"Which is in keeping with his actions in the temple, the way he reacted to Judas when he betrayed him, and then at the end declaring \\"Father forgive them, they know not what they do...\\"Reich portrays Christ more of a victim of a mob in the book and goes deeply into the differences and similarities of Communism and Fascism-and the book ends with a fascinating appendix called the \\"Weapon of Truth\\" (LOVE IT)So, if you are looking for a book on the deification of Christ (which-is not an arguement because we are all filled with \\"God\\" and children of God)-this is not a good book for that...But if you are looking to understand what Christ's mission was about, why he came, and why he had to suffer and die-then this book will do more for you then reading the biblical account of the passion-The movie \\"The Passion\\" I haven't seen it, but after reading the book, I think I am ready now to see it. Basically, Reich shows us-the emotional plague of the masses contracting because they reject love and freedom (because of their parents and society)- are the same people who murdered Christ, and the same people in Christianity and the other world religions of today. This book is to Christians what the film \\"Fitna\\" is to Muslims-every Christian and non-Christian should read this!-in Freedom of Speech, AuroreOnly that day dawns to which we are awake- ThoreauAurore Adamkiewicz, N.D.www.beyondnaturalmedicine.com"},{"Title":"The Murder of Christ","review":"When Reich wrote this book in the early 50's He was supposed to have gone mad. After a first read of the book, you will find He was unusually lucid, much more than Nietzsche himself in the account of a Life ruling principle.Do not be afraid of any comment. Just enjoy reading it!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Christ","review":"This work is best read in the context of Reich's work as a whole. In particular, this work is quite different from the rest and reminds us how prolific the author is. In this book, Reich draws parallels between the crucifixion and modern day emotional pathologies. It may be painful for some to read this book. It equates the 'murder of Christ' with a common modern day phenomenon of which we are all active participants."},{"Title":"The Murder of Christ","review":"I have not read very much about Reich, having come to him through Robert Anton Wilson. But if this book is any indication, he was a passionate and deep thinker, one I can learn a great deal from.That said, this particular book is quite sloppy and repetitive. Each chapter is very similar in content, with only the particular Gospel trope Reich looks at changing. They all end up the same - Christ is Life, and humanity kills him because they cannot bear to really live.At the beginning of the book it is mentioned that this work is \\"immature\\" and was released by the Reich foundation for archival and educational purposes. Having read this warning, I was prepared for the book to be imperfect - had I not read it, I would have been a bit more disappointed.I bought this book looking for any similarity to the thought of Rene Girard, and did find some. Both Reich and Girard share the basic insight that the death of Christ occurs because of humanity - it is the culmination of a sort of disease of the spirit, not an action independent of that disease, directed at it. They also share some ideas about how this \\"emotional plague\\" (Reich) or \\"mimetic desire\\" (Girard) works, which may be due to their common influence, Freud.Other than these broad strokes, however, the two go their separate ways - Girard to Catholicism and Jesus as God, and Reich to Jesus as sexually liberated innocent.I think this book, despite its flaws, could be a good introduction to new ways of thinking about Christianity, to typical atheists and Christians alike."},{"Title":"The Murder of Christ","review":"This book is a masterpiece.Instead of describing it, i will mention only 1 point:When you read it, you will either read it again and again and again, or you will burn it before finishing it.It depends of your \\"inner\\" situation.In both cases it is absolutely worth to read it.It is a unique book, written from one of the most genious and surely the bigest physician and natural scientist on the world ever."},{"Title":"The Murder of Christ","review":"heavy to read!! still worth it to get to understand how institutions and the masses function over individual persons willing to change our paradigms!!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Christ","review":"In this book Wilhem Reich, revolutionnary scientist, explore the Myth and history of Jesus in a functionalist perspective...and depict what he calls 'the emotional plague'He expose in a philosophical manner the responsibility man continually evades..."},{"Title":"The Murder of Christ","review":"Reich exposes Jesus as all-in-one with nature, and not as a supernatural power, nor dying for men was his OWN choice. Morality and men's judgement of their own sins led to his murder..."},{"Title":"The Murder of Christ","review":"This is a profoundly depressing book, along with its companion Listen Little Man. In fact when I first read this book seriously in the mid-1970s when I devoured everything Reich wrote, reading those two books cast me into a near-suicidal depression. They are sad commentary on how Reich was destroyed, and many others of his generation was destroyed by the collapse of revolutionary communism and the imposition of STalinism.Put simply, this book is autobiographical. Reich posits that the problem of the world is that great epoch making prophets and leaders come into the world at each major stage of history. These men--and in Reich's telling of this tale they are all men with no thought of women at all--are somehow possessed of greater vision because somehow they are not orgone deprived--orgone being the basic natural energy released in healthy sex among other places according to the Wilhelm Reich from the late 1930s until his death in the 1950s--like the normal neurotic weaklings, but they suffer and are killed and ignored by the normal neurotic weaklings.This speaks to the flaw in Reich's system. He had begun as an assistant to Frued. Yet, Reich was familiar with the Marxist answer to Freud's view of the permanence of the Edipus Conflict that most of human history we had non patriachial structures and not the nuclear family of modern Europe. Moreover, Reich was also influenced by the Malinowski and other anthropologists who discovered relative sexual freedom, particularly for youth, in prepatriarchal societies in the South Seas and elsewhere.Armed with these ideas and the spirit of revolutionary Marxism that swept Western Europe after the Bolshevik Revolution (Reich was born in Hungary of Austrian-Jewish parents and lived in Vienna and later Berlin before fleeing to Norway and the US after Hitler came to power), Reich began a radical scientific psychological extension of Freudian pyschology to eliminate the conservative and idealist concepts Freud integrated in the system when Freud realized that his concepts of sexual repression clashed with the conservative family morality of middle class Europe that Freud believed in.This materialist and political aspect of Reich's work is hard to find because after his development of \\"orgone theory\\" in the late 1930s all of his works were reedited to reflect it.Reich was not only widely successful as a pyschoanlyst, but launched a political movement for sexual freedom, particularly for the youth that won thousands of supporters in pre-Hitler Germany. His best work \\"The Mass Pyschology of Fascism\\" even with its current orgone editing shows how a battle of for sexual rights for the youth, equal rights for women, abortion rights for women, could have cut into the Nazi's support among the Youth.Reich was expelled from the Communist Party of Germany for \\"Trotskyism\\" and fled to Scandanavia when Hitler came to power, for he was surely on Hitler's death list. Across the 1930s, his belief and faith in buidling a political movement waned, and his belief that a sexual energy called orgone was emitted during good sex was born. By the 1950s, when this book was written, Orgone energy was not restricted to sexual union, but had become a basic underlying energy of the universe with which Reich proposed to cure cancer, built plans to shoot down Soviet jets, and proposed to power spaceships.In the 1920s and early 1930s, Reich understood great events in the world and mass movements such as he had witnessed and participated in in Hungry, Austria, and Germany during those years and a revolutionary movement could allow people to look beyond the limitations of every-day conservative life, and see a bigger picture and create radical change. Yet, by this time, Reich tended to believe all problems were due to orgone deprivation and more and more began to have the insane and paranoid belief that he was specially infused with orgone and a heroic view of the world because his mother had produced him through an affair with an extraterrestial!Facing this, there seemed no way to resolve the conflict between the great visionaries like Reich and Christ and orgone deprived masses whom this book despises. Great visionaries are doomed to death. Christ is murdered, and poor, delude Reich believed he was doomed to be murdered by the conspiracy of the orgone deprived led by Stalin.Sadly, this led him to send many of his papers and documents to the CIA and the US Air Force which made it easy for the government to frame him up as a quack doctor--though Reich only did experimental medicine and psychology in the United States.He was thrown into prison. All of his books were banned and burned by the federal government. I can remember reading bootleg copies of his masterpiece The Mass Pyschology of Fascism in the late 1960s when the ban was still in effect.Oh well, if you want to see the grandeur of a revolutionary vision of how the neurotic problems of capitalist mental health can be overcome read his early writings like the Sexual Struggle of the Youth and The Sexual Revolution. If you want to read an outstanding analysis of why conservative \\"family values\\" politics are essential to capitalist society and how they can be defeated by a struggle for women's rights, sexual freedom, and true liberation, read The Mass Pyschology of Fascism.If you read this one, make sure to keep the number of the suicide hotline handy!"},{"Title":"The Murder of Christ","review":"Wilhelm Reich's The Murder of Christ has an introduction that states, in part, \\"The problems presented in The Murder of Christ are acute problems of present-day society. However, the solutions to these problems, given in The Murder of Christ are immature, emotionally blurred, insufficient or lacking completeness. Therefore, The Murder of Christ is being published only as historical source material from the Archives of the Orgone Institute.\\" The introduction appears to have been written by Reich himself, although this is not absolutely clear. If Reich did write it, it is a welcome sign that he was to some extent capable of self-criticism. The Murder of Christ is by any normal standard an appallingly bad book. It is not primarily, as its title might imply, a book about the historical person Jesus Christ, but rather one about the significance of Jesus Christ as an image or a symbol.Reich deserves credit for recognizing that the figure of Jesus Christ is of the utmost importance, and that the crucifixion provides an example that makes it possible to understand persecution and intolerance in general. That is not say that Reich's comments on Jesus are profound or insightful; they are neither. The idea that the life of Jesus helps to illuminate the nature of human society generally would be a brilliant starting point for historical inquiry, but Reich simply did not have the knowledge, the skill, or the patience to deliver on its promise.Even more unfortunately, Reich does not consistently distinguish between commenting on the figure of Jesus and commenting on Jesus as a historical individual. Despite occasionally explaining that it is the former that really concerns him, Reich cannot resist offering opinions about Jesus the man. Reich foolishly claims that the goodness and benevolence of Jesus shows that he must have been a \\"genital character\\" with a wonderful sex life. Having offered his opinions about Jesus, Reich goes on to offer his opinions about pretty much everything, launching into a semi-coherent rant about what a horrible place the world is and how terrible most people are. One sympathizes with Reich: perhaps the world is a horrible place and perhaps most people are terrible. Yet there is nothing especially impressive about Reich's rants about this Earth and its inhabitants, and I say that as someone who has read plenty of rants and sometimes enjoys them. Rants range, after all, from the merely crazy to the inspired. Reich's ranting is, in a few rare places, witty and almost amusing, but most of it is just dreary. Reich does have a few wise things to say. To give one example: \\"To know the rational in the deeply irrational is the mark of truthful living. Only the stupid self-righteousness within the empty bag of a freedom-peddler manages to believe itself fully perfect and the enemy fully bad. There is a rational motive in the most evil happenings.\\" Yet such genuinely wise observations are rare islands in a sea of comments that are very far from being wise.The final thing that should be noted about The Murder of Christ is that it is volume one of \\"The Emotional Plague of Mankind\\", the second volume being People in Trouble. One of the sad things about The Murder of Christ is that it might discourage someone from reading People in Trouble, a far superior book. Both books should read: People in Trouble for its very real merits, and The Murder of Christ as an example of Reich's failings."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"Even thou I enjoyed the art, the book wasn't in english. I wanted to read and understand about the art, to bad."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"Any review of this book would have to start off by emphasizing that this is a short book. It is only about 96 pages a significant share of which consists of Dali's most famous paintings. Hence anyone looking for an encyclopedic overview of Dali's works would do well to look elsewhere. The question becomes, for its short length, how good of a job does the book do in terms of providing a decent succinct overview of his art? The answer to that is quite well.This is primarily due to the fact that the author, like most of his colleagues who have written other titles in the Taschen \\"basics\\" series, is extremely knowledgeable of this subject. He provides an excellent, albeit brief, overview of Dali's art from the beginning of his career to his end. The reader sees Dali's progression of art through its early stages through its conclusion where religious matters become paramount as Dali comes closer to facing his end. The quality of the illustrations, as in all the Taschen \\"basics\\" series, is magnificent, as usual. The prints are on very high quality with vivid color (which would be essential to appreciating Dali's style) on high quality premium paper.The book does have some gaps however, especially in terms of Dali the man and the motivation behind his art. The author, for example, does not address the question of whether Dali was insane (or mentally unstable), like Bosch or Van Gogh, for example or whether his behavior and the art it reflected, was just part of his showmanship (i.e., an \\"act\\"). The author also does not address how Dali was able to survive in post-Franco Spain, especially considering how \\"subversive\\", Dadaist and anti-establishment his art was as viewed by both Franco and the Catholic Church."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"I am a huge Dali fan and this is another one of those books that gives a great insight into the man's thoughts and feelings."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"I used to have this book, and my ex-wife took it.

I learned a lot about his friends and famliy. The book just reminds me that in every genius there's a lunatic."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"As a college art major I developed a distaste for Dali and his art, even referring to him as a \\"pimp\\" in an essay. I was turned off by his commercialism and his overly-polished style. But over the years my opinion began to shift, and the major retrospective at the Philadelphia Museum of Art has completely renovated my appreciation for the man and his art.This huge and handsome tome is the catalogue for the Philly retrospective, and includes hundreds of color images along with insights into the thought behind the imagery. The book takes you through his youthful experiments in post-impressionism and cubism (there are a few works you'd swear were by Picasso!), into his affiliation with Surrealism, his development of his personal \\"paranoiac-critical\\" method, and his later interests in physics and conversion to Catholicism. The middle section of the book and exhibit includes hundreds of his best-known and most widely-admired paintings, but surprises abound in the early and later sections, with works most people never knew he created.What struck me most in the show and the book was how thoroughly dedicated Dali was to his art, and how intellectually involved his work was. His draughtsmanship was also so acute as to defy belief. I realize now that I was sold so completely on his posture as an eccentric personality, that I lost sight of the power of his art. But this show and book reveal how truly special and significant Dali was as an artist, art theorist, and explorer of the hinterlands of the mind and soul."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"This book is the definitive look at Dali. I own a few other of his books but this one blows the out of the water. The only negative aspect about the book really comes down to my opinion. Some of my favorite paintings are fitted onto a page with 3 others making them a little difficult to see the extreme detail. While others get their own page but in my humble opinion didn't deserve it. While reading or just skimming through the paintings its awesome all the way through. The book is in chronological order so you can see his progress throughout his life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't like Dali's style, there is so much in here that you'll find something. I've spent dozens of hours looking through it, finding something new each time."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"While it may be hard to get a hold of here at Amazon, &quot;Dali: The Paintings&quot; is worthwhile in searching for. I found it at a local bookstore and snatched it up immediately. It's a gorgeous book at nearly 800 pages. It has a black cover with a classic image of Dali and his mustache ends sticking straight up on the cover.The real meat of the book is the paintings, drawings, and sketches. Over 1600 of them to be exact, almost all of them produced in vivid color. The book progresses year to year, giving a glimpse into Dali's changing techniques and styles. Thoughtful commentary by Robert Descharnes and Gilles Neret compliment the works of art.Overall this is one of the best and most comprehensive Dali books around. A must for any serious Dali fan, or even the casual admirer."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"After collecting, selling and trading Dali art works for more than 30 years, Mr. Robert Descharnes, one of Dali's past secretaries, has outdone himself in this magnificent book.

Ades is one of the formost Dalinian scholars. Her book analyzes many of his most popular paintings and will assist the reader in understanding these as well as works not included in her book."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"The value of this book is in its 1600+ image reproductions. A few of them are photos of Dali or the people and places that inspired him. A very few show existing artworks to which Dali's creations responded. The overwhelming majority, however, display Dali's own paintings or the sketches related to them.And the mass of imagery is overwhelming. The book traces Dali's output from his early, formative periods onwards. Although Dali was productive in the 1920s, his familiar style emerged in the 1930s and simply expanded for the next half-century. The chronological organization of this book lets us see Dali's art and personality develop. Among other things, we see how his sketching evolved from pen drawings early in his career to loose oil sketches later. This also seemed to complete some kind of cycle, from the relative crudity of his early work, to the crystalline finish of his best-known years, back to imprecision again, but with all of his mature expressiveness.By its attempt at completeness, this presents aspects of Dali that other authors often ignore. For example, Dali was profoundly influenced by Catholic Christianity. Although his personal beliefs may be difficult to fathom, he produced some of the most beautiful images of Christ ever created.Descharne's commentary supports the images well, but it's hard to read. I don't mean that the text is badly written - quite the opposite, it is very helpful, especially in biographical notes that describe Dali's life at the time of each work. Instead, I mean that my thoughts can't stay on the words for long when the pictures take such command of my attention.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Dali","review":"a beautifully sized book that contained excellent text about the painter's life and superb reproductions of his work in the book"},{"Title":"Dali","review":"Dali (Mallard Fine Art Series)I have read this book cover to cover and enjoyed every word!

The paintings selected span Dali's lifetime and represent the major directions of his work at different points in his life. The explanation provided for each painting includes its symbolism, its relation to what the artist was going through personally at the time, as well as connections with the historical period and other influences.

Such seems to be the case with the reactions to Dr Gardner's The Case That Never Dies : The Lindbergh Kidnapping. As noted elsewhere, Dr Gardner is the first professional historian to tackle the case, at least in book form. And his credentials are impressive: a professor of history at Rutgers University and the recipient of two Fulbright Professorships and a Guggenheim Fellowship. But credentials count for little when faced with the competing theories of die-hard case followers.Dr Gardner's work is without doubt the best researched of all books on the case and a raft of new information is brought to the fore, all of it meticulously footnoted. However, where Dr Gardner differs from previous authors is his overall approach to analysing the case and the evidence. While the other major works are best described as \\"theory\\" books - i.e. they set out to prove Hauptmann innocent or Hauptmann guilty and wear such motives on their sleeves - Dr Gardner instead attempts to put the events in historical context and draws parallels with modern day attitudes to capital punishment. He poses more questions than he answers; he gives fertile ground for additional research. This, perhaps, is the nub of the problem for the self-appointed experts.Discourse on the case today tends to focus on competing - and hotly disputed - theories. There is no generally accepted truth of the Lindbergh case, save that accepted in a court of law in Flemington in 1935. And that, after all, is but one theory. What seems to have enraged the natives is Dr Gardner's refusal to adopt a particular theory, his reluctance to draw conclusions, to join them on whatever side of the fence they happen to be. But that is a reflection of the book that they wished to read (or in some cases write) rather than the book which Dr Gardner - as is his right - chose to pen.The book itself does contain some typos and there are some minor errors (and other alleged errors which are in fact just differences of interpretation), but to distort these into damnation of the book as a whole is to rather miss the point. For any student of the crime, this is an indispensable read and the most thorough reference book on the case. One doesn't have to agree with all of Dr Gardner's interpretations because the evidence itself is presented so clearly and is so well referenced that anyone who wishes to research further can do so off the back of Dr Gardner's hard work. The book focuses on the central timeline and the arrest and conviction of Hauptmann. The tangential stories of hoaxers Curtis and Means are given little further exposure as Dr Gardner chooses to concentrate on the meat of the case.Expertise on the Lindbergh case is not measured through any long-service medal, or by commitment to any official theory but rather by recognising that however much one does know, one does not know everything. And that is what Dr Gardner offers: something for every student of the case, new or old. And given the mountain of literature on the case already, what more can anyone ask but that?"},{"Title":"The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping","review":"After reading the other reviews I was apprehensive about purchasing this book, but I was pleasently surprised by it. The author has spent much time ferreting out those small but important details that make the Lindbergh kidnapping so enigmatic and entrancing. While there may be mistakes to be found in this work, I don't think they in any way detract from the overall balance of the book. I found Lloyd Gardner's book to be insightful and well tempered. Highly recommended for the serious or first time Lindbergh kidnapping reader."},{"Title":"The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping","review":"The dust jacket of The Case That Never Dies by Lloyd Gardner (Rutgers Univ Press, 2004), states this is the first book [on the LKC] by a historian. Whether Hauptmann was guilty or not, Gardner concludes there was insufficient evidence to convict him of first degree murder. Hmmm... what then was he guilty of? Manslaughter, extortion, bad luck, or anti-German prejudice?There is much newly uncovered documentation, mainly from the FBI Records at College Park, Maryland, and the NJSP Archive. But totally omitted, for reasons that are unclear (for 3 years of delving), are the repositories known as the Bronx DA'a Papers and the NYPD Archives. Charles Appel's Treasury Report on Hauptmann's handwriting, and detailed analyses on ransom bill passing prior to the notorious shoebox discovery, are simply ignored.Unfortunately, despite the advertising, the CTND is simply the latest book that has tried to sort through endless reams of data, but still manages to get many historical details egregiously wrong.Characters and dates, ages, and other book titles are mangled throughout - misspelling even Hauptmann's name and that of the fortune tellers Peter and Mary Birrittella (two different ways on the same page), and even the 'Sheraton' Theatre in Greenwich Village. Sometimes Joe Perrone is John Perrone. On p. 305, he claims that Hauptmann's German-English Dictionary never appeared at the Trial - but it WAS introduced by the Prosecution and is listed in the Exhibits section.The technique used in the chapters on personalities mainly concern innuendo - why was CALjr's picture on the Wanted poster taken from his first birthday party (it wasn't), and why did Betty Gow really use those safety pins to fasten Charley's blanket the night of Mar 1, 1932? We are ominously told (p. 410) that the baby was suffering from a rare malady called (craniotobes) - brittle bones of the head. The correct term is actually craniotabes and its definition is quite the opposite - excessive softening of cranial structures. The truth, rather banal, is that the child suffered from rickets, for which he was being treated by daily doses of Viosterol and artifical (ultraviolet) light - a fact freely admitted in the diet published in the newspapers. Statements in one chapter are contradicted in another, as if the author has not read his own book.For example, some lost inventory cards have been found at the NJSPM which indicate that plaster casts were made of footprints at Hopewell - not specifically however of the footprint under the window. On p. 369, we are told that the State Police kept this exculpatory information from the Defense, and yet on p. 319, we are reminded that the very same details were openly printed on the front page of the NY Times (in a highlighted box), before the Trial (Sept 28). So which is it?There are 2 photos of John Condon making the most of his new found fame and a single line, in passing, that JFC (alone) refused to accept any of the Lindbergh reward money. Rarely is an honest gesture understood. A mysterious footnote that Katy Fredericksen was having an affair the night she claimed that Anna was working is given as a Confidential Source. No further explanation... This is worthy of Startling Detective magazine, and keeps the pulp tradition of the 1930s alive.What about the myths that have accumulated about the LKC over the years - should an historian help to dispel those? It doesn't happen here - on p. 19, once again we read that Lindbergh (forgot about a speaking engagement in NYC) on that fateful Tuesday. But the original records at NYU show exactly what happened - Lindbergh's secretary was misinformed and he thought he had agreed to show up on Friday, but not to speak. Chancellor Brown's wife had died in the interim and the date was sent in error.Gardner deserves credit for locating the Mar 1-15, 1932 Reliance Payroll (at the NJSPM) - the one so touted by Scaduto and Kennedy as holding the key. So why not show it? Aha - Hauptmann's name is not there, as the Prosecution always said.Should anyone get this book? I have to say (reluctantly) &quot;yes.&quot; Despite my serious reservations about the poor use of the documentation and the self-defeating methodology and tone, Gardner does manage to cite a lot of material which will prove endlessly useful - to others."},{"Title":"The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping","review":"The contents of Gardner's book are thoroughly reviewed elsewhere. I intend this \\"review\\" as a warning only for Kindle customers. The Kindle version of this book is faulty. Paragraph are in the wrong order, usually at the beginning of chapters. At best, having to unscramble paragraphs is distracting. At worst, it could lead to misreading of the text, which would certainly be unfair to the author as well as the reader."},{"Title":"The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping","review":"This book attempts to sift through and analyze the contemporaneous information; both the evidence at Hauptmann's trial and other information available at the time that was not, for various reasons, presented to the jury as well as significant amounts of additional information that has come to light since Hauptmann's execution.Professor Gardner considers in detail the four principle types of evidence that led to Hauptmann's conviction; (1) eyewitness testimony that either placed Hauptmann in the vicinity of the Lindbergh estate, at the payment of the ransom or passing ransom bills, (2) expert handwriting testimony with respect to the authorship of the ransom notes, (3) expert testimony tracing the wood and one of the tools used in building the kidnap ladder and (4) the discovery, following Hauptmann's arrest, of a substantial portion of the ransom money in his garage together with evidence with respect to his explanation for his possession of it.As to each of these, Garner discusses some of the circumstances that have been advanced to throw doubt upon each element of the evidence which, absent such circumstances, certainly presented, in sum, an overwhelming circumstantial case. I was familiar with the essential evidence in the case from prior readings and had previously been of the view that, given the variety of circumstantial evidence and the number of witnesses involved, the hypotheses of either innocent errors or a \\"frame-up\\" were both incredible. Even before reading the book, I was disturbed by Hauptmann's stubborn insistence upon his innocence despite virtually being offered a commutation if he would admit his guilt and name his accomplices and his seeming choice to go to the electric chair rather than talk. The theory of some psychic block to admitting anything provided a possible, but less than convincing, explanation.After reading the book, I am far less confident than I was before.Professor Gardner's book raises serious and disturbing questions as to each of the major elements of proof; eyewitnesses who had repeatedly changed their stories or were pressured to make identifications, the main prosecution handwriting expert's initial inability to link the ransom notes' handwriting to Hauptmann which changed only AFTER he had been informed of an eyewitness identification, frailties in the wood expert's testimony and additional information about Fisch (whom Hauptmann had claimed had given him the ransom money) that increased the plausibility of Fisch's involvement in the crime.Most disturbing of all that, according to Gardner, (1) a great deal of this exculpatory evidence was never disclosed to Hauptmann's defense lawyers and (2) they were given an inadequate opportunity to conduct their own analyses of the physical evidence and investigation of witnesses in preparing Hauptmann's defense. This, together with the trial judge's highly suggestive discussion of the evidence during his charge to the jury, very likely had a substantial influence on the ultimate verdict.Of course, accepted standards for the conduct of criminal trials were quite different in the mid-1930s from what they are at present; for example, there was no requirement that the prosecution disclose exculpatory evidence in its possession, regardless of whether it would have been effective in either exhonerating the defendant or raising a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. The standards of one period do not necessarily provide fair criteria for the evaluation of conduct during another.But even though Hauptmann's trial may have passed legal muster by the standards that prevailed at that time, I conclude that the trial was far from fair and that, had it been otherwise, there is a real likelihood that reasonable doubt could have been established to the satisfaction of the jury, at least as to the first degree murder charge, although perhaps not to a lesser charge of complicity in the extortion of the ransom payment.Professor Gardner's assembly and consideration of voluminous materials is impressive, despite sometimes enigmatic presentation of his sources in his footnotes and despite an occasionally disjointed analysis of particular aspects of the case in diverse parts of the book.Overall, however, the book is an interesting and informative presentation that is well worth reading, not only for one interested in the Hauptmann case, but also as an object lesson in why modern rules of criminal procedure do much more than merely create potential technicalities for the avoidance of criminal liability but, on the contrary, are essential to achieving the dual objectives of ascertaining guilt while minimizing the risk of error."},{"Title":"The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping","review":"\\"The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping\\", Lloyd Gardner, Rutgers Univ. Ress, NJ, 2004. ISBN: 0-8135-3385-6, HC 415 pgs., plus Notes 44 pgs., Biblio. 4 pgs., Index 14 pgs., and 30 B & W Photographs/Illustrations. 9 1/2\\" x 6 1/2\\".Gardner, a distinguished Prof. of History & author of a dozen books gives a fair-minded exaustive analysis of the Lindbergh baby's kidnapping (Mar. 1, 1932), ransom, murder, and the subsequent apprehension, trial (Jan. 2, 1935), conviction and execution (Apr. 3, 1936) of german immigrant Bruno Richard Hauptmann (BRH). To the chagrin of many readers, but more-so to the author's credit, is Gardner's neutrality or foregoing of taking one side or the other, but rather walking a fine line to avoid and evade bias, prefering facts to speak for themselves but still pointing out errors made by authorities & both legal counsels.The writer drew heavily upon FBI records and from the official Police records, papers and documents in repositaries, museums, etc. Of interest are photographs of the colorful notables and of the Lindbergh's home floor plans. The book has 16 chapters, each rather sharply devoted to the testimony or viewpoints of a specific person, topic or subject matter. The read is tedious at times for much is built upon recorded witness testimony in and out of court, oft \\"she-says he-says\\", and at many times outbursts from questionable sources having questionable motives -- but all of which is part and parcel of the Hauptmann trial. We learn, for example, of the tricky and complicated money transfers by BRH in a variety of business schemes and con games, stock market tradings, possibly money laundering, and how the ransom money gold certificates were crucial in finding BRH, and of the sundry hiding sites BRH used to stash away the ransom moneys. The author also deals with the previously noted imperfections of baby Lindbergh, alleged to have overlapping of toes bilaterally, enlarged cranium with open fontanelle and mention is made of possible rickets (not uncommon in those days, but no mention of possible hydrocephalus). Gardner also notes the 1948 discovery by Bolliard in NJ of writing on the underside of a small table that also had a small metal brace whose holes were discovered by Falzini in 2002 to matched the markings of the ransom notes precisely.\\"It was a two million dollar funeral\\", although BRH was a declared pauper, brought to bear by the states of NJ, NY and the USA to \\"turn a human being into a whisp of smoke and a jar of dust\\", said Lloyd Fisher. In the end, \\"Gardner concludes that there was insuffient evidence to convict him (BRH) of first-degree murder.\\" It remains the finest documented book I've encountered on this subject, a must read."},{"Title":"The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping","review":"I have read many books about the Lindbergh kidnapping. I feel Lloyd Gardner's book is thoroughly and thoughtfully researched. I have read it twice carefully and each time I read it I discovered new information. Who was John Condon? Why did Violet Sharpe commit suicide? Why did Lindbergh act so strangely the night of March 1,1932? Does a parent call his attorney before calling the police when he suspects his 20 month old child is missing? There are so many bizarre events surrounding the disappearance of the Lindbergh baby that it is no surprise that Lloyd Gardner titled his book \\"The Case That Never Dies\\". The trial was a farce and a circus: an embarrassment to the State of New Jersey. Read it!!!!"},{"Title":"The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping","review":"Gardner has produced a book that allows the reader to consider the evidence and make thier own conclusions without being presented a prosecution brief of a Jim Fisher(Lindberg Case-1987). Bruno Richard Hauptmann appear to have been involved. But the key word is appears. Gardner does a good job showing inconsistencies of a John Condon ( a bigot by the way that wanted to blame the I-talians).He explores the weirdness of the crime itself. The Lindbergs normally were not at that house on Tuesdays. The window was unlocked,the right shutter was warped,the baby was not to be disturbed by a Charles Lindbergh routine from 7-10,that demanded that the baby was to be left alone.This suggests inside help contrary to the lone wolf theory. The flimsy ladder allegedly made by the carpenter Hauptmann. The narrow window,the lack of any prints which is contrary that a lone wolf wiped down the room and could have commited the crine . Other details such as the ladder being set off to the right of the window,indicated to the police that the kidnapper (Isido Fisch)was left handed. I don't believe that in the case of Hauptman,that is the fact . The footprints that don,t fit Hauptmann left at the house or the cemetery where the ransom was paid off . The window was closed upon leaving the bedroom so the lone wolf Hauptmann had to do wife down the room, find the off set ladder with his legs,carry the baby and close the window all of this by himself . This is not believable and this smells of inside help-indeed Violet Sharpe a maid in the other Morrow house committed suciide after being evasive. This book demonstrates that the hand writing that doesn't match as much as Fisher's book claims.I use to believe that Hauptman did this by himself but this book rasied enough doubts. I cannot understand the criticism on the scholarship on the book. Sure there are mistakes but is calling Joe Perrone, John Perrone enought to dismiss this book? A good book by some psychologist would be why some people attack anyone that raises concerns that Hauptmann did this alone? Why the emotion in protecting police mishandling of the case,after 70 years? Lindbergh was a national hero and with that fame came this horror but Lindbergh sqandered much of the good wiil from this tragedyy by coming a friend of the Third Reich and making speeches that were Anti Semitic. After 70 years we need more of this scholardhip . I recommend any serious researcher of this case to get this book and use the info the serch out new leads as the table that was found recently 2002 that appears to be the template for the ransom notes"},{"Title":"The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping","review":"As someone who has researched the Lindbergh kidnapping extensively for the past fifteen to sixteen years and as someone who is currently writing a book on the case, I waited with bated breath for many months for this book. I was hopeful that, based on Mr. Gardner's reputation, that this would be a significant book on the case that would dispel many of the legends and falsehoods associated with the case. I could not have been more disappointed.From a literary standpoint, the book was not written well. It is a tedious read and lacks any prominent ending. The book just stops.The theories offered by Gardner are not consistent with the facts and evidence. There are only two new pieces of evidence offered and no significant discussion of the \\"tabletop confession\\" which is the latest and most significant development in the case in at least ten years.Even more disturbing are the casual references to outlandish theories without any evidence or support. For example, Gardner suggests that Violet Sharpe -- the victim of a suicide-- was actually murdered by Septimus Banks. This one line is extreme and not one iota of proof is offered. There are many other examples.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the book are the inaccurate citations. At one point, Gardner accuses John Condon of sexual improriety with a student and actually cites Condon's own memoirs as support. When I referered to my 1st edition copy of Condon's book and checked the citation, there was absolutely nothing there.In all, the book was a major disappointment. I gave it one star because it is the lowest rating your system permits.There are arguments to be made on both sides of this great case. As an expert in this area, I very much enjoy good debate and was hoping this book would be intellectually stimulating. Instead, Mr. Gardner served only to further muddy the waters."},{"Title":"The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping","review":"I am not finished reading it.

The print is too small, the words and thoughts are redundant and the small paperback has the look and feel of a self-published work, which it is.The range of interviewees is tiny compared with the breadth of Brooks' life and all the interviews sound the same.

Written by a professional ski coach, it is filled with information starting from the body metabolism, plyometric and strength training exercises, to training which can be perfomed while skiing. All off-snow exercises which I saw in skiing videos, books, skiing journals, and on the internet are in this book. The importance of each group of exercises is clearly explained. No special equipment is required (except for the access to an average gym for strength training). The suggested training routines are based on US skiing team manuals and on over 80 references cited in the bibliography. All 200 pages are densely packed with information, all presented so well that it does not overwhelm you at all. Another aspect of this book which I liked is that the author treats the readers as intellegent people, who can put together their own training schedule according to their needs and possibilities. There is no suggested training schedules, just recommendations how much one should exercise and why not more or less than that. Although it is not a book on skiing, there are some tips on racing and ski tuning as well.

Even spookier is that it coincides with what I have heard, seen and read in many other places. My biggest criticism is that sometimes it seems that Springmeier tends to think that if they're people Christian they are probably bad guys. However he is really not that narrow. He freely admits that the Christian church has been manipulated by the Illuminati. He is really a historian and tells stories that will blow your mind.You don't have to pay a fortune to get this information. I purchased a CD on eBay that contained this as well as several other of Springmeier's books. You can watch a video of Springmeier speaking for over one hour on this same CD or DVD. (Sorry, I get confused on which is which since my DVD drive plays both!) Anyhow, just search \\"Fritz Springmeier\\" on eBay. Springmeier hurries to tell in one of the books on this CD/DVD that some of his books can be DANGEROUS for you if you may be a mind controlled slave yourself. He has worked with dozens of now-ex mind controlled slaves -- some on very high levels -- and seems to know what he is talking about. The problem is, if you think you may be mind controlled yourself, reading some things in some of his books could \\"trigger\\" one of the parts of your programming of which you are unaware.Unfortunately, I hear that Fritz Springmeier is now in prison on trumped up charges.His message also includes a very strong Christian viewpoint. If that really bothers you maybe you will not be able to appreciate his book, but I don't see why that should have to bother you, since the words of Jesus in the Bible are loving and forgiving. One can be a non-Christian and still have a very strong connection with the Inner Light and the Divinity which connects us all. I do not recommend reading this if you are not strong with your bond with a Higher Power. It could be too distressing.By the way, on the CD/DVD I got, it was the same as getting 3 or more full length books of Springmeier's for only a few dollars and very worth it. You can always print it out on 3-hole-punched paper and put in a 3-ring binder if you don't like having to read off of a computer screen.May be extremely helpful reading for true lovers of the Truth. If you are not sure if you can handle the bad news, don't read it. Feeling fearful would only play into the hands of those who would enslave you."},{"Title":"The Illuminati formula used to create an undetectable total mind controlled slave","review":"The book is a very good introduction to the scene of Satanic cells. It's lacking, however in the immense use of psychotropic drugs. The theory is straight forward, however the procedures laid out in this book happen in rare cases only. Usually agents of influence simply corrupt the moral outlook of their recruits and have them join with the idea that they thought the whole plan up themselves. Thus, making the recruited, seen in his own eyes, as the initiator of the action. If you find this book is simply too expensive have a look around the net for it. It has appeared in text, and HTML versions available for free. This book grabbed the attention of the US government, and the author of it is (last I heard) in jail, with all of his research papers seized.

I wanted to learn about these techniques because frankly, mind control fascinates (and scares) me. But this book is just HORRIBLE. It is loaded with cryptic, needlessly esoteric psychobabble and complex metaphors as well as thousands of random historical facts about MI6, the CIA, the FBI, Joseph Mengele, African tribesmen, etc all strung together randomly and using no particular time line. He jumps around so much that you wonder if he himself has multiple personalities or wrote this entire book stream-of-consciousness. I am being completely serious! In the very beginning of the book, he defines several mind control terms that will be used throughout each chapter (such as \\"alter\\"), but this really does not help the reader along much because the problem is his writing style, which consists mainly of run-on sentences and extremely long-winded paragraphs that make no cognitive sense initially. This book was CLEARLY not edited by a professional. At times it is so densely packed with information that you literally have to read a single sentence 6 or 7 times to infer its meaning. Below is an example of what I am talking about. This is only a PORTION of a single paragraph (not the entire paragraph, which goes on for almost an entire page without a break):\\"In Illuminati systems these early parts are dehumanized into thinkingthey are gems and crystals. These gems and crystals then \\"power\\" theentire mind-control system that is programmed over the following yearsinto the child's mind. The gems are not perceived as alters, so the proxycore wouldn't integrate with what is perceived as an inanimate object.The proxy core is allowed to want to move toward health with a therapist,it is programmed to move toward healing, but to lead the therapist awayfrom the true core. She or he is programmed to believe it is the truecore. The real core & its first splits, which are the gems, are placedhypnotically at the mind's deepest levels--in an area of the mind fewtherapists ever search.\\"How could anyone possibly understand this without some kind of \\"decoder ring\\"? This is actually one of the more *simplistic* sections of the book! The whole thing reads like a technical manual. I just don't see the point of being so cryptic if your purpose is to educate people.

Its perspective is predominantly historical and a bit too academic, but it is well written and simply fascinating.Sam Walton was a natural salesman, passionate about building his retail business. When founded Wal-Mart in 1962, he did not entertain any dream of becoming the wealthiest man in America or creating the world's largest company. Instead, he wanted to bring big-city discounting to his corner of the rural American South, which would cut about 20% off the prices in local stores. But he wanted the discounts to be offered every day, rather than by one-time sales promotions of selected items. He chose to expand locally, opening stores in his native Arkansas and spreading slowly into Oklahoma, Missouri, and Louisiana. Thus, as the book points out, Wal-Mart's culture reflects where it was born, where its salaries were viewed as fair and people could live reasonably well on them and in a context without strong unions or organized workers.Walton's strategy was simple: to make up for his low profit margins, he would have to sell in higher volumes of sales in a large number of stores. In addition, his company developed a relentless drive to lower costs by going directly to manufacturers and constantly increasing worker productivity, which often translated into low salaries for a high-turnover work force. He also paid close attention to the competition as well as trained Wal-Mart workers to treat customers with courtesy and consideration of their needs. It was a phenomenal success. In 1985, with just under 1,000 stores, he was named by Forbes Magazine as the richest man in America. By 1991, Wal-Mart was recognized as America's largest retailer as it began to expand overseas. It was repeatedly hailed as the most admired company in America.In the aftermath of Walton's death, the expansion of the company accelerated with a combination of new technologies (the \\"logistics revolution\\") and the globalization of its operations. By 2004, Wal-Mart was number one on the Fortune 500 list, as both the world's largest corporation and the largest non-governmental employer.From the mid-1990s, Wal-Mart became a pioneer in technology-driven productivity enhancement. Elements included: 1) point-of-sale data collection, enabling managers to track inventory and demand in real time; 2) data mining in order to exploit trends to boost sales via novel merchandising techniques, e.g. placing diapers and six packs of beer near store entryways on Fridays, to exploit a spike in demand for both items at the end of the workweek; 3) the establishment of a just-in-time delivery system, which suppliers and distributors were obligated to participate in and obey, in effect joining Wal-Mart's data network. According to a widely cited estimate by McKinsey and Co., Wal-Mart alone was responsible for 25% of the \\"gain in productivity\\" of the U.S. economy from 1995 to 1999! Many of these efficiency gains, the company claimed, were passed directly on to consumers in the form of lower prices. Wal-Mart, the company said, saved U.S. consumers over $100 billion per year.Combined with its sheer size (Wal-Mart accounts for approximately 10% of all retail sales in the U.S.!) these technological capabilities enabled Wal-Mart to exert an unprecedented degree of control not only over its business partners (independent manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors), but over its employees as well.On the one hand, this represents a fundamental shift of market power to the retailer, which traditionally had served as outlets for manufacturers. In practical terms, this meant that Wal-Mart could force its partners to set prices at whatever levels that the retailer deemed desirable, which translated into direct control of both their marketing through Wal-Mart stores and in many cases, even the manufacturers' brand. Given the imperative of cost containment, this tends to cut their profit margins to the bone. In the case of Vlasic pickles, for example, some have argued that Wal-Mart's insistence that the company lower prices led to its bankruptcy as well as derailed its brand strategy for high quality at slightly higher prices. One the other hand, managers in Wal-Mart headquarters are able track the productivity of workers in its individual stores, allowing them to push for \\"improvements\\", allegedly as unpaid over-time and refusal to take breaks, which many critics charged were degrading and often illegal.Wal-Mart's size and reach attracted many critics, who condemn its practices and began to mount protest campaigns against the company. Their tactics include grassroots campaigns to block the establishment of new Wal-Mart Supercenters, targeted consumer boycotts, a barrage of media attacks (in films and television, on the internet, and in print), and efforts to unionize Wal-Mart associates. In addition, the company became the object of a growing number of lawsuits (on average two per hour, 365 days per year!) from both current and former employees and customers, including many class-action suits.Wal-Mart's critics argue passionately that the company had to change in a variety of ways. First, they believe, Wal-Mart had to somehow lessen its impact on the communities that it entered. As it stood, they charge, Wal-Mart not only destroys local \\"mom and pop\\" stores that could not compete on price, which sometimes turn traditional downtown shopping areas from vital social centers into ghost towns, but also generate such second-hand effects of increased traffic, reduced demand for other local businesses such as newspapers, additional infrastructure costs that create new tax burdens. Second, Wal-Mart's labor practices, which they believe are brutal and unfair, have to change. The company, they demand, should allow associates to unionize, offer better wages and health insurance benefits, and treat them more humanely. Moreover, critics claim, Wal-Mart's labor practices were dragging down those of its unionized competitors, who were asking employees to \\"bargain away\\" their higher salaries, pension plans, and other benefits in order for the companies to survive. Third, they argue, Wal-Mart has to provide a more equitable management of its supply chain, from \\"sweatshop\\" workers in China to the company's truckers as well as its manufacturing partners. This often means that the company should pay more for the goods and services it buys.This criticism amounts to nothing less than a fundamental repudiation of Wal-Mart's business model, which in the words of one critic in this book, \\"can flourish only by externalizing many of its most important social and economic costs, which are displaced onto a relentlessly squeezed supply chain, an underpaid retail work force, and those many thousand communities...which have been forced to absorb so many intangible expenses...\\" Even worse, evidence suggests that the criticism resonated with a growing portion of the public. In a 2004 confidential McKinsey & Co., it was reported, between 2 and 8% of the public had ceased to shop at Wal-Mart due to the \\"negative press\\" about the company. Most alarming to Wal-Mart executives, however, was the disapproval of more affluent, middle class consumers in urban areas, that is, the group that the company had identified as the market that it must next enter if its growth rates were to improve or even be sustained.This is about where the book stops, which is unfortunate given the things that have happened recently. As media campaigns against the company grew in 2004, Wal-Mart President and CEO Lee Scott decided to mount a counter-offensive. In its aim respond directly to the claims of critics, this represented a new departure for the company. After hiring the public relations firm Edelman, the company created a rapid-response \\"war room\\" in summer, 2005. Among the tasks of the group was the cultivation of a more positive image of the company - as environmentally aware and more worker friendly - in the minds of the \\"swing voters\\" who had not yet decided against shopping at Wal-Mart. It wants to be viewed as a good guy again, which in my opinion is a dubious proposition.The next phase of the story is whether or not this new PR will work. The company certainly got lots of praise for its Katrina relief efforts, and deservedly so if you ask me. But the opposition to the company will persist. My advice is: hold onto your seats because it's gonna be a heckuva ride. For example, just after Scott announced some progressive measures, such as a new health care plan and some environmental initiatives, foes of the company released a leaked internal memo (on strategies to keep employees off the company health care plans) with perfect political timing: the vilification was intense, focusing on how the leopard may not really have changed its spots. These opposition groups are media-savvy and driven - and they will not stop. I have interviewed some of them, and to say the least, they are passionate about their mission, which is not just to block Wal-Mart but on how to shape the direction in which their communities will develop. Instead of asking \\"how many jobs\\", they are looking at what kinds of jobs are being created. In my view, this represents a fundamentally new kind of social movement and Wal-Mart had better take heed.Recommended as the best book I have yet read on the company. While it is predominantly historical, it explains many useful things about the company that are unavailable elsewhere. Also, there are wonderful histories about the retail trade."},{"Title":"Wal-Mart: The Face of Twenty-First-Century Capitalism","review":"A collection of essays, written by different authors, regarding Wal-Mart's business strategy over the past 50 years, with special focus on American Wal-Mart in the early 2000's. Some are written better. I wouldn't call them 'biased' or 'dry' like the incoherent low starred reviews here. (I'd bet corporate PR has something to do with those reviews.)Let me tell you what I learned from the book. Wal-Mart bases it's 'floor strategy' on a divide and conquer scheme (keep workers divided, very powerful management), where the objective is low margins with high volume. To maximize profits, the biggest item on the Wal Mart agenda has always been controlling 'fixed' labor costs (theoretically necessary with small margins). Corporate obsesses about labor costs. The culture exploits workers 'off the clock' by under staffing and assigning more work than a single person can accomplish. During slow times, workers are sent home and not paid, despite being scheduled to work. Internal rules (borderline legal and also unfair) allow management to arbitrarily assign 'violations' to employees who cannot accomplish the work of three people, and they do. With documentation. This means when Wal-Mart fires a worker, no unemployment, because the firing was 'justified'. Wal-Mart also wants no benefits paid for with corporate dollars, and exploits state run insurance and food stamp programs wherever possible.Men working at Wal Mart make more than women, and women are preferred for most jobs because they can be paid less with higher turnover. (Entire chapter on a class action lawsuit complete with statistical evidence.)Wal-Mart aggressively avoids/busts unions in the USA. In Germany, China, the UK, Argentina --- most everywhere else --- Wal Marts are unionized.In this current economy, the culture of Wal Mart is a hypocritical 'family', where shame is used to control workers, most of whom have little hope of advancement and become gradually disenchanted. Managers enjoy treating unskilled workers as replaceable cogs. This leads to a high turnover (allowing Wal Mart to keep wages low). It is deliberate.Overall, an enlightening book."},{"Title":"Wal-Mart: The Face of Twenty-First-Century Capitalism","review":"Before commenting on this very boring,badly written junk book I think it is necessary to comment on some of the political diatribes that herein pass for \\"reviews\\"of this volume...Everyone knows that at wal-mart prices are low because the company is cut-throat,doesn't pay its workers well,and has as it's primary goal the intention to drive as many of its competitors out of business as possible..so what else is new?In an era that allows a brainless twit like George W.Bush to have two terms as president,that has seen repeated tax give-aways to the rich but no increase in the federal minimum wage for the poor,that allows government to step on the constitution and trash the bill of rights,one can only wonder at the self-righteous fulminating to be found in reviews that say more about liberal anger than about how badly written this book is...Hey!Wal-Mart thrives for the same reason that George W.Bush remains president,and for the same reason thatthe rich get richer while the poor remain poor;BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN !This book is written is an ultra-dry,statistical style,apparently designed for someone other than the average reader...If the people responsible for this book thought that with its publication a spark would be ignited that would burn wal-mart to the ground they were-and are-mistaken...while poring over the data in this volume may indeed show wal-mart to be the predatory corporate villian that we all already accept as fact,it is not likely that many will take the time and the effort necessary to do so..and effort is needed,as reading through most of what is contained in this volume is about as entertaining as reading the phone-book cover to cover."},{"Title":"Wal-Mart: The Face of Twenty-First-Century Capitalism","review":"The book begins by summarizing the 10/11/03 lockout/strike of 59,000 Southern California grocery workers from 850 supermarkets in an effort to maintain wages and healthcare insurance the UFCW had negotiated over 50 years. The lockout/strike ended Feb./Mar. of '04 with a decisive defeat for grocery workers - the new contract slashed starting pay and capped health insurance payouts. The one point of agreement was that the struggle was initiated by industry management trying to prepare for expected competition from Wal-Mart in their area. (Some experts see Wal-Mart becoming the nation's leading grocer by '08.)Wal-Mart is attributed to bring over 230,000 shipping containers across the Pacific each year - approximately 100 containership loads, and about 10-20% of transhipped through Southern California. Its overseas suppliers employ up to 65,000 at a single facility (Huyen-Binh-Chanh in VN).Discounters' labor costs average about 15% of sales (about half that of department stores); Wal-Mart's are another 25% less. One means of selling its low wages is to also offer profit-sharing - however, few take advantage because qualifying requires two years' employment to qualify (40%+ turnover/year). Only 7% of its employees try to support a family with children on a single Wal-Mart income -> reduced need for benefits. A 32-hour week is considered \\"standard\\" at Wal-Mart (some employees do work 40 hours. It probably has a higher percentage of managers start in low-paying jobs and lacking a college/university degree than any other large company in the world.Adding groceries to Wal-Mart's existing stores typically increased sales of non-food items 30%.Wal-Mart's \\"Plus One\\" principal: - each product's price should be lowered or its quality improved each year. Over 500 large vendors have a permanent sales office near Wal-Mart's headquarters. It requires suppliers to open their books and undergo detailed cost analyses; trade-promotions and direct-marketing campaign costs are deducted from the wholesaler's price. Vendors can access saels data directly, providing the ability to test new products more easily/quickly, and to simply product production and setting inventory levels.Providing national brands helps Wal-Mart document its status a a low-price leader; store brands (abouat 40% of the total) appeal to the more price conscious shoppers.Methods of Controlling Labor Costs: Making indenpendent contractors out of truckers bringing containers out of port prevents them from trying to organize or join a union - would bring anti-trust suits; in addition, a large portion are immigrants - particularly difficult to organize. Staffing distribution centers with temporary agencies/employee-leasing firms allows a quick change if organizing develops.Wal-Mart originally incorporated each store separately, thus allowing sales/store to fall under levels that would require paying the minimum wage - this was stopped by a court-ruling in '67. (K-Mart took the concept a step further - licensing out different departments within a store to different companies.) A computer staffing system dictates lower staffing/sale as sales levels increase; people are sent home early when sales fall. Managers are pushed to \\"beat yesterday\\" to retain their position and earn bonuses.The rest of the book is taken up with general retail history, a summary of the class-action suit claiming Wal-Mart discriminates against women in promotion decisions, and background on Wal-Mart's foray into Mexico.My opinion is that blaming Wal-Mart for low wages/benefits is misplaced - Wal-Mart would not be able to do this if the economy were better. Thus, the weak economy is the problem, and Wal-Mart provides a preview of how life will be for more and more Americans as international competition increases."},{"Title":"Wal-Mart: The Face of Twenty-First-Century Capitalism","review":"This may not be the book of essays that finally gets people up in arms against the Wal-Martization of the world but it contains much useful information for those are interested in that perspective.This writer has just received news that the Massachusetts Federation of Teachers (MFT) has voted to support the Wal-Mart boycott. Thus, the MFT joins a growing number of other unions union federations nationally and internationally in support of this first step in the struggle to organize Wal-Mart. Every militant is obliged to and must support this boycott as a first step in the struggle against this greedy mega-corporation. To list the egregious labor practices of this corporation is like reading pages from the history relating the sweatshop conditions of the American labor movement at the turn of the 20th century. These essays detail that exploitation. Whatever piddling savings one might receive by shopping at Wal-Mart is negated by the degradation of its labor force. It is high time for the labor movement to move on this outfit and move hard. The race to the bottom stops here.Whatever the practical effect of the boycott it can only be a first step in the ultimate union organization of Wal-Mart. A boycott is not enough! A consumer boycott, as has been shown by past practices, is only as effective as the diffuse shopping public is aware of it. In general, a consumer boycott has little or no effect at all. In any case it is not decisive. There is no short-cut to effective organization at the point of production and, particularly in the case of Wal-Mart, distribution. The leadership of the organized American labor movement (now centered in the AFL-CIO and Change to Win Coalition) has chiefly used to the tactic of boycott to avoid the hard struggle to unionize the workforce. In the final analysis only organization in the field will bring unionization.To organize Wal-Mart means there must be the will to organize Wal-Mart. It is necessary to go all out to win once the decision has been made to organize this monster along industrial lines, like the automobile industry in the 1930's. Previous local efforts (such as in Quebec and Texas) to organize particular stores have shown that this strategy (or lack of strategy) has been a failure. Wal-Mart is just too big and powerful to be taken on piecemeal. This writer has seen estimates that the number of field organizers necessary to effectively organize Wal-Mart is at least 3000. Militants must call on the organized labor movement to fund and sent out that number en masse. The time is now.Those even slightly familiar with the Wal-Mart operation know that the corporation has a fleet of at least 7000 trucks to transport and deliver goods to its various locations. This should make every militant salivate at the prospect of organizing that fleet. Militants must demand that the Teamsters International Union to organize the fleet. Know this, if the trucks, the key to the distribution process are unionized that is a very powerful argument in the workers' favor if a showdown with other parts of the Wal-Mart workforce is necessary. This writer suggests that militants read Teamster Rebellion and Teamster Power by Farrell Dobbs; a central organizer of the successful Teamster union drives in Minneapolis and later over the road drivers in the 1930's. (These books have been reviewed elsewhere in this space) One thing is sure, if it took practically a civil war to bring the relatively loosely organized trucking company bosses to their knees in the 1930's it will be 1000 times harder to do so against this monolithic giant. But the victory will be sweeter."},{"Title":"Wal-Mart: The Face of Twenty-First-Century Capitalism","review":"My review title pretty much says it all.One sided books are fine if not disguised.

The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War.

The story is told from the perspective of an aging mother hummingbird, allowing readers to experience life through her eyes. The book begins with the voyage of yearly migration, then carries readers through the pains of childbearing to the enlightenment of motherhood. Stevens tells the story in fascinating details that will capture the attention of readers and give them a true sense of what life is like for this tiny little bird.The book includes a CD brimming with music that will enrich the story for readers. The tone and rhythm of the music will convey to readers what words cannot. Lyrics to each song are included in appropriate places throughout the book, guiding readers and allowing them to further enjoy the meaning of the music. Stevens does an excellent job of allowing the music to \\"speak for itself\\" and add to the splendor of the story.The climax to the story comes when the mother hummingbird makes a connection with an \\"upright creature\\" who lives in the house on which the bird has been nesting. The upright creature is an expectant human mother. She has a very touching interaction with the mother hummingbird. Stevens describes it in a way that conveys a sense of compassion for all living beasts, not just mothers and hummingbirds.Though readers may need a page or two to adjust to seeing the world through the eyes of the hummingbird, this captivating story will capture readers and keep them hooked through to the end.

It makes us remember that all things are connected and that the plastic superior view that we so often take from \\"above\\" the natural world is pathetic and shallow.The hummingbird's constant search for food, leaving the nest 40 times a day for food, and shelter for herself and her egg, are not just physical acts but spiritual ones as well. The strong progression between the humans, the pet dogs and the wild bird solidifies the connection between one and all, and renews for us Walt Whitman's, \\"A mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.\\"The sensitive, powerful message conveyed very effectively by the music of word, song, and photography is inspirational.

I want to say that the songs (all done in instrumental) highly speak of the emotional fruits taken out from each of the episodes of a hummingbird's journey. I am inspired to take myself for a walk in the mountains and see for myself what the nature has to say about me and what I could say about the nature. If only I could afford to bring myself in one I can call sanctuary, I would loveto see a hummingbird and gently press my hands against its breast and feel my emotions and its emotions. Everyone of us I think could relate to the book. Symbolical. Emotional but it's not sentimental. I am so delighted to have read such a work where the writer had ultimately captured the soul that is with the hummingbird and in this way, I think, nature is blessedto have a work and a writer that sees her.It was indeed a dramatic, and colorful moment together with the hummingbird. Why should I say just a moment? Well, indeed, a colorful journey. Thanks for letting me read this book.-Henry G AngelesManila, Philippines"},{"Title":"the Greengage Summer","review":"This is one of those books I've bought again and again. It's a beautiful coming-of-age story set in the French countryside. I first read it back when the earth was cooling, and I have no idea what became of that original copy. I bought it again as an adult, loaned it to a friend and never saw it again. I recently bought it yet a third time, a used copy on Amazon, and this one I'm not loaning out.Greengage Summer is a delicious melange of mystery, romance, travel writing, and character study. I'm surprised it's no longer in print, because I truly think it's a classic. It started me reading everything Rumer Godden's written. I like her writing tremendously, but Greengage Summer is her best.When Mum is confined to bed in a small French village, her children are left on their own in the pensione. It's mainly the story of the oldest daughter's blossoming toward maturity, but it's more, much more, than what appears on the surface.Read it, and loan it to a friend - but be sure you get it back!"},{"Title":"the Greengage Summer","review":"The Grey children are taken to France by their mother to visit the battlefields of WW1 in the hope that it will make them less selfish. However, she is taken ill as soon as they arrive at their destination, the hotel Les Oeillets, and the children find themselves bewildered and frightened in a strange land with a barely conscious mother. They are befriended by Eliot, a charming and enigmatic Englishman staying at Les Oeillets, who sorts everything out. With their mother in hospital, the children are free to explore this strange and exotic new world, so different from the dull suburban English town they have come from. They get to know all the people at the hotel, Mamzelle Zizzi, the beautiful but slightly haggard proprietor, who is clearly besotted with Eliot, Madame Corbet, grim and unsmiling, who equally clearly detests him, and all the rest of the staff. They make friends with Paul, an orphan who is an overworked drudge in the kitchen, but dreams of some day owning his own lorry. The story is narrated by Cecil, thirteen years old, who observes everything, especially the growing attraction between Joss, her exquisitely lovely elder sister, and Eliot. As Eliot spends more and more time with the children, Mamzelle Zizzi's jealousy grown, until it finally explodes one night in a scene that terrifies and bewilders the Grey family. The children try to retreat from the scary grownupworld to their safe childhood idyll, but it is too late, the happy atmosphere is poisoned. As Eliot's behaviour grows more mysterious,and Mamzelle Zizzi continues to simmer with jealousy the story heads inevitably towards disaster. All the characters in this book are fascinating, from secretive, sexy Eliot to the drudge Paul, and you feel totally involved in their lives. The atmosphere of a French summer is so vividly described, you can taste the greengages the children stuff themselves with, and smell the eccentric French plumbing. A gripping and poignant story of lost innocence, this book is based on actual events in Rumer Godden's youth, and is quite unforgettable."},{"Title":"the Greengage Summer","review":"I first read it when I was 12 and then again when I was 22. It is a wonderfully written and deepy perceptive book about growing up (amongst a host of other things). Please read this book if you have not and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Other books by Rumer Godden are also brilliant - eg. In this house of Brede, Black Narcissus, Two under the Indian Sun, The River. She is also one of the very few writers who (IMHO) really loves India and writes like she is an insider and not an outsider. Enjoy."},{"Title":"the Greengage Summer","review":"Like many of the other reviewers here, I first read this book when I was about 13. (I am now in my 40's). A few years ago I was lucky enough to find a copy, but was nervous that perhaps it wouldn't be as good as I remembered...however I enjoyed it at least as much as I did when I first read it! I just gave this book to my 11 year old daughter and am enjoying watching her fall in love with it too. The characters are so fascinating, and the descriptions of the french countryside, the old hotel in which the story takes place, and the food just transport you. You hate to see the book end!Rumer Godden is a fabulous writer of both adult and childrens' books; this is definitely my favorite."},{"Title":"the Greengage Summer","review":"I was given this book the spring I turned thirteen by my favorite aunt, who had read it when she was about thirteen. It has become as beloved to me as it was to her. It is a beautifully written story about the pain and excitement that accompany the time in one's life when the things of childhood get left behind for the lures of adulthood. Sensitive, it glorifies neither state, but shows the pains and pleasures of each. I wanted to buy if for my younger sister, and am devastated that it is out of print. If you can find a copy, do. It is infinitely worth the time. But be warned, you too will want to pass this treasure on."},{"Title":"the Greengage Summer","review":"A former &quot;diplobrat&quot; who grew up abroad, I identified with Godden's description of a child's first encounter with France. The effect of their foreign adventure on each family member develops along with an excellent plot (not usually Godden's strong point). Even better than the character descriptions is the evocation of French country life at its most seductive -- &quot;next best to being there.&quot;"},{"Title":"the Greengage Summer","review":"I read this book at the age of 14 (30 years ago) and will always be grateful to Rumer Godden for all she taught me about life. This novel, centered on the conflicts and misunderstandings between adults and children --- and their profound effects --- showed me that somewhere, there was an adult who remembered and understood the pain and confusion of adolescence."},{"Title":"the Greengage Summer","review":"Originally published in 1958,The Greengage Summeris a lush coming of age novel that might have been aimed at the young adult market, featuring as it does the five Grey children virtually on their own in France. Their father is a botanist and seldom home, so their long-suffering mother marches them to the champagne country of the Marne for summer holiday, intending that they should be edified by seeing \\"what other people have given.\\" The bedraggled troupe arrive at a hotel named Les Oeillets where the proprietress, Mademoiselle Zizi, is horrified at the sight of them. Her \\"special friend,\\" the cheerful Englishman Eliot, arranges for Mrs. Grey to have hospital care and appoints himself guardian of the children.The eldest, sixteen-year-old Joss, is taken to bed for some time with a stomach upset. That leaves her thirteen-year-old sister Cecil, our narrator, in charge (so to speak) of the three younger children. They spend their days roaming the gardens, gorging themselves on plums in the greengage orchard, picnicking along the river, and getting their noses into everything while remaining invisible to the adults who don't want to see them anyway. Their slim command of French just adds to the hazy, exotic quality of their holiday.Ah! but Joss and even young Cecil are \\"standing with reluctant feet / where the brook and river meet,\\" writes Godden, quoting Henry Wadworth Longfellow's poem \\"Maidenhood.\\" They learn very little about the war (other than from the bullet holes, blood stains and buried skull carefully restored from time to time at the hotel), but they learn much, much more about the pleasures and risks of adulthood. Joss has blossomed and Eliot can't take his eyes off her, to Mlle Zizi's rage, and then there is the kitchen boy, Paul ...This book has flashes of humor that remind me of another long-loved book: Gerald Durrell'sMy Family and Other Animals. But English author Rumer Godden reveals the dark side of growing up in \\"Greengage,\\" as adult passion and greed lead to actions that the children see as betrayal.So yes, the story is mesmerizing, but oh, the language! It's so rich and atmospheric. \\"...I can smell the Les Oeillets smells of hot dust and cool plaster walls, of jasmine and box leaves in the sun, of dew in the long grass...I can hear the sounds that seem to belong only to Les Oeillets: the patter of the poplar trees along the courtyard wall, of a tap running in the kitchen mixed with the sound of high French voices, of the thump of Rex's tail and another thump of someone washing clothes on the river bank; of barges puffing upstream...of the faint noise of the town and, near, the plop of a fish or of a greengage falling.\\"I listened to this old friend of a book, brilliantly performed by Nicola Pagett. I didn't understand the French conversation quite so well as I did at fifteen, but that was no obstacle to my complete enjoyment of this beatiful book.Linda Bulger, 2010"},{"Title":"the Greengage Summer","review":"When the dog bites, when you're feeling blue, simply get a copy of The Greengage Summer to gorge on its luscious and heady prose. Godden is a timeless writer and I'm fairly sure this started life as 'adult' rather than 'children's' fiction - for all the worth of those meaningless categories. I guess the teen reads didn't exist then and this seething, hormonal coming-of-age novel captures the very essence of that moment when knowing youth casts its spell without being able to foresee the consequences, for it to appeal to younger readers, but I wonder if the hindsight of growing-up add another layer or three. The prose is limpid, laden with resonance and the characters are wondeful. I can smell and see the summer and its dangerous allure. Nicely tragic too (in that noone actually dies, but the consequences of playing with adult-hood are suitably dire!). It is a book I turn to time-and-again and recommend unstintingly to anyone who'll hear me out."},{"Title":"the Greengage Summer","review":"In \\"The Greengage Summer\\" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite.

Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing.

It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the &quot;natural disaster&quot; ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp.

His contant references back to Christ build his every aspect of the setting. The last two pages of this novel are the best two pages of literature that I have ever seen in my 16 years on this earth.

Amazon delivered on time and in perfect condition!!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is my first review so bear with me. This book reminded me a lot of Catch-22 by Heller because of the wartime scene and its cast of characters. Though King Rat is not that humorous, Clavell still wrote a fascinating story.His style so easily reveals the key characters and what they're all about. Learning about King and Marlowe and Grey - early in the book, you know everything you need to know about them. The key is the dynamics between them - the interaction between them. I enjoyed every conversation between Marlowe and the King because I as the reader could feel the electricity.As it happens with any good story, you get so immersed in &quot;their&quot; (prisoners') situation, that you suddenly realize how much your view has changed throughout the story. That is good writing.I tried hard to read Clavell's Shogun - heck I went traveling to another country and still couldn't finish it - it's too long - it was a great epic but I needed answers or conclusions. King Rat is much shorter and as powerful.One other mention - the version I bought included 5 or 6 sets of 10-15 pages that discussed what happened to a few of the wives of the prisoners. You can buy either version - the story of the wives' is interesting and touching, but you're not going to get your sappy Hollywood ending in this one so it doesn't add to the story much."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Actually, I rate this an 11. This was the first, and the fifth, and the last Clavell novel that I have read (yes, I read it three times). Clavell even coproduced an excellent movie adaptation in the late 60's (though filmed purposely in black and white) which captured the entire mood of the book. The reason that this book works so well is that Clavell himself lived the story. The character of Peter Marlowe is based on Clavell himself, and it shows.This book is a brutal, depressing display of humanity at its basest. Not for the light hearted, but a must for anyone interested in WWII or in Asia."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"First of all this is the first book I have read by James Clavell and I really enjoyed it. Some of my first thoughts were that the prison was not quite as horrible as I expected, but that is where Clavell did a good job allowing us to see the prison through the eyes of the prisoners. This was a really drmactic page turner for the specific reasons that there are so many levels of plot development and happenings.The two main characters are a British air officer named Marlowe and an American named the King. This book is of course about the psyche and human nature of survival in the face of insurmountable odds. When you read through the book you will think King is not so bad and doing what it takes to survive. By the end you will see the results of his behaviors, actions, and results. The last few pages are poetic and intense. I have read a lot of novels, and this one in my opinion is up there with the classics. Also King Rat could be read by people with all kinds of varying interests and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"As others have noted, this is James Clavell's first novel and definitely the most difficult for him to write. It deals with the Changi POW camp that Clavell himself was imprisoned in during the latter stages of the Second World War. Clavell's pain of having to revisit the very harsh memories of Changi will leave most readers with a better understanding of human sacrifice and survival.Although part of the Asian saga, King Rat can stand alone as an excellent WW2 memoir. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This book, like all of Clavell's historical fiction, pulled me in within the first five pages. The gripping story of life within a WW2 POW camp is disturbing, enlightening and dramatic all at once. The story centers around two characters and their reactions to the horror around them. As we get deeper into their lives we begin to get a picture of why life is worth living and the way that it should be lived. The ending of the book is much more telling than the end of most of Clavell's books and does a fine job of summarizing the book's overall purpose. By far, this is the best book that I have ever read by Clavell."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I read this book in a long London-Toronto flight. I just could not put it off.James Clavell continues to exercise its magic by creating a captivating universe that make us dream about the relative value of things. How much would you pay for a rat leg ?We follow the king in its daily rulings and dealings with its subjects, all prisonners of war in a Japanese camp during WWII. How can a corporal rule a camp and its general. How can cunning and ruthlessness elevate a man on a throne. This is a very strange american dream that is depicted in this novel.All rights reserved to The Reviewer Provided by courtesy to Amazon.com"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat serves up a tale of advantage and envy in a less than desirable enviroment, the Changi prison. Changi prison becomes a microcosm of human nature and how base it can really sink when all the comforts and luxuries that so many take for granted are stripped away. A vicious Darwinism takes over as those who can survive and those who can't barely exist or worse. Is the Rat wrong to make himself (&amp; his cohorts to a lesser extent) as comfortable as possible during his stay in Changi? That is the question the reader has to ask themselves after reading this novel. Some of the King Rat characters are referenced further in Clavell's chronicle of the Straun family &amp; Asian business intrigue, &quot;Noble House&quot;."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"All right, so King Rat's a thriller, used bookstore fodder for thirteen year olds. It's still one of the best in the genre, with great characterizations and an ending that puts to shame most of today's &quot;profound&quot; bestsellers. King Rat differs in its psychological, internal approach to the POWs trapped inside the a Japanese camp in Singapore. Buy it for the thrills, but read it for the emotion."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Well... I really despise reading. I hate it with a passion. There has never been a time when I decide to just &quot;pick up a book&quot; for a good time, I usually won't even consider that in my plans. However, a few summers ago I picked up King Rat. And I picked it up again a few weeks later. I lost it, but bought it last summer. I finished it in a weekend because I just couldn't put it down. I read it again a couple weeks ago. Every time you finish that book, something just comes over you, I swear it. It's the most amazing book I have ever, or will ever read in my entire life. Now that that's done, I can go paint my nails."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"At one time or another I've read most or all of James Clavell's novels. KING RAT is by far my favorite. I've lost count of the number of times I've read this novel. I also own the movie version of the story on DVD; and yes, I've lost count of the number of times I've watched the movie. I like the book better.Clavell survived as a POW in WWII. The sub-story is that the Peter Marlowe character in KING RAT is a fictionalized version of James Clavell and that the Corporal King character is a fictionalized version of the buddy in the Japanese camp who actually saved Clavell's life.I think all of Clavell's novels made it to either TV or Movie form; in some cases he wrote the screenplays, in most, not (he was too busy doing other more important things in Hollywood, or writing his next blockbuster novel). His career in Hollywood is almost as impressive as his novels (Due to lessons he learned the hard way in the POW camp? Correction: Due to lessons he learned the hard way in the POW camp!). Did you know that Clavell wrote the movie THE FLY? Did you know that Clavell co-wrote the movie THE GREAT ESCAPE? Did you know that Clavell wrote and directed the movie TO SIR, WITH LOVE?I won't sport with your intelligence by relating the plot of the famous KING RAT story as told in novel and movie beyond to say that it is the story of how an American prisoner in a Japanese internment camp became more powerful than the Japanese warden.For those fond of \\"How To\\" books like How To Succeed In Business, or How To Win At War, I wouldn't mess with SUN TZU or the latest rewording of Machiavelli. Go to KING RAT.@hg47"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"James Clavell is renowned for his works such as _Shogun_ and _Noble House_. This darkly autobiographical novel was, so far as I am aware, his first literary work. It remains his best.Clavell was a prisoner of the Japanese. He was held at the infamous Changi prison on the eastern end of Singapore island as described in the novel. Like the protagonist, Peter Marlowe, Clavell came from a good family, though due to his eyesight he was in the Royal Artillery, not the Royal Air Force (a little harmless wish-fulfillment, there).I think the novel impresses so many readers due to its stark simplicity and forthrightness, particularly in describing the moral dilemmas that confront Marlowe. With the issue of survival in the balance, does morality become relative? Marlowe concludes that the only man who could answer his questions, his father, is dead-- killed on the Murmansk run. But just as Changi is rebirth for Marlowe, perhaps it is the King-- the trader with the Japanese-- who becomes Marlowe's father and answers those questions.There are many, many layers to this book. I have read it many times and have always walked away with something new. As with the Changi experience, itself, I sense that there is never complete resolution.Clavell died several years ago. I hope that he found peace.Add this work to testaments like Iris Chang's, _The Rape of Nanking_, as a remembrance of what the Japanese did to the defeated."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Of all Clavell's books, this has always been my favorite. I will not deny that Clavell tends to use the same story and characters in every novel (compare shogun with tai-pan and noble house). I love all his books (even gai-jin which few seem to enjoy), but King Rat is the best. It really makes you think about human nature, and what's really important in life. All these people grew up in a certain lifestyle, and suddenly and thrown together in a POW camp, and under brutal circumstances. I have done research on POW camps at this time,and the findings are not pleasant, so it really is interesting to see how people change, and what they really value. Seeing as how Mr. Clavell spent time in Changi himself, all that we see in King Rat is an extension of that, and so you can really appreciate what he endured. It for these above reasons that I truly enjoyed this book above his other great novels, and why I have read several times over."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat has many unique aspects amongst the other novels in the Asian saga:- It was written first, with less connections to the rest of the series.- It's the shortest of the lot.- It's the most autobiographical, as Clavell spent time in that same prison.- There is the least cross-cultural interaction.Having said all of this, this WWII POW survival story is a compelling study of what people do to survive. In a sense, we all become rats, with one as king. Much of the book studies the manipulations between folks vying for power. There are the Americans trying to enforce prison standards. There are people living off of rank to hold a grasp of dignity. And then there is the King of the title, who finds a way to transcend above the problems, living off the black market and a network of informants.We are introduced to the character that most closely resembles Clavell in this novel too. Though he reappears in Noble House, we first catch the author as the King's sidekick, a downed soldier who has to struggle with where his loyalties are.I can not recommend the series enough. Whether you go through it chronologically as written, or in the order of time periods written about, you'll find this a deep addition to the series."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is the only only book that written that in my opinion supplants Clavell's own Shogun as perhaps the best historical novel ever written.Partly autobiographical, King Rat recounts the story of Phillip Marlowe, a character no doubt based on Clavell himself, and his years spent in the notorious Singapore POW camp known as Changi during WW2.What is so stunning about this novel, is that perhaps because of the very real life experiences that forged its narrative, it becomes more than mere words on paper, it becomes a very real world where the old class lines are broken down as officers and enlisted men sleep in the same mud huts, where getting an egg in your rice for dinner constitutes a great day, a transvestite becomes the sexual icon of the whole camp and the very concept of traditional ethics and morals are challenged.What makes this novel so very magical is that the depth with which the characters and their respective personalities and fates resonate with the readers, their laughter becomes your laughter, their sorrow becomes your sorrow, their joy becomes your joy, very rarely is a novel simultaneously able to so superbly entertain and make you affect your outlook on life, after the end of this short novel you will feel as if you have emerged from three years in a Singapore prison camp, and like the men in this novel, you will never be the same again."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This book is lumped into the &quot;Asian Saga&quot; series of James Clavell, and yes, it takes place in Asia, but bears no other true resemblance to the rest of the saga. It's shorter, of course, but it's also not an epic...it takes place in a POW camp almost entirely.The character of King, the American trader who lives high-on-the-hog through his wheeling and dealing, is fascinating in the feelings of hatred &amp; envy he generates. Everyone wants to be close to him, not because they like him, but because he can afford to give away cigarettes, share an egg, pour coffee, etc. He has learned to manipulate the system totally to look out for #1.He makes friends with unassuming British fighter pilot Peter Marlowe, who at first acts and translator and later as partner and friend to King. His character goes through lots of development, and he is really the conscious of the camp. Although not written in the first person, we really see things through his eyes.The book is packed full of colorful characters, many sketched only briefly, yet Clavell makes us see them all, and understand them.THere are moments of high drama, where our characters are close to being caught or captured, and the plot moves at a brisk pace.I found the ending of the story to be just a tiny bit rushed, BUT it made some powerful statements. When the war ends, the fear that sweeps through the camp, first that the Japanese will take vengeance on the POWs and second, the fear of &quot;what do we do now,&quot; is very convincing. It's not what I ever thought the liberation of a POW camp would be like, and it really made me stop and think. And the dynamics that occur when the first officers from &quot;outside&quot; show up to help liberate the camp are fascinating.This book is an exploration of the human spirit that is dramatic, moving, occasionally funny and always unexpected. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"James Clavell's King Rat is a poignant, resonating tale about humanity and struggle in incredibly dire situations--namely, the World War II Japanese prison camp of Changi.The bulk of the story, consisting of the life-and-death daily turmoil among the POWs, is deeply affecting and intriguing. Clavell writes concisely and powerfully. The brief descriptions and terse dialog amplify the emotion and passion of the story. It is not often that a book is truly \\"hard to put down\\" for me, but this was one of them. The pace of the book and the compassion I developed for the characters was such that I really didn't want to stop.The ending left me profoundly melancholy--not necessarily a bad thing. Clavell creates intense moral questions for the reader about honor, duty, loyalty, love, and a thousand other human emotions. As the war ends and the prisoners are faced with the somehow-terrorizing concept of returning to normal life, the reader comes to grips with what truly matters in life, the hope and faith of the POWs, and the joy of life in the face of death.King Rat is a whirlwind of emotion and adventure. It will heighten your understanding of World War II history and leave you questioning. A grand tale."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"An American corporal manages to swindle and manipulate his way to being the &quot;King&quot; of a Japanese POW camp. The one thing that sets this aside from Clavell's three other novels that I have read, aside from being semi autobiographical is the protagonist. The King has a rascal like charm to him that makes the character highly readable and fun. He is the underdog. Plotting and conniving to make a buck and sticking it to his superiors and relishing it. A man in the right place at the right time. He befriends a British Lieutenant by the name of Marlowe (A nice little nod to Joseph Conrad) whose honor and integrity is arguably the the conflict in the book. Finally, on the opposite end of the spectrum, you have the dutiful yet pitful antagonist Lieutenant Grey. Who, while morally and lawfully in the right, alienates himself by taking himself too seriously. These three make for some great tension and are the main drive of the story.I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not an epic, despite this being his most personal story. However, Clavell fans will not be disappointed. The protagonist thinks two steps ahead of everyone else (I would hate to play chess with the author) and I would not be surprised if King's shrewdness was a precursor to Toranaga in Shogun. Any less qualified author would have made this story into glorified genre pulp. For those struggling for a visual reference, think Bridge on the River Kwai and Pappilon. A great read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This, in my opinion, is the best of three books and movies about Japanese World War II prisoner of war camps. The others, also very good, are Bridge on the River Kwai and Empire of the Sun.The theme is how men survive in the horrendous conditions of POW camps. Set in one of the worst camps, Changi, near Singapore, an American corporal, called The King, thrives. He is street-smart, unscrupulous, the most powerful man among the 10,000 prisoners, and somewhat appealing in his vulnerability. The King is also honest -- at least about himself -- and the only other honest person in the book is his antagonist, the wretched, diarrhea-ridden British cop, Grey, who is attempting to rise above his lower-class origins. Most of the other British officers in the book are revealed to be vicious hypocrites.The King and his callow, worshipful friend, a British pilot named Marlowe, outsmart everyone...but then the war ends, and the real world begins again. This is a good tale on several levels: adventure, survival, an insider's look at a Japanese POW camp, and an examination of the differences between Brits and Americans. The movie rates five stars. The book is almost there."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Warning: this is a disturbing book. It is gripping and enthralling, but horrifying. It shows men being tested to the utmost, and the many bad qualities this brings out. But it also shows true friendship and cooperation against adversity.Clavell truly brings to life a POW camp of Englishmen and Americans (captives of the Japanese) and the horrors they were subject to. Men help each other survive, but also betray each other, and are jealous of each other's success. The King, an American soldier, is especially envied because he is extremely skilled at trading and making deals. He and the Englishman Peter Marlowe are the main characters, but there are also stories of other men and how they survive.The ending is perhaps the most frightening part of the whole book. The prisoners are freed at the end of WWII, and as they leave the camp, they must learn to be part of the world again, and not the world they created. I won't spoil anything more. For anyone who can handle its intensity, \\"King Rat\\" is an eye-opening read."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"There we go again, after Shogun this is my second book by clavell. The best thing about the book is that the author did not try to justify the war. Japs were not the villains. Its was something bigger....situations...the situation,time was the biggest enemy. Just how mean people can get when the find themselves in bad situations. it is quiet true people can actually forget that they are fighting for the good side when it comes to saving their lifes.Mr clavel who actually went through all this, has written the book with an emotion (cant tell axactly is it anger or nostalgia)The book is a must read for every book lover"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Book is about World War II.Prison in Singapore,officers and soldiers,relationships,tragedy they all must go through.Very tens and brutal story."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"After reading Tai-Pan, I obviously wanted more of the same. This is exactly what King Rat is. It takes place in a very different time and surroundings, but you know you're reading James Clavelle.

But its writing will put you where the charater is. James works still lives to this day. It is amazing! The story of how one man controls a prison, how a man is pitted by his wits to his what he can take phsycaly. If you like lititure books, then James Clavell is the best at his books. Try it out. And try out Shogun!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I borrowed this book from my grandfather, and I was amazed. Such an intricate, fascinating story of of human mental survival. It's incredible how some, when put in a certain situation, die easily, while others have what it takes mentally to survive. It is an excellent book and of all of James Clavell's, this is my favorite."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is a magnificent book. It details the horrors of war and the inhumane conditions POWs were forced to face, but it also is a carefully crafted tale of friendship, and how people can thrive in the most unlikely places. I disagree with the reviewer who thinks it is a depressing book - it is a novel of the human spirit, with a dash of good old capitalism thrown in for good measure.Again, it is a wonderful book. It will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I'll be honest, this is a depressing book. But it is about a depressing subject. This is a semi-autobiographical look at the author's internment in one of the Japanese's POW camps, Changi. It is a statement on the ingenuity and cunning of mankind, but also of its brutality. If you're looking for a quick, solid read, this is it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read ... Easily, easily the best book by this author"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Once again James Clavell has exceeded my expectations and written a real gem. The characters and scenery are so richly described that I felt I was in the camp with these unfortunate men. I would encourage anyone to take the time to read this book...and then, go back and read the rest of his novels."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The way that James Clavell compared humans to rats at the end of the book. It really showed how humans can revert to their basic instinct when it is nessesary."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat, tied with Shogun, is the best of Clavell's Asian Saga. He incorporated, and illustrated the very core of what it is to be a man. What makes this book an instant classic, is the simple, yet horrific, setting. Also, Clavell was able to fill each page with such meaning, he didn't have to make a several-hundred-page-behemoth of a book in order to digest the meaning within it. Compelling was the depth that a man falls to in such a desolate existance, and the measures required to lift a man up to some degree of dignity. For his ability to depict the strength of charicter of this western man in asia, Clavell has earned a place of honor among the great novellest of our time."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Great! Reminded me of The great escape only without the escape. Very moving."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The book is deeply moving and thought provoking. What is really important in life? How would I develop or handle such circumstances if put to reality? What is moral or not and where is the fine line between survival and death? All of these questions are posed by Clavell... What a masterful portrayal! Clavell is such an outstanding writer! Sho-gun was my first read.. This one is a classic also!! Recommended."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The whole time devoted to reading this book was a magic spell to me. This book must be recommended as a text book for students. Because you can see the diffrences between haves and have-nots, how they become what they are, how strong the diffrences are. In KOREA we have a similar novel &quot;OUR DISTORTED HERO&quot; by a famous writer. but 'KING RAT&quot; is more vivid and has more juice. Reading this book you are going to see what your life will be like. And in the end you are going to get this result,&quot;LIFE IS BUT A DREAM&quot;"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is another fabulous work by James Clavell, a stand-out in his collection. Even though the book was set in a prison camp, all I thought about was that I wanted to be 'The King'. A rivetting story of life and death, friendship and betrayal. Shorter than his other works, but equally valuable."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The King visits the jungle village. James has shown them to be predominantly Muslims. Yet they are having a feast of Pork. I have read and have all the books of James Clavell and enjoy them . I feel this is a gross mistake.VIRENDRA PAWAR PUNE INDIA e-mail: delta @vsnl.com"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Just finished Kindle version of King Rat, by James Clavell.This book is the product of a bad OCR-scan to make it \\"Kindle-ready.\\"- Quotation marks are often backwards, particularly in double-quotations.- The elipses character (...) which is used often in this book, is translated as an ampersand (&).- Good luck with anything italicized. I sometimes had to track down the paperback version to figure it out.These typos are prevalent and knocked a full star off my review.A scheming, hustling American Army corporal known as \\"The King\\" befriends an upper-crust Royal Air Force leftennant in a Japanese WWII POW camp. Both men adhere to well-developed, but radically different, codes of honor, and the novel is an exploration of their unlikely friendship and struggle to remain men (by their definitions) against the corrupting desolation of the prison. The matter-of-fact tone of King Rat pegs it as a 1960s paperback. Brutality and filth are background noise; the book alludes to the horrors of the camp without dwelling on them. The many characters and sub-plots of the book at times weave into complex and ingenious knots of suspense and drama, but Clavell isn't interested in calamity or resolution, so tensions are often smoothed over anti-climactically. Nothing much happens, and the pointlessness of prison life may be the point of the novel.More interesting are the exploits of \\"The King.\\" Originally presented as a conniving anti-hero, the only prisoner with a clean shirt and fresh underwear in a world where hungry men pawn their wedding rings for extra food, The King's honorable, if twisted, nature is slowly revealed and developed. Also, we come to see that the other characters in the camp, pitiable though they are, are just as corrupt as The King. There's no one to like, so the reader is left siding with the one character he/she can understand. The camp MP, a Dudley Do-Right named Lieutenant Grey, is instantly vile as the vile camp tattletale, but ends up almost the hero of the book simply because his devotion to pointless rules and laws doesn't look so bad once everyone else's dirty secrets are known.There were way too many people named \\"Sergeant\\" and \\"Colonel\\" in this novel. You'll need to put out a casting call for imaginary extras if, like me, you need to put faces to names when you read fiction.This may be the only WWII novel in which all the major characters are in the armed forces, many of them die, and yet not a single shot gets fired (okay, one bullet at the end, but it's incidental). People die from malaria, starvation, despair, snakebite, and suffocation in an outhouse (ew!) The violence in this book is largely internal and muffled.Note 1: James Clavell was a British soldier who was captured and interned in Singapore's Changi POW camp for the final months of WWII. The Changi prison of his novel is far harsher than the real POW camp was, according to most survivors and historians. (I'm sure the real Changi was no picnic, either.) Clavell is honest enough to insist in the preface that the book is entirely fictional."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is set in a Japanese prisoner camp in World War II. Most of the novel deals with the interactions among the prisoners (who are British, Australian, American, etc.) and between the prisoners and the guards. The main theme is whether or not each prisoner is morally required to help the other prisoners, or whether in this setting it's &quot;every man for himself&quot;. The main character is someone who took every possible advantage for himself at the expense of the other prisoners. He becomes the most powerful force in the camp, but he has to sacrifice his humanity to do so. I found this book to be well written and thought provoking; I would recommend it to anyone but especially to anyone contemplating military service."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Clavell is the best story teller of the twentieth century. His works are accurate, compelling, and timeless. An hour with this book &quot;King Rat&quot; goes by like a second. I have read Shogun, while much longer, it is also impossible to put down. Buy this book now."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"A very good read, this novel is more \\"complex\\" in the character development then Tai Pan or Noble House. But the plot centers on an anti-hero, and shows the darker side of capitalism. A sharp break from the heroic figures of industry that I personally loved in Tai Pain and Noble House. After finishing the book you may be a little upset and wondering \\"what the point was the novel trying to get across?\\" I honestly don't know, the ending leaves you trying to figure things out on your own. But that's the beauty of the book at the same time as its biggest fault. This is a book you appreciate more and more after finishing it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Although there is nothing patently wrong with King Rat, it is my least favorite of the first three books in Clavell's Asian Saga. The novel takes place entirely within a POW camp run by the Japanese in Singapore. The plot is engaging and I spent a couple of days eagerly flipping pages until the end, but I didn't get the sense that I had learned anything about Singapore the way that I felt I had learned about Japan and Hong Kong from reading Shogun and Taipan. In the book's defense, it is an excellent account of life in a POW camp and the ends to which people will go to survive in them, but I am hoping that King Rat is not a harbinger of things to come for the remaining books in the series."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is a fairly accurate depiticion of life in a Japanese POW camp. He glosses over the harsher points of camp life, but leaves enough to give a good pitcure."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I hadn't read anything of Clavell's before &quot;King Rat,&quot; so I came to him fresh and with no preconceived notions. I enjoyed this book, but found the ending somewhat unsatisfying.Still, I would recommend &quot;King Rat&quot; for its apparently realistic view of the horrors of a POW camp and the lengths to which the human spirit will go to survive. The main character IS an interesting fellow."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is my first James Clavell novel. In a nutshell, it is a Japanese version of Stalag 17. It is the story of American, British, and Australian POW's at Changi prison camp. A place where the real world is turned completely upside down. In addition to being prisoners, the POW's find their ranks are meaningless. Devoid of societal/military rules &quot;the strong&quot; survive. #1 is &quot;the King,&quot; an American corporal who runs the prison camp from the inside.The King effectively manipulates everyone in the camp from Colonels on down, through his payroll system. If you want money, eggs, cigarettes, medicine, you have to see the King. If you want to sell something, everyone knows you go through the King.Suspense is derived from the near misses of getting caught by the Japanese or the pip-squeak MP, Captain Grey. Grey's sole motivation is catching the King &quot;breaking the rules.&quot; Much of the action is seen through the eyes of Peter Marlowe, an affable English lieutenant to whom the King takes a liking due to his command of the local language and it's value to the King in trading and conversing with the guards.The King teeters on the edge of good and evil throughout the book, never completely falling off the fence to either side. Under the circumstances, the reader tends to forgive the King's &quot;business&quot; dealings over this lack of compassion for the suffering around him. But when the suffering befalls Marlowe, the King reacts as a true friend and saves Marlowe's arm from amputation.The finale is somewhat ambiguous and anticlimactic. The man who was once on top, the King, is reduced to a lowly corporal again and the many officers and outranking enlisted men are quick to see the King put back into his place when they are rescued and order is restored.The books is adequate at best as there are no major conflicts or plot twists. But it is one of the few books telling the story of a Japanese POW camp."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I had read this book over 30 years ago as a teenager and thought it would be interesting to see how I reacted to it now. It's a fun and easy read, I'll admit that. But I can see why I liked it more as a 14-year-old; the book seems to have been written by a 14-year-old. And the \\"moral dilemmas\\" are of the kind you probably dealt with when you first learned what a \\"moral dilemma\\" is.And although the copy I read was a paperback from the early 1980's that was in its umpteenth printing, it had a surprising number of typos and major grammatical errors. I guess even back then no one took the book too seriously."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I read this when I was 15, so I don't know if it was 'deep' or anything, but I can say I enjoyed it quite a bit."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"After Shogun one would expect much better. Compared with Shogun, King Rat is rather 2D. The plot is not as engrossing. I think readers will have a difficult time getting into the story. The ending is somewhat predictable (what do YOU think happens to all the prisoners?)and there are many things that are never explained (who is the informant that knew about the radio? ). On the whole an entertaining book, but it moves slowly and doesnt go anywhere (how exciting can life in a prison be anyway? :P )"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I'd heard such good things about this book, and couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I found it really slow. I read the paperback version, and to be honest, I couldn't bring myself to finish the book.

Unlike the other installments of the series this is intensely intimate and the author does a great job expressing the feelings and agony of survival in the camp. With the constant specter of death in its many forms (tropical diseases, betrayal and starvation) hang over these men you can't help but get involved in there tale."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I first read King Rat back in about 1988 and decided to read it again last month. Twenty-two years later, it has lost none of its greatness. I enjoyed reading it back then and I enjoyed reading it again this time around, perhaps even more so because I have learned a lot more about World War II in the Pacific theatre since then. Other reviewers have already done a splendid job of explaining the story and the reasons why they gave it five stars, I'll just toss my own five stars into the mix by saying this is a terrific book and a powerful, though-provoking story that is well worth anyone's time."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"As many have noted, King Rat is based on Clavell's own experiences at the dreaded Changi POW camp in Singapore during WWII.Filled with unforgettable scenes and characters, and tightly written, this book grabs you on the first page and never lets go.There are numerous set pieces -- the poker game, the rat farm, the diamond sale, the camp liberation, I could go on.Add to this a powerful tale of morality amid immoral conditions, and a search for what it means to be a man amid inhumane surroundings, and you have a tremendous story that is brilliantly told.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Overall (with the exception of the ending) this book was a solid five stars and is second only to Shogun in my opinion. There are so many things going on in this book, and I could not stop turning the page.The ending on the other hand was extremely anticlimactic - hence my four-star. Sofar I have read the first four books in the Asian Saga including King Rat, and all of these books have an ending that falls flat. I was so angry when I read about what happened to the King. His sudden change in status is never really explained, and only if Clavell had made all of his endings good (Shogun was the only one with a halfway decent ending), then this series would inch its way over to a five-star rating."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is a brilliant work. I was fully vested in each and every character. Whether or not you like the populace of this prison camp, if you sympathize with the honest or the desperate, you will care about the men portrayed in this effort. Even the Japanese guards are well rendered and have substance. Read it!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The setting is a Japanese POW camp near Singapore in early 1945. After years of Japanese neglect,near starvation diets, tropical diseases, and increasing hopelessness of liberation, British,Australian, and American prisoners are dropping like flies. A young and idealistic British pilot,Peter Marlowe, forms an unlikely friendship with a clever, street-smart enlisted American, 'theKing'. While all the prisoners are literally walking skeletons suffering from every disease thetropics have to offer, the King inexplicably manages to eat, live, and dress normally. The King'ssecret? Trading.However, in Changi trading is a zero-sum gain and absolutely forbidden. (In this strange world, thecommanding British officers strictly enforce Japanese orders against their fellow inmates.) For oneprisoner to eat, another will go hungry (ier). And the King is the master at not going hungry -looking out for No. 1. The king even outtrades his captors. Life is comparatively sweet for theKing, albeit lonely. After all, the entire camp burns with covetous envy regarding the King.Nearly, everyone depends on the King, though, to make a life-saving trade - a watch for a bowl ofrice, $20 for an orange, etc. The King decides to take the unaffected Marlowe under his wing as asort of junior partner.Marlowe is decidedly fascinated by this dynamic man (without a conscience?). And the King, in turn,remains mystified by Marlowe's idealism and self-sacrifice. The King lets Marlowe in on hisadventures and his secrets, something the whole camp would like to know, too. The ever imaginativeKing comes up with a brilliant scheme to both make money AND get revenge on his camp enemies. Andthis perverted world comes to a surrealistic end with the closing of the Pacific War. Though somesurvive Changi, the experience will haunt the survivors for the rest of their lives. The question iswho will survive.This is an outstanding book, which I read in the space of two days, barely able to put the book down.Clavell's book - based on his actual imprisonment in Changi - describes the truly surrealistic worldof an actual Japanese POW camp and the men within it. However, it is strictly a fictional account -only 2% of the prisoners held in Changi died according to the Australian War Memorial's Creation of Changi Prison Museum article by Kevin Blackburn."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"We should be really grateful for the strike that prevented Clavell to work as a screenplay writer and director for a few weeks in the early sixties and led them to write his first novel. In this edition there is a nice prologue by his daughter explaining what prompted him to write this book, and how quickly he wrote it. The novel is a fictionalized retelling of Clavell's experiences in a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Singapore.Clavell does an amazing job in describing the personalities of the different characters that take part in the story. The fact that the camp held American, English and Australian prisoners provided him with the opportunity to showcase his acute understanding of the different cultures. If you add on top of that the Japanese and the locals that were in charge of managing the camp, you will find a wealth of characters that make this a mesmerizing read. There are two characters though, that are at the center of this tale, and whose actions could serve as a study in sociology. One is an American, the King, who is a corporal that has the ability to facilitate commerce, which is prohibited by camp rules, and therefore makes a very nice living, especially when compared with everyone else. When the King meets Peter Marlowe, a British Lieutenant, the contrast of personalities and moral codes could not be clearer. Thus starts an unusual friendship that will test Marlowe's character and convictions, since he will have to decide between compromising his morals in return for better living conditions for him and his friends, and sticking to his guns and keep on living miserably.One thing that you can tell as soon as you start reading this novel, and that is confirmed later, is that Clavell is an excellent narrator and has a gift for describing characters and give them a soul. This helps understand how he can hold the reader's attention without it wavering in lengthy novels likeShogun. In this case, the parts that deal with the secret commerce help provide the story with variety, because they speed up the pace and change the tone. It is also interesting that this edition includes the passages related to the situation of those left behind, mainly wives and kids. These provide additional insights into the lives of the prisoners, helping us understand their motivations and behavior better.In summary, this can only be defined as an excellent read. Although it has some scenes that may be hard on some readers for their brutality, I believe that the great majority of people will love it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Circa 1962 Clavell astounds the reader with his insight to the human condition. From the beginning until the end, King Rat never ceases to surprise and evoke the dark humor concurrent withthe grim reality of terrible circumstances. I remember seeing this book in countless rucks during Viet Nam, read and re-read, taped together, dog eared and in heavily stressed condition then, passed along."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is the first book that I've read by James Clavell and I'll have to say I will most likely be reading more of them. I chose to read this book as a history assignment and it is perfectly historically accurate. It shows the struggles POWs went through where tobacco is such a prized possession men stoop as low as to pick others used tobacco from the ground. The plot line is slow to realize but becomes more evident as the book becomes harder to read (pages 150 on). Overall the book really makes us feel for the people that fought for us in WW2."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Great Book and Series. This was the 3rd time through the Series. Just wish they had the Last and Final book in the Series which was \\"Whirlwind\\" when I was ready for it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This book is, without a doubt, one of the quickest reads I've ever seen. Though about 300 pages long, one could realistically breeze through it in a day. Why? Because the story flows so well as to keep one engrossed. There's never a dull moment; it's always interesting, and the profiles of the main characters are excellent and poignant. Clavell's real-life experience as a prisoner at Changi really shows, as he masterfully captures the atmosphere, mood, and times of life in a prison camp.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is historically accurate and emotionally compelling.

That the author lived through the experience is clear as one reads.

Very real, thought-provoking. This is my first Clavell novel (although I did watch all of Shogun on DVD) and have to say I'll be reading more of his in the near future.I liked the texture, the rawness of it all. A story of poor, helpless prisoners who create their own little 'society' if you will, in this war camp in South East Asia. Imagine having to eke it out in those conditions.Overall, this book kept me glued and it hasn't aged a day..."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is the fourth book in James Clavell's \\"Asian Saga\\". It is also the first book he wrote and the one that is closest to being autobiographical.King Rat really can be read as a stand alone novel. It is only about 350 pages long and doesn't involve any characters from previous novels (even though Peter Marlowe and Robin Grey appear in Noble House). It is about a Japanese prisoner of war camp called Changi in World War II.The King is an American soldier who trades camp members' valuable items to the guards for money which can then be used to buy contraband food. This is against Japanese rules and, thus, camp rules but most officers turn a blind eye to the trading. Robin Grey is the exception and he sets out to catch the King and humble him.King Rat is a very accurate depiction of Japanese prisoner of war camps in World War II and shows that the only true rule in the camp is to survive.The forward of the book mentions that the original publication had removed the women's perspectives. I am glad they added those parts back in, even though I wish they could have been a little more fleshed out. The big question at the end of the book is \\"what happens when the surviving soldiers go home?\\" We don't learn the answer to that question (even though we know a few things about the people left behind that the men aren't aware of) but that is the point. Changi has been the entire world for these men for so long and now that they are free, how do they go back to \\"normal\\"?"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This book King Rat, is one of the best genre fiction books you could ever come across. The detail of the plot is just so unexpected. All this happened in a miserable military concentration camp (which is what it was in Changi during ww 2) It is fresh and well written and psychologically real as if it was written recently and yet the book itself is older than the Beatles. There are at least 5 astoundingly original characters in this book as well as the usual corruptable military types.Corporal King (King Rat) is one of the less astounding but is completely believable as a street wise American who benefits from the moral shambles aroung him.The author, the late James Clavell-an Englisman- was imprisoned in Changi by the Japanese, himself as a young Captain.It is beautifully written within the tough prisoner genre that the book belongs to.If you like WW 2 stories about near triumphs and near misses over moral corruption you will really admire this classic book."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Whether you are a fan of Clavell's Asian Saga or a casual reader, you will surely enjoy his first major book about prisoners of war at Changi in Sinapore during the Japanese occupation. Because Clavell himself spent time in the POW camp, he has a real perspective of what life was like in the camp. He is able to describe to the reader a sense of competitive community that the prisoners had amongst one another and that it seemed the Japanese hardly had a role at all. One enterprising character is able to make a great deal of money and garner a large amount of supplies at the envy of most others. The title itself has a cryptic meaning that only reading the book will dissolve...."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is the great ass-whuppin' that released James Clavell's literary chi-flow and allowed him to become the eternal master of intelligent historical potboilers. Never mind Umberto Eco's \\"Seven Seas Jim\\" high-cappin' in \\"Foucalt's Pendulum,\\" James Clavell lays down some staggeringly beautiful historical yarns. And this, the one that came straight from his own horrifying experiences, is the one that started it all.Where Remarque, Hasek, Grass, Vonnegut, Heller (and the list goes on) tell us the obvious truth that war sucks, Clavell fell into the ninth circle that the others were lucky enough to avoid. And he emerged with one novel that will make you sick even while you enjoy the heck out of it.King Rat, while short and spare, is truly the prerequisite to Shogun, Tai Pan, and all his other novels. That every subsequent novel makes peace with his one-time tormentors is even more extraordinary."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"When I started to read King Rat I was not sure what to expect. I was hoping for a cross between \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\" and \\"The Great Escape.\\" Well I was kind of right on both counts.King Rat is an authentic novel written from Clavell's past experiences in a Japanese prison camp during the war.In a nutshell, we have an American, called The King who, back in America was as plain as dirt and who came from humble beginnings. Well ironically, while in Prison, his rough upbringing was just the thing that made him a survivor/local hero among the other enlisted men, yet among the educated British officers he was a trouble maker who wouldn't conform to the rules of the prison. To the Rat prison was the best thing that ever happened to him.Clavell, spent very little time on the Japanese. This novel dealt mainly with the interactions of the prisoners.Rather that a prison/war novel I felt this was more or less a character study of class systems. King Rat illustrates to us that a down and out loser from America who couldn't get arrested before the war, can become the most important and cunning survivor during the war. Because, when it is the comes down to it, this is the rule of the jungle, dog eat dog . Just like the actual rat, we loathe them, we try to kill as many as we can, yet we can never seem to kill them all, because a rat is a survivor and can adapt to its surroundings. So in short, the Rat was King in this jungle.Fine novel, I recommend it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This book is Clavells finest book, King Rat is one the finest views into a Prisoner of War.

After all, it is rather depressing and there is not that much of a plot. Clavell does very well at describing the inhuman situtation and how some - the king Rat - of the title do better than others in this kind of circumstances. The prison world dehumanizes most of them, Peter Marlowe, is one the exceptions holding on to his upper class principles as much as can be expected under these circumstance. There is a lot about the relationship of the different classes in Englands and the lack of that in the USA. There is sort of a happy ending when most of the principal characters hang on their lives until their liberated with the end of the war.At the same time this looks like the downfall of the admired King Rat of the title, who when stripped of his power, has no friend left and dows nt seem to look forward to going back to freedom after the powerful postion he had enjoyed in the camp.It is powerful book and especially the ending makes it a book hard to forget. It does not have the wide range of other Clavell novels but it makes up for this by creating the claustrophobic world that was Changi. Quite recommendable."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is a truly great book. James Clavell is a master of making his audience feel as if they are immersed in the story. The relationships between people when they are placed in a desperate situation (in this case a WWII POW camp) is facinating. There is a deep insight into the main characters that isn't found in most books.This book is terrific and if you can't handle some of his larger books this is a great way to become acquainted with is writing.

Apart from it being a fast-paced, well-written account of POW's in Asian war camps it also provides me, as a teacher, with a great hang-up for discussing differences between American and English culture (Peter Marlowe and the King) (compulsory subject to be dealt with in the Dutch English class)"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I read this book for my Honors English class in the 9th grade, and it is still, after all these years, one of my favorite books.

It is powerful, well written, and extremely intelligent."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is Clavell's best work. The story is engrossing, with an intriguing plot and beautifully worded prose. Readers may be so amazed at this fact that they ignore the larger genius inside the work -- a study of human suffering, survival, competition, ethics, and beliefs. Fears, petty hatreds, pleasures, religious convictions, and the constraint of social rules are all subjected to a scrutiny which turns one's views upside down. The wisdom that Mr. Clavell gained out of his experience at Changi during the war is expressed perfectly in this &quot;fictional&quot; account of life at that prison camp; the commentary on humanity seen in all of his other books in the Asian Saga are first seen here. Quite simply, a MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is the 4th Clavell book I've read, I was more than a little disappointed. I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it. Although a lot was made of their inner feelings, this made me feel that they were both just shallow people."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"James Clavell's \\"King Rat\\" is hands down the worst of his Asian saga. Only related to the other four by the main character's possession of a \\"gold ring, signet of the Clan Gordon\\" (italics) mentioned once on the seventh page. Any reader of Clavell would expect this to have some significance later but the thread never reemerges. Did the author forget about it, carried away by his clearly sophmoric adulation of his Hero? Or did he toss it in at his publisher's request in order to somehow justify this waste of print by weakly connecting it to his better works. And what is this shiftless down-and-out motherless drunkard's son doing with such a treasure anyway? Surely that would have made a more interesting book. Of course, the matural answer is that Clavell is telling his own story, what he lived through as a POW. He has, however, forgotten the first rule of freshman exposition: \\"Just because it happened to you, doesn't make it interesting.\\" Certainly, there are traces of the Clavell magic--despite his always hackneyed prose, he is a master storyteller, but in this case the threads lead nowhere and peter out where a quick death would be more merciful. A large theme is built up around a secret radio, but when discovered not once but twice the Japanese commander who has been built up as a terrifying menace offers cigarettes to all involved. None are tortured,jailed or even questioned. It is as if he is uncertain as to whether he wants to write The Gulag Archipelago or Catch 22 and settle for Hogan's Heroes\\" (of TV sitcom fame). Changi makes Stalak 13 look the Hanoi Hilton. There is even a Corporal Schwarz-like Japanese guard who, like his sitcom counterpart has \\"no stomach for war\\" and comes close to saying \\"I know nothing-Nothing!\\" Clavell,who knows how to spin yarn, would be great on a campout and we cannot forget the majestic sweep of his four ?good? books, but, like the t-shirt says, \\"I spent nearly four years in a Japanese POW camp and all could come up with was this lame book. I was going to give the book away but instead chucked into the recycle bin."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"after reading all of clavell's books, i was looking forward to King Rat. It made me uneasy.

Moreover, it is short and to the point. Clavell was in a POW camp so I get the sense that it is accurate, that it lauds real people through their character portrayals (indirectly), and it scathes other people in the same way."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I enjoy historical writing. this was excellent reading.

James clavell. On. the evolution of Japan. Book. One shogun may have been the best book I ever read. I highly recommend the series to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The first book written in James Clavell's disparate six-novel \\"Asian Saga,\\" \\"King Rat\\" is nothing less than a monumental achievement.The novel is set in a prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, and its characters and their actions ring true, mainly because it is a semi-autobiographical work by Clavell, who was a POW himself. One reads details that are only accessible because the author has experienced them.The play on the words \\"King\\" and \\"Rat\\" are numerous and multilevel. The characters are in a unique Darwinistic setting, where the only rule is to survive. Each has to look out for number one, and the interplay between the characters is fascinating.It's a case of context influencing behavior, behavior that, in yet another context, would be abhorrent and immoral. It's a nightmarish stage on which the characters parade, each showing why he can or can't adapt to his environment. Prison is prison, be it a penal institution for criminals or one in which soldiers are ensconced, and one can easily draw the parallel between the two by reading this intensely readable novel.At the book's core is the transient element of power -- how it's acquired by some and how different people react to it. It's also a story of how one man can look at another and be influenced by his nature and actions, the result being the change of one's own behavior and worldview.From a microcosmic viewpoint, the tragedy and scope of World War II are depicted through the eyes of various characters. It's a thoroughly thought-provoking book, one that should be considered a classic. And though the statement is often overused, it undoubtedly applies here: This book is a must-read. It's a rare, great book, one which I cannot recommend highly enough."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Unlike other James Clavell novels, King Rat had a point of reference in regard to a place and time that is embedded in more recent memories of people my age.It was not, in my view, as well written as the more completely fictional works but, nonetheless, it described very well the attitudes and stresses of humans in close contact, starving and in fear of death at any moment.The interplays between characters were well drawn to an extent that made up for the absence of the swashbuckling excitement of Tai Pan, Noble House and Shogun. King Rat was different, less exciting but despite that, enjoyable and informative.Sceptic Ian"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Terrific story, well- written. Thanks to King Rat, I'm now in the process of reading or re-reading all of Clavell's works. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I read all of the James Clavell novels recently and enjoyed them tremendously. I learned so much about the Oriental mind and culture. I started reading King Rat thinking it would be on the same vein. At first, I thought I would stop reading it because it was about a prisoner camp but I am so happy that I persisted through the end. James Clavell's novel is such a great study of the human mind and soul. I learned a great deal and thought the novel was very thought provoking."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat has to be another one of my favorite novels, as it is not just a war story. It is a story of how characters react as their environments change.It has been a while since I have read the novel, so I will only refer to people by their ranks. The protagonist in the story is an officer (like a Captain) in the US armed forces. Then the main character is King Rat. As I recall, King Rat is non-commissioned officer (like a Sergeant). Completing the chain of command would be the enlisted men (like a private). But King Rat had the most power in the prison camp. His enlisted men treated him like a God; even Officers could come to him if they needed him.The prison was a microcosm of society. For example, there was a man that looked like a woman. Men would fight over him, so he had to be locked up at night for his protection.I don't want to give the story away, but when soldiers are released, the same men who wanted the feminine man and fought over him and wanted to have sex with him called him derogatory names and ostracized him in the outside world. So he waded into the water and drowned. It was an example of how people react to changes in environment. Those who have strong characters remain strong based on their convictions. This does not mean that they cannot change when their environments change.However, ethical people, such as the protagonist in the story, stays true to his convictions and does not yield to the masses. Others who are weak or two-faced will change to meet the change in environment, as they are more concerned with fitting in with the majority than making the moral decision. And that is why this novel mimics a morality play."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is an American POW who economically and socially dominates a prison camp peopled with mostly British POWs of the Japanese. Life at Changi POW camp is a daily deadly race towards the time of hoped for liberation. The book operates on many levels and is infused with symbolism. One day a captured pilot, Lt Marlowe,comes to the camp and the saga of life at Changi,outside of Singapore, unravels before us.The Rat comes into conflict with the antagonist of the tale,Lt. Grey, who represents the dubious authority of those entrusted with enforcing enemy rules while keeping loyalty with their fellows. The Rat is an American enlisted man who accumulates wealth by breaking the rules that Grey must enforce. The Rat becomes a blessing to many on both sides and the object of admiration among most British officers. The Rat upturns not only the hierarchical nature of the military but symbolizes the conflict and leveling influence of free market capitalism on entrenched privilege.Perhaps the conflict in this book is also between capitalism and socialism. Perhaps The Rat is an anti socialist symbol to some while Grey is a symbol of collectivism. I think this thought is trite and lazy...what about you?As it turns out The Rat is capable of altruism despite his greed and helps in a serious medical crisis. The Rat becomes a symbol of Existential good verses mandated compliance with good rules... of free will rather than moral determinism.Camp life destroys conventional notions of right and wrong as war itself does...the camp becomes a moral desert...a rat race. A transvestite becomes the object of longing for many in the camp and then destroys himself by suicide. The Japanese themselves are caught in the web of deceit weaved by The Rat as he builds his empire on black market wealth and then destroys the authority of the camp commander who,interestingly, is a non-entity in the book. There are also literal rats in the camp.The nadir of the plot comes when The Rat decides to market a new brand of meat raised at low cost. A meat rat farm is built underneath a barracks. Rats are marketed as a new type of \\"chicken.\\" The rats struggle and feed off each other in a parody of the humans above them...a rat rat race.When the camp is closed, the place where the prisoners once lived and then vanished from is abandoned by the British...- the rat farm below,however,continues with a life-direction of its own. A new King Rat, heavy with the flesh of his comrades, emerges to carry on after the human one has left.KING RAT is worth a good read and seems written like a screenplay. NAKED ISLAND by Russell Braddon should be read along with KING RAT as a historical documentary. KING RAT was my reading companion in an old hotel in Egypt where the British Empire once thrived and then vanished.The Naked Island"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"After reading Shogun I was hungry for anything written by Clavell and went on to read King Rat (which was also made into a movie that I found to be quite good). Clavell is a master of character development and as this is one of his earliest(if not earliest) works, one can see the greatness of this author who would go on to write at least one of the best books of our time (Shogun). This book which takes place in a Japanese prison camp located in Singapore Island during WW2 and it centers on one of the few Americans imprisoned among mainly British and Australian prisoners. The American thrives in this harsh environment and manages to possess more than anyone else and has a knack for making money. It is a character study about greed, friendship, war-time relationships and social hierarchy. It's a well written book and an interesting story that is remembered long after the book is read.

This is a great Tarot resource, and for the pictures alone (Wegmuller's \\"Zigeuner\\" Gypsy Tarot, large-size edition) it is well worth the price. Thanks, Sergius!"},{"Title":"God, Man, and the Thinker - Philosophies of Religion","review":"Slow going, but worth the mental exertion, this 1962 survey of philosophical approaches to religion is not theology. That is, it isn't normative, so it doesn't set standards for belief to defend from the presumption God exists. Instead, this analyzes the systems set up upon belief. It delineates the pro-con arguments for religion, God, and dogma, and then it judges their merits. Rather than trying to prove what faith asserts as beyond reason, it uses reason to investigate faith claims as far as logic can, before reaching a logically logical impasse or barrier.This distinction bedevils many scholars and seekers. Wells diligently, for 500 pages, shows what fifty years ago could be published by a mainstream (and not university) press, Random House, as a challenging study for an audience able to handle \\"nisus, tychism, apodictic\\" as words not summoning up my red squiggles as I type them, and to know what \\"Capua\\" stood for metaphorically. As for me, I had to look up all four words, but overall, Wells' careful examination rewards the reader, who, if like me, will take awhile to progress through its vast chapters. This is not a drawback of Wells' book, but it is an indication of its rigor.I read this after J.C.A. Gaskin's considerably peppier and compact 1984 \\"The Quest for Eternity\\" (see my review). Much as I admired Gaskin's primer, its minor shortcoming was that it concentrated more on proofs for and against the existence of God and less on the wider philosophical examination of religious truth-claims in historical and contemporary settings. These, Professor Wells emphasizes, cannot by reason be ultimately tested, for resting by definition on faith, they elude \\"evidential proofs.\\" (101) For instance, St. Thomas Aquinas claims, as Wells shows, that God's existence is not a theological but a philosophical problem; theologians by nature already assert there's a God. (Gaskin is also good on this aspect; Wells sometimes gets impatient with his predecessors and deniers both, so testiness lurks herein. This tone of dismissal is a slight letdown in this otherwise valuable compendium.)Most people who don't believe, Wells reasons, aren't going to be convinced of God by such philosophical proofs; however, science may dissuade those whose lack of faith is deepened by rational analysis of religious textual or dogmatic claims that can be falsified from ancient sources which tend to be lacking in accuracy. Metaphorically, as St. Augustine argued, Scripture can be interpreted when facts clash with its assertions, but for fundamentalist Protestants, as Wells sees it, they are trapped in claiming the inerrancy of Scripture even as each believer can lay claim to his or her reading of the text as true. Rapidly, this leads to endless fission in the Protestant realm, without the controlling force of Catholic interpretation imposed from above. This was written while Vatican II was convened, so a slight shift may or may not have happened since, but this observation appears accurate for the time of this book, and most times over the past five centuries.Wells deals with much material, and he can be wry at times despite his academic demeanor. He concludes about Christian boasts that it alone is the best religion by reminding readers that folks tend to show preferences for their conventional religion based far more on where they are raised than by \\"any claims of cognitive or normative superiority for any religion.\\" He adds that if there was a superior religion, it'd have to have \\"super-empirical\\" evidence to back up its factual existence! \\"So far, the shrewdest way in which the claim to uniqueness has been defended has been to appeal to intuitive insights or divine revelations. These, however, suffer from being inexplicable, incommunicable, and, from the perspective of an independent observer, indefensible.\\" (282)Overall, this is not an easy book to navigate, but effort pays off. Philosophy of religion is defined and contrasted with science and philosophy itself in part one; religion is defined in a variety of ways--belief, feeling, and ethics--before being \\"nominally defined\\" and its origins probed into in part two; the idea of God or gods takes up part four; arguments for the existence of God comprise part five.Problems of Religious Knowledge serve as part six, as applied to truth-claims. Natural evil, immortality; knowledge of religion as faith vs. reason comprise parts seven-nine. From here it gets a bit easier, and after 150 pages or so, issues like psychic claims and scriptural manufacture enliven this treatment. Inerrant Scripture, fixed vs. evolving religions, fundamentalism, and modernism take up parts ten-thirteen. Humanism, psychology, the church and state over the centuries, and finally science cover the remaining parts through seventeen, with a few study questions appended, leaving me to wonder if Wells' college students half a century ago could handle such daunting material!"},{"Title":"God, Man, and the Thinker - Philosophies of Religion","review":"Very scholarly and thought provoking.

Because Bourdieu deals with rather abstract concepts which cover a lot of social ground (e.g., symbolic, cultural, economic capital, field, etc.)and not enough linguistic ground, some linguists will have trouble applying concepts to the actual production of speech at the phonological, morpho-syntactic, pragmatic and discourse level. He never really deals with actual production of language by speakers, so it creates a lot of work for the reader to fill in the details of what, for example, an actual linguistic habitus might look like, what its dispositions might be, and how they might be coordinated in their habitus set.However, unlike many US linguists, he assumes there is an empirical connection between language use and larger social domains; furthermore, he is able to explain the way power often operates through exclusion and devaluation (dialect analysis). One of the less abstract chapters, the chapter on Searle, is excellent. Bourdieu accurately locates the efficacy of the speech act, not in the functional form of the utterances, such as christening, ordering, requesting, etc., but in the recognition by all involved that the agent who produces the speech act has the right to be obeyed and that the material circumstances of the speech act are appropriate. Mary Jane down the street and the mayor of NY may christen a new warship using the exact same functional words, but the power of those words depends on our recognition that, in this example, the mayor, not just anybody, has the authority to name. Bourdieu masterfully argues this point, and I would recommend reading that chapter first for its accessibility and accuracy in pointing out that the extra-linguistic is as much linguistic as the linguistic."},{"Title":"Language and Symbolic Power","review":"Bourdieu's point is not to explore linguistics but rather to explore the larger impact that language has on shaping symbols, meaning and power in the social context.

However, the crochet instructions were a little difficult to follow for a non-American and chart diagrams would have been a useful alternative. As would the degree of difficulty involved. But after receiving some help in deciphering the instructions, and referring to the stitch guide at the back of the book, I was able to work my way through the pattern I chose."},{"Title":"A Year of Afghans (Bk. 5)","review":"I have most of the &#34;year of afghans&#34; books.

I have been looking for this book for awhile now and so happy I found it."},{"Title":"The Building","review":"Years after I read this book, I still remember the tale of the dying Building, its Owner and the Tenants. At the time I read it, I was working for a Landlord who also had trouble collecting the Rents and paying the expenses, just like in this book. Sadly, the theives and low-lifes who represented most of the building's tenants weren't that interesting to me. When the State took over the Building, things only got worse for it and the Tenants. This book was at times gross, at times funny and at times frighteningly realistic. Anyone who's ever managed (or tried to manage) slum buildings will recognize himself here. I? Well, I was just the computer guy, but working for that company scared me out of income property investments for life.I give this one three stars because I had difficulty getting through the gross passages. But the fact that I remember it over ten years after I read it must mean something, right?"},{"Title":"Chopin: The Man and His Music","review":"This book (originally published in 1900) is split in two sections. In the first 100 pages, the life of Chopin is discussed by Huneker in a very colorful and poetic style, although unfortunately very few biographical facts are revealed. When I finished this section I felt I had hardly learned anything new about Chopin.The next 150 pages deal with Chopin's music, in which Huneker comments briefly on every one of Chopin's compositions (with the exception of several pieces unknown to Huneker), categorized by type (Ballades, Preludes, etc.). This section, like the first, is amusing but not very helpful. The author never really goes into great depth about any single piece. Instead he simply says a word or two on mood or style, often quoting authorities such as Kullak and Niecks, and compares several major editions of the work. I would recommend this to someone very interested in editorial details... anyone else could probably do without most of this section.People familiar with Chopin should find Huneker's writing somewhat enlightening, though far from substantial. Those looking for an introduction to Chopin may find the first section very helpful, if they can tolerate the author's verbosity."},{"Title":"Chopin: The Man and His Music","review":"This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like &quot;Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are.&quot; The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of &quot;What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores.&quot; What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."},{"Title":"Chopin: The Man and His Music","review":"Huneker was an aspiring concert pianist (as well as a brilliant writer), and his analysis of Chopin's music and poetry are simply amazing. Like Chopin, Huneker expresses from the heart and hears the music at a whole new level. His interpretation is raw and as full in energy as the music itself (especially for etude op.25 no.11 and the ballade no.1)."},{"Title":"Chopin: The Man and His Music","review":"Who can count themselves learned in Chopin who has not read Huneker's wonderful, purple-prosy, unabashedly romantic examination of the Polish Master's music? If the musicology is a tad dated, the enthusiasm, the sheer love of music present on every page, are more evident than ever. This is absolutely essential reading for the Chopin lover."},{"Title":"Chopin: The Man and His Music","review":"The biography is very disappointing, the musical descriptions are poetic but don't get into much detail. If you want a general feel for Chopin's music but don't want intricate musical detail, the descriptions of the pieces may suit your need. That's the only reason I didn't give this book the lowest possible rating.For biographical info, \\"Chopin in Paris\\" by Tad Szulc is much more informative and accurate. Huneker's biography, besides being relatively short, takes off on gossipy tangents that often jump around in time making it hard to get a good feeling for Chopin's progression thru life.My problem with the musical descriptions (the book is divided into 76 pages of biography and 141 pages of music \\"analysis\\", divided into sections on preludes, mazurkas, etc.) is again the gossipy nature. For example, the chapter on the preludes is 13 pages long. The first four pages are strictly about who claimed when and where they were written.I recently played Prelude No. 4 in E Minor at Peabody in Baltimore. Prior to the recital, I was deluged with coaching at college master-class play-ins, etc. The discussions centered on things like why the downbeat beginning each measure is played weaker than usual, contributing to the feeling of hopelessness in the piece.Huneker's descriptions are: \\"The melody seems literally to wail..\\", \\"This tiny prelude contains wonderful music\\", \\"The whole is like some canvas by Rembrant..\\"In the relatively few times Huneker does go into musical detail there may be some insight, but just as frequently a few bars of music are shown accompanied by an explanation like, \\"Volcanic mutterings these!\\" -when the music shown is a pianissimo (played very softly) passage!For anyone looking for insights on actually playing the pieces, Walker's \\"The Chopin Companion..\\" which can be found \\"used\\" at Amazon, is a much better choice."},{"Title":"Chopin: The Man and His Music","review":"Loved the documentary about Mozart.

Weinstock wrote the forward. He also wrote a book called \\"Chopin: The Man And His Music\\". Weinstock should not even be listed as a secondary author, much less the primary author."},{"Title":"Chopin: The Man and His Music","review":"Strangely, no one seems to have writen a definitive biography of Frederic Chopin (1810-1849), despite the fact that he was one of the most important composers of the 19th century Romantic era. (Tad Szulc's book,Chopin In Paris: The Life And Times Of The Romantic Composer, is perhaps the best existing biography, in addition to Jim Samson'sChopin (Master Musicians Series)and Jeremy Siepmann'sChopin: The Reluctant Romantic; Chopin's friend Franz Liszt also wrote a \\"SORT OF\\" biography of himLife of Chopin (Forgotten Books).) Consequently, I would suggest that this book by American music newspaper writer and critic James Gibbon Huneker should not be expected to be more than it is.Huneker offers many interesting observations on Chopin's life and personality: \\"For the dissipations of the 'average sensual man,' he had an abiding contempt.\\" \\"Chopin loved the night and its soft mysteries...\\" Chopin \\"did not care much for German music except Bach and Mozart. Beethoven ... was not sympathetic. Schubert he found rough, Weber, in his piano music, too operatic and Schumann he dismissed without a word.\\" With regard to Chopin's famous development of the rubato style of playing, Huneker writes, \\"The Chopin rubato is rhythm liberated from its scholastic bonds, but it does not mean anarchy, disorder.\\"Concerning Chopin's fateful meeting of author George Sand, \\"Sand was antipathetic to Chopin but her technique for overcoming masculine coyness was as remarkable in its particular fashion as Chopin's proficiency at the keyboard.\\" Her ardor for Chopin cooled as he became ill: \\"for an active mind and body like hers, it must have been irksome to submit to the caprices of a moody, ailing man.\\" In his final days, Chopin \\"begged his sister to burn all his inferior compositions. 'I owe it to the public and to myself to publish only good things.'\\" Huneker notes that \\"This wish has not been respected. The posthumous publications are for the most part feeble stuff.\\"Huneker concludes that \\"Chopin is the open door in music. Besides having been a poet and giving vibratory expression to the concrete, he was something else---he was a pioneer.\\"This isn't THE biography or study of Chopin to purchase; but for lovers of Chopin and his music, it should be read."},{"Title":"Chopin: The Man and His Music","review":"Au contraire to the negative reviewers. This book is the tour de force on the music of Chopin, expressed in the most descriptive and vibrant language imaginable. It was written in the late 19th Century by a man who enthusiastically explored every nook and cranny of Chopin's genius.The book is meant primarily as an overview and examination of Chopin's music for pianists and lovers of Chopin, written by a man who was a respected music critic and pianist himself. It's full of information on how the great pianists of the time performed Chopin and invaluable as a fascinating read and historical document. The book was never intended as a dry encyclopedic biography of the composer, and much has been discovered about Chopin's life in the last 100 years that can be found in other biographical sources. Those who expect Huneker to be literally correct in every respect on Chopin's life are badly missing the point of this fascinating examination of Chopin's life and music. Huneker adored Chopin, and his writing brims with passion, enthusiasm and incredible insight into each piece Chopin produced, though his words were never intended for the piano pedagogues only.Anyone who deeply loves Chopin will find this a unique and wonderful read. I have marked many passages, referred to it countless times, and there is nothing like reading Huneker's descriptions of a Chopin work while you are actually listening to it performed at the same time. Huneker's language simply reflects the florid language of his age and is truly fantastic in its descriptive detail.Zero stars on the misguided negative reviews on the book; and 5 stars on behalf of Huneker's little Chopin classic that has been in print for over 100 years. This is a book to be savored, and there are no other writings on Chopin that can match the boundless enthusiasm that Huneker felt for his musical god. Each page brims with Huneker's exuberant spirit and his fervent love of music itself. A treasure from another age."},{"Title":"Chopin: The Man and His Music","review":"James Huneker made an praised essay around the different stages of Chopin's life as well an extensive, meticulous and detailed analysis about every one of his compositions.

It's pretty fun to read what the feds 'allegedly' think about some characters or events of the show, but what disturbed me was the fiction that was written there.

At a recent lecture in Santa Barbara Mr. Doubilet indicated that he is still swimming with film with marginal mental and financial investment into digital techniques. His most credible argument in favor of film was black and white imagery and the use of filters. The unpublished works he showed us were incredible and I hope to see a collected works before digital devours us all. I have found Fish Face a good learning tool in terms of composition and and an exercise in recognize the moment and capture that moment, whereas I found Water, Light Time a good study in terms of lighting, composition and imagination.

It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When a book is slated as one of the greatest Sci-Fi novels of our time, it should be extremely hard to criticize. Unfortunately I found The Foundation to have more than a few flaws which actually made it a chore to read. Considering that it beat out \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for the Hugo Award in 1965 for best All-Time Series, which is why I decided read it, makes it even more insufferable in my opinion. Simply look at how momentous LOTR's has become over The Foundation in our culture and you can begin to see how it is obviously lacking something. So why does it fall short ? Well, the primary reason is the story line jumps vast amounts of time chapter to chapter, which even though I found refreshing, it gives the reader a completely new set of characters in different settings which receive little to no development. So ultimately the visual depth, as well as character depth, which I find so alluring about Sci-Fi, is ultimately lacking leaving little for the imagination to grasp on to. What this does do though is leave room for what I believe Asimov wanted the reader to really experience, which is the psychohistorical themes built upon long term economic strategy, which was wonderfully orchestrated and second to none. The thing that gets me, is considering that is the focus of the story, it could have just as easily taken place in the 1800's and 1900's and be based on oil or guns instead of nuclear power. Don't get me wrong, the story is intriguing but if you are looking for a visually stimulating Sci-Fi book, I would look elsewhere...or you can just wait for the feature film in 2013."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Inscribed along the bottom of my well-worn copy of Foundation is the following accolade: \\"Awarded the Hugo as Best Series Ever!\\" In response all I can say is, \\"don't hold your breath.\\"Sure, I give the book three stars for its creativity and imaginative appeal. But, as a stand alone work, it doesn't measure up to other estimable sci-fi classics, most notably Robert Heinlein's thoroughly engrossingStarship Troopers. As the first work in a series, Orson Scott Card'sEnder's Game (Ender, Book 1)and Frank Herbert'sDune, 40th Anniversary Edition (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)far surpass it on similar terms.I lost interest in the remainder of the Ender and Dune series, which is unlikely to happen with the Foundation lot from what I know of the rest. It is in the remainder of the series where Asimov supposedly hits his stride. I don't doubt it, but his first book, much likeI, Robot, lacks an overarching narrative that one would expect in a Hugo series. Replacing the narrative is an overarching theme. But the theme's unabashed anti-religious and humanistic elements are somewhat off-putting.Most readers will likely look past this, but it diminishes the book's appeal in my mind. It also dampens my enthusiasm for diving into the remaining books. In the end, the Foundation series may have received the Hugo, but the first book leaves it with much ground to make up when compared to its two most notable Hugo runners-up, J.R.R. Tolkien'sThe Lord of the Ringsand Edgar Rice Burroughs'The John Carter of Mars Series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the story telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time.The method for introducing new twists or skipping decades by introducing fake abreviated &#34;encyclopedia galactica&#34; entries was awkward and rough."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As the beginning to his Foundation series, which will eventually incorpate his entire Asimovian universe, this collection of intertwined short-stories is a must read for Asimov fans. But it is not close to his greatest works - he's only getting started here, but if you take the time to read his other stories and novels, you will appreciate these beginnings."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov considered his work that eventually became the Foundation and Empire book of The Foundation Trilogy to be his best, due to his introduction of the misunderstood, mutant conqueror: \\"The Mule.\\" Given Asimov's personal stamp of approval, for that reason alone, this book is well worth devouring. Published originally in the 1940s by the magazine \\"Astounding,\\" this trilogy eventually won the Hugo Award for Best All-time Series ever. It even beat out Lord of the Rings, although I think evaluating two such different series in dissimilar genres is like comparing apples to oranges.Asimov's imagining of a future, immense and extremely technologically advanced galactic empire (based on the Roman empire) that is on the verge of falling back into barbarism is indeed astounding. Among other fantastic characters in this series is Hari Seldon, the Empire's greatest intellectual, who sets about to reduce the period of barbarism from 10,000 years to 1,000. But unfortunately, Seldon's mathematics-based science called \\"psychohistory,\\" whereby he can predict group human actions in the future, was unable to account for a mutant with vast mind control powers; the previously mentioned character who mysteriously calls himself The Mule.Foundation and Empire tracks The Mule as he conquers planet after planet and the efforts to stop him and make sure that Hari Seldon's Plan for the future is maintained. One aspect that sets this book apart from a lot of science fiction is a strong and compelling female character, Bayta, who plays a critical role in combating The Mule. This is especially surprising considering that this work was written in the 1940s. I will leave it at that so as not to reveal not one, but two fantastic plot twists at the end of the book. Foundation and Empire is perhaps the best of a truly classic sci-fi trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Once again, Asimov serves up a thrilling read for the sci-fi fan. The two story-lines followed in the text pertain particularly to the question of if/how spectacular individuals can alter the Plan of Hari Seldon. The first pertains to a final thrust of the Empire while the second pertains to the question of an anomalous power known as the Mule.The final expeditions of the Empire attempt to take over the foundation by means of the talented general Bel Riose. Bel Riose launches a campaign against the Foundation and pushes toward victory with nearly unprecedented ease, backed by the Imperium. This first half of the book considers the power of the individual and the mass with respect to the great movements within the Foundation according to the Plan. Although I will not reveal much more than this, I will at least say that the outcome of part one is intriguing in comparison to part two, dealing with the Mule.The second half of the story deals with the relationship of Seldon's plan to the possibility of a mutation which begets a figure who is an extremely powerful galactic conqueror, destroying the overall political milieu foresaw by Seldon. To speak much more of this would spoil the read for you. However, I must say that it is a thrilling text which kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the end. The ending itself was such a surprise that it indeed reminded me that I was reading Asimov, for it is just the type of intellectual curve-ball that he would throw just as the novel ends.Once again, we have a stupendous text on our hands in these two. It raises major questions about the plausibility of psycho-history, some of which are raised again in the third text in the series. I suggest this text most thoroughly to all sci-fi fans. I only suggest that you at least read Foundation before reading this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"But Asimov is one of the greatest science-fiction authors to have every lived. His massive work adding itself to works by other such sci-fi masters: &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; as well as the more modern cyberpunk works like &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot;, and &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot;. All are must-reads for any hardcore science-fiction and cyberpunk collector."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is amazing science fiction novel. Asimov's straightforward and simple way of writing presents the reader with a concise and well formed novel. The plot is amazing with its many twists and turns, although the character development isn't very strong. However, the lack in character development comes from Asimov's style of writing in which he presents the reader with several major characters. The entire book revolves around foreshadowing of a point in history where knowledge will be lost and barbarians will rule over an ingorant civilization. In order to shroten the period of ignorance and barbarianism, Hari Seldon forms the Foundation, a group of scholars on a planet at the edge of the galaxy. Asimov uses foreshadwing to great effect throughout the entire novel to form the plot. Another device well used by asimov is symbolism. One example is the Foundation, which is used as a symbol for hope for the future. The symbols placed throughout the novel bring about a sense of profound revelation to the reader. Irony is also used very effectively in one instance. When the encyclopedists realize that all their work was all in vain, Asimov reveals the fragility of the human intellect. He explains how the composition of human knowledge is not in one single person, but is spread out throughout all of humanity, and cannot be contained within one book or one set of books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this* because it presents a galaxy without aliens, colonized by people. It was soft SF in so many ways (incl. FTL, antigravity, flying cars, walnut-sized nuclear reactors, laser pistols, personal and city force shields, egregious use of energy in the form of anti-gravity elevators) and the psychohistorian-predicts-future-events-to-the-day plot was dumb--not to mention the idea of civilizations with FTL ships incapable of harnessing nuclear power. With repeated suspensions of disbelief, it was pleasant enough. The characters were not such nitwits as those of \\"Prelude to Fdn.\\" No need to read his other books.* after reading If the Universe is Teeming with Aliens...Where is Everybody?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life (2002) by Stephen Webb"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I realize I'm in the minority compared to the other reviews but I don't feel this book is even close to being half as good as the first foundation book.

Also I guessed the big twist in the second story by the third page."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is a great read. A lot of great characters, and interesting events take place. This book definitely advances the whole \\"Foundation\\" idea, but it does stand on its own."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"My sister likes to randomly give me things, based on conversations we had weeks prior that I barely remember. I must've been talking up Asimov (the man published enough articles/books for 10 lifetimes) because one day she gave me Foundation and asked me to read it. Not having read it herself, she said the only thing she knew about it is that it's the book that established him. In reality, the books, initially a chapter-by-chapter series in a two-bit magazine, never made him that much money until much later in his life. So it goes.You should, therefore, pick up this book knowing only that one piece of information; this book was his \\"big break.\\" It starts engagingly enough: One arithmetician, Hari Seldon, has found a way to predict the fall of civilization, and develops a plan to stem the suffering of mankind. Very little of the story is actually about the man himself. By nature of the predicting-science, the science of history, the narrative spans a multitude of exotic settings, and even more lifetimes.An interesting thing happened to me as I was reading the book, however, despite having been warned by Asimov himself in the foreword. I realized that nothing happens in this book. That is to say, no actual action takes place. The entire book is dialogue driven.Unfortunately things sometimes take a hit or I have to stop pretending for a second, because during some of the dialogue exchanges people say or do things outside the boundaries of their character(lines like \\"and I'm glad you refuse to countenance it.\\" from a Han Solo-style trader? Just say 'face it' instead!) It's clear that at the age Asimov was when he wrote it at least, that he had a Davincian understanding of women at best. Characters throughout sometimes act in grandiose, dramatic ways that defy common sense or motive. It's like watching a good play with bad acting, and as well, you can practically FEEL the curtain coming down in between chapters since so much of this book happens \\"behind the scenes.\\" Speaking of scenes, they get somewhat sparse of props. Asimov will rarely, if ever, describe inanimate objects. Unless they do something science-fictiony (lets just say he GROSSLY over-estimated nuclear physics and under-estimated electronics.)Anydangway, there's also a problem of overconfident protagonists. At first you're not used to it, so the feeling of imminent peril is genuine, but after reading one cocky protagonist after another, you begin to stop worrying about them because they always come out on top in a vaguely predictable fashion. I suppose part of that is in the design of the book's thesis, but it would be nice to show some more range in his characters.I'm already almost finished with the second one. So far, this first one was better. I know after reading this review it sounds like I was hard on the guy, but really it's not bad. I'm only a little surprised a movie hasn't been optioned, because it kindof feels like Dune.

His later work is definitely better. &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; is like its predecessor (&quot;Foundation&quot;) in that you get several stories told in different periods throughout Foundation history. Everything Asimov has come up with in these books is fundamentally good sci-fi story stuff, but the lack of character development makes you think while you're reading, &quot;Why am I reading this?&quot; I'll read the last in the trilogy (&quot;Second Foundation&quot;), but that's as far as I'm going to go with these.For great sci-fi, read &quot;Hyperion,&quot; &quot;Fall of Hyperion,&quot; &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.&quot;For good sci-fi, read &quot;More Than Human,&quot; &quot;The Gods Themselves,&quot; &quot;Slan,&quot; &quot;The Demolished Man,&quot; &quot;The Stars My Destination.&quot;TOO MUCH TO LIST, MY FRIENDS!!!Good luck and good reading."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In a twisted (mis)reading of the Foundation series, the Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo used Asimov's epic as a prophecy of upcoming apocalypse and converted dimsighted guru-dictator Shoko Ashara into an incarnation of Hari Seldon.

I thought the story was thin. Surprisingly, the best of the Foundation novels is not the first but the fourth - Foundation's Edge.

The invincible foundation is overrun, the land of your beloved characters is defeated!&lt;pr&gt;And THAT'S just the start of the fun! This book is so well written and Asimov's universe is so well developed, you fell as if your there when the troops of &quot;The Mule&quot; land.

And Asimov is never more ridiculous than when he writes about feelings, especially about love (scenes seem to be described by a child or a thinking machine). But this writer is still gifted at setting clever plots every reader will enjoy, for instance in his robots tales (of course do not expect more than a quality entertainment, as often with sci-fi). However, Fondation is not really a clever book ; it is not boring, but it has poor content. You will finish it but probably won't read it again. First problem, it is impossible to believe in psychohistory, which smells like positivist propaganda from the 19th century. And because he has nothing more than an adventure story to tell, Asimov uses all kinds of tricks to grip the reader, including lots of surprises justified by unlikely and twisted arguments, some of which you may find hard to swallow. To conclude, Fondation is a kind of cartoon : a succession of sketches, rather funny but unlikely. If you still absolutely want to read the book, don't read Dune before.

The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged \\"novel\\" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections.

After having noticed all the editorials, reviews, and awards attributed to the Foundation series, I didn't hesitate to order all the books in the series. What a mistake! I'm not sure what people are seeing in these novels, but in no way do they even come close to approaching some of the other hallmarks of sci-fi, like Dune, Ender's Game, you name it. This book has a semi-interesting setup about trying to preserve civilization during a coming galactic dark age, but beyond that the book devolves into stupid scenario after scenario about how the Foundation is threatened but through the citizens' skill (i.e. sheer stupidity and dumb luck) they manage to somehow make it through the crisis only to face another yawner a few pages later. In between each crisis numerous years elapse, so by the time Asimov sets up the next unrelated crises, the entire cast of characters changes -- you barely have time to figure out their names much less get to know any person in significant detail.This series of books did nothing but put me to sleep on multiple occassions when normally if a book is good I'll stay up all night to finish it. My advice is to steer well clear from this series and try one of the other highly rated sci-fi books out there -- there are so many others that would be far preferable."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I can understand why this book is considered one of the best science fiction books ever written, especially considering the time period it was written in. It has a very interesting concept of destination and cause and effect (although it is weak in execution and very weak in explanation). For these reasons and other I should only give this book a one star, but instead I gave it two and I will explain why later.There is almost zero character development in this book. The extremely short chapters jump thirty years to eighty years and more between chapters. Almost every &quot;book&quot; within this book has a new set of characters with only a few references of the &quot;heroes&quot; from the previous &quot;books.&quot; At times, this makes for very confusing reading because I had no idea who the new people were in the successive chapters.As mentioned in the title, this book suffers greatly from the Superman sydrome. By this I mean that you know the outcome before the events have unfolded. Superman can't be beat (except for by Doomsday in the comics but he comes back anyway) and therefor when watching the movies you know he wins. So there just has to be more elaborate plans and more complex ways of defeating him but he still will win. The same is true with the foundation. Harry Seldon, the prophet who esentially created the foundation, knew what was going to happen because he could see the future. Every &quot;book&quot; in &quot;Foundation&quot; will ultimately see the Foundation as the victor, so there just must be more complex problems arising, but of course the Foundation will ultimately prevail. And in this book, the problems are not really that complex, just different social economies arising to counter the previously established social economy that prevailed in the previous &quot;book.&quot; I can only imagine that in the later books the problems will get ridiculously complex - maybe even too complex for enjoyment.Because this book has almost zero characterization and is very predictable I would give this book one star, but instead I gave it two. The reason for this is because I have read the backs of the other books in the Foundation series and other reviews of them and I am interested in the storyline. I want to read about the Mule in Foundation and Empire, and I want to read about Earth in Foundations Edge. If not for that this book would recieve a one star rating from me and I would also never recommend this book or ever pick it up again.It may be a classic, but it's not that great. It's not great at all."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov anyday. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialoge driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learnings of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know pratically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a &quot;classic&quot;. I've seen the word &quot;classic&quot; thrown around a little too much sometimes.

So begins the reader's journey through hundreds of years of history and turmoil, watching as Asimov paints his picture of the tiny Foundation and its struggle to keep Seldon's plan alive. Asimov's characters are first-rate, grabbing the reader's interest with their intelligence and charisma.

The plot sparkle and shines throughout and the reader is never left alone and bored."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Set more than 10,000 years in the future, at the edge of a failing galactic empire, this book isn't a story so much as a series of vignettes spanning decades. The book starts by detailing the effort to create the Foundation, which will try to preserve civilization from total collapse as the Empire continues to decay. With each jump to the future, we see the members of the Foundation confront a series of crises that threaten both the Foundation and the very fabric of civilization.Asimov has done a remarkable job of creating a believable far future, with a human civilization that spans the massive space of the galaxy. His descriptions of the decline of the Empire, and of the resulting chaos at its edges extrapolates nicely from history (particularly the decline of the Roman Empire). Though written half a century ago, very little about this book feels particularly dated, except possibly for the prevalence of characters that smoked. This book deserves its reputation as a science-fiction classic."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted, masterfully imagined, and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are, in my opinion, among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"this book is one of the most important books in science fiction historyand a must for all science fiction lovers."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Ah, Isaac Asimov. A god, some would say, in the sci-fi genre. I picked up this book at the urging of a friend, trusting in its reputation.At first I found Foundation unusual to read, it covers large swathes of time at once. However, Asimov does this extremely well. He gives us little anchors of information or characters that we can recognize, so we can figure out where we are in the time line without him having to come out and say it.Much of the book is dialogue, which is something I have not encountered before. Most of the story and characterization is carried in the dialogue rather than through plain description. Asimov doesn't tell you what the characters are thinking, he *shows* you what they're thinking as they explain it to other characters. This rather prevents us from growing too close to the characters, but that is rather the point because the time line goes so fast.Foundation was an unusual novel, but I can see why it is still a classic. It may be a little dry for some, but I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It's my third read of this book. First two I read about ten years ago, when my English hasn't been that matured, so after reading the book in original, I immediately found a copy in my native language. Now I decided to read the whole saga and of course started from the very beginning.Just as addictive as before. And with fair certainty I can say that this is the saga that has inspired George Lucas or whoever he took his ideas from. And yet it all started with \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\"..."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire, you don't make many friends. But Seldon manages to keep what he finds low key and sets into motion a series of events that will lessen, not stop, the ravages that are to come.A great sci-fi classic. One of the best from an all time master of the genre. When I was younger I tried to track down every book he ever wrote. Think I got all the Tales from the Black Widows, but am not sure.Any lover of Sci-fi will find this not only exciting, but intelectually stimimulating."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I totally liked the pattern that Isaac Asimov established in \\"Foundation,\\" the first volume in what we know refer to as the original Foundation trilogy. Hari Seldon created the revolutionary science of psychohistory and mapped out a future for humanity that would allow thirty thousand years of barbarism between the existing galactic empire and the future one to be reduced to only one thousand years. Through the effort of the psychohistorians the Foundation was established with its encyclopedists. Then we saw the rise of the Mayors, the Traders, and the Merchant Princes, each representing a step on the path laid out with mathematical precision by Hari Seldon over the first two centuries of the millennium he plotted out.I was looking forward to a continuing series of Seldon Crises as the Foundation played out the rise of human civilization, thinking that what we had hear with what Arnold Toynbee had done with his study of ancient civilizations extended into a future that covered an entire galaxy. But Asimov was setting us up for something unexpected in \\"Foundation and Empire\\"; the idea was that at this stage the Foundation would be threatened by the final power play of the dying Empire. But the universe is apparently tired of Hari Seldon playing with his mathematically loaded dice and has thrown the entire plan into doubt by creating a mutant, nicknamed \\"The Mule.\\" Now the Foundation, the Seldon Plan and the entire galaxy is facing a new and powerful threat.When I first read \\"Foundation and Empire\\" I was rather dismayed at the big change in direction. But, of course, Asimov knew what he was doing. He had already proven the validity of psychohistory, at least within the context of his futuristic novel, and there really is no reason to put out another four books (at two hundred years apiece) to complete the plan. Historians might find this interesting, but Science Fiction fans were going to want more than that from Asimov. Indeed, the Mule proves to be, both in terms of the story and the trilogy, the link between the Foundation and the Second Foundation. The Foundation trilogy is classic science fiction from the genre's self-proclaimed Golden Age, and even if the writing style seems dated or quaint, it remains a seminal series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"But, then, how could it not be when its author was the incomparable Isaac Asimov? There are, of course, plenty of other noteworthy works by all manner of Old Masters as well as newer authors that, in my opinion, at least belong next to the &quot;Foundation&quot; series simply because they, too, are great sci-fi adventures and space opera: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others.

I know there are many more famous books from him like the Robots collections and Foundation. I picked this one for the first book simply because this is the first entry to the Foundation series, on a chronological sense. I must say surprisingly, this is a very easy-to-read (compare to Dune, Lord of the Ring, etc), but exciting, and full-of-surprises book. At times, it also gives us thoughful issues (e.g. can we 'predict' the future?), which is what we are anticipating from a sci-fi. I know from many many readers that Foundation is the best among all the volumes, but I can imagine that this is already an enjoyable read, I cannot imagine how exciting the Foundation book will be. It also thrills me to read all other series (Robot, Empire, etc) so as to get a full understanding of the history under Asimov's reign. I recommend this one to everyone who has never touch Asimov's work before."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As well as a trilogy that is as far-reaching as it is set in a far-distant time with characters and galactic backdrop unrivaled by any other book.

This series of books uses the concept of random motion as a prediction for the future was quite a brilliant idea. The story deals with a genius who predicts behavior for millenia into the future and actually has recorded holograms for future people that deal with his predictions. Where I had trouble was the reliance on robots in the later books. I personally prefer the human side of things. It was an interesting read and well worth it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is not easy to read since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. It follows the plot very closely but still keeps the scifi element with things like space travel and intergalactic empires.When I read it I found the religious aspect interesting. The main characters were either scholars, politicians, or interstellar traders, and there were a lot of cloak & dagger type situations. Something I found interesting was that women didn't really play any roles until the last part of the book. It's kinda funny to see this Emerald City (Terminus) in the middle of these warring kingdoms who think they have the upper hand. The use of nuclear power as the ultimate source of energy is a important aspect in the book. If you like lots lots of action, then this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov is my favorite sci-fi writer and this book is great.

So buy the trilogy in a single volume rather than buying this first story separately."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"but just barely!Foundation (Foundation Novels)by Asimov; a classic, a reread (its been at least 35 years however), and a very quick read. Sadly, Foundation doesn't hold up well at all. It's hard to understand how such an accomplished mathematician and scientist like Asimov was so completely unaware of the coming ideas of chaos theory and how it would make his theory of 'psychohistory' so completely improbable and even faintly ridiculous. Secondly, it's 12,000 years into the future... and Asimov can't imagine beyond the common use of tobacco products, blasters, and nuclear power??All that said (and I know it's been said in many reviews in far less kind terms than I have)... it's still a fun story, and one can see the roots and budding ideas of lots and lots of later authors.

The characters and language are a bit creaky, but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way, the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good, and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago, when Asimov was writing."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Absolutely wonderful book. Real science fiction is not about blasters and spaceships, it is about people who've been put in extraordinary situation and how they react to it.I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"One more trip outside my usual reading waters. Science fiction. Foundation makes me remember why I loved science fiction when I was in my late teens and early twenties. The whole world is tilted and new ways of thinking and doing things become possible. All our world leaders need to read science fiction, with its ominous ventures into possible futures. Foundation is the story of a world set up solely as place to compile an enormous encyclopedia, an effort for the ages. But as the story moves forward rapidly in time, we readers come to see that the world has been set up for many other, secret purposes, purposes designed to save the thinking peoples from an eternity in a dark age."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asmiov is not at all a great writer. He does not develops the characters, who are often just tools to set the story going. Classic readers may find his style too crude, too objective. In this series, a character you find important for the story in one chapter may never appear in the rest of the saga.But Asimov is a master storyteller. His imagination has delivered us a lot of great sci-fi stories, and the Foundation series is among the best.In the far future, experts in the study of the behavior of great populations determine that the galactic empire is going to disappear, and then they conceive a plan to preserve human civilization, and reduce a many thousand years of \\"dark age\\" to just one thousand years. They predict what is going to happen decades and centuries in the future, and take precautions so that humanity will be able to avoid each crisis, according to the strongest factor at each time. It seems complex, but it's not. As long as you reach chapter three, you're ok. I can't tell anymore without spoiling it, but despite its lack of literary quality, it's a story you must read if you like science fiction.I liked this book most for the outstanding way the plan comes together in each crisis, revealing Asimov's amazing creative mind.I you think sci-fi silly, or if you value literary virtue a great deal, this is not your book.

After reading, I see why Asimov is still relevant today. His stories don't age because the lessons can still be applied to modern empires and the struggles they face.**Spoiler Alert** Do not read below here if you don't want details of the story.\\"Foundation\\" certainly didn't disappoint. At first, I thought it was a little odd that the sections of the book were so far apart in time, but as I kept reading, it began to make sense. Asimov wasn't trying to tell a story about specific characters as we're used to thinking of them (i.e., individual people), rather, he was aiming to tell the story of a civilization. As I read, it began to make perfect sense. His premise is that the actions of humans as a race can be predicted on a large scale. In order to get that across, the story had to be told using large scale and long time periods. Whether Asmiov was thinking of this or not, I can't say. But it works."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In my initial read of this book, I stuck with it because it is a classic and everyone loves it.

Another essential read for those who love science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is Sci~Fi at it's best, from that great era. It was fun to read again after all these years. The lifestyle of the times when this book was written, really shine through, everyone smokes and everything is nuclear. If you haven't read then read the entire series..... &lt;(~&iquest;*)>"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is my first Foundation book, and I definitely will be reading more. it is too bad all the Foundation books aren't printed into one edition, because while I really enjoyed this book, I found the ending all to abrupt.The book is split up into four parts, each concerning a different issue. Asimov really shines here, as each of the Seldon crises arise and is dealt with - no wonder he is such a big name in science fiction!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the only review (of literature) I have ever written. If you like well written characters, mystery, adventure, intrigue, and a surprise twist to your stories.. oh yes.. and SciFi (but that is beside the point).. the Foundation Trilogy is for you! I haven't even read this story in 37 years, and it STILL stands out in my mind as one of the best I have ever read. Second only to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by JRR Tolkien. It matters not that \\"Foundation\\" is SciFi.. it is just a darn good read! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It's kind of funny when i think that less than 3 months ago, i had never heard os Isaac Asimov, and i had not much interest in reading science fiction. Then i get some book called \\"Foundation\\" for christmas, and it kind of interested me although i didn't read for over a month after i had it.Well since then, not only have i read it, and not only have i done alot of research on Asimov and science fiction in general, but i've also bought and read \\"Foundation and Empire\\". Quite a difference one book can make.I can not get enough of Asimov's Foundation series. I own over 100 books that i've found at thrift stores and second hand stores by many different authors. However the second day that i owned \\"Foundation and Empire\\" i dove right into it, and it did not dissapoint. The only negative thing i can say is that it's just barely not as good as the first book (although that book really blew my mind and was my very first sf novel).Regardless, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is another solid tale by Asimov, filled again with great characters (even a clown!), and written with top notch imagination and imagery. Particularly amazing is how Asimov created the character of Hari Seldon. He appears in this book for about two pages, and yet the man's presence is a highlight. I did question if Asimov wasn't skilled at creating solid character's with real depth. However, when a man who was only in 40 or 50 pages of the first book makes an appearance in this one, it was easily my most anxious moment of the story, and i truly felt just as eager as everyone else sitting before the vault for Seldon to appear. Consider my question withdrawn haha.I am really loving the Foundation series, just the whole creation of, the many planets, the talk of ships, the different classes of people, everything! Not only am i very antsy about continuing this series (which i will definitely be doing soon), i am dying to read his robot novels and his stand-alones as well. Great book!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Good: I really liked this book. The plot was solid and the characters good. I can highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is a great scifi read but it is essentially a series of short stories. So you shouldn't expect a typical \\"novel\\" story. They are set around the same theme of the Foundation, a group set up by a man, Hari Seldon, who is brilliant at something called psychohistory. He predicts that the galactic Empire will fall and sets up the Foundation as way to prevent the knowledge of man from being lost. The first section details this storyline. later storylines are about the trials of the people of the Foundation. Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"continuing the lifetime Hugo award winning series written by Isaac Asimov...lest my snarkiness towards this venerable and respected author and his writing give anyone the wrong impression.. I am very much enjoying this reread! But the world (and I) have changed a LOT over the last 50-60 years (or in my case 40 years). Rereading the books that we loved when we were younger gives us insight into who and what we are today...Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)Isaac Asimov; continuing the 12,000 years-in-the-future saga of cigar chompin', blaster-totin', space-faring men and women (yes the women also lovingly smoke cigars... much to the consternation of the men) as they attempt to unravel the mystery of The Mule and The Second Foundation.I cannot imagine anyone reading this series for the first time having any flicker of comprehension as to why it was so popular and how it garnered a lifetime Hugo award... but again.. kids these days have little appreciation for The Beatles and Elvis... so there you are."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is fantastic! The first time I read it, I wanted to read it again immediately upon finishing it. There were so many twists, turns and details that you just don't catch the first time through. Love!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The big brain of Isaac Asimov composed this series and it shows. This book contains more characters than a fifteen-act Shakespearian play and still manages to unfold as one impressively coherent space-saga. This is by no means a detriment, and characters as well as past events are periodically referenced in later chapters.I'm by no stretch a science fiction aficionado, but upon reading summaries of the plot I couldn't wait to read this book, and it verily meets my expectations. The most interesting thing about this work is that it can be read as pure-science fiction or as social-commentary/social history. Without revealing too much, the sections of the book are dedicated to describing certain \\"Crises\\" that invariably occur due to the events of an imperialistic planet - planet Terminus, home-world of the Foundation - and it's attempts to reestablish (or supplant) a dying Galactic empire. The Foundation uses religion, politics, and economics to spread it's influence across the periphery, or \\"outer-edge\\" of the galaxy. Most of the book centers on characters who possess an aptitude for politics or are just plain cunning, and it's extremely entertaining to see how each character handles the crises and mini-crises laid before them.This book is, surprisingly, heavy on politics - but not politics as usual...that is to say, not any politics that you and I would be familiar with, but politics of fictional worlds and fictional people. However, the political theory behind it all is strong...I was hoping for a little more description when it came to the actual \\"science-fiction,\\" but I guess it was Asimov's intention to leave most of the work to the imagination, and this actually works-out beautifully. Your imagination can truly run wild with this book - Asimov gives only the most cursory descriptions of the characters, but what he gives is enough to get you going. Besides, who wants to spend time reading about a character when there is a good chance that he or she will no longer exist a couple pages down the road? You can infer much of the characters content from their actions and dialogue. Foundation is an entertaining and ambitious book, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. Classic for a reason."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book, Foundation, is a very detailed fictional book that place in the future. Isaac Asimov wrote many books and series in his lifetime and this book along with the series was one of his first books written. This story is mostly about the First Galactic Empire and its fall. Hari Seldon was a psychohistorian, and, using his advanced mathematics, was able to conclude that the Empire would soon fall in 500 years, and then be followed by 30,000 years of barbarism. Hari, however, could limit the 30,000 years to only 1,000 years, by having the people on a planet called Terminus follow an Encyclopedia Galactica that Hari Seldon had made. They followed this for 50 years until they found out it was a fake. Many years pass, and there are many different people who try to do something to help. Each person had a crisis to get past in order to keep doing what had to be done to limit the barbarism to 1,000 years. This continues until the end of the book, and is then continued in the sequels. I think that this book was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot, but the only problem about it is that it is very difficult to follow because each chapter, new characters are brought in and it take place 50 or more years later in time. Other than that, if you are a good reader and enjoy fiction books then this is a great book to read. Also, if you really like the book, there are a ton of other books that he wrote, including several other sequels that you can read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Few works of literature merit me acquiring several copies and I must say that the Foundation series is one of those. Whenever I find an old edition of this series I tend to pick it up and now I own several copies of this series of books ranging from decrepid old paperbacks to some of these newer copies.Here are a few spoilers about the story but I hope not too many:Overall, the premise for foundation is quite intersting. The books take place in a far away future where humanity has colonized the galaxy. In this far future, a scientist discovers that he can tell the future...not for any particular person but for the aggregate of humanity as a whole and then only over long periods of time. The future that Hari Seldon, our scientist, sees is grim: the galactic empire and the society that billions upon billions of people depend on will fall. Nothing can stop this decline and fall.The scientist though figures that his formulas and computers can find key inflection points in history when the future can be altered or \\"helped along\\" and if the right decisions are made, the empire can be restored much more quickly than if history was simply left to run its course.So, the Foundation is created to safeguard human knowledge and especially this concept of psychohistory and every few millenia or so - whenever the computers predict that a \\"shove\\" is needed to get the empire back ot its glory - the Foundation \\"speaks\\" and tells people what to do to fix things.Overall, this is a fantastic series that Asimov at some point winds up tying into with his whole Robot series...you know the laws of robotics?...which winds up being just fantastic.This book was written in the 50s or 60s so there is quite a propensity to use nuclear technology powered gadgets of all kinds and people smoke quite a bit and the characters don't tend to have that heavy gravitas that you find in some modern TV like Battlestar Galactics: it was a more innocent time and that comes across int he writing. It is quite interesting to read science fiction from this era as it shows some of the cutting edge thinking of the time, but Asimov was so good that his writing transcends through to today and in many ways is better than some of the overly complex baryon/tachyon hard sci fi of today. This is smart sci fi - and it is smart sci fi because Asimov is so well read. So please as you pick this up, put it in context - you're not going to get Stephen Baxter or even Gregory Benford and you're not going to get David Brin -- you are going to get Asimov and it just tastes different from modern sci fi. These words are 50 years old.Now, Asimov was very well read and that comes across in his writing and if you read carefully you will find Machiavelli, Gibbon, Plato, and a slew of other writer's concepts interwoven into some of the very original thinking of Asimov.Asimov was truly a giant and the Foundation series is required reading along with the Robot series. A couple of things, one - there is quite a bit of mythology and gravitas associated with Foundation as one of the foundational works of science fiction and that causes people to approach the work with different emotions. Some people have their hopes way up. Others, like me approached Foundation with a bit of trepidation, I was a bit scared as a 15 year old whether I'd be able to read this book - my literature teacher recommended it to me. I must say that Foundation reads fast and it is a rather engaging story, so you get sucked in pretty quickly and there aren't a ton of turns or multiple branches like in Zelazny - Foundation is straight forward....and refreshing in many ways.The second parting item I leave you with is regarding this edition. I found it to be more of a collectors paperback than a mass market paperback - a bith higher quality. It does give you the feel that you're reading something special...but if you want to save yourselves a few bucks go for the mass market edition or if you want to dress it up a bit, get this one --- or if you really want to get an old copy, go to some antique book shop and pick up a leather bound edition with the gold trim (yes such a beast is out there).In any case, enjoy - this is \\"classic science fiction.\\" Those are loaded words and I offer them as consideration before you pick this book up."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the first book of the original trilogy, but the third book overall. Here's a list of all the books in the Isaac Asimov series.- Prequels -1.Prelude to Foundation (Foundation Novels)2.Forward the Foundation (Foundation Novels)- The Original Trilogy -3. Foundation4.Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)5.Second Foundation (Foundation Novels)- Later Works -6.Foundation's Edge (Foundation Novels)7.Foundation and EarthThere are other books written by other authors called the Second Foundation Trilogy, but I haven't read those (and don't plan to).The plot centers around a psychohistorian named Hari Seldon who can predict the future using his newly invented science. He realized that the empire is failing, and the galaxy will be propelled into a 30,000 year stretch of barbarism before a civilized government is established. To reduce the time to a mere 1,000 years, he establishes two Foundations at each end of the galaxy.This book focuses on only the First Foundation, the Second Foundation makes its first appearance in the sequel, Foundation and Empire. The First Foundation expands to take over the edges of the receding empire using its superior intelligence instead of force. They win conflicts through technology, religion, and trade.The theme that reason can overcome brute force is cleverly illustrated in this science fiction classic. It's a relatively short book at 320 pages, and a very fast read. The first book of the original Foundation trilogy is the beginning of a truly great series, a must read for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is one of the original science fiction novel of all time. I read this book as an outside reading assignment for my English class. First of all, I chose this book out of all the other books because I didn't want to read something that sounds dull and unexciting. I wanted to read something more innovative, and I certainly made the right choice when I picked this book from the library shelf.Hari Seldon, the protagonist, develops a area of study called psychohistory, which allows psychohistorians to predict future events in big pictures. According to psychohistory, the Empire will encounter decay in the future and an age of collapse will follow. This book portrays how our civilization tries to shorten the age of collapse by preserving all human knowledge.The book is divided into five section, each with different settings. First section explains the psychohistory and sets up the stage. Second section takes place 50 years after the first, and the new Empire starts encountering conflicts with resources. Third section starts 30 years later, and it deals with religion. Fourth section takes place 55 years later and the new civilization gets involved in a trade conflict. Last section takes place 20 years later and involves merchandise matters. Each section has different characters. Each experiences different conflicts, but they all pile up to show us how a civilization grows and how history is made.I liked how the writing is terse and straightforward. It is hard to follow the story because of the change of settings and many characters, but they do come together. I liked how I could observe the history being made. It is fun seeing a civilization encounter conflicts, digress from religion to economics, and so on. It feels like I'm experiencing a century of history. It's easy to read because there isn't really any complicating science that you need to understand or in-depth character conflicts into the story. Definitely a book to read if you want to know how it feels like to be a god looking down at human civilizations and how they behave. Read it if you want to know what Hari Seldon's true plan is!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I can't say enough about this book, weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"By the end of the thirteenth millennium, mankind had populated millions of planets scattered throughout the galaxy. The centre of the imperial government was located on the planet Trantor, in effect a single planetary city some 75,000,000 square miles in extent. Every conceivable square foot of habitable space was occupied with a teeming population well in excess of 40 billion souls. Its internal problems were so vast that it was all but inevitable that its grip on the outer reaches of its dominion should weaken. The empire, like every other empire that had preceded it, was in the throes of decline.Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician and psychologist developed the science of psychohistory - the use of mathematics and symbolic logic to evaluate and predict the future behaviour of statistically large segments of human population. When he applied his analysis to the Empire, the conclusions were bleak and inescapable. The stagnating Empire would imminently fall and collapse into a galactic dark age - a period of anarchy and chaos and a loss of art, culture, knowledge, technology and science that would last for thirty thousand years.When he knew that imperial collapse was inevitable, he created the \\"Foundation\\" and implemented what was later to become known as the Seldon Plan. He couldn't stop the dark age but he could shorten its duration to a mere thousand years and give civilization the ability to start over again.Asimov, known to his millions of fans merely as the \\"good doctor\\", certainly didn't stint when it came to the scope of his ideas and the size of the canvas on which he chose to paint. \\"Foundation\\" is a classic sci-fi novel that leans far towards the left side of the sci-fi spectrum. Hard sci-fi, technology and advanced science are touched upon only to the extent that they are necessary to make sense of an Empire that spans an entire galaxy. Quaintly, much of the science is seriously dated - data storage is on microfilm, atomic power is the norm even in spaceships that are expected to travel galactic distances - and could hardly be considered brilliantly prescient.So it is clearly the ideas that Asimov deals with that have elevated \\"Foundation\\" to its status as one of the most loved and most read science fiction novels of all time - science as religion, the authoritarian nature of religious dogma, the insidious Machiavellian nature of political diplomacy, the inevitability of the decline and collapse of a major empire and a powerful discussion as to whether violence is a necessary tool to resolve differences or whether it is merely \\"the last refuge of the incompetent\\".While I will happily acknowledge that \\"Foundation\\" was interesting and thoroughly enjoyable, I was somewhat disappointed to discover that it did not have the same thrill or excitement that I experienced when I first read it thirty years ago. The level of science in the book seems almost lack-lustre and in my mind did not live up to the grandiose scope of the novel. Like so many of his peers in the 1950s, women were stoutly ignored and played no part in \\"Foundation\\" at all.Dickens wrote at the turn of the century so one expects his prose to be different. Asimov wrote \\"Foundation\\" in 1951 so one certainly expects it to be a product of that time. But, unlike Dickens (and I'm not really quite able to put my finger on the reason why), the prose simply didn't age quite as well. So, in the full knowledge that many will disagree with me, I'm unwilling to accord \\"Foundation\\" the 5-star rating that many will expect. Four stars only from this reader and a high recommendation that this book must be read if you claim to be a fan of the classic sci-fi genre.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I won't bother you with much detail about the book, just know that this is one of the best (if not THE BEST) Science Fiction books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you plan to read only one Sci-Fi book in your entire life, please make it this one! Asimov pretty much established the grounds for all space odysseys' that followed (think Star Wars, Star Trek, Hitchhiker's Guide, etc.). You wont be let down.The book is actually a collection of 5 short stories published together in one volume. It all begins at about 30,000 years after our time, and about 12,000 years after the Galactic Empire was established. Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician, has developed a theory (psychohistory) that can accurately foretell the behavior of immense human populations to the tee. Using it he placed the Empire's demise at 300 years, with an added bonus of 30,000 years of struggle in a chaotic and barbaric galaxy, until the Second Empire is established.What are you waiting for,get yourself a copy!!!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a masterpiece, bar none. It is not only great science fiction, but great fiction. Asimov does a truly wondrous job of painting a large picture, much in the way that the Hudson School of painting did in the 19th Century, while also giving compelling characterization, like a Rembrandt, and selecting the \`right' moments that the reader can zoom in on, in this compelling account of future history. Asimov leaves Clarke in the dust in terms of characterization, and most of this is achieved via dialogue, while still painting a big picture. Asimov wrote wonderful dialogue, and one can read the tenor of a character's soul simply by how they react in words to other characters. That said, I am very surprised that Asimov did not take issue with George Lucas's Star Wars films, because without Foundation there would simply not be Star Wars. Everything is there to be plumbed and looted- a galactic Empire, rebels, space jumps to circumvent the speed of light, the Galactic Spirit (aka The Force), and so on. Even Star Trek took a heavy load of its mythos from this book, as the human dominated Federation and human-looking and human-derived aliens that dominate most of the Star Trek universe have much akin with the Empire that rules Foundation at novel's start....Foundation was first published in novel form in 1951, but consisted of a number of short stories published throughout the 1940s in magazines like John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction. Book One, The Psychohistorians, was written specifically as an opening for the novel; Book Two, The Encyclopedists was published as Foundation; Book Three, The Mayors, was published as Bridle And Saddle; Book Four, The Traders was published as The Wedge; and Book Five, The Merchant Princes, was published as The Big And The Little. Each of the Books within the novel functions almost as an autonomus story, much the way Bradbury's Martian Chronicles, or Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio do. Yet, it all ties together, and though it has always had a reputation as a space opera, even if the ultimate or original space opera, it transcends that label. Yet, those sorts of labels can be offputting to casual readers of a genre, like I am. For I am not a sci fi nut by any means, yet I sense that many people have avoided this book because like, say, reading a Rilke poem or watching Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, they have felt that something so overpraised and hyped is bound to be a letdown. It's not. It earns its praise and labels, like epic, for, even though the book is less than 150 pages long in my version, probably 250-300 pages in paperback, it is certainly epic- the timescales and range of the Empire demand nothing less. And although that term is grossly overused, in this case it is spot on. The very title of the book has, in the decades since its first appearance, taken on another connotation, though- that of not only referring to the Foundation within the tale, but its place as the Foundation upon which modern outer space sci fi is based upon.This is not to deny the books flaws, which are there. But, given that most of them have to do with technological things, they are not truly literary flaws, merely those of the nature of the sci fi genre. Among them are anachronisms such as typical hausfrau-like portrayals of women, who apparently still worry over household domestic products, an addiction to nicotine, an over-reliance on atomic power, the use of parsecs rather than light years as a unit of distance, the galactic Empire being at the center of the galaxy where we now know only a supermassive black hole exists and makes life as we know it untenable due to radiation, and other minor points. Other flaws are less anachronistic than what in film would be called continuity errors, such as being able to transcend the speed of light, but recording information in actual books, and on microfilm, rather than digitally, or quantumly, yet being able to teleport that information; the Empire possessing holographic technology, yet it all being powered by vacuum tubes; or civilizations possessing interstellar ships but having economies dependent on fossil fuels- which means that dinosaurs and the like must have appeared on millions of the other worlds. Then there are just the plain odd things, such as Asimov's faith in capitalism being the solution to the galactic ills, even though in his universe it's what ails all the worlds. The idea that even were an Empire to arise and dominate a galaxy that such a massive thing could ever stagnate, seems odd. Diversity argues against that, but this shows Asimov's pessimism regarding the human ability to evolve. That these future men also have life spans akin to ours, smoke, and suffer cancer, bespeaking there seems to have been little in the way of medical breakthroughs (this was pre DNA discovery), also seems a bit of an imaginative lack.But, perhaps the greatest flaw of the book is Asimov's love affair with the Freudian Psychohistory (although I'm told in later books Asimov redacted the mythos to reveal it all a fraud), which reeks of determinism, exalts psychology to a \`hard' science, damns free will, plays to the Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends, and has been totally demolished in the wake of chaos theory. Still, even though Psychohistory fails as science, it's still far easier for a writer to predict human nature than scientific advances.But, again, these are mere quibbles, relatively speaking. Let me look at the pro side of the ledger. The very Psychohistory that, in reality, is specious, allows for the very drama of the tale to exist. While poor science it makes for excellent drama. To watch the various Foundation leaders grapple with their own will versus their faith in Seldon is the essence of existentialism. Asimov's use off offstage action is not just a condensing device, but clues the reader in to what is really important- the human moments and confrontations, not the comic book like blowing up of great interstellar vessels. A third device that works well is the use of select epigraphs throughout the story, culled from the fictive Encyclopedia Galactica. They unify the tale, lend it grandeur, and ground this future history as if it were already in the reader's past, much as Edward Gibbons' real and influential The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire did, and which Asimov acknowledged as his main source of ideas. Wisely, there is not too much technobabble, which helps date a work more than anything else. Also, as stated before, the book is rife with humor and sparkling dialogue, as well as plausible catchphrases like \`Galaxy knows' or \`By galaxy!' It is also worth re-stressing that the book's focus is not on scientific progress but social progress, and this predicates a number of major existential queries, such as what is progress? How does progress reconcile with human nature? Is progress ever expanding, cyclical, or helical? What is knowledge? How do the two square? Should knowledge be commoditized? Should knowledge be mysticized? What is free will and ethical agency? But most of all, how can all these subjects and ideas be best related?Yet, most of all, despite the ideas and the narrative, is the wonderful fact that Asimov is just flat-out a damned good writer. His prose is sometimes muscular, sometimes poetic, but always lucid and clear. His plots are not overly Byzantine, yet quite complex, his sentence and paragraph structure not ornate, but subtly seductive. How Hollywood has never optioned this book for a film is beyond me. Wait, no it's not. Why would they want to do compelling, human-based science fiction when they can pump out the pseudo-intellectualism of a Philip K. Dick, or the vapid &uuml;r-mythography of Star Wars, and make a fortune? Perhaps Asimov might be re-thinking his faith in Adam Smith's invisible hand in the great beyond?"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The main plot of the story copies the evolution of every human society. The decline and fall of empires, followed by the rise of others, depends on the same phenomena as those described here. We are puzzled by Psychohistory, but the notion itself (forecasting the future as the weather) is sound. This novel opens a range of questions and issues beyond other books of the genre."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation and Empire is the second book in this series. If you have not read the first one yet, you should. Still, because of the rare and very clear writing found here, you can read this book and never be confused. Since both books are so good, why skip the first one?In this book, we return to the future. A small empire, the Foundation, is on the edges of a greater one. The &quot;Empire&quot; currently encompasses thousands of worlds. Still, compared to its past, it has been shrinking. One of its most able generals, aware that the Empire is less then it once was, decides to expand the Empire. Unfortunately for the Foundation, he has choosen the systems occured by it, as the best direction for his expansion.Like the first installation, this book continually talks about the &quot;inevitable&quot; victory of the Foundation. Since they are being systematically destroyed by the Empire, such predictions ring hollow. How the book solves this problem seems to make sense. But this war is only the prelude for a greater conflict - a Civil War in the Foundation itself.Here is a really interesting dilemena. Since the Foundation is &quot;fated&quot; to survive, what will happen if it wars with itself? And, to make things more interesting, a third party joins the conflict. This mysterious entity, the &quot;Mule&quot;, leads forces that beats both foundations back. What is happening here?Again, like the first book in this series, Foundation and Empire is as much a mystery story, as science fiction. How the author solves these problems are great fun. The ending, actually the middle of the book, is a great surprise on your first read. What happens afterwards, and the new developments, make for a great twist to this story and a powerful new development in this series. A great story. It is great fun and easily as enjoyable as the first book which, on its own, was a classic. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"&quot;The Foundation&quot; by Isaac Asimov is a very thrilling science fiction book. This book takes place so far into the future that they do not know which planet humans came from! This book spans over 160 years and shows the developments of the Foundation. The Foundation is a group of people sent to a remote planet to preserve information and to secretly start a new empire. When the old Galactic Empire begins to crumble, Hari Seldon starts the Foundation. He and his followers work on an encyclopedia to help shorten the barbarian age that results from the destruction of the empire. Seldon's true plan for the Foundation is to raise the next empire that would control the galaxy. As the book continues, the Foundation grows and tries to spread their beliefs across the galaxy. Powerful neighbors become jealous and try to conquer the foundation and destroy it. The Foundation wins usually using non violent means unlike their violent foes. When the Foundation starts to conquer the other surrounding worlds, they expand and send out traders. Traders hold the Foundation together and keep up the economy by trading with the inhabitants and bringing them the Foundation's beliefs. Much of the galaxy is unaware of the Foundation's secrets and the power it holds! This book is divided into five sections, starting at different time periods with new characters and conflicts. The beginning of each section is difficult until you learn the new characters. However, the books flows well since the ideas of people in the past sections are presented in each new section as historically important. Each section is exciting with descriptive characters and a suspenseful plot. The book is a fast read, written for pure enjoyment and entertainment. It does a terrific job of both. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Prelude to Foundation describes the young mathematician Hari Seldon's flight from an entrenched galactic bureaucracy bent on destroying him and what he represents - a threat to the established political order.Foundation opens with Hari Seldon having successfully escaped his old enemies, and having refined his new mathematical theory of statistically predictable human behavior (modeled on similarly ponderous equations of statistical mechanics): \\"Psychohistory\\".Already old but still intellectually formidable, Seldon deftly masters the waning political intrigues still seeking his life. His new project is development of a galactic knowledge repository (similar to the Great Library of Alexandria or the US National Archives) where all knowledge will be stored for future generations against the impending collapse of galactic civilization, (which Seldon's psychohistorical equations have predicted accurately). Building on his psychohistorical knowledge of the future, Seldon establishes two \\"Foundation\\" outposts in opposite and extremely remote corners of the galaxy. He does this with galactic government financial backing - ostensibly to create \\"dictionaries\\" - but the galactic government is only told of one of these Foundation outposts; the other outpost \\"is not on any of the star charts\\", (which becomes significant in later volumes of the Foundation tales).As usual, Asimov's poor ear for dialogue never gets in the way of his rich storytelling. These books are outstanding and a perfect introduction to science fiction.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov are the standard by which I judge all science fiction. The stories center around the mathmatical mechanics that allow for the prediction of the future in a statistcal manner- individual lives remain unaffected, but humanity's future can be charted and directed. All this comes to pass as the great galatic empire slowly but surely fades into chaos. Only Hari Seldon, creator of this science of prediction, can save the universe from a galatic dark age. The short stories contained in this volume set the stage for the rich universe that the other volumes fill and explore. This is the series that testifies to the genius of it's author and is perhaps his greatest legacy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Galactic Empire is crumbling, and only one man can save the universe from chaos. That man is mathematician and historian Hari Seldon. To minimize the effects of the fall of the Empire, he sets up the Foundation, a group of people following his carefully laid plan to preserve the achievements of humanity. So begins the reader's journey through hundreds of years of history and turmoil, watching as Asimov paints his picture of the tiny Foundation and its struggle to keep Seldon's plan alive. Asimov's characters are first-rate, grabbing the reader's interest with their intelligence and charisma. The plot is solid and fascinating to watch as it unfolds, taking twists and turns, every one guaranteed to surprise. Originally published as four short stories, Foundation is the beginning of the classic science fiction epic, and is not to be missed by any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a must buy, by writing this Asimov opened a gateway for other science fiction writers, none, in my opinion who have been able to better him yet. Issic Asimov doesn't just give you one set time period but 5, jumping 50 years or so into the future, each one with rebelious and revolutionary characters, adding colour and flavour to a already brilliant plot. If this wasn't enough, and the books well worth reading for just for that you are introduced to a new kind of warfare- giving the enermy something that they want and become dependent on, then when they become too mencing.... well you can read it for yourself. Foundation is pure genious, you MUST read this book"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation was the first Asimov book I read and that was about 15 years ago. Subsequently I purchased and read multiple times, every Asimov sci-fi book. All but one of the Foundation Series I have in hard-cover in addition to paperback.Reading Asimov is for me a pleasure. How he wrote in conjunction with his rich and diverse use of English I have found unequalled.A must read without which the stage for the rest of Foundation remains unprepared.True it is not his best book, but how do you decide between Masters from The Master."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation has been called by science-fiction lovers all over the world as a cornerstone for science fiction. Isaac Asimov's all time best, this book tells the tale of the crumbling of the Galactic Empire and is only the beggining of a 7-book series. The way Asimov uses the analogy of the Fall of the Roman Empire has pleased readers for decades. Asimov tells the story of a planet alone at the edge of the galaxy awaiting a future already planned for it. Leaders struggle for the planets survival, for this planet, Terminus, holds the future of the Human Race in its hands. Isaac Asimov tells the thrilling tale of human survival in an environment that is against it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Few doubt the power of these novels, and no one mildly competent in the realm of science fiction would at all. I don't remember ever being so sucked in by any book or set of books before. I think that Foundation and Empire was the best of the set, with &quot;The Mule&quot; being the best single story of the nine-story set. This is Asimov in his purest form-- no pomp, no ornation, no flowery aspiration to a false literary quality; just plain, simple prose and story: a mix that earned this set the honor of Best Science Fiction series, an honor I believe is well deserved."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I never would have made it through this book if I hadn't read the other foundation novels first. Because this was originally published in magazines, this book is very fragmented and hard to follow if you don't already know the story. Still, I love Asimov. This is just so early, he isn't excellent yet"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is the second in the original Foundation Trilogy. The first book was \\"Foundation,\\" which introduced us to Hari Seldon, psychohistory and Hari's plan to reduce 30,000 years of chaos to a mere 1,000 years. This book is two novelettes combined into one book, and tells how the Foundation struggles to survive against the remnants of the galactic empire and then against a mutant, whose coming Hari Seldon failed to predict.In the first part of this story we meet the General, Bel Riose. I enjoyed the story, but I kept getting the feeling that Bel Riose was being manipulated for most of the story. I assumed that Riose was being manipulated by the Foundation, though it was also possible that the Second Foundation, which we learn much more about in the second half of this book, was also manipulating Riose. In spite of my perceived lack of suspense as I waited for Riose's inevitable defeat, I did enjoy this half of the book while longing to get into the second half.In the second half of the book we meet a unique and unpredictable mutant called the Mule. The mutant is called the Mule for biological reasons. We also learn that the Mule was unpredicted by Hari Seldon. The Mule realizes that the Second Foundation is his only true nemesis as he quickly conquers the Foundation. The Mule follows the exploits of researchers as they seek, and find, the Second Foundation. How can the Second Foundation be discovered? Has the Second Foundation been discovered? Is Hari Seldon's plan truly out of control? The reader must move on to \\"Second Foundation\\" to learn these answers and more!I enjoyed the second part of this book immensely. I had to read about the Mule until I learned whether he had truly destroyed Seldon's plan. Unfortunately, I had to wait until the next book in the series to learn the truth, but I was still on the edge of my seat.This book carries on nicely from \\"Foundation.\\" If you liked that book you will enjoy seeing the challenges the Foundation faces as it tries to help create a future that remains hundreds of years away. This book is a worthy second book in the original Foundation Trilogy.The final book in the original Foundation Trilogy is \\"Second Foundation.\\"Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Not surprisingly this is a second reading - I first enjoyed this classic about twenty years ago.There's much to enjoy. Or, rather, there's the central idea to enjoy: Asimov is generally at his best in short stories with a single \`what if' notion. What's unusual about Foundation is that he managed to successfully spin his workable \`psycho-historian' idea out into a (wisely short) novel. The series even kicked along OK for a while, but by the time we get to the dreadful fifth Foundation and Earth Asimov had spun out of control into event horizon of his ego.One way he gets away with a whole novel here is by basically telling the same story three times (only the character's names have been changed to protect the word count). Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are all puppet master politicians who keep their master-plans carefully hidden, pulling a clever rabbit out of a hat at the last minute to thwart their thug foes: I can't really remember who's motto was something like, \\"Violence is the last resort of the unintelligent,\\" but it works as well for any of them. The latter two are a bit annoying in their reiterated, \`Look, it's obvious how to solve this crisis - Seldon's plan means there's no other way', when it's no such thing, but the joy of fiction is never having to say your wrong. I mean, Asimov's quasi-Marxist political theory of historical progress is, at heart, flapdoodle, but he can have the fun constructing his universe to confirm his protagonists' convictions. We can have fun to: it's a nice idea competently realised.The leading men are arrogant, spurning or using public opinion with machiavellian disdain while they manipulate enemies with the same Trojan horse technique. Oh, and they are, of course, leading *men*: Asimov's SF futuristic orientation didn't stretch as far as women being any more than pantomime caricatures, if indeed they exist at all. His only female character is execrably predictable: vain, pretty and shrewish. People are basically divided into three groups: realists (successful scientists, businessmen and/or politicians); greedy amoral militaristic imperialists; and sheep."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It had been quite some time since I had read Asimov, so I was relatively excited when I picked up Foundation. I was not disappointed in the least. This novel is an absolutely fabulous piece of psycho-political drama that is perhaps most enjoyable because of its suspenseful trill as well as its political/sociological considerations.The entire text, built on the theories of the fictional character Hari Seldon, is driven by the concept of psycho-history. This is primarily a form of mathematical sociology that allows for the statistical prediction of galactic masses, given a set of variables. As the Galactic Empire is beginning to crumble, Hari Seldon perceives this fall and takes the precautions to insure a quick return to a Second Empire. The development of his Plan spurs him to create two foundations at the ends of the galaxy to promote this return.This text chronicles the early founding and rise of the first foundation. Given the nature of psychohistory, most events unfold in such a way that a critical moment, at which the probability of success is nearly 100%, always arrives for solutions to the problems facing the foundation. This drives the story in a suspenseful manner, as Asimov pursues the interrelation of individual freedom and the \\"mob psychology\\" of psychohistory. The text is also an interesting exploration into the rise of power by a means of a variety of factors, concealed in this review for the sake of not spoiling the story.Foundation deserves the accolades of the Sci-Fi community and truly should be read by anybody who has any latent interest in science fiction or fantasy. It is an exciting, and fulfilling read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the unabridged audio cd version of Isaac Azimov's book foundation.

All are must-reads for any hardcore science-fiction and cyberpunk collector."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation and Empire is basically a continuation of Foundation. There really isn't a new plot, just new problems for the Foundation to deal with. Foundation and Empire is pretty good, but without the novelty of the new ideas presented in Foundation, it is a bit flat. About the only reason I could think of to recommend this book is so you can see what else happens to Seldon's colony."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first tried reading this book when I was 11. For me at the time, it seemed boring at that age, and I had trouble reading it. Next year, I picked up the book again, and couldn't stop reading it. Asimov sets up a realistic structure for how to contain millenias of combined information from across a galaxy, and build a stable, remote world to contain the falling Empire's scientific knowledge. But especially after reading the entire series, I always must ask, is psycho history scientifically possible? It states that the actions of an individual doesn't affect the flow of the universe. Later int he series though, you will learn of the mule that broke this rule, and even later after the trilogy, where he came from. But how could mathematics, and the general pschology of people,possibly predict when specific crisis's happen. Even though in Second Foundation, where the reader learns more about the second foundation, which is based not on science, but on pschohistory, helps maintain the course of the Foundation. You can get lost in thought trying to discover the possibilities psychohistory could bring, if it could work.????"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It is astonishing to realize that science fiction consisted of a relative humble portion of Isaac Asimov's ouevre. While most of his time was spent on nonfiction work, his contributions to science fiction proved so monumental that there is not a single science-fiction writer today who has not been influenced, in some way, by Asimov's writing. His intellectual and engaging fiction has produced some of the finest short stories and novels in the genre, in classics such as \\"The Last Question\\" and \\"Nightfall\\". But his seminal work is the top-of-the-pyramid, groundbreaking, and famous \\"Foundation Trilogy\\". He is to SF what Tolkien is for Fantasy.\\"Foundation\\" is an entertaining piece of sociopolitical SF in the backdrop of a space opera. This book is the foundation of SF for the past six decades. Asimov's prose is clear and concise, without any room for ambiguity or vain style. Asimov's words, though pared down and stripped of subtext, are not any less true or beautiful or witty.Set thousands of years in the future, after humanity has colonized millions of planets in our galaxy, \\"Foundation\\" introduces the Galactic Empire is in its waning years. One man on the capital planet of Trantor, Hari Seldon, predicts the cataclysmic and chaotic decline and fall of the Empire. Seldon has developed the science of psychohistory, which aims to calculate the behaviour of mass populations over the course of events using, among other things, socioeconomic trends. Seldon has predetermined not only the demise of the Empire, but that thirty millennia of barbarism will follow, unless his organization, the Foundation, is able to finish its gargantuan mission of cataloguing and preserving all accumulated human knowledge and history. The act would serve to lessen an inevitable thirty-thousand years to a mere thousand.Asimov portrays the epic grandeur of the galaxy through the unyielding arc of time and history. Individual lives are ineffectual, though not inconsequential, in the grand scheme of things. Throughout the stories, there is a pervading sense of \`greater good' or \`the bigger picture'. There is only one recurring character in each of the five tales: the Foundation. It stands in the background, an entity both mysterious and arresting; a godlike presence that shaped religion and ruled a city. The story of the Foundation is portrayed through the periodic snippets of human life throughout the growth of the First Foundation from an indefensible, dependent, colony in the backwaters of the outskirts of a great empire to a massive political juggernaut with commercial and technological prowess. The central characters: Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, Salvor Hardin, Linmar Ponyets, and Hober Mallow are seen in flashes as their importance and contribution to the longevity of the Foundation is waxes and wanes.Asimov has an arresting flair for conjuring up a methodical, articulate, and complex history. In the battle for free will over determinism, Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" falls securely into the side of the determinists. Psychology and economic trends and the insurmountable turn of time dominate the short stories with a sense of inevitability. But it the tone of the story is far from pessimistic. There is only ever the slightest indication that they should lose hope, or that individual lives are meaningless. As one character says, \\"Seldon's laws help those who help themselves.\\" Asimov appears to advocate forging a better future through the sole and collective action of the present.Unquestionably, \\"Foundation\\" is an intellectual treat that tends to emphasis the background scenes as opposed to the ones that illustrate more action. Most of the book is exposition and dialogues between characters in a meeting over smokes. The third story, The Mayors, provides the most exciting, and arguably cleverest, climactic confrontation in the book. It is a scene between Mayor Hardin and Prince Regent Wienis. Hardin, in a stroke of brilliance, has manipulated events to stave off a rival political party's attempt to impeach him and end the threat posed by the Four Kingdoms.\\"Foundation\\" is a significant to the genre in more ways than the ideas it challenged us with. It is the culmination of science fiction into a literature encompassing reason and ideas. It reinvigorated the genre and turned it into a platform of higher ideals and concepts. \\"Foundation\\" steered it away from the pulp swamp creatures. It did for science fiction what \\"Spiderman\\" (2002) did for superhero movies, or in particular, what Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" (2005) reboot did for the franchise. Asimov gives us excellent characters, complex sociopolitics, and a good story that never wanes."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is far and beyond one of my favorite books of all time. Anyone who enjoys scifi must read this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is an interesting technological/political science fiction. A very famous book, obviously. The Galactic Empire has lasted 12,000 years, but it is predicted by Hari Seldon, a genius scientist/psychologist/mathematician that the Empire will fall within 300 years. So he takes a large group of people to the distant planet of Terminius, to create the Encyclopedia Galatica, a book of knowledge. It won't save the Empire, but at least will prevent the world from falling into chaos for too long. At least, that's what I got from the purpose. The various parts of the book skip from generation to generation of people on Terminus, and their various political problems.The political element of Foundation was very interesting to me. I hadn't read much political science fiction before. I don't think the world was that well developed; there wasn't a lot of description of it, it was more focused on the various power-plays and intrigues going on. Also, the way that each part is a different time period was a little off-putting; I really would have liked to know more about Gaal Dornick and some of the other characters. But you can't really narrate 300 years of history without skipping many years. At first, I thought Gaal Dornick was going to be the protagonist. I was wrong.Anyway, Foundation was an intriguing science fiction with an interesting plot, and I'm certainly glad that I decided to read it.

If so, I look forward to (possibly) reading them.All of my reviews can be read at my blog (novareviews.blogspot.com)."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The book was apparently resent after not arriving 5 weeks after ordering and it still hasnt arrived after two months. phshopus customer service has been responsive but there is something going wrong with the shipment process"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second book in Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy.

I believe the best idea is to read the books in order of publication, but any reader will do fine reading them in chronological order as well (shown below).Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" was not conceived as the beginning of series of novels. It was not conceived as a novel. It was not even conceived entirely by Isaac Asimov.Beginning in the late 1930s and for decades thereafter, the editor of the most prestigious and far more important, the best-paying monthly publication in science fiction was John W. Campbell of Astounding Science Fiction (now known as Analog.)Before taking over the editorship of the magazine, Campbell had been a popular hack writer of unabashed, wild-eyed space opera. A typical Campbell plot involved a couple of young American go-getters who whomp up a superduper space cruiser in their garage, set out on a test flight around Saturn, find themselves hurled into another dimension by a short circuit, and stumble on a planet inhabited by humans who are at war with some interplanetary Nasties who display unusually bad table manners. They forge an alliance with the good humans against the bad Nasties which, a few hundred pages later, inevitably leads to the utter annihilation of the world of the Nasties, not to mention the Nasties themselves and every vestige of their million year-old civilization and culture. By the literary standards of pulp magazine science fiction in 1936, this was pretty sophisticated stuff.When Campbell took over the reins of the magazine in 1938, he raised his sights. In short order he dumped the old stable of writers whose collective knowledge of science could have been stuffed into a peanut shell with room to spare and began cultivating new ones. A. E. van Vogt specialized in social science mumbo-jumbo that actually sounded like it meant something. L. Sprague deCamp had a sense of humor. Robert Heinlein possessed a literary spark that might be carefully fanned into a flame. And Isaac Asimov was a college kid from Brooklyn who wrote stories to stretch out the limited income generated by his father's candy store.All these and many others were overawed by the wondrous fact that the godlike JWC deigned to accept their humble stories--after he mercilessly picked apart their flaws and demanded re-writes, pronto!Those were the heroic days of magazine publishing. Editors in general and Campbell in particular did not wait for undisciplined and slothful writers to hatch ideas. No, JWC would call in his disciples and hand out plot lines and devices to be made into short stories, novelets and serialized novels. To van Vogt he tossed the idea of a totalitarian society whose tyranny was leavened by weapons shops that sold guns which could only be used in self defense. From deCamp, citing Mark Twain's \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" he demanded to know what would happen if a contemporary American were hurled back from Mussolini's Italy to post-imperial Rome. Of Heinlein he demanded a series of stories that would collectively outline the history of the next few hundred years. For Asimov he reserved a far larger patch of history. What, he queried, would happen when a galaxy-spanning empire finally decayed and began to fall?Asimov pondered. Then, in his own words, \\"With a little bit of cribbin' / From the works of Edward Gibbon / And that Greek Thucydides,\\" Asimov took the Roman Empire of the Fifth Century and cast it into the stars as the expiring Empire of Trantor. From Eighteenth Century France he took the Encyclopedists and renamed them the Foundation. Finally he spiced up his literary gumbo with blather about \\"psychohistory,\\" a mathematically-based fortune telling system which yielded valid results when the human population achieved the vast numbers only attainable in a galaxy-spanning civilization.Campbell bought the first story. The fans--at the time, a demographic aged 12-25 and virtually all-male--loved it. Campbell ordered more stories. The Trantorian Empire fell, but slowly and reluctantly. The fans loved it. The Empire blazed up under the last great imperial general, Bel Riose. (Gibbon's Belisarius, get it?) The fans loved it. A Napoleon-like conqueror appeared to muddy up the predictions of the psychohistorians. The fans loved it. Darkness and barbarism followed the collapse of civilization across the Milky Way. And the fans loved it. On and on it went, to book, to trilogy, beyond--even to new books written by other hands long after the passing of Campbell and Asimov.The fans still love it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is not a novel, but a series of stories which had been published separately. The entire trilogy was written in nine stories which were completed in the period between 1941 and 1951. Asimov notes himself in the foreword that part of what he intended with the fourth book _Foundation's Edge_ was to have a chance to write an actual Foundation novel.I actually like the effect that the story-based approach gives, particularly considering that Foundation is meant to be covering the fall of galactic empire and the rise of a new power. Having chapters based on discrete periods, I think the reader gets a better sense of the sheer time involved in politics than any 9000 -page space opera could ever achieve.One of the things I like about Foundation and its subsequent other parts is that it isn't an action-packed adventure. There isn't high romance. It isn't really about individual heartache and success, although the role of the individual is important. It's a meditative look at both politics and the future, and a darned sharp one at that.An excellent read, even worth the time for people who don't think that they like science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Personally, I don't like &quot;classic&quot; sci-fi. It can be preachy, dated, dry, corny or just not as &quot;mature&quot; as modern science fiction. However, Asimov gives just enough characterization, not too much science and the right amount of action adventure and conceptual gems to keep your mind racing. He truly is the grand daddy of science fiction.Quirky lines like &quot;Galaxy knows!&quot; or &quot;By Seldon!&quot; evoke nostalgia for the time of space rangers and laser guns. So what if nuclear power is a thing of the past? Asimov doesn't beat you down with tecnobabble. You just know that thats the prime power source in his idea of the future. Remember, this was written in 1941. Furthermore, the writing style and dialogue don't seem dated at all. Asimov's writing is simple, clean, and doesn't get bogged down with excess ramblings. His true talent is in plotting unexpected twists and turns that make this book a pageturner.Hari Seldon created psychohistory. It is mathematics applied to the development of human society on a grand scale. Seldon's new science predicts the path of human civilization with no regard to individual actions. Religion has given us fate vs. free will. Asimov poses a perhaps even more frustrating question, what if science tells us that one man's will cannot change the path of history?You're not going to get soliquoys droning on and on about a lost love or a crumbled courage; But what you do get is a brilliant collection of short stories Asimov wrote separately that later were compiled as one novel.The four(?) stories are brief yet cohesive glimpses into the developing stages of the Foundation's rise amidst the decay of the Imperial Empire. Each character driven event propels the Foundation through its first stages of development: political autonomy, technology protected by religion, and economy. I think Asimov did a great job in breathing life into these characters. After I finished the book, I remembered Hari Seldon's mystic wisdom, Salvor Hardin's determination and Hober Mallow's money hungry practicality and what remains is an overwhelming sense of awe and satisfaction. You will get that too."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation trilogy is really a rebinding of stories published serially in Astounding Magazine, so each part really stands on its own, making only passing references to previous stories and explaining anything necessary to the current plot.Asimov's writing is rather dialog-heavy, and evolves slowly enough that I couldn't get past the first book when I read it the first time (in high school). Coming back to it years later, I've really enjoyed these three volumes, and am looking forward to reading the extension novels by Greg Bear and David Brin, two of my favorite authors (and the reason I picked up Foundation again). It's not as slow as Lord of the Rings (also worthwhile for those with patience).The story is very interesting, and lets you into the psyche of the characters only through their words and actions, so your understanding of them builds slowly through your reading.I definitely recommend Foundation. I also read Bujold's &quot;Warrior's Apprentice&quot; recently, which I find to be similar in style, and I recommend that as well."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the second volume published of Asimov's classic Foundation series (originally published as two novellas in 1945).

He gets permission from the emperor to wage a campaign. The Foundation must find a way to stop him. Fortunately, the mathematics of Hari Seldon has already considered a course of action. In Part II, called &quot;The Mule,&quot; a mutant with unparalleled power (power never considered in Hari Seldon's psychohistory; he can control the emotions and commitments of others) fights and defeats the Foundation about 300 years after the start of the novel &quot;Foundation.&quot; But, now the Mule has to go in search of the Second Foundation which is made up of psychologists and psychohistorians (the First Foundation had been set up primarily with physical scientists).

For all its episodic construction (unavoidable, considering the unparalleled scope) and its rather flat, exclusively male characters, the Foundation Trilogy takes readers back to a time when America was making the world safe for democracy, personal freedoms were a given, and science seemed to be the salvation of a fallible humanity.The first volume, Foundation, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to mold a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. After the introduction, whose final paragraphs subtly lay out the whole structure without our knowing it, we get to see the Plan in action as the Foundation faces a series of political and military crises. Because the scientist/hero is long dead before the second chapter, the heroes are the political and economic, rather than scientific, leaders who must resist the temptation to take direct military action, and instead allow events to proceed until Seldon's Plan points out the answer. The magic of this book is the exquisite means the Foundation uses to defeat its enemies without resorting to force, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make these solutions seem inevitable. As such, each chapter is like a sociopolitical puzzle that challenges the reader to find the move that will defuse each situation, and taken together these stories comprise a virtual primer in diplomacy.Countless millions of fans have enjoyed Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, consisting of Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. Other Foundation novels, written by the master in his later years, lack the simple charm that makes these earlier works so popular. They were tacked on solely because the power of those first three created a demand that Asimov felt obligated to try to fill, but they have an entirely different feel, and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.This book is about political maneuvering, not action, so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans, although the next book in the series, Foundation and Empire, is a little more dynamic, and reading the complete Trilogy is a must, since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off. Still, the vast historical vision begun in this book is so sweeping, it should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Many consider Foundation a Sci-Fi classic, while others concider it a poorly written, boring piece of something I really shouldn't mention by name.I personally fall within the first category, I liked this book a lot. But although I myself loved this novel and its sequels, I do can imagine why other people simply hated it.Those who don't like it usally refer to the fact that there is virtually no character development, no action of any kind whatsoever, and that the technology used seems outright \\"retro\\" (nuclear trashcans and the like).All of this critism is undoutably true. Since this book is actually a collection of a series of short stories, and all of those are about different eras in the history of the Foundation, Asimov has to replace most of his characters every 50 to 100 pages which leaves room nor reason for descent characters.And since the story focusses promary on events in the future \\"history\\" of mankind and the reasons they take place, most of what happens is people talking to other people, with only small references to battles, wars, and sofort.Finally, lest not forget that these stories were written when the last century was only halfway over. Nuclear trashcans, atomic guns, and typwriter-isch computers were perfectly plausable back then.The point I am trying to make with this review is that this book is about a subject that simply isn't everybody's cup of tea. Foundation is nowhere near as accessible as Sci-Fi series such as Star Wars, Star Trek, or Babylon 5 (all good series in their own right). Or even like the more famous classic Sci-Fi novels such as \\"2001: a Space Oddessy\\", \\"1984\\", or \\"Dune\\".If you like juggling with logic and stories of people trying to make sense of their situations, then you're probably going to liove it.However, if you're more into character development, scientific discovery, or action, I wouldn'd recommend reading this novel. You'll probaly just get bored to tears."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a landmark in science fiction, and epitomizes the best of what Isaac Asimov stood for. This book proves that you don't have to have a lot of sex and mindless violence (\\"-the last refuge of the incompetent\\") to make a book suspenseful and a page-turner. The book is entirely without action and romance in the normal sense, and consists almost entirely of dialogue. What makes it so interesting is the ideas (and reversals of ideas) that it presents, in all their aspects, subsequently debates, and solves. It has an aura of almost detective story fascination with regards to political ideas. What is interesting is that the book takes a pacifistic approach to politics, and thereby forces itself to present a plausible solution to occurring problems (say, rebellion, anarchy, and war) without degrading into violence. Each self-contained story (the book is not a novel, but a collection of stories that were originally published stand-alone) is therefore a sort of logic puzzle (much the same, in principle, as Isaac's Robot stories) that you must delve into and accede all its ramifications, and come out with an answer that will work, without using violence. It's a credit to Asimov that he could not only achieve this, but make it interesting, and, indeed, arresting. This is an essential science fiction read, and perhaps Asimov's apex."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I had read a great deal of Arthur C. Clarke, Peter F. Hamilton and H.G. Wells before finally coming upon Issac Asimov.I really hadn't heard of him until a friend of mine recommended him to me. I was looking for a new author to read after coming off 4,000+ pages of Peter F. Hamilton, and decided to try something different.In the beginning, I was a little worried that since the books were written in the early 50s that they would be technologically dated and not have the technological appeal that newer scifi books had.I was TOTALLY wrong. The concepts that Asimov illustrates in his writting are still used today, and were probably their original origin.Asimov's writing style does take a little getting used to, however, but in the end, I appreicated it more than hated it. It's so different that it seems to give the characters an entirely different feel. With long, descriptive, deep dialoge and a very schemish design, you don't really fully understand the ENTIRE story until the end, when it finally clicks in one of the character's heads what is really going on, after meeting the supposed opponent and hearing his side of things.I think, in the end, the best part is how you can really see the evolution of the Foundation right before your eyes, and see how things happen and how some little thing that happened a hundred years ago set off some other thing that was HUGE in the present in the story.If you do not read Asimov's Foundation series, you cannot call yourself a scifi buff, remember that, always. Now GO and read!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read this book maybe 20 years ago, when I was more accustomed to 'action' sci-fi replete with ray guns and space ships and trying to guess how such technology shaped society (a la Larry Niven, to name one). This book is more like an historical novel, or a future history, like reading Gibbons or Kennedy. What is particularly astounding about this work, which he first published in 1951 at age 31, is Asimov's ability to scale- from the drama of a handful of individuals to the seminal events of the last decades of the ancient, galaxy-wide empire (which does not even remember its Earthly origin!). Unlike Heinlein's _Citizen of the Galaxy_ or _Friday_ (or many others) we do not follow the story of a single person or family in the backdrop of a civilization, but rather, the original Foundation trilogy makes both the individuals as well as the whole history of the galactic empire come alive in an extremely concise work. Here, the context is just as important as the characters, a scaling rarely seen elsewhere. This is the book's greatest strength- which becomes one of its weaknesses: To be sure, and Asimov himself admitted as much about sci-fi in general, the characterizations are not terribly deep. Much time, he has written elsewhere, is required to build the context of the worlds that sci-fi writers create, with little time left to build characters to any depth. But we are watching the fall of worlds, so the relatively shallow characters may be overlooked.A must read among the classics of sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Ultimately, the hardest decision about the Foundation books is to decide how to read them. Maybe I'm being ridiculous, but I think you will enjoy them more if you read them in the order they were written. If so, this is the second book. If you have not yet read Foundation, then you need to go back and do so before tackling this one.Your other choice is to read the prequels first, then go onto Foundation. In that case, this is the fourth book you should read.Whichever choice you make, don't read this book first.On the surface, Foundation and Empire will seem like an uninspired playing out of Hari Seldon's vision for the future. Ah! But there's much more happening, so pay attention. When you get to the end of the book, you may find you have missed the mainstream and will have to go back. Don't worry, almost everyone has that reaction.Asimov is a brilliant conceptual writer, but not someone who slaved over every word (in fact, he was famous for writing most of his many books in only 1 or 2 drafts, with little editing after that). This book begins to develop the full Foundation concept in all of its stunning beauty.In many ways, you will be reading this book from the eyes of the first Foundation. But that's the unimportant one. The real action is with the second Foundation. Be sure to keep that in mind.When you meet the Mule, don't think of him as an aberration but rather as an extension of today's potential. That will make the book more interesting for you.Many people find this book to be the least interesting one of the Foundation series. Let me warn you that reading this one will greatly increase your pleasure in the following books beginning with the Second Foundation (which is your next pleasant reading assignment).Enjoy this irresistible series!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire,\\" the second novel in Isaac Asimov's landmark science fiction series, is a definite improvement on the first novel. The first novel was hardly a novel at all, but rather a loose and uneven collection of short stories. \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is actually two novellas, and more care has obviously been taken with writing style, pacing, and character development.The second story, \\"The Mule,\\" is perhaps the best of the entire Foundation series. The characters are enjoyably real and likable, and there are two masterful surprises at the end.The entire Foundation series is essential reading for any science fiction fan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"You can read the publisher's summary for yourself, but let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one, \\"Foundation,\\" creates the future world, its declining culture, and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two, Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule, and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain, books that offer good mysteries, and books that make you think about bigger things in life, than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have not readf the Foundation series in years. However, the other day I was thinking about how much fun the trilogy had been. One has to remember that most of the scifi you read today has at least some of its roots based in Asimov's work, Asimov was not the best writer, nor was he the most creative. What he did accomplish was selling you another time and world that you could believe in. So, taking it for what it is, not a great piece of literature but a really enjoyable trip, i need to give the trilogy 5 stars."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I always prefer to think of the foundation Trilogy as one book.They are meant to be read one after another and are also written that way.While the first part(Foundation) gives us the historical perspective and a sketch of characters who influence the events,this book is where it gets better in a serious way!!There is not much of a point in discussing the plot-lots of other people have commented on that.But i'll tell you this - the 2nd part of this book- which talks about the Mule and his rise to power is THE best part of the ENTIRE FOUNDATION series ( Yes all the 7 books!!).IT ends with the most famous twist on paper it will make your mind reel!! It sets up the things nicely for the Second foundation - the 3 book in the series.I have read almost everything that Asimov's written.The foundation series and the End of Eternity are my favourites.The difference between Asimov and the other Science Fiction writers is that he makes the Science Fiction believable.Asimov is also a very good mystery writer(no kidding!! - he's right up there with the authors who write mystery alone).It's easy to write a Sci Fi book with an amazing amount of Science and imagination- but how well you can bind it to a story and make it real, that is the deal.Apart from the idea the story has to be told well. This is where the good doctor excelled.Trust me if you have not read the Foundation Series you are missing something which in indelibly written in the records as the one of the best books on paper.Asimov's written it so that you are sufficiently intrested for more at the end of the book one , by the time you finish the second book you are thinking this is great stuff - desperate for more you go the 3rd book. By the time you are through you think this is soooo cool - it might be the best thing you ever read.Do yourself a favour go read the Foundation and Empire , follow that up with the Second Foundation.You'll be glad you did when you return to it over the years!!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Welcome to the second book in the Foundation trilogy (although Asimov did write further books, it was a trilogy originally). The book picks up where Foundation left off - the Foundation has established itself as a formidable force in the Periphery of the Galaxy. Of course, everyone is too well aware that gaining control of the local warlords is small potatoes compared to what's to come. In Foundation and Empire, the inevitable comes.As the previous novel, Asimov has divided this into books, however here there are only two. As a result, he gets to explore the characters at more length then in Foundation. But again, expect wonder, amazement and enjoyment at the themes, issues and grandeur of this book, not the characterisation and &quot;literary&quot; qualities.In the first book, the conflict between the Foundation and what's left of the Empire develops. This however is a much bigger game - in the past, the warlords barely out-war-powered the Foundation, while here the Empire dwarfs it even in its twilight. As always, something must be done other than a brute force tactic. Furthermore, the &quot;heroes&quot; of the Foundation are no more, in the conflict there are no Mallows or Hardins to guide the political intrigue, so it is here that Seldon's plan is put to the ultimate test.In the second book (not to give away too much), a new threat to the Plan arises. A man known only as the Mule comes to light. And for the first time, an individual drastically changes the course of history. Indeed, he consists of the biggest threat to the plan thus far. What's so special about him?.. Personally, I found this book the most enjoyable in the whole trilogy - it reminds me of the little cryptic &quot;detective&quot; plotting from other Asimov works I read, such as I Robot and Steel Caves. However, here, it's an almost perfect melodrama played out (and unlike many detective elements in novels includingthose of Asimov - this one doesn't seem contrived or make you feel at all &quot;cheated&quot;), as we follow some Foundationers in their quest to find out what the Mule is and how to deal with him.This is a great continuation of the saga and will also bring out many interesting questions - like whether an individual can change the course of history. It will also shake up your conception of the Seldon plan - overall, a great book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I just finished Foundation and Empire and so far it is my favorite in the series....Foundation presented us a struggling organization of scientists on the Planet Terminus who must deal with the newly formed barbarian kingdoms that arise from the retreating Empire. Important figures within the Foundation use religion, trade and technology to dominate over adversarial planets....In Foundation and Empire, we are given a new perspective on the Foundation. Before, we were lead to believe that the Foundation must survive and that no one could hinder its progess; that Hari Seldon's predictions of the Foundation were infallible; that the 1,000 year plan was set in stone and that a new Galactic Empire will arrise in such time thanks to Hari Seldon. However, these beliefs are put into question when an individual calling himself 'The Mule' threatens to destroy Hari Seldon's 300 year old project. He is a mutant of considerable mental powers who can seemingly convert anyone into his cause, even the greatest opponent. Thus, we are asked, \\"Does Hari Seldon's precious Psychohistory take random genetic mutation into account? If not, then is it possible for the Mule to destroy the Foundation?\\"...I loved the ending to Foundation and Empire. Like Empire Stikes Back, it leaves you hanging, desperately wanting to find out what happens to the main characters (and the galaxy) after the book ends....I've always loved enigmatic characters in books. The Mule fits this catagory, which, in my mind, makes him even more sinister and evil. We never see him or hear him speak (for all those who have read the book, don't say anything), and yet we experience his destructive force. It reminds me of Sauron of The Lord of the Rings. At the end, however, we are given a profound revelation of the Mule that adds a new dimension to his character....All in all, it was the dispair and depression in the book that captured me. There was little hope and yet the human spirit was still evident. I applaud Asimov for creating a believable story in which death, destruction and dispair overshadow an entire galaxy but hope and determination remain. This theme, I think, is present throughout the series and, in my opinion, is the most important human quality that makes us who we are. The foundation is ultimately an exploration of this theme. Clearly, Hope is the most formiddble force that human history and, according to Asimov, the galaxy has ever seen."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second book of the original trilogy, this book is an amazing follow on to &quot;Foundation&quot;. The seven books of the Foundation series together form what I consider to be the most complete and astonishing blend of deep reality with science fiction.

Note also that I do not consider Asimov's early &quot;Empire&quot; novels to apply to the Foundation series. Interesting that they were included in Foundation's Triumph, but not relevant. It was cheesy in my opinion that the &quot;time machine&quot; was included in that story and then not even used for any practical purpose. Again, another plot-joiner there (Triumph was filled with them!). So, 14 books in all, in my estimation. The three galactic empire books are so cheesy, just don't read them...nothing to do with Foundation at all."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I was expecting so much more from this book as it was once awarded best sci-fi series ever. It was good, but not that great. Maybe in the 1950's it was the best of sci-fi, but compared to today's standards it was a little boring and out of date. It contains long dialogs and a lot of politics wrapped in a sci-fi environment. It doesn't contain fascinating worlds and interesting glimpses of the future. There's not a lot of action but I have to admit the dialog is pretty good. If you're into nostalgia, politics and interesting dialog this book is for you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In reviewing the book Foundation I am recommending that you read all of the Foundation books by Asimov. Just get started and read them all. Even though each book can be read individually, do yourself a favor and read them in order. I won't be reviewing any other books in the series. I want you to do the whole series.One of the most interesting ideas that Asimov gives us is the ultimate form of self defense. No, it isn't karate or jiu jitsu, boxing or wrestling. It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles, things that aren't what they seem to be, surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat, to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"From everything I've heard about this book, I was really excited to read it. After reading the first half in a few days then forcing myself to finish the second half after taking a two week break, I can honestly say that I found it to be a real let down.The main theme was about the only part I liked. Humanity has colonized the stars and controls everything blah blah blah but a really smart guy and his friends do some math equations and figure out that the currently all-powerful and all-encompassing Empire is doomed to collapse and thrust mankind thousands of years back to a &#34;barbaric&#34; state. His solution is to gather all the great minds of the day and create an educated stronghold on the edge of the galaxy to serve as a becon of hope and enlightnenment to supposedly shorten the time mankind has to spend in the dark ages.Their main goal is to create an encyclopedia that pretty much contains every biit of information ever learned. Ever. (wikipedia)Well it turns turns out that several years after the creation of Foundation, the shallow characters are riddeled with &#34;crises&#34;. Good thing the late creator appears via prerecorded videos at strategic times to offer advice to the indistinguishable residents and assures them that he did some math problems fifty years ago and discovered that everyting with work itself out. This is the basis for the rest of the book.The characters are dull, boring and super confident in everything they do because some dead guys math and future predictions will save them all.The second half of the book proved to be slightly more interesting, but not much"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The first thing to understand about Foundation is that it isn't really a novel. It is a collection of 5 connected short stories (The Psychohistorians, The Encyclopedists, The Mayors, The Traders, & The Merchant Princes) written in the 1940s for publication in Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. The first story in the book was actually written a few years later for repackaging the stories as the first novel in what would eventually become the Foundation trilogy (later expanded with additional books).The galactic empire is rotting. After it collapses, there will follow 30,000 years of barbarism. Nothing can prevent the collapse, but Hari Seldon believes that the subsequent dark ages can be contained to 1,000 years if the proper steps are taken. To achieve this he sets up the Foundation at the very fringes of the empire. The first two stories are far and away the best in the book, and are worth the price of admission by themselves. This is because they deal directly with the central premise, which is a fantastic idea.Things go downhill with the next two stories. In particular, The Traders, seems completely unnecessary. Things pick up a bit with the final chapter.Taken as a whole, Foundation is less than the sum of its parts. I don't think it is the unrivaled masterpiece that many make it out to be. I would definitely go in with an open mind and lowered expectations.However, as I mentioned earlier, the idea is fantastic and promises much more and better to come. I will definitely be checking out the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have no idea why I hadn't read this series until now.

The premise and scope of this novel are staggering and the plot develops at a blistering pace. You will not be able to put this book down once you start. The only minor critique I have of this book is that, as a series of novellas that continually advance into the future, characters you have grown to care about are quickly whisked away and replaced by new ones. Therefore, it is helpful to approach this book as a set of separate, though interconnected stories. When all is said and done, this book sets the stage for one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time.

Even if your taste is for other styles, Asimov's \\"future history\\" has rightly become part of the science fiction canon of great books.The first episode in \\"Foundation\\" appeared about 50 years ago as a stand-alone story in Astounding Science Fiction under the title \\"Bridle and Saddle.\\" At the time, Asimov had no idea where it would eventually lead. Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, and the Galactic Empire emerged in that single story to shape all the \\"Foundation\\" novels that were to follow. It's all the more remarkable, then, to read that story today with the realization that none of the sequels or \\"prequels\\" had yet been thought of.The original \\"Foundation\\" trilogy is written in a style that may seem quaint or even prim in comparison to the baroque convolutions found in some novels of the '90s. And, at the time, one reviewer had trouble with the episodicity: \\"The bare bones show.\\" On the other hand, many readers find those early Asimov stories to be quite refreshing.If I had to choose, I would rate \\"Foundation\\" as the best of the entire series. Outside the \\"Foundation\\" series, I think \\"Caves of Steel\\" is his very best, closely followed by \\"Pebble in the Sky,\\" although, as Asimov himself said, the latter was written at a time when almost nothing was known about the hazards of nuclear radiation.Some critics have questioned the logic in Hari Seldon's \\"psychohistory.\\" Deterministic as it is, how can Asimov's clever heroes count for much in the grand scheme of things? Perhaps, in some as yet unwritten novel, \\"psychohistory\\" will be revealed to be a kind of secular religion where the mathematical trappings are a faade behind which a happy few labor heroically to save the galaxy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Although Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is over 40 years old, his overall writing is still top notch.

A darker story, &quot;Empire&quot; introduces the Mule who proves that Asimov's Foundation galaxy is not always a happy and predictable place.

With prequels and sequels, it tells the story of Hari Seldin's plan to preserve the achievments of mankind through the inevitable collapse of the Galactic Empire, and the chaos that follows. By use of the science of Psycho-History of which he represents the apex, Seldon atempts to establish the foundation, and reach beyond the grave to shape the forces of the future, but to what end? Sort of a stripped down Dune, it reads like a Steinbek re-write of The Scarlet Letter. With religious, psychological and political intrigue, Foundation and its subsequent works are the perfect stepping stone to Herbert's monumental series. If you like epic tales that span centuries in scope and content you'll enjoy this book and its companions. With short chapters and smoth flow it's perfect for the commuter or busy reader, and is a must for those who want a grouding in classic sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"An excellent science fiction novel, probably one of the best ever written.

I read all 296 pages in less than 12 hours. This book is so much better than more modern sci-fi (for the difference between SF and sci-fi, see Isaac Asimov Gold) because it actually has a story, rather than a colection of all the stupidity the author could think of.

I can't remember any other book that i've ever read that covers such a large time span in the way that this book does.

Originally published as two novellas, Foundation and Empire the novel is made up of \\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule\\".In \\"The General\\", as the Galactic Empire crumbles, General Bel Riose launches an attack on the Foundation. Although the Foundation is theoretically stronger than the Empire, General Bel Riose has access to greater resources and personnel and so his attack does begin to threaten the Foundation. A Foundation citizen named Devers intercepts a communication that details the General's double dealings and attempts to escape to Trantor so that he can show the communication to the Emperor and hopefully stop the attack.\\"The Mule\\" is set roughly one hundred years after \\"The General\\". The Empire has crumbled, Trantor has been sacked by invaders, and most of the galaxy has split into barbaric factions. Due to its extensive trading routes, the Foundation is now the major power in the galaxy. Until, that is, a new threat arises in the form of a growing army of barbarians led by a mysterious individual known as the Mule. Once it is discovered that Hari Seldon has failed to predict the existence of the Mule, Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell, along with psychologist Ebling Mis and a refugee clown named Magnifico Giganticus, travel the galaxy attempting to locate the Second Foundation that had been established by Seldon.Although a much darker and more intense book, Foundation and Empire is an excellent follow up to Foundation. Asimov's writing is excellent as ever, with his descriptions of the alien worlds and his characterisations being particularly strong. The whole Foundation series is fantastic and Foundation and Empire is further proof that Isaac Asimov is one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation, a collection of five short stories, is the first book in Isaac Asimov's epic century-spanning science fiction masterwork known as the Foundation Series.The first of the collected stories, \\"The Psychohistorians\\", takes place on Trantor, the capital planet of the 12000 year old Galactic Empire. Mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new science known as psychohistory which equates are possibilities in large societies to mathematics, allowing him to predict long-term outcomes. Using his psychohistory, Seldon discovers that the Galactic Empire is decaying and that it will collapse within 500 years, the collapse being followed by a 300000 year period of barbarism in the galaxy. When his findings are declared to be high treason, Seldon and a group of hand-picked scientists agree to go into exile on the planet Terminus, where they intend to create a mammoth Encyclopaedia Galactica as the repository for all human learning. In this way they hope to limit the period of chaos that will inevitably follow the collapse of the Empire.In \\"The Encyclopaedists\\", having progressed 50 years into the future, the planet Terminus is facing its first Seldon Crisis. The Foundation on Terminus is caught in the middle of a power struggle between four neighbouring planetary systems and the scientists are ill-equipped to deal with military matters. Luckily, Mayor Salvor Hardin is quick to realise the danger and attempts to work out a solution. Hardin receives guidance as to the way forward for the Foundation from an image of the now deceased Hari Seldon that appears in a specially created Time Vault and confirms that psychohistory has predicted a series of crises that will occur on Terminus.\\"The Mayors\\" takes place 30 years later when the Foundation has used its scientific knowledge as the basis for a pseudo religion that keeps neighbouring planets in order. However, the Prince Regent of Anacreon seeks to overthrow the Foundation and so Salvor Hardin is once again called upon to avert a Seldon Crisis.In \\"The Traders\\" another 55 years have passed and a trader by the name of Limmar Ponyets is sent to the planet Askone to retrieve a fellow trader who is facing execution. The leaders of Askone are determined to avoid contact with, and contamination by, Foundation technology so Ponyets must employ devious methods to secure the release of his colleague.The final story is \\"The Merchant Princes\\". The Foundation has expanded and grown powerful through the use of its science religion and economics but three Foundation vessels have recently disappeared in the vicinity of Korell, a civilisation trying to develop their own variety of technical superiority. Trader Hober Mallow is sent to uncover information on their technology and hopefully find the missing ships.Foundation is clearly an epic undertaking, especially since anyone who reads this first book is pretty much guaranteed to want to progress on to the further books in the series, but it is well worth the effort. The Foundation Series is perhaps more esoteric that Asimov's Robot Series but is still a rewarding read. The characters, planets and indeed empires that Asimov has created are truly immense and his storytelling ability is outstanding. Foundation is a fantastic book by one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I hadn't read this since I was a teenager. I had forgotten what an excellent writer and fantastic mind Isaac Asimov was. It was refreshing to see character and idea development that kept my interest and actually made me think. Read this and enjoy all Asimov was to the Science Fiction genre."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre, he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction. If you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose. The universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down. In case you couldn't tell.....I am a fan!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As is all Issac Asimov Novels this is good reading! The 4 star rating is that the story does not seem to come to a complete end, I did expect more."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"While I believe that Asimov was a great science fiction author I was disappointed in this book and the whole series. To me science fiction is about new ideas of the future and an exciting story. While the idea of a falling society, where some foresee the downfall of its society and plan to minimise the impact, is interesting, it could have been staged as well in the past. One can tell that the book has been written some while ago and it is missing the action and technologies I want to read about in a science fiction book today. For me personally the book is also very slow paced and not engaging enough to make me want to continue reading it, but rather read some chapters at a time and then I can put it down for weeks, since I am not engaged enough to read further. Still I am kind of interested in how the series continues and finally ends, but not interested enough that I have to use every free minute reading it. I find it hard to judge this book and if you are into science fiction I believe you just have to give it a try. Yes, I rated it only three stars, but rating this book in a one dimensional fashion doesn't do its justice, since I believe it is still a very good book, but just not what I was expecting of a science fiction and wanted to read. I personally prefer a Peter Hamilton, Stephen Baxter or Andreas Eschbach for example."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In a preface written in 1982 for a volume collecting the original \\"Foundation\\" trilogy, Asimov recalled the sources of inspiration for the series and boasted, \\"Why shouldn't I write of the Galactic Empire and of the return of feudalism. . . ? After all, I had read Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' not once, but twice.\\"Edward Gibbon's influence is certainly obvious in \\"Foundation.\\" A galactic empire, centered in Trantor (a celestial Rome), is on the verge of collapse. During the Dark Ages that follow, the surviving remnants at the extreme borders of the galaxy initially maintain control by creating a religion that hides scientific knowledge behind theological mysteries and by training a caste of priests to monopolize this learning. Asimov, however, goes beyond the period covered by Gibbon (who ended his masterwork with the age of the Crusades): when new and powerful rulers challenge the priestly authority, an upstart mercantile class--the Medicis and Borgias of the galactic future--gain the upper hand.Yet \\"Foundation\\" is hardly a history lesson; Asimov simply channeled his understanding of medieval and Renaissance Europe into a series of intriguing stories, what might instead be described as \\"psychohistorical\\" and sociopolitical thrillers. In the opening chapter, during the dying days of the Empire, Hari Seldon studies \\"psychohistory\\"--a kind of societal (but not individual) determinism based loosely on the idea that broad historical trends are cyclical and predictable. Aware that he cannot prevent the fall of the Empire, Seldon uses his learning to chart a course for the preservation of knowledge and an accelerated re-creation of a Second Empire. (Asimov had no way of knowing, of course, that psychohistory would later become a legitimate field of academic research by such scholars as Peter Gay.)Each of the five episodes in the book reads like a tautly played game of political chess in which the winner is inevitably the visionary who is not wedded to traditional moves and who is patient enough to wait for his opponent to make the first mistake. The suspense is developed almost exclusively from the \\"cold war\\" tension between rival forces: there's not much action in \\"Foundation,\\" and (as other readers have noted), the lengthy dialogue is spotty and the \\"character development\\" is pretty much nonexistent (although the same could surely be said about such sci-fi classics as \\"2001\\" and \\"The Time Machine\\"). But if you like your science fiction a tad cerebral, you'll find much to admire in Asimov's first major work."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre. This second installment is less episodic than the first volume, focusing on just two specific stories. The first volume, &quot;Foundation&quot;, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. &quot;Empire&quot; starts off in the same vein, showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying, but still dangerous Galactic Empire. Once again, the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable. Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation's authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government's economic power. While the Foundation is threatened with civil war, the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation, this volume focuses more on individual characters. In fact, it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question, \\"Do individuals matter?\\" As a result, the characters are developed slightly more, and there's even a wistful love triangle, and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume, which tended to be distant and impersonal. If you liked Foundation, you'll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series, Second Foundation.Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated, Asimov's sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction. Later additions to this series, both sequels and prequels, don't adhere to the tone of these original novels, and really add very little except bulk."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you have the patience to read the first 100 pages you'll not be able to put this book aside.The first time I read this book I was 14. I've probably read it a dozen times by now. The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The classic Foundation trilogy continues on pace in this second installment. The first half of this book is rather flat with uninspiring political wrangles and a story of the Empire's last general who is defeated by the Foundation and is never mentioned again. This episode has little effect on the overall flow of the story and is a curious piece of filler in this otherwise strong trilogy. However, the second half of this book, taking place many decades later, more than makes up for it. Here we learn that Hari Seldon's once flawless predictions on the course of humanity throughout the galaxy are starting to break down, because of the passage of huge amounts of time and the introduction of an unforeseen variable. This variable is a mutant known as The Mule, who has strange mental powers that are outside the realm of Seldon's psychohistory and throw his ancient predictions out of whack. Soon both the Foundation and the Empire are in ruins, and barbarism reigns throughout the galaxy. Only the mysterious Second Foundation, which has not been heard from since Seldon's day, can possibly help. Whether or not the Second Foundation can save the galaxy from the dark ages, and whether this is all really a part of Seldon's plan after all, are questions that arise in this book but are not answered. Thus we have an excellent intellectual cliffhanger that gives a great reason to continue to the third installment of the trilogy.There are two strange occurrences in this book that speak volumes on the time period in which Asimov wrote it, that being the 1940's. First, there is a prominent female character in this book, which was nearly unheard of in the sci-fi of that area. Furthermore, Asimov writes as if this is an amazing occurrence, and other characters are shocked and uncomfortable with this woman's status as an \\"equal\\" among the male characters around her. This sure seems strange today. Was Asimov slyly commenting on the state of women's rights back in mid-century, or did he think he was making a grand statement about the future? Either way, the sentiment is oddly outdated and even more oddly takes place in the distant future of humanity, where I would hope things would have progressed. Finally, in the second-to-last line of the book, Asimov inserts a rather sick dirty joke through the use of a sly double entendre (the key word is \\"mule\\").. Back in 1952 Asimov probably thought he was making a goofy in-joke to his learned friends that would not be caught by the general public. If that's the case, the joke in question seems extremely silly and predictable today, and brings the book to a close that is rather difficult to take seriously."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Normally I need lots of action and suspense to keep me interested in a book. This book had some level of suspense (not like Koontz's, The Watcher) but focused more on the growth of the main character. Very intriguing plot that had me wondering what was going to happen next. I liked it enough to read the next two books in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I had read Foundation when I was in High School and I decided to revisit the book later. Last summer I revisited the book and by the end of the summer I had read all of the books in the series. Asimov had combined 3 series into one leading to 15(?) books. I can't remember how many I read. I even checked out the Foundation books written by &quot;the Killer B's.&quot; Read this book. It is a pillar of Sci-fi as is his &quot;I, Robot.&quot; There is a reason that these books were in contention with Tolkien for the Sci-fi series of the century. Foundation is a wonderful starting point for an engaging series.If you decide to read the &quot;series.&quot; Understand that he took 3 different series, his robot series, foundation series, and the empire series and combined them to create a vision of future history. Few authors have tried to create a series in such a grand scale and Asimov is the master of grand scale. Only the empire series (which is currently out of print) feels outdated. Yet, all parts must be read to truly enjoy the second foundation trilogy.If you want to get your feet wet with Asimov, start here or with his &quot;I, Robot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future, humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base, Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone, genre fan or not, I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation series is Sci-Fi's grandest and most accessible epic. Asimov's writing style focuses on the story, not the jargon, so you never get bogged down. The hero is Hari Seldon, who is able to scientifically predict the future (don't ask how), and he knows that the vast Galactic Empire is soon headed for the dustbin of history...Hari, the prophet that he is, endeavors to shorten the time before another Galactic Empire can restore civilization to 1,000 years instead of 10,000 or 20,000...surely a worthy goal. This book will amaze you, will excite you and have you wanting more. It's fun and thoughtful at the same time...And, IMHO, these books get even better later on in the series.This book, which is later linked to the Robots series, may also be one of the most influential sci-fi books ever. (The galactic empire of Dune shares a lot of similarities)...Great stuff from the Grandmaster!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov captivates the reader in this book, the &quot;unofficial&quot; start to the Foundation series. The story revolves around 3 major characters, Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian and predictor of the Empire's demise, Salvor Hardin, mayor of Terminus, home planet of the foundation, and Hober Mallow, a Master Trader who rises through the ranks. I found the 3 separate yet interweaving storylines appealing, much like The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury but not nearly as divided. Each character has their own opinion in how to accomplish a goal and presents each in a logical and realistic way. The thing that's amazing about the Foundation is that it doesn't have to rely on epic battles, hyperdetailed sensory imagery, or ridiculously long monologues by static, stereotypical characters. The characters are real, they get afraid, they make mistakes, and they change throughout the story. The writting is paced just perfectly so that it doesn't tire you out yet it provides enough details about any given situation. Asimov is a literary genius and I can't recommend the whole Foundation series enough to anyone who just has a little free time on their hands.

Foundation is a very good series, but here's a few reasons why this book might not expand *your* world: 1) you were a statistics/religion/philosophy major in college (it may annoy); 2) you want a book for entertainment, not to ponder (it may bore); 3) you really think character development is important in a book (it spans generations, hence little/no development); 4) You're already a scifi buff (most of the books you've read have already assimilated the ideas of Foundation -- credit where due!).

Acclaimed Hugo Award winner, he really makes you feel a part of the future, as he proves to be a genius not only in a robot way of thinking, but also in politics, economy, religion, mass manipulation and, of course, in every way that makes a human, human. And I am pretty sure this characteristic of him is really connected to his also great robotics series.Imagine yourself in the future. Now imagine yourself in a further future where you are studying the chronology of the future. Remember your history classes in school? Yeah, that's where he's taking you. Analyzing the Galactic Empire from a distant and omnipotent way of view, he sets a pattern in the development of mankind that repeats itself various and various times, that's why this book could be written set in Middle Age. But it isn't and that's one of the most fascinating things about it.Everything starts when Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian - a new science developed by himself based in history, statistics and mathematics - predicts the fall of the Galactic Empire. To save mankind from thousands years of darkness and restart, he suggests setting a new colony at the fringe of the Galaxy - Terminus System - to develop the greatest literacy work of history and regroup all knowledge ever acquired: the Encyclopedia Galactica.Set as a scientific colony and lacking natural resources, the Foundation, as it is called, starts to suffer of politics and diplomatic issues and that's just where all the greatness starts coming. As it's well more developed in technology and science than the rest of Periphery - as they call the region of the galaxy containing the Terminus system - other colonies start trading natural resources, such as gold and iron, for scientific gadgets to control their masses.Based on science, there is created a new religion in which priests are, actually, researchers and technicians. It was Arthur C. Clarke who once said that high level technology is indistinguishable from magic, though it makes perfect sense for this novel, except we are not taking magic in consideration, but religion (although they are equal if you look from a different angle, but this is not to be discussed in this review). To control masses in the Four Kingdoms of Periphery, they sell science. And it works pretty well until there's a crisis, and another, and another. In each of them, those called Seldon Crisis and taken in consideration when the psychohistorian predicted the need of Foundation, he appears and hints a new period of development.But it is not only religion that control masses and it is not only faith that is needed in human race, but also trading, protection, food, gadgets, industry and, of course, a stable economy. Nuclear force moves everything in the future, that's how Asimov puts it and he puts it so well that he really makes us think if isn't it the power we should explore - consider this book was written in the beginning of nuclear power.The book is well-split in five sections: The Psychohistorians, The Encyclopedists, The Mayors, The Traders and The Merchant Princes. In each of those, Asimov explores a deep wound in human civilization, psychology and sociology, based on a few dominating aspects, and shows that it is even easier to overpower an entire society poking only its foundation.It is a masterpiece, well-thought from the beginning to the last word. That's all I have to say.95/100"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Clever twists, incredible imagination, and a fun, quick read.

I read this one in record time. A great read, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is a \\"trilogy\\" of thirteen books. This review will mainly talk about book one. The Foundation, a group of scientists and engineers writing a galactic encyclopedia, starts before book one takes place. The prologue is about an apparently irrelevant person. Nonetheless, I think it is important to read the beginning because it sets up the story. The main story takes place much later, when the actual Foundation is formed at the edge of the galaxy. This entire group of people are the main character, though at time other people take the spotlight.During the book, challenges arise to meet the Foundation, and at each challenge, the Foundation uses a different and unique method of dealing with the task at hand. As the book progresses, the Foundation gets more and more technology, while the empire at the center of the galaxy dies away. The Foundation was created to start a new empire after the old empire is destroyed. To make sure this would happen, Harry Seldon used psychohistory to predict the future and lock the foundation in a path that will reach its goal.I think that this book should only be absorbed by people in college or beyond because it has very advanced ideas."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation And Empire, by Isaac Asimov is the second book in the original Foundation trilogy, which won a Hugo Award in 1965 for Best All-Time Series. It follows much the same narrative structure as the first book, Foundation, save that the book has only two \`books', to the original's five, which allows for less epic scene setting, and much more character development. And don't let some of the books' critics fool you. The characterizations in these books are wonderful, deep, and complex. They simply are not done in the usual ways. They use a characterization style I term \`silhouetting', wherein characters are portrayed not so much by what they do as the important things they do not do, or that which is not described in \`on stage' actions. This book, though, is not merely a continuation of the first book, but an expansion of its themes, which includes some more detailed characterization.The first book set up the history of a senescent galactic Empire on the verge of tottering into oblivion and thirty thousand years of barbarism. A scientist named Hari Seldon attempts to shorten that Imperial interregnum by establishing two Foundations on either end of the galaxy, ostensibly to compile an Encyclopedia Galactica. In reality these two Foundations will be the cornerstones of the Second Empire, which Seldon's Psychohistory- a deterministic pseudoscience, predicts will cut the interregnum down to s ingle millennium. By the first book's end the first Foundation, on the planet Terminus, has survived several \`Seldon Crises' via his holographic intervention, which helps the Foundation outwit its enemies, and the work of legendary leaders- Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow, and a few centuries in to its existence seems poised to actually take on and destroy the ruined Empire.This is where Foundation And Empire starts....the book is relatively easy to get into- even if you've not read the first book. That's because Asimov's style of the pseudo historical work allows for quick recaps (in the old movie serial vein), and the fact that each chapter within each book has new characters and situations means that they can stand alone, even as they add to the overall tapestry. Asimov also makes a wise dramatic choice in The Mule section. By spending a book and a half showing Psychohistory's upside, and proving its internal \`validity', the second half of Foundation And Empire shows the downside of lulling oneself into a false sense of security, as well the consequences that coyuld await the Foundation if it falls the same way the Empire did. The funereal descriptions of Trantor contrast vividly with the awesome complexity that opens the first book of the trilogy. Then, the Empire seemed impervious. Yet, Asimov is so good a writer that he rarely lapses into caricature. Even The Mule is sympathetic, when we understand his drive to prove himself. Even more interesting is that he seems no worse than the old Emperors, nor even the dynastic heirs of the current Foundation. With his powers his Second Empire might even be better than the Seldonian one. Yet, lacking an heir- due to his sterility. and his own powers, it would seem likely that even greater chaos would befall the galaxy upon his death.This begs the question that seems to be central to the trilogy: \`What place does the individual have in the overall scheme of things?', or, more succinctly, \`Does an individual matter?' The Mule seems to be a resounding answer of YES! He also seemingly cuts to the dubious heart of Psychohistory, which is based upon the well known Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends. Because of these philosophical depths, wonderfully concise and spare writing which does not bore one silly with extraneous detail, but a lean, clean narrative line, excellent characterizations, and an ability to deliver a twist ending many mystery writers would envy, Foundation And Empire ranks as a truly great novel, even outside its genre. Only readers addicted to the modern need to reveal why everything is, in excruciating detail, and to have mere action, action, action on every page, will not recognize this as not only great sci fi, but great literature. Asimov, too, deserves the label as a great writer. As The Mule might say: On to Second Foundation!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted, masterfully imagined, and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are, in my opinion, among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"What else can one possibly say about one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written?? A terrific beginning to a beginning series. I can hardly wait to read the rest of them."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the first of the three novels in the original \\"Foundation Trilogy\\". The trilogy is similar to \\"I, Robot\\", in that the novels are created out of shorter fiction that was first published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940's. It was first published in novel form by Gnome Press in 1951. A trimmed down version was published under the title \\"The 1,000 Year Plan\\" by Ace books in the 1950s.While certainly a classic and important to setup the series, \\"Foundation\\" is easily the weakest of the three novels. Consisting of five parts, four of which are taken from the shorter fiction from years before, it covers a large period of time in a relatively short amount of space. In addition, the stories are fairly short, and it is rare for a character to appear in more than one. As a result, there is little in the way of character development in this book. The subsequent novels (\\"Foundation And Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\") are each comprised of just two works of shorter fiction, and thus do not suffer as much in this area.The sections of \\"Foundation\\" are:\\"The Psychohistorians\\" - This is the story of Gaal Dornick who has come to the capital of the Empire, Trantor to work with Hari Seldon. This story introduces the key concepts of the series; introducing the reader to Psychohistory, the Empire, and the purpose of the Foundation. It is unique among the sections of this book, in that it was written specifically for the novel and was not published previously.\\"The Encyclopedists\\" - In this story, the Foundation becomes separated from the Empire, and is threatened by its neighbors, the Anacreonians. It is in this story that the citizens of the Foundation find out their real purpose, having believed before that they were sent there to create a Galactic Encyclopedia to preserve man's knowledge. This was first published in part as the novelette \\"Foundation\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in May of 1942.\\"The Mayors\\" - This story is closely tied to \\"The Encyclopedists\\", and there are some of the same characters. Once again the Foundation is threatened by the Anacreonians; however, this time the Foundation uses its technological expertise to avert the crisis. This story also introduces the use of \`Priests' to spread the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"Bride and Saddle\\" in the June 1942 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".\\"The Traders\\" - This story is about the use of trade to expand the influence of the Foundation. More specifically, it is about an agent of the Foundation who has been imprisoned on Askone, a planet that prohibits the use of the Foundation's devices. This was first published in the October 1944 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" as the short story \\"The Wedge\\".\\"The Merchant Princes\\" - This is a more complicated and involved story than the others included in this book. A merchant trader, Hober Mallow, goes in search of several missing Foundation ships, discovering evidence of the old Empire. More important though, is the struggle for power within the Foundation which results in the abandonment of religion in favor of economics as the source of expanding the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"The Big And The Little\\" in the August 1944 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years. In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966. In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels. In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels. In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990. It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\", Smith's \\"Lensman\\", Heinlein's \\"Future History\\", and Burroughs' \\"Barsoom\\" series for the award."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I think asimov truly showed his ability in Foundation and Empire. Whether or not Foundation was better is debatable. But to create 2 knockout novels is pure gift. All the people who say it is bad are wrong. they say you should read a classic. It is a classic! A modern classic! the series deserves a place among Dune and other SF greats. The Mule was stroke of genius. The surprise ending was wonderful. whatever they charge you for this it is a deal."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I recently read Foundation, all I can say is Wow!. First let me say this is not STAR WARS and it isn't STAR TREK, This is what Science Fiction is all about. Truly epic in every sense of the word, Foundation offers us a window into a future so far away Earth is forgotten completly. And like any good epic, their is no main character, instead the story is a series of short stories. Each story features new characters and plots decades, sometimes centuries apart. The best part of this book is that its only part one! I can't recommend this book enough! If you consider yourself a serious Sci-Fi fan then get this book today."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation and Empire is the second of the original Foundation trilogy written in the 1950s. The first book is Foundation and the last is Second Foundation. I enjoyed Foundation but I liked F&E; quite a bit more! Foundation consists of five disconnected short stories, too short for adequate development of the settings or characters. F&E; is much more focused, containing only two stories, the second of which really impressed me.A quick refresher on the background: The psychohistorian Hari Seldon was able to mathematically foresee the future of human society in the Milky Way. It wasn't pretty. Socio-economic forces were to cause the total collapse of the Trantorian Empire and lead to 30,000 years of anarchy and barbarism before a new empire restored peace and order. However, Seldon saw an \\"alternate path\\" that could reduce the duration of the Dark Ages to a single millennium. He established two societies (called Foundations) to bring this change about.In Foundation, we learn how the fledgling First Foundation established itself after Seldon's death and how it grew powerful. In F&E;, Seldon is long dead and the First Foundation faces much more serious threats: a war with the dying but still powerful Trantorian Empire and a war with a mutant leader called The Mule who possesses incredible powers. The part about the war with the Empire is a straightforward narrative with a couple interesting twists. The second part about The Mule takes place a few decades later and is written in the style of a mystery, sort of like the first two Robot novels.Since The Mule is an individual of extraordinary power, Seldon's psychohistorical predictions for the First Foundation are in jeopardy because they deal only with masses of people and large scale socio-economic forces. Hence the second part is a more exciting read. :-) Also, until the end of the second part the Second Foundation is a mysterious society on the other side of the Galaxy about whom we know next to nothing. Although I guessed the nature of The Mule's powers, I did not guess his identity and it was a great surprise for me when it was revealed at the end. The events of the last two chapters are stunning and really make you want to rip into the third book. Yet F&E; doesn't end on a cliffhanger and is quite satisfying in and of itself. This unique blend is a testament to Asimov's genius as an author. Also, you'll learn why the mutant calls himself The Mule and it's quite enlightening!With novels written later, Asimov tied together three series into one huge one! I recommend reading the entire 14-book series in the following order: the four Robot novels, the three Empire novels, and the seven Foundation novels (the original trilogy plus two prequels and two sequels). So far I've yet to read the last three Foundation books (Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and Earth), but so far most have been excellent and all have been well above average."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As in Foundation, this is actually not a single story. Here are presented two separate episodes in the development of the Foundation toward the establishment of the Second Galactic Empire.The first details the encounter between the growing Foundation and the still-very-powerful Empire. At the forefront is an Imperial General of outstanding ability and charisma. Unfortunately, Hari Seldon, the architect of the Foundation, predicted all this with his psychohistorical calculations. While the general is very successful in his opposition to the Foundation, his very nature ensures his downfall.The second story is quite ingenious, in that the single large failing of Seldon's psychohistory is brought to light. An individual beyond the predictive nature of psychohistory has appeared and done the impossible. While there is a type of mystery presented, Asimov either wanted the reader to know the answer before the characters, or he didn't try very hard to obscure the nature of things. But this is a crucial moment in the Foundation's development, as they seem to be vulnerable after all. This story depends heavily on a plot element present in all the Robot-Empire- and now Foundation Series: psionic abilities. Clearly this was a favorite concept for Asimov, and he never seems to abuse it; that is, it never seems there for its own sake but always represents a fundamental encounter when it appears, and you can bet there are severe ramifications.While I have noted a few complaints about the second of these two stories, this book is still very well written, with action and suspense as good as any I've read. Asimov did such a wonderful job crafting this future history that I can only applaud having had the pleasure to read it. If you like S-F, you will love this whole series, chosen as the Best Series Ever Hugo winner. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When Isaac Asimov was writing at his best, he was the one of the best science fiction writers to ever heft a typewriter.He wrote the orginal short stories to make up the Foundation novels in the 1940's for John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. In large messure, he modelled the history in the stories after the fall of the Roman Empire.Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, Hober Mallow are names that stand in the history of Science Fiction like the names of real people in many ways. &quot;Violence is the last resort of the incompetent&quot; and &quot;Never let your morals get in the way of doing what is right&quot; are quotes that every reader of SF knows well.Only names like Jubel Harshaw and David Bowman (who came to life from the pens of Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke) rank with these characters created by Isaac Asimov. I'm not positive if this is the best SF/F novel ever written, but it definitely makes the top five list of best SF novels ever written.It is a great loss to the world that Asimov slipped off his mortal coil back in 1992. His writting is great. At least we still have his books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the \\"trilogy\\" are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book, Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General, and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat, we just read the characters talking about it. Also, the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story, called The Mule, is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However, it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately, he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book, I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy, while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950, when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book, but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The original Foundation series was released as a series of three books: Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation, in 1951, 1952, and 1953, respectively. Some datedness to this series is to be expected, but I've read SF stories written 40 years after these that felt more dated, and personally I think the concept, the sweeping distant future galactic empire Asimov writes, far outweighs any datedness one might expect. So much so, that for serious science fiction readers this series is almost essential reading. Not essential in that you *have to*, nothing kills interest faster than making it some classroom prerequisite to SF, but more in that it would be hard to consider that you wouldn't find some aspect of this series worthwhile at least and absolutely fascinating at best. Several reviewers had said that this trilogy is really a series of shorter novellas that were published earlier thus leading to some incohesiveness. Until a few days ago, I wasn't aware of that and when I read this series and discussed with friends afterwards that never came up. This is a sweeping series, where if an *only* 1000 year dark age is the *best* case scenario, you realize that a lot of time may have to be covered leading to chronological jumps.The idea of psychohistory is a fascinating concept and I haven't seen anyone else really copy it. With that said, it could also be considered a far fetched concept. To predict the history of a huge civilization statistically, albeit in large numbers to offset individuality, but still made up the most irrational entities in the known universe, human beings, is pushing credibility. But that's what also makes this a powerful concept as well. This idea has also been considered in the United States, for what else, economic theory. Statistically there had been too many variables, basically risk. Then in the 80's some economic theorists came upon the concept of eliminating the variable of risk, by forming a mutual fund of as many diverse economic sources as possible. The more the better (like Seldon's the larger the group of people the better) because any worldwide effect causing one economic segment to go down would be offset by some other economic segment that wouldn't. This concept was considered revolutionary and massive amounts of money were poured into this mutual fund from numerous financial institutions. And it worked and paid off well... for a while. But like the Mule of the book series, the theory couldn't account for a single element that would take a large segment of the economy with it. In this case, it was the financial meltdown of the Asian economy that was so sweeping, it took down so many markets that this mutual fund plummeted. So many institutions had poured money into the fund that the US government actually had to help bail it out, because it's collapse threatened the US economy and possibly the entire world economy. (PBS did a fascinating documentary on the events.) So the theory of psychohistory is difficult to consider viable, but is still a fascinating theory and the inventor of it in the series, Hari Seldon, is the Albert Einstein of the empire and is successful at it. Until, that is, a powerful individual comes along, The Mule, which the theory cannot account for and the Seldon Plan fails. The Seldon Plan is so visionary at first that every once in a while long after his death, a prerecorded holographic speech of Seldon would occur stating would should be occurring in the universe at that time and indeed it is occurring. The Foundation realizes they're in big trouble when, after the emergence of The Mule, Seldon returns in one of his recorded messages and the events of the time isn't what he predicted. Asimov writes this section brilliantly.Thus Seldon had secretly instituted a Second Foundation (which is essentially a Backup Plan). I cannot call myself an Asimov fan. I don't really care for his robot series in general and the endings of Asimov's novels tend to be anticlimactic. But with the Foundation series he turns this into an advantage. The final book of the series deals with the confrontation with the Second Foundation. By this time the reader is aware of the power of the Second Foundation and thus the confrontation doesn't need to be with laser pistol or light saber, and is over in minutes. What a brilliant conclusion.I've considered the original Foundation trilogy a stand-alone series. Asimov's Foundations Edge, written 30 years later, is different as to be expected. Since the Foundation series was sufficiently concluded (and stood for 30 years), Foundation's Edge has to add a new element and I've always mentally considered it the Third Foundation. The entire Foundation series is now a seven book series (septology?) and some might say that the post-trilogy novels have corrupted the original series. If you decide to read on, Foundation's Edge is a good book, and did win the 1983 Hugo Award, deservedly so, it helps to keep in mind the real-world chronological differences between the two."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Recently, I picked up a copy of the first book in Issac Asimov's Foundation series, for which this review is written. I will not spoil the book in this review as some others have done.The theme was quite interesting. Essentially, one man somewhat manipulates humanity into protecting its knowledge and creative abilities by setting them apart from the &quot;masses&quot;, so that they can weather the coming dark ages. The great joke of this book is that Asimov almost makes it seem as if history is pushed forward by the &quot;masses&quot; themselves but in reality, his apparent humanism and rationality comes through as he shows that it is always the &quot;individual&quot; who in the end can save or destroy humanity.If you are a man (or woman) who cares about how ideas move history, if you believe in the sanctity of the individual, if you love life, then this is a book for you.Asimov is a man of reason and he shows it well throughout this first, in what I hope to be an excellent sci-fi series. Often times, contemporary authors infuse their lack of values into their books and characters, making one wonder who one should be rooting for. Asimov paints a clear picture of the values within man that make him worthy of praise (or not) - reason, justice and a love of life.This book can proudly stand side by side with Ayn Rand's Anthem and Orwell's 1984 as a warning to society about the dangers of the &quot;irrational&quot; in all its glorious forms."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"One of the BEST science fiction books I've ever read, as written by one of the best science fiction authors to live, Foundation is a wonderful look into a completely different universe than our own.Foundation is based on a community of planets who have formed and Empire- A large collective society... One mathematician claims that it will collapse into the dark ages, and take 10,000 years to recover and rebuild... The foundation is formed in an attempt to reduce that time to 1,000 years by maintaining the knowledge of the present. While acting as a terrific science fiction setting and story, Foundation also serves as a very deep look into society as a whole, and how predictable a society is. The social implications of each major crisis as it occurs is aptly predicted and accounted for, which proves largely entertaining and intriguing...This is a must read for any science fiction fan, historian, or sociologist... It's well written and imaginative with engaging ideas and concepts true only to Asimov."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This novel, the first in a (50's) series of three, has not dated one bit since its first appearance. Like The Lord of the Rings, it should really be read in combination with its sequels, but the book contains its own strong moments, especially the first section on Trantor. I was amazed and moved by the cleverness of Asimov's plots, something he is of course well-known for. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you had bothered to read the entire series, you would know that one of the major heroes in the book is a young girl, Arkady. In fact, once the Foundation books tie in with the Robot series, you will find another woman hero, the &quot;mother of robotics&quot;, Dr. Susan Calvin. So your comment about the &quot;deplorable&quot; lack of women in the Foundation books is off the mark. And the characters are not poorly developed - what you learn about characters like the Mule is staggering - but you wouldn't know that because it is in the second book. I hope you don't do this with all literature - try getting the facts first, then give an honest opinion. You will be well respected for it, even if most people disagree with you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The first book in Asimov's Foundation Series is actually an anthology of stories tracing the formation of the Foundation to its growth into a competitor of the Galactic Empire. The premise is simple, its execution complex: the Galactic Empire has started to decay even though the Empire itself denies the truth. Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian whose mathematical theories of historical psychology have allowed him to determine when the Empire will crumble and the probabilities of the aftermath. To avoid a Dark Age, he sets up the Foundation at the outer edge of the galaxy to preserve the knowledge of humanity. The stories in Foundation deal with the formative years of the Foundation and its growth from an (outwardly) academic's and historian's interest into a power on (and behind) the galactic stage guiding humanity's redevelopment.Cleverly written and plotted with quick-moving events and the interesting theory that humanity's future for hundreds and thousands of years can be predicted based on probable outcomes. This is the foremost intellectual, yet generally accessible, science fiction series ever written. The lone drawback is that Asimov did not finish it before he died."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I am making my way through the original Foundation trilogy for the third time now, and I'm still gaining new appreciation for it. Fifty years after it first appeared, Asimov's Foundation series can still justifiably be called a classic. A clear influence on the Star Wars saga, and probably Star Trek as well, along with a large chunk of all science fiction that has come since. Sure there are a few things to quibble about with this series, and with this first book in particular. Asimov's vision of the distant future, with its nuclear reactors, microfilm communications, and picture phones, all seems ridiculously quaint today. As the story blasts through several decades, interchangeable characters come and go without making much of an impression, and this first book is so obviously part of a trilogy that it doesn't have a chance of standing on its own. But that's not the point, and by focusing on these quibbles you're missing the forest for the trees. Here Asimov has created a tremendous masterpiece of the imagination that is larger in scope than just about any other literary creation. The saga is built around the intriguing concept of psychohistory, in which the movements of huge masses of people can be accurately predicted over thousands of years (while it is still impossible to predict the actions of any one person). An ossifying empire, obviously based on the Roman Empire in its death throes, is on the verge of horrific collapse when the Foundation is created to subtly change the course of history behind the scenes, and gradually rises to prominence and tries to usher in a new golden age. The entire saga (not just this first book) takes place over a thousand years across a whole galaxy, while Asimov believably incorporates a full palate of psychology, politics, and sociology to lend the story credence. Still a masterpiece after all these years."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Disclaimer: I am judging this book as a standalone piece of work.Isaac Asimov's Foundation is the first of a series that would eventually be considered a cornerstone of the Sci-Fi genre. While it is certainly a solid piece of work, I don't quite understand how it is deserving of such praise. In my opinion, it suffers from an abundance of poor storytelling techniques, which reduce what is a great concept to a finished product that left me feeling empty. In fact, I struggled to finish the final pages, nearly racing through it solely for the sake of completion. I have rarely, rarely done this before. I'll start with the good aspects along with plot setup type-stuff first, and then finish with the overwhelmingly bad.The ideas and concepts behind Foundation are wonderful. The basis of the book is the work of Hari Seldon, the master practitioner of a discipline called psychohistory. If executed correctly, psychohistory has the ability to predict behavior of human beings thousands and thousands of years in advance through a combination of many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, and psychology. It is, in essence, what modern day economics aspires to be. Being an economics major who currently works in the field, I found this to be highly compelling. In fact, it was from a blog post suggestion by Paul Krugman that I picked the book up in the first place.A bit more of the plot: Hari Seldon, the well-known psychohistorian, seeks to avoid an extended Dark Age, a period of 30,000 years in which barbarism runs rampant and tons of information is lost. His work in psychohistory leads to the establishment of the Foundation, which send ripples through the universe and ultimately attempts to shape its fate for the better. Hari Seldon is the first of a string of highly intelligent characters you'll meet, and Foundation is saturated with clever and thought-provoking dialogue amongst these characters. This, unfortunately, is where the good stuff ends.To say that this book is saturated with dialogue is a vast understatement. This book is 95% dialogue and it is the vehicle through which the story is told. This, I found to be abysmal. Even with an omniscient narration technique at hand, rare are the thoughts of characters, their descriptions, or an inkling of the settings on which these dialogues are taking place. One of the largest structural weakness of this storytelling style is that Asimov must infuse important details into his conversations. The problem with this is that these are details that would never come up in normal conversation. Thus, they come off as very awkward and ultimately serve to cheapen the dialogue. Not being able to get into the minds of characters leaves too much unsaid, which is the part of the cause of every section having the same structure: Person A is the plotter, Person B is the questioner. Person A knows something that Person B doesn't, Person B continually questions Person A about his plans, which all finally ends with a \\"Don't you see?\\" moment by Person A in which he explains his elaborately constructed conspiracy to Person B. This is the essence of every single section. By the time you get to the end, nothing is unexpected.And worse still, every single character is similar (except for one, who speaks with an accent and makes for a very comical section of the book). They are all intelligent, but not wholly different. Their lack of physical descriptions and thoughts serve to make them feel like the same lifeless replica of one another. The nature of the story, which causes there to be major gaps in time, make this even more egregious because just as you are getting used to one character, his section ends and a new character has replaced him. I felt zero emotion for these characters. As for the setting, this universe is not a living, breathing world. It is merely the outline of one, a skeleton of what could have been something magnificent. This bothers me. I am confident when I say that this book would have been absolutely stunning if Asimov had included 100 pages more of thoughts, descriptions, and settings.Some other small gripes: Asimov is prone to overusing adverbs, usually considered a literary sin. Foundation also has not aged well in terms of technology, as Asimov really misses on a lot of advancements that it seems other Sci-Fi authors were able to catch. I do not take any points off off this review for that, however, because the predictions he did make were far better than any I could have ever fathom, and I commend him in that regard. All I'm saying is that these misses, relative to other authors, aren't helping."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation saga is one of the most widely-known sci-fi series ever published. Started in the 1940's with this book, Foundation, Asimov continued the series up through the 1980's, at which point he was being basically threatened by fans to continue writing to satiate their reading interest.Foundation's setting is in the far-future, when planets have not only been discovered and colonized, but millions of planets have been organized into a Galactic Empire that spans thousands os star systems. Hyper-industry and nuclear power form the core to this civilization, which seems to have an endless grasp on the future of civilization.That is, until Hari Seldon, a scientist, discovers the science of psychohistory, by which future events can be predicted based on calculations of human behavior. He foresess the collapse of the Empire based on inevitable social, political, and economic forces. He devises a plan to save humankind from an imminent dark age by instituting a scientific Foundation at the edge of the galaxy.This premise is what drew me to the read the book. What exciting prospects! The opportunity to plumb the mind of the genous Hari Seldon. To get a closer look at this Galactic Empire, whose proportions were mindboggling. To understand, at a more nuts and bolts level, this &quot;psychohistory.&quot; To see what Hari Seldon has up his sleeve.Unfortunately, though the book provides an historical fiction that encompasses 300 years of life after Hari Seldon, and introduces leaders of his Foundation that are memorable for their nerve and intellect, some of the imaginative possibilities, such as most of those mentioned above, are not fully realized. I am not sure if they are realized in other books of the series, but I guess that's for someone else to comment on.Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction, but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. Though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read, I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book, I felt it was good, but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking in addition to the brevity of focus on Hari, a good discussion of psychohistory, or much emphasis on the Galactic Empire.Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable, he views plot as the central element to his writing, at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First, there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people, but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes (there are 5 heroes that are portrayed in the generation following Hari), there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks, I like to view my characters as a little more than men-at-work. Everybody is always scheming, there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future, such far-off planets. The dialogue is great, though, and that's part of the reason the book is a quick read.Secondly, there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. There's not much refelction on the part of the narrator, or poignancy. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the interesting description of the false religion that a protagonist, Salvor Hardin, invents in order to undermine the economy of a neighboring state. Religion is also used to manipulate other planets. Hard to swallow, this helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The book is also full of cute phrases that portray the all-importance of technology in Asimov's future: characters say things like, &quot;What in the name of space?&quot; or &quot;Thank space!&quot; The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to &quot;understand&quot; how important it will be in our era, with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future, such as super-intellect, robotics, biotechnology, etc. Not only are technology and politics the deepest material this book touches, but even the technology the book introduces is not very interesting. With the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor, the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly, romance does not play a role in the book. There are no women in the book, which means there can be no romantic intrigue, or world events influenced by a woman. Also in the true spirit of what the word &quot;romance&quot; conveys, there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far-off worlds is sparesly and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms. Though, admittedly, Asimov's grasp of political personalities is astounding.On the other hand, if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history, you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic, political, and sociological macroforces that shape history, you will like this book. If you're more about the game and the moves than the players, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I know I'll take some major heat in saying this, but I wasn't that impressed with this beloved classic. Oh, the idea intrigues me, surely, that of humankind eons in the future existing across the galaxy on a multitude of worlds, so far removed from earth that eminent masters of science themselves debate whether earth was even the planet where human life began, but once the dust settled from an idea that lofty, what did Asimov really DO with it? He used it for unexciting little tales of science v. military might. I love the parallel between the fall of this vast space empire and the fall of Rome. The way bands of scientists struggled in a dark age to keep the light of knowledge alive was thought-provoking (which is high praise in my lexicon) but this was backdrop, and the plot Asimov employed in telling the story of all this was (sorry to say) dull, slow, simple, and unworthy of the imaginative concepts he thought up in his setting for this tale of knowledge overcoming strength of arms. I haven't read the later Foundation novels, so maybe they're the ones where the brilliance of the series exists, but I found this book from Sci-Fi's golden age so demanding on my patience that I didn't finish it the first time I tried to read it and barely made it to the end the second time. I wish I shared the glowing praise for this classic that millions of others claim they feel, but to be honest, I just don't."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is great science fiction for the scientific minded, no deus ex machina here. The only fault I find with this 1st book is that the 3 main characters are exactly the same person. Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are the exact same character. All calm, cool and collected. Perfectly confident and perfectly logical. No difference in dialogue and problem solving skills, you wouldn't be able to tell from Asimov's writing that these characters are from different time periods and are from different cultures. For that matter, every character in the book seems to be of the same culture and dialect. I realize Asimov uses a minimalist style of writing, like Hemmingway, there are good and bad sides to this. No fleshing out of characters has to be considered weakness in Asimov's writing. It may have made for a longer book, but his characters would have been better served if they all didn't behave as robots."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov is one of the few popular science fiction writers whose fame is derived mostly from his intriguing story line and character interactions as oppose to pure imaginative science. In fact, given that this series takes place 50,000 years into the future, one could easily argue that its incredibly short sighted given how little science has evolved; yet this detracts very little from just how entertaining this book and the series is. Asimov is a fantastic writer in terms of creating intrigue, wit, and believable dialog, and the result is he has developed a very enjoyable series.Foundation is the first book of the original three that Asimov wrote in the Foundations series, and although the series is now quite a collection of books with some even taking place before the period of this book, Foundation still represents a terrific point to enter the series. The premise is that a science exists that is able to predict the downfall of an empire that ruled the galaxy for 20,000 years, and as a result a foundation (two in fact) is set up to ultimately shorten the period of anarchy that will result in the empire's downfall. This of course leaves open plenty of intriguing possibilities and Asimov does not disappoint.Asimov is very straight forward in his writing and leaves little open to interpretation. He has often been criticized for this style, yet in place of open ended complexities the book contains a quality that fully immerses its readers and satisfies them with clear and definitive answers. Reading the foundation novels is somewhat akin reading a history book that that highlights specific elements of importance. This style may not appeal to everyone, but once you are engrossed in the story line you will find it hard to put this book down (as well as many others in the series).***For those new to the series, here are the specific seven books tied directly into the Foundation story line and their original date of publication. I read these in the order they were published and was very happy to have chosen that order. Asimov also tied in some of this other book series into this one (specifically his Robot series) thus making the entire story line a much larger volume of books.Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a classic of the Sci-Fi genre, and that is nearly everything you need to know.

The first, as is usually the case, was the best. A very fascination premise."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation, and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful. I remember when i read this book 8 years ago, and as you see i still love it. If you don't want to read all the books of the series, you don't have to do it, the saga of foundation it's only three books (foundation, foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation), but if you want to read a good, good, GOOD,GOOOOOOOOOOD series of books, read them all, you won't regret it. I really loved all this books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When I first read The Foundation book, I was pretty dissappointed and I didn't finish it. After about half a year, I've tried to read it again and I started to like it. Finally, I liked it very much and it's one of the best series I've ever read. Asimov is a fabulous writer, no doubt."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Yes, it's got some truly lovely ideas. But, no, I didn't especially enjoy reading it. Gripping storyline, anyone? Not here..."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"After reading Prelude (which I thoroughly enjoyed), I began FOUNDATION with much anticipation. Unfortunately, the book did not meet my expectations. First, it was really boring and predictable. Second, you never stay with a scenario long enough for any character development. As soon as the reader gets to know one of the characters, Asimov rushes ahead 50 years and a new cast of characters enters. My final complaint about FOUNDATION is that most of the characters are presented as simple minded. I might read the rest of the books in this series only because I have been told they get better. However, FOUNDATION is just an average read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I admit it, I am an Asimov-phile. This is yet another book by Asimov that is very hard to put down. I rate this, and all of Asimovs books with the highest regard. Quite simply buy it now, or you are a fool. ;-)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"A nod to the greatness of this book, on a recent episode of Deep Space Nine, a group of genetically altered humans got together and used mathematical formulas to predict the outcome of the Dominion War.

If only they would have given credit..."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I just finished it today, and must say I wasn't dissapointed. The movement in time for each section is very effective and interesting in moving the story. I found that at each part, the radical, the person immediately disliked, turns out to be the savior of the Foundation during that crisis. I've been exposed to a lot of Science Fiction and while reading this book, I saw pieces of almost all of them in here. The Galactic Empire of StarWars originated here, the personal shields and the control of the spice guilds from Dune, to name a few. I must say, in my humble opinion, Foundation deserves the high placing as one of Science Fiction's greatest works."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book, the first in a series, is all about the origination of the Foundation, an orginization based on the idea to shorten the period of decay of the galactic Empire. Everyone who likes Prelude to Foundation MUST read this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"(If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed &quot;Foundation&quot; and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated &quot;Foundation&quot; may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov takes the reader on a journey that is thought provoking and entertaining. It's probably his best work of all the foundation series.&quot; Foundation and Empire&quot; is one of those books that you simply can not put down."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have just read all the volumes in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series. Because the basic ideas of society and its control (&quot;psychohistory,&quot; &quot;Foundation, &quot;Gaia&quot;) are cleverly and skillfully constructed, I could grasp these highly abstract ideas much easyly. Forever Asimov's Galactic genious! Of course this series planned as an entertainment, it can be recommended to the academician, who has his/her major in social science or its related area."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book does not need action to be great. Mr. Asimov was a profound writer. I do NOT mean swears or grownup matters. His words go beyound the sci-fi plot. This is why I give it five stars. This book may be hard to follow. This is because Mr. Asimov wrote it in sections for a magizine. Just be patient an you will lovvvve it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Before &quot;Foundation&quot; i'd read somes short-storys from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. And what can i say now about this book? Really is a excelent piece of scifiction: Asimov united 4 independent stories in a book with lifely descriptions, a strong main-story and credibles characters in incredibles situations,...the result is just epic. So, with this book we become in eyewitness on the monumental development and fall of the human civilization... becoming it in a surrounding journey trought our future and past."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. Issac Asimov shows off his expertise in what is probably the best series ever. Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian and can predict the future. He sees the impending collapse of the Empire and establishes two Foundations to prevent that."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation details the fall of the Galatic Empire and rise of an island in the midst of desolation - the Foundation. Not full of starship battles, but I have never seen a more clever story in its use of thought. The three Seldon crisises and the solutions have an intellectual beauty to them in that 1) the crisises are believable and 2) the solutions are also believeable and in retrospect obvious. I have noticed this about other Asimov books, espically &quot;The Stars, like Dust,&quot; and it is my favorite part of his style. Very higly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is a highly cereberal study of history. I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical transmutation). This book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect Star Wars style entertaiment."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a good book, but is only a must read because the 2 books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are must-reads. It's a shame that few lists of his books include Foundation and Earth, but if you like science fiction, that is the best novel ever."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"this is the first book i read by asimov. of the 7 books in the &quot;trilogy&quot;, i found it the most gripping. (this is where i start to digress and spell words wrong) i am happy that i read it before the books that he wrote after but take place before the action in this one. i believe that the first two books ruin some of the suspense in later novels. ah, the book... my first venture into sci-fi, and i am so greatful that i took it. although it is in the future, i never got the impression that it was unrealistic. well, i hope i helped. live well and for yourself."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Unlike a lot of other sci-fi books, Asimov has the ability to include not only the sense of futuristic complications and inventions, he has the unrivaled ability to also include a dramatic and intense showing of personal interactions, which is what makes him such a master.Its more than an idea, Asimov makes it a story. Great book and possibly the best of the three foundation novels."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero, Hari Seldon, sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work, forces of humanity and all that, but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals. If you know this ahead of time, you will appreciate each story even more."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov, remember, wrote this initially as a series of short stories for a sci-fi magazine. Only later were the stories combined as a book. That is why of course no great character development occurs and the stories seem tidbits rather than grand scale work. Granted there is not much science in the book, but I have always felt that sci-fi is a form of fiction to allow the author to write freely on a subject and be able to mask what he is really talking about. Think about it, change the story to another world and have strange names for planets and suddenly nobody sees it as an attack against their country or their people. I have also felt science fiction to be more political than science (even though we call it science fiction). Politics are immense in Foundation and the style of having conversations to tell the story vs. having lots of action and space battles is fantastic. I read this first when I was 18 and did not appreciate what Asimov is trying to do. At 39, I get it. Asimov is looking at society in general and commenting that no society can be perfect and ideal and all wonderful and that dirty tricks and greed and compromise and working with others (including our enemies) is the only way a society can survive and the rest is simply propaganda. It's a direct attack against all societies that foster the idea that we're the best and the greatest and we stand for freedoms and love of country. Instead he states that what all societies become are survivors finding their strengths to counteract the enemies weaknesses. It's a great reality check which is why this should be required reading for all political science majors."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov participated in American science fiction's golden age, helping to convert pulp fantasy stories into realistic predictions of the future based on current science. It isremarkable that he wrote the Foundation while a young man, barely 20 I believe, a work with grand themes and the cornerstone of his massive and sprawling future history of mankind, which I believe went into more than 50 volumes. The basic plot is that a scientists created a new discipline, psycho-statistics I believe, that could predict the future behavior of huge masses of humans. He then attempts tomold - or at least influence - man's fate over the next 30,000 years. What is truly amazing is that Asimov succeeds in this and the two following volumes. In a way, he should have stopped here with the series. The ideas are crisp and not yoked into a determined framework, so are fresh with lively characters. Later novels in the series - the overwhelming majority - feel more stilted, bound by concepts more than by a plain old good story.A sci fi classic."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I liked Star Wars. But for those of us who knew and loved the Foundation trilogy as one of the greatest masterpieces in all of science fictiondom, it was galling to hear the misplaced accolades heaped on the movie lauding its originality.Asimov's seminal universe was created decades before Lucas's derivative one, and Lucas shamelessly lifted whole passages of ideas, themes and settings from Asimov. The idea of a galactic empire; the conflict between an established empire and a fledgling but vital upstart; a world-girdling city at the heart of galactic government; a noble elite with incredible mental powers; a mysterious antagonist possessing the same mental powers but directed towards dark conquest; even the robots are there (albeit from a different Asimov source).I mention these things not to disparage Star Wars but to elevate Asimov. Today, it is too easy to forget just how original and inspiring the Foundation trilogy was when it first appeared in print. In the intervening decades, lesser imitators have copied, twisted and diluted the original story so often that its brilliance has been buried under mountains of mediocre muck.This trilogy has so much going for it that it is hard to know where to begin. For one thing, it is tautly written. Asimov would tend towards bombast later in life, but not here. For another, it sustains bold visions and landscapes of truly cosmic proportions. It also strikes the right note in setting the lives of a group of protagonists against a backdrop of immense historical forces. In so doing, it attains the weight of epic.Mostly, it astounds us with the sheer power of its imagination. I have already alluded to its many firsts, but it is what Asimov does with these firsts - the subtle way he folds them into the very substance of his story - that distinguishes this work. Take the theme of psychohistory. Asimov coined this term for his premise that all of human behaviour is reducible to a complex set of mathematical equations. He translates this abstraction into a storyline that is so compelling that we never think to question the outlandishness of his premise.This is science fiction at its finest: the marriage of science with fiction, all done with such consummate skill - the one merging so seamlessly into the other - that we are never aware of where the one ends and the other begins. Do not pass up the opportunity to read this trilogy. In the science fiction universe, it is the work of a grand master at the height of his calling."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is a well written science fiction classic. While not a major action-adventure story like many science fiction novel really makes you think about the plot, the characters, and all of humanity.It is truly one of the best scienc fiction books I have ever read and encouraged me to read the whole, equally enthralling, series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the first book of Isaac Asimov's aptly named Foundation Trilogy. Foundation presents the premise that when examining large enough populations of people it becomes possible to predict their behavior stochastically (and sociologists become statisticians). The great psychologist of the day, Dr. Seldon, finds from his statistical data that there is going to be a great social collapse; and he creates two colonies (or foundations) that are designed to shorten the period of chaos the universe will experience before a renaissance occurs. Without giving too much away, this novel is the story of the early years of one Foundation and its' experiences with the universe around them. This book makes one wonder just how much people act of their own volition and exactly to what extent we are all the same. Is it possible to predict the behavior simply by examining a large group? Another interesting sub-theme with this book that I found extremely interesting is that eventually there won't be any original thoughts; the example given is of archeology; the archeologists of Seldon's age assumed that there was no point in examining ruins; they simply read books written by the archeologists of earlier generations; it was assumed that there was nothing else to find. As people explore, explain, create, and discover more and more of the universe, will there eventually come a time that there is nothing else to find?"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The books in Asimov's universe are by far the best scifi to date. I enjoyed the Foundation and Robot books so much I collected all 45 books that are set in the Foundation universe, written by Asimov and other authors. While not all authors live up to Asimov, their contribution allows his loyal fans a chance to slip back into the universe he created. If anyone is interested in Scifi books, the Foudnation series is a wonderful place to start."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Folks, till foundation happened to me, I had for some inexplicable reasons never got introduced to world of science fiction (SF).(unless you call hitchhikers guide to galaxy as one) Based on influence of the die hard coterie of Asimov's fans, I decided to start my journey with Foundation...........and I have really found it cool stuff............worth reading and excellent investment of time..........since it rejuvenates you with fascinating ideas and terrific narrative. Looking forward to picking up the next one."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I would recommend this series to anyone. Asimov is a great writer, who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall. For those of you who like hard sci-fi this is the series for you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"After somehow assiduously avoiding Asimov's seminal \\"masterpiece\\" for over 50 years since I began reading sci-fi, I decided to dip into this ponderous tome.Oh, forsooth, the ancient bard's Shakespearean language came alive once more, only this time, more than 12,000 years into the future.But, lo, some things have never changed: women are little more than pawns to the men who run the Galaxy -- still concerned with \\"housewife\\" duties.Distance is still measured in miles; microfiche and paper still reign supreme; the priesthood flourishes; folks still haven't learned that smoking kills.Not one to espouse elucidation, the new bard Asimov floods pages with convoluted dialog that fails to eschew obfuscation.The five barely connected stories that comprise this mess are loosely thrown together in homage to Hari Seldon, as we are seldom harried by logic.While I realize that it's easy to criticize the grand master of sci-fi after his passing, someone must raise the cry that the emperor was born with no clothes."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When I was in junior high school, Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was my favorite science fiction. Recently, I picked it back up, and have had to revise my opinion somewhat.First, in terms of character and plot development, Asimov certainly hadn't hit his stride when he wrote these books. The characters are cardboard cutouts--especially the female characters.More importantly, Asimov uses the basic idea behind the series...that Hari Seldon created his &quot;psychohistory plan&quot; and launched it, invisibly determining the future of his Foundations for centuries...as a kind of magic box from which he pulls plot developments. This drains the story of dramatic tension. One knows from the get-go that it'll all work out in the wash. (In the second half of &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; and &quot;Second Foundation&quot;, Asimov had found a way out of this problem, by introducing a wild card in the deck.)Finally, the book hasn't aged well. The technology forseen for his far-future galactic civilization seems positively &quot;retro&quot;. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem...Orwell's 1984 is still an effective piece of fiction, even though it's 2002, and the world is far different from the world Orwell envisioned...but the Foundation books' other flaws just seem to make this worse."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation novel is very dated, which I suppose is a function of the time it was written. Women are almost entirely absent except when they turn to putty over pretty pieces of jewelry. A gun is an \\"atomic blaster,\\" and other quaint 50s relics.The one dimensionality of the characters is problematic. I have to admit that although I don't read a lot of science fiction, I know priority is never put on characterization. However, since nearly all of the ideas of the book are no longer relevant, this shortcoming becomes glaring. The book is more of a time capsule than a living book.There is actually a single main character who re-occurs as 3 different personas (Seldon, Hardin, and Mallow). SeldonHardenMallow is calm, calculating, and always right. His opponents flail around until the denouement when SeldumHardenMallow has maneuvered them into exactly the right position and emerges victorious. It's so predictable that there isn't any dramatic tension.The biggest problem I had with the book is that the politics seem very nave. This novel was supposedly based on Gibbon's \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" but Foundation seems to have only to most primitive understanding of that work.I don't really understand the love generated toward this book. It seems particularly flat. A lot of people seem to enjoy it -- just not me, I guess."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment, as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull, and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally, this series feels very dated, in terms of language, attitudes, and even vision of the future. \\"Nuclear\\" is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s, but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character, and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a &quot;classic&quot;. I've seen the word &quot;classic&quot; thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I ordered this book 2 weeks ago and it just now came today. What's worse, it's in absolutely terrible shape.

It's a work of genius! There are two sections of the book. The first is a seemingly typical war story of the conflict between the Galactic Empire, led by a strong emporer and a firebrand general, and the dumb-luck, mediocre leadership of the Foundation. It illustrates how, under the Seldon plan, it is virtually impossible to defeat the Foundation. The second part is just phenomenal. Word spreads of a mighty mutant, the Mule, who is conquering the galaxy with unprecedented mental powers. The Foundation is astonished when they don't beat him;the Mule is the .001% that the Seldon plan left room for and dismissed. The Foundation falls, and only a small group of hopefulls dare to go to the library of Trantor to find the Second Foundation and defeat the Mule. This book has it all;plot twists, philosophy, and colorful, memorable characters. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Let's face it: Isaac Asimov was not a very good writer, especially this early in the game. We read 'Foundation' not because we are interested in reading some fantastic literature but because the ideas in this little book became the tropes that have thrived in science fiction even to this day. If you're interested in sci-fi, 'Foundation' is a must-read.The importance of 'Foundation' in the genre may force us to allow for the blandness of its prose; however, it does not excuse it. The characters are ciphers, the style is blunt and ugly, like a sledgehammer, and there are plenty of minor but annoying infelicities of grammar. It's a good thing the novel is pleasantly short; whatever Asimov's faults, long-windedness was not one of them."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This series sets the standard for excellence. This demonstrates a master of the craft of writing. Asimov was brilliant and when he turned that intellect to writing, he created amazing works, none better than this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"That's not saying much since I thought that \\"Foundation\\" was pretty poor.\\"Foundation and Empire\\" was pretty good, but still lacked in certainareas - mainly character development and also the first third of thebook had a very weak story line. The whole battle with the Empire bythe Foundation was very very weak, I cannot stress that enough. Maybe Iwas just hoping for an epic battle between the renegade Foundation andthe dying Empire. Nothing really happened to spur the victory of theFoundation, there wasn't even really a battle. But I guess that mightbe the point that Asimov was making since Seldon predicted the choicesand decisions of the Emperor about the passion that the characters hadfor the battle. It wasn't even a battle between the Empire, it was somemission designed and orchestrated by some general in the navy thatthought it would be a good idea to take over the Foundation.This book also lacked in strong characterizations, but not as much asthe first \\"Foundation\\" by a long shot. The last two thirds of the bookstick with the same characters the whole time. It also enters apowerful mutant, the Mule. I won't give much away about the Mule andhis plans because I don't want to spoil the book but it sets up for thesequel, \\"Second Foundation.\\" Once again the idea of the Mule is a goodidea but is somewhat poorly executed until the ened when everything isexplained about the effects the Mule has on the Foundation and thepeople in the main storyline.Get ready for \\"Second Foundation\\" because it will probably be the bestof the first trilogy. This book is worth reading and if \\"SecondFoundation\\" is better than this book then I will recommend the\\"Foundation Series\\" to anybody who can persist in their reading anddoesn't mind a long slow beginning."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation Trilogy, one of the touchstones of Science Fiction, began as a magazine serial in John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction in November 1949. Respective stories were gathered together into the three volumes: Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952) and Second Foundation (1953). Finally, the whole shebang was published as The Foundation Trilogy in 1961 and in 1966, won a Hugo Award as the best science fiction series of all time. I don't know that this last is still true, but it is certainly one of the seminal works in the history of Science Fiction and remains extraordinarily influential.Oliver Morton, in The New Yorker of May 17, 1999, had an excellent essay about the books wherein he pointed out that Asimov is really responsible for the concept, so prevalent in science fiction, of the Galactic Empire. He particularly demonstrates the debt that the Star Wars series owes to Asimov's vision, a vision which apparently in turn owes a debt to Edward Gibbon, whose Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire Asimov had read twice as a young man.He also draws one important distinction; where the main foundation of the Star Wars series is speed (iconified by the image of the accelerating starship), the Foundation series is built upon size. It is the epic scope, spanning thousands of years and worlds and incorporating billions of people, that really made Foundation so groundbreaking. It enabled Asimov to apply historical themes to a genre that, virtually by definition, lacked history.All of this is certainly true, but it strikes me that the epic scope as utilized by Asimov presents a political/philosophical problem. Asimov posited a future science of psychohistory, a discipline which would bring scientific cause and effect certainty to the field of human affairs. The Trilogy traces the fall and reemergence of a Galactic Empire with the entire process having been predicted by and, to some extent guided by, Hari Seldon, the Founder of Psychohistory. This premise manages to combine two of the worst ideas that human's have ever had--first, that history is deterministic and follows some kind of iron clad pattern; second, that there is any merit to psychology, particularly as a predictive tool when applied to large populations over a lengthy period of time.The whole thing is sort of creepy in so far as it dismisses free will and the impact of ideas and individuals on man's development. The quest for discernible patterns and laws in human existence is nothing new, most religions are predicated on the revelation of such hidden patterns. And it is natural for scientists to be attracted to the idea that there are certain universal laws that will eventually explain our behavior, everything from why we love or why we kill to why I just typed the letter r. But I for one, do not believe that our lives are predetermined. In fact, I find such an idea pretty bleak and antihuman.I still recommend the series, particularly in light of the influence it has had on the genre and for the massive scope of Asimov's vision, but, for me at least, the Freudian &amp; Hegelian overtones are a little bit off-putting.GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation was by far one of the best science fiction novels I have read. I especially loved his take on religion, and actually making a parody of it! Through the Foundation's organized religion, Asimov showed how science can possibly and really be equated with a new religion, or a set of superstitions and preternatural phenomenon. Asimov also showed how religion can sway the minds of the masses, as the subjucation of the Four Kingdoms illustrated. Asimov wrote his wonderful opus as a parallel of the Roman Empire, and the historical allusions show. However, there was something in the book that was surprisingly missing. There were no female characters! Except for the Commdora of Korell, most of the figures holding real political, social, or economic power in this society of the future, thousands of years ahead, were male. I find this hard to believe. I reasoned, though, that because Foundation was written by Asimov in the 50s, during the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of SF, female characters were a scarcity in most science fiction anyway. There were no female writers of SF either. Other than this glaring omission, Asimov has done a brilliant job with Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I can see why Issaac Asimov is consider the king of science fiction. To be honest this is the first book I read by him. When I read this book I was flabbergassed that this book was written back in the early fifties. He was so ahead of his time!!! I was amazed of how much this book was mostly all dialouge usually I would of been bored if the book was mostly dialouge but the theories in this book can they be all real one day!! The thought of psychohistory should be a considered science of future and politics. Most of the books I read that are consider science fiction I feel is mostly influence by this man. I know there are more to this series but after I read this book I felt I needed much time to absorb of what I just read because it was such a mind opening experience."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is seen as classic science fiction. Shockingly, Foundation is hardly a classic. Its theme of history repeating itself is drilled into the readers head. However, Foundation and Empire, the second book in the trilogy, continues with these themes with better fluency and character.\\"The General\\" continues with the stories of Foundation. General Bel Riose of the old empire tries to conquer the Foundation, and Asimov, once again, reassures that Hari Seldon's plan can never go wrong. With this setup of reassurance and the death of the first empire, Asimov raises the reader's hope that the Foundation will never fall.Immediately in \\"The Mule\\" Asimov rattles his audience with the fear that the Foundation, like the empire, will fall. The Mule, a mutant with psychic powers, was not seen by Seldon's Plan. The conquest of the Foundation is unstoppable. The second part of the novel allows readers to actually know the characters. They are not just people who act, but we can see their motifs. The end of the book is supposed to have many plot twist that shock the reader, but with foreshadowing, many revelations are undermined. Bayta, one of the main characters, has a deep dread every time something happens with the Mule. This gives away the identity of the Mule.Foundation and Empire is a great read through its despair and hopelessness. It left me on the edge of my seat scrambling for the next book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"How can this be considered a classic? It's fun, it's entertaining, but it lacks so much qualities all classics have!The Mule was a disappointment. I knew from the beggining who he was. I found myself skimming sections of this novel because I got bored with it. When I got to page 50 I was ready to give up on the novel and put it down, but I thought this book has to be good it's consider a classsic! So I decided to read the whole novel. A classic novel is suppose to convey a message to the reader about life, the words and writing style is suppose to be superior to the average writer, and the story should stand out as one of the more creative stories. This novels main lesson about mankind is not a unique one : The idea of history being preditced by math ,science, and psychology. People will never change, civilization will always end up destroying itself. Nothing is for certain even if science says so. I have heard this all before he did not invent this idea I want to hear somthing new and original. The great writers have superior writing skills. Askimov writing skills are just average. I expect to see in a classic novel a lot of symbolism, carefully crafted prose, well thought out sentences, better play on words, and better dialog! The dialog spoken by the characters is 3rd gradish and dull. Finally the author lacks the creativity the classic writers have. I expect to see a detailed lay out of how each creation works. I like an author who invents hi-tech gizmos and then educates the reader with all the scientific details of how it works. I like to learn a little physics when I read a science fiction book. --Main point: I liked the robotic novels better. Askimov went into details of how the robots worked. His robot books were good,not classics, but much better I thought."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"...The first book (excluding PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION) in a five-book series introduces the idea of pyschohistory. Pyschohistory is simply the mathematics and variables in predicting the general future since it cannot predict an individual's. Hari Seldon, pioneer of this revolutionary science has seen into the future where chaos will INEVITIABLY exist for thirty thousand years but with the triumph with each &quot;Seldon Crises&quot; they will be able to shorten the years by a millenium. Hari Seldon must rely on the future (Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow) to provide each step in shortening the amount of years. FOUNDATION covers the first 100 years of this chaotic period following the life of Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow, the key players in the book. Though somewhat lacking action and fast-pace suspense, it's a very good book nonetheless. Asimov is able to find clever ways to conquer each &quot;Seldon crises&quot; so ingeniously that it makes up for the lack of action. Infact, Asimov writes with a &quot;cause and effect&quot; basis. The book also ends in a way leaving the reader somewhat satisfied yet will want to read the rest of the series.I recommend this book to sci-fi fans or anyone looking for a great read, but the lack of action can bore some. And altogether the series is also great to read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this book as a teenager, and loved it. Read it again several years later, and could not understand what it was that I liked. Sure, Asimov writes with ease - and it is equally easy to read. But the characters are totally flat, the plot (?if any) is thoroughly predictable, and he also shows a terrible amount of prejudice against women, minority people and just about anything that does not fit the template of &quot;middle-age white american male&quot;. The book generally left a bad taste, as if you'd stuffed yourself on marshmallows - mostly air but enough sugar to make you feel sick."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you only read one sci-fi book this should be the one. Complex ideas delivered in a simple way, a great story written in an elegant style. I hunted down the hardback version because I know that this is one series I will want to re-read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"previous reviewers hit on the my main gripes. no character development or insights. predictable plot development. no women at all. i understand it was written as a series of shorts, but it is really just a political drama played out in space. it could just as easily been set on earth in any era. some interesting moments, but far from gripping.i much preferred early heinlein, clarke, and later ellison, pangborn, farmer, pohl, cordwainer smith, et al.dont think i'll bother with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I respect Asimov as a writer of science fiction. However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Three stars is a bit generous, but this certainly isn't a bad book. In fact, it is easy to read, always interesting, and often exciting. But that's all it is. It is not deep or meaingful. It is not profoud. It is not thought provoking. It isn't even particularly well written. But it's so easy to take and has enough good qualities that it can't be disliked.The plot center's around the creation of a Foundation, a place where mankind's accumulated knowledge can be protected from the approaching collapse of civilization. This is an interesting enough premise and very original in its day, but the blending of mathematics and psychology into a science that can accurately predict much of the future is hard to take seriously.If you come across a copy of this book, read it. It won't take long and you'll probably enjoy much of it even if your not a SF fan, but I don't recommend anyone by this book. There is to much out there that is much much better."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The book, Foundation, by Isaac Asimov, has promise but leaves the reader without satisfaction upon completion. Though having what initially appears to be a gripping plot, the grip loosens throughout the book. While philosophers may enjoy the lack of action and adventure, other readers who crave that amazingly described action sequence, will find that this is not the book to get. Taking place beyond the year 12,000 A.D, the Galactic Empire, spanning galaxies, is predicted by the revered physcohistorian, Hari Seldon, to crumble. On a mission to shorten a period of 30,000 years of barbarism after the fall of the Galactic Empire, to a mere millennium, he establishes an association, the Foundation, to preserve the Universe's knowledge in a giant Encyclopedia. Foundation takes place on many different planets in many galaxies across the universe. This book spans many generations and involves many characters, as the book covers in different plot lines that converge at the end.Foundation is a book that focuses on political issues, thus making the book void of action and adventure. This can make the book extremely boring and aggravating to some readers. The story focuses on conflicts among activist parties and groups conspiring against the political leaders of the Foundation's home world, Terminus, as well as diplomatic and religious conflicts between the Foundation's home planet, Terminus, and neighboring kingdoms such as Anacreon and Smyrno, along with greedy kingdoms bent on conquest of their neighbors. But out of the 285 pages of the book, there is only one significant action sequence, which is between the kingdom of Anacreon and the Foundation. The sequence involves a mass riot and uprising of priests on Anacreon's home world, along with the total emancipation of the Anacreonian naval fleet by a priest who threatens to curse the fleet. When characters, like the mayor of Terminus and his advisors, discuss war or the inevitability of a war, there never is an explanation of what occurs during the fighting, just a summary of the war, and who is the victor. An example is at the end of the book, when there is a war between the Foundation and the world of Korell, because of disagreements over religious beliefs and the tolerance of missionaries. The war is only summed up in an excerpt from the &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot;. Another noticeable point about Foundation is how confusing it is in many aspects. The book is broken up into &quot;Parts&quot; that separate time, setting, and characters. A part entitled &quot;The Mayors,&quot; which takes place mainly on Terminus and involves the mayor, Salvor Hardin, and the relations between his world and the kingdom of Anacreon, is then followed by one entitled &quot;The Traders,&quot; which takes place many decades later and involves totally different characters in a different part of the galaxy. When and where each part takes place is not answered until later into the chapters of the part. Also confusing is the fact that new characters are introduced quickly in every part, thus making it harder for the reader to grasp. If the reader gets attached to a character or really likes where the plot and characters are going in a certain part, he or she will be unpleasantly surprised when those characters are never talked about again in the novel, after that part.One good thing about Foundation is that it expresses new and intriguing ideas about predicting the future through the science of psychohistory and what the human race and universe will be like in ten more millennia. This includes the idea of having a Galactic Empire that controls millions of planets. Along with ideas of nuclear power still being the most advanced power system, man-sized force fields able to block any nuclear handgun's blast and giant space ships with the capability to destroy planets are discussed. Also the ideas of monarchy being the prime governmental system is included in the novel. These may seem like interesting ideas that would make Foundation a great book, but the reader may find that these ideas also make the story harder to understand because they are either seemingly too primitive for the time period, or too far-fetched to be logical. This book could be someone's favorite book, if they happen to like philosophical books without action. It could also be the bore of a lifetime for some people."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"&quot;Foundation&quot; is just one of the many sci-fi/high-tech books and sci-fi in general books that Asimov has written, along with &quot;Empire&quot;, that takes us into the far-flung future like no one else can.

Things were going smoothly until the periodic prediction (when Seldon appears holographically) was obviously wrong.The cause is the Mule, a mutant of incredible mental powers who no one has ever seen. The introduction of this character was one of the best plot devices used in a long time and it gave the fledging story a much-needed boost. Who is this mutant and why does he do the things he does? What caused his mental powers? Can he be defeated? But most important, what is to happen now that Seldon's plans cannot be followed with accuracy?Stay tuned for book III."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation by Isaac Asimov is an excellent read for any fan of literature, not just readers of science fiction. It is the first novel in what is known by many as the greatest science fiction trilogy of all time. The story envelops the reader from cover to cover and never stops. The characters are real, with great development from the author.The story itself is about the trials gone through by a small group started by the great scientist Hari Seldon. The goal of the group is to rebuild the Empire after its inevitable fall. The characters are actiive, and the plot is always moving, never letting the reader go for a second. Asimov also uses his great knowledge of science to his advantage in the novel.

A new character arrives to totally disrupt everything he has planed out for the future, The Mule.Humans are so unpredictable."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed &quot;psychohistory&quot;. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Unlike the first Foundation book, which was a series of related but not inter-connected stories, Foundation and Empire has two longer stories. This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more, adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story, The Big and The Little, is not one of the series' strongest. However, the second story, The Mule, is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant, The Mule, who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists, and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book, which is great also. The whole series comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"...P>The story was very unique.The world he creates and the society therein is fantasic and dangerous.The protagonist is a mathmatician running around just doing his thing not realizing that destiny awaits him.I really, really recommend this book and the next. By the middle of the third book I did begin to loose interest as my male testosterome began to scream for more violence and suspense.Characters are likeable and the story resolution is very satisfying. This book was great and enjoyable in and of itself even if you don't continue on with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Let's get started with one of the most celebrated science fiction sagas of all time: Foundation. originally Asimov wrote it in form of a trilogy: Foundation, foundation and empire and the second foundation, to be read in that order. Then Asimov expanded his \\"foundation universe\\" to tie it with his \\"robot universe\\" by adding 2 more novels to the series: Foundation's edge and foundation and earth. All these 5 books are a must read if you consider yourself a sci-fi fan. Besides there are 2 more books: prelude to foundation and forward to the foundation, which must be read before actual 5 novels. It's quite a complex maze. It will also help if you are familier with Asimov's robot series. But you can nevertheless read only the 5 foundation books as a standalone and still enjoy them greatly.So what is foundation (as in neo asks in matrix)? Well foundation is the fictional name of a futuristic society, which is founded by a great scientist called hari seldon. In Asimov's foundation, humanity has expanded over the galaxy, hyperspace travels have advanced and an \\"empire\\" rules over millions of planets in the galaxy. The \\"empire' has seen its best days and is living in the relic of its past glory, a.k.a. it is crumbling. However all phegmatic rulers, the rulers of the empire refuse to accept their weakness. However Hari seldon, through his scientific and mathematical eyes, predicts that empire will soon crumble and humanity will be reduced to abject barbarism for a long time.On the preset of this plot, hari seldon establishes \\"foundation\\" to save the humanity.Ok, let us not delve too much into the plot as I am not playing spoiler. Why should you read Asimov? Apart from foundation being one of the greatest sci-fi saga, you can find several refreshing ideas, which have been adopted ubiqutously by most sci-fi series later. Take star trek, star wars, dune, even the most recent matrix, everyone borrows heavily from Asimov. Asimov not only introduced scientific concepts of hyperspace travel, he also introduced the concept of \\"control\\", which is used heavily especially in matrix. throughout his foundation saga, one is left wondering \\"who is the ultimate master?\\" the answers come as you keep reading through the novel.Asimov also explains a futuristic society in its sociology, politics, power struggle and human nature. No other sci-fi writer has cared too much to explore how a society will behave in future. Asimov stands unique in that respect.I would highly recommend all 5 foundation books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This was probably my fourth reading of the book and what can I say? I highly recommend it.My brief review is this. The book is a lot of fun to read, has some excellent characters, and a very intriguing plot. For a little more detail continue reading.I'll start with three specific observations.FIRSTGeorge Lucas was impregnated by the Foundation prior to the birth of Star Wars.Let's check off some parallels. Decadent empire in decline? Check. Deep space religion? Check. Traders/smugglers with a wild-west attitude? Check. Central planet is entirely one city? Check.If you are a Star Wars fan and have NOT read this book these little hints alone should be reason for you to check it out.I'm not discrediting GL for his development of Star Wars, simply identifying a primary source of his inspiration.SECONDThese short stories which became this novel were originally written in the 40's. Given that the stories are written before the computer age it's really easy to forgive what technologies he didn't anticipate and appreciate the development of his futuristic world and its own technology.However, it is interesting to note that the technological innovations of the Foundation anticipate to some degree the technological phenomenon we see everywhere in that devices get smaller and smaller but more and more powerful. The main difference is that the Foundation's limited resource was metal while our real world limitations are more related to energy.THIRDThe scary point? That even in decline certain civilizations can produce their most advanced achievements. These achievements are however quickly lost as the downward impetus of that civilization is too great to escape its destiny with implosion.Yikes!I think I'll end with that. Have a nice day!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I love classic sci-fi, in all it's wondrous unbelievability. I like stories where humans go to venus and find rainforests and go to mars and establish colonies and can breathe for no reason at all. It's way off science fact. but it's awesome. There's a nostalgic feeling to it that makes me feel comfortable and happy.I've never read anything by Asimov before, so i thought i'd start with his multi-part epic classic. The Foundation series takes place in the far, far distant future when humanity has spread itself across the entire galaxy. They live in a political empire, quadrillions of people on billions of planets unified for millenia under one system, advanced, strong and stable. Enter Hari Seldon, a psychohistorian (aka a mathematician who can use advanced formulas and sociology to predict the future with absolute certainty). Seldon predicts the demise of the Empire and a period of chaos, a new dark age, that will last for 30,000 years, unless he takes direct action to preserve all of human knowledge and make subtle changes to reduce those 30,000 years of disunity to a mere 1,000. I know. A 1,000 year long story. Epic. Seldon is tried for treason and disruption of the peace of the empire, but convinces the leadership of his theories and sets up the Foundation, responsible for the construction of an encyclopedia galactica to preserve all human knowledge on the rim of the galaxy, away from the turmoil about to unfold.From this introduction, Asimov proceeds to tell his story in almost like an anthology format. We see major figures and major events from each generation and how the members of the Foundation deal with crises that lead them to the forging of a new empire, conquering the darkness, chaos and barbarism that spreads across the galaxy in the wake of the fall of the first empire. There are wonderful themes explored from fate, predestination, individuality, change, and religion. This last is probably the most powerful for me. In the wake of the collapse of civilized society and it's technological wonders, the Foundation finds itself the only group of humans with advanced technology (mainly nuclear power). The other bands of humans whose tech has fallen into disrepair looks upon this advanced technology and science as magic, and the Foundation is quick to seize upon this and make a new religion out of the science, teaching \\"priests\\" how to repair and use the technology to further their own power and domination in the galaxy. An interesting concept.Asimov is a brilliant sociologist and finds interesting ways to resolve immense political and economic crises. The series is well thought out and brilliantly executed. So why four stars? Well, the scope of the story is so large that there are innumerable characters to keep track of and develop. Asimov does a fantastic job at that, but I never really identify with anyone, and just when I start liking someone, they die and we move on to the next generation. This is more of a personal quibble than anything serious. Asimov forsees a great many modern technologies from the early 50s including video conferencing, the internet, and miniaturization of a lot of the gadgets available in the 50s, a trend we see continuing today. Looking forward to the second book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov was one of the founding fathers of Sci-fi and to him we owe a debt of gratitude for making the genre worthy of the literary title.

Both parts of the book, especially the second, create some incredibly strong and memorable characters that will immerse you so completely in the universe you'll not want it to end. Asimov created a master piece with the Foundation series and this second book is the staple that holds it together."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov's Foundation series portrays a tremendous sweep of future history. Published in 1951, Foundation is the first book of this series (however, Asimov would later write prequels to Foundation). Set many thousands of years into the future, this book opens with a description of psychohistory and its founder Hari Seldon. Psychohistory is a branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli. Mathematician Hari Seldon predicts a series of crises which will impact the Galactic Empire. Wanting to preserve knowledge Seldon sets up a foundation staffed with scholars and scientists.As Asimov wrote Foundation he was influenced by Edward Gibbon's multi-volume work History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In fact, Asimov read Gibbon's book not once, but twice! It may be inferred that the emergence of Christianity during Roman times and the emergence of a new religion in Foundation are parallel events. What struck me about this book is that it is primarily composed of dialogue. I also found it interesting that Asimov has newspapers and tobacco still in existence so far into the future. I did like this book and I look forward to reading additional volumes in this epic science fiction series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Notetably one of the finest chapters in the Foundation series...the \\"original triology\\" is still the best."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"These are just a phenomenal set of books.

But what would really make my millenium (can't forget to interject a Y2K joke...) would be to see at least the first Foundation book made into a feature length movie or at least a direct-to-video production.

Once I picked up Asimov's &quot;Foundation&quot;, I could not put it down. To write a book of such imagination and complexity, and yet to capture the mind of the reader as it did mine, is and extraordinary feat. Asimov is a brilliant writer. I have now begun reding the fourth installement of the series, titled &quot;Foundation's Edge&quot;. He has been able to keep the same level of intensity throughout the entire series, and is still able to keep the reader guessing. Asomov is truly a mastermind.

Asimov has this clever idea that extensive control of the population requires religion, technology and the guise of freedom.In reading the introduction by Asimov he reveals the Foundation story was created after completing Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.The story is full of political intrigue and religious power-plays.Some of my highlights from the book:\\"...religion-controlled commercial empire\\"\\"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.\\"\\"...so that we could incubate art, science, and technology, and form the nucleus of the Second Empire.\\"\\"Now any dogma primarily based on faith and emotionalism, is a dangerous weapon to use on others, since it is almost impossible to guarantee that the weapon will never be turned on the user.\\"I'm looking forward to the second and third books in the trilogy, Second Foundation and Foundation and Empire."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I had never read any of the foundation novels and yet, considered myself a science fiction fan.

Even the smart ones do dumb things, they just do them for smart reasons."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Really an enjoyable book to read. Asimov had such a hard task in this book, introducing his readers to a large span of history. Most of the book maintained immersion, but the smoking of the characters threw me off a bit (I wish someone would go through and pull the smoking out, as well as the newspapers, and change them to something else). Many people complain about character development being non existent in this book, but character wasn't the point of this work. I have never seen another author try in under 300 pages to cover the span of time covered in Foundation. For the constriction he put himself under, the characters are developed as far as they need to be with broad strokes.For people who are critical of this work, read contemporaries of Asimov, and you will find that only he, Bradbury, Herbert, and a few others even bother to develop characters. Most Scifi doesn't even bother to develop the science enough to stand on it's own. In this case, Asimov simply developed what he knew on the time through scaling the size, and using hyperspace to solve distance problems, so it was easy to accept every premise he laid down (well except for the smoking...)The whole point of the premise is that the main characters all have an inkling that there CAN BE NO HERO for Seldon's plan to work. If at any point, someone had acted with rash heroics, his mathmatics would be rendered null, and the decay of the galaxy would last for ten millennia instead of one."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is simply way out of this scarry scarred annoying world we are forced to live in called earth, with all its stomach aches and dripping joints and footsores and boredom. But old Asimov gives you a chance to go way out of this into just plain gigantic empires and it's all so way past any human imagination it keeps you satisfied, your poor little soft skin human body satisfied, so long as you keep reading it. Asimmov knows really how to keep you out of it all as long as your nose in his pages. But what is too much a puzzle I just don't get is how so many people want to take a good fanstasy like his and say he is actually realistic, this is the world we are going to make ourselves in a few hundred years or even sooner. But these people are totally missing the point, I don't care even if Asimov himself wanted to make all this Foundation real oine day or hoped people would, beause then if we are actually living in this sort of Foundation Empire then, if you think about it, we'll all actually just be back in boring old scratchy reality again that always feels sort of uncomfortable like velcro. They just don't get how the whole genre is called \\"science fiction and FANTASY.\\" The two halfs go together like the inside and outside of your face. Keep reality out. Hooray for unreality and yummy unreality like this one."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Breathes there a teenager of the md-20th century with a love of science fiction who was not weaned on the Foundation series? All that sweeping drama, testosterone-laden but basically non-violent (all the violence is simply swept into summarizing references to ships destroyed and cities ransacked) marching through decades without concentrating on anything really boring, like character development, emotional entanglements or the trappings of society. Not a single reference to such trash as classical music, or stage shows, or pop music, or romance, just sweeping views of a distant future (or could it have been the distant past?) with the means of traveling between stars in the galaxy in the flash of a gnat's eyelash.And yet . . . revisiting the beloved Foundation, reading through the filter of a lifetime of experience, cracks appear in the plaster, and beneath them one finds that the lath is too widely spaced, the bricks behind that lath are often without mortar, and one can see the trees where bricks are missing. We live already in an age where technology has bypassed this particular Universe. Computers have become infinitely more pervasive than Asimov might have dreamed in his wildest fantasy, for at the time of the writing they were mere collators of stacks of punched cards, the transistor had yet to be introduced or shrunk to the size of a grain of sand, much less a sub-microscopic speck imprinted by the millions on a tiny wafer of silicon.Asimov had enormous faith in the future of Humanity, but he had no idea of how rapidly that future would approach - or how slowly humans would react and adapt to the challenges posed. No Empire can be established when information is instantaneously available to three-quarters of the population. Will an army composed of humans indefinitely repress an entire population composed of their friends, family, relatives? We see the answer in Libya, in Egypt, in Syria, in Africa - where the mobile phone has allowed guerrilla tactics to be employed by any group, whether terrorist or freedom-fighter or mall-invasion gangs or \\"mothers against the death camps of dog pounds.\\"Human society has been transformed by 24/7 information availability - but the universe of the Foundation proposes a populace of ciphers acting in ignorance of facts that would already be generally available in the 21st century. \\"Just Google it\\" or \\"look it up in Wikipedia\\" is nowhere to be found. There is a project of the First Foundation to write a \\"Galactic Encyclopedia\\" - yet it already exists in 2012.And yet that universe is immensely attractive, reduced to comic book simplicity, perfect for any adolescent (whether 14 or 74) to immerse himself - or very infrequently herself, as this universe is truly misogynist: the strongest female is just a papier mach&eacute; accoutrement.The psychobabble of \\"psychohistory\\" which is the very premise of the Foundations is wholly implausible, of course. The introduction by Asimov of \\"The Mule\\" is his admission of the absurdity of such a concept, which he probably didn't consider when the first book was written. Man has mutated more rapidly in the past 10,000 years than Asimov's populace has in 50,000 - a highly unlikely probability in the event that man actually progresses to interstellar colonization.All that said - I downloaded the trilogy on Kindle whilst in America, read it through lovingly, and was again transported to that clean, technologically impossible universe, forgetting all the travails of real life at present, putting the horrors of terrorism, the Hunger Games, the beheadings of \\"infidels\\" and the lies of politicians to one side for too brief a span. It isn't great literature, not even great Science Fiction - yet it is riveting to any adolescent male who enjoys reading as opposed to or in parallel with the escapism of cinematic action films like the \\"Matix\\" or \\"Terminator\\" trilogies.For some reason, Europeans aren't allowed to download the books. No doubt the vagaries of copyright laws, tax authorities and those %^&* politicians - as well as the accursed lawyers (who are blissfully absent from the trilogy, undoubtedly bred out of existence due to their total lack of humanity).Asimov was the supreme techie of his time - and it shows in his use of language - sparse, precise, technically impeccable, but occasionally impenetrable without a modicum of concentration.I heartily recommend it to you !"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov is incredibly easy to read. His sentences are perfectly formed, neither too long, nor too decorated, nor too sparse. He strikes the perfect balance for his type of story, driving things forward consistently through description or dialogue whenever each is appropriate.This story takes place over a rather large time period and could really be considered a collection of closely related short fiction instead of a novel. It works well that way. We're only given information on the most exciting periods of time in the Foundation's history, and we're left to fill in most of the blanks on our own.On the downside, there wasn't much time to get to know any of the characters. I, Robot follows the same two characters through several situations and you get to know something about them by the end (even if they are almost cardboard cutouts, it works). In Foundation, nobody lasts long enough to really care about.Despite that flaw, it did what any good book should do- it made me interested in continuing the story. Luckily, this is a long series. I'll have plenty of time to finish it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"WHY CAN'T I BUY THIS FOR MY KINDLE?????

We start out with the psychohistorians with their leader Hari Seldon who has predicted a 10,000 year Empire is about to crash to its knees and herald in a new Dark Ages. Hari can't stop the Dark Ages but he can shorten it.Interestingly he creates a priest class that runs the \\"nucleonics\\" of the Foundation, its erstwhile goal of creating an Encyclopedia Galactica set aside by stemming the tide of losing technology.You see, the Empire is losing its grip on the other sectors of the galaxy. More and more are dividing and becoming their own little kingdoms. The book centers around several characters who, through inside and cleverness, make things happen to keep the Foundation and create an insidious society that keeps it going.Asimov as an author, I have always been impressed with. His ability to create and predict (micro-miniaturization), parodies and criticism of religion and science, trade and technology, is throughout the book.Near the end, we find that The Foundation is set to expand. Each chapter stands on its own and can be difficult for some to follow. But each chapter expands decades, some more, and as such can be hard to keep up.Highly recommended.

A welcome change."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The book doesn't really need yet another enthusiastic review, so I'll keep this to the point.The stories in this book are really enjoyable. You get to learn about characters in the beginning and then spend the rest of the time reading about the legacy they created and the later events that they had a hand in shaping. I find this satisfying in a way similar to the Dune series but I didn't have to read 6 books.As with every Asimov book I've read, the plots in this book are forged and hewn into complicated machines that are disassembled before your eyes at just the right climactic moment. It makes for a hard book to put down."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation is a series of books about two Foundations at the end of the Galaxy, at the rotting fringes of the Galactic Empire. Psychohistorian Hari Seldon has predicted the fall of the Galactic Empire, and 30,000 years of barbarism that will follow. The Foundations are established at two opposite edges of the Galaxy, little settlements that contain all human knowledge. The problem is that there are certain crises that the Foundations must overcome, with as little guidence from Seldon as possible.This was the first Asimov book I've ever read, so I didn't know really what to expect. I found I loved it! It was full of interesting characters, and each novelette showed a different point of time in the Foundation, so instead of slowly going through each year in the 1000 years of barbarism, you actually get somewhere. The characters had pros and cons to them, and seemed well rounded. It also showed a change in character through time, such as characters that were once sharp become dull and characters that used to rebel fall in line. Instead of telling you all about the character on the first page, it gave a general idea and then let the story tell the characters. One part I really liked was that it had plot twists that I didn't see coming, and the plot wasn't completely transparent.In the end, this book was a very interesting sci-fi novel that kept me going, and held my interest until the end."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I realize that it is a fairly arrogant thing to think that I have something new to say about this classic work that the 335 people who reviewed it before me haven't said already, so if you are reading this, you must REALLY be interested in this series.The only reason I'm bothering is because I tend to write personal reviews with personal musings, a habit which has cost me more than a few \\"helpful\\" votes here and there.My purpose here (really) is to be a sort of compass for people, especially newer SF fans who are just learning about the genre.If you are a member of this group then you need to ask yourself a question. That question is: Are you interested in rich, well drawn characters that develop over time and make you love them? If the answer is yes, for God sake, go read something else. This is no insult to these books, they are great, but if you want character development, you really need to look elsewhere. SF in this time period in general tended to be rather, um.. what's the word... DULL, THAT'S THE WORD. Notice I didn't say bad, I said DULL. SF books of this period read more like philosophy tracts then what we would think of as novels.NOW!! With all that being said, when I first read this book in the 8th grade I thought it was the best thing since Dune (I didn't have a real sense of copyright dates so Dune came first.The reason I liked this book so much had something very much to do with my love of history and the underlying idea that you could use math (another interest of mine) to predict it. For me that was great, my fellow 8th graders thought I was In-SANE. They didn't get it, as they didn't get most things I was interested in and so I sluffed them off like the useless intellectual baggage they were.Now, at 34, I reread these books, and now I think they may have had a point. This book (and the ones after it) are just people having long political discussions as time goes by in a series of increments. Because the book is comprised of short stories that are set decades apart, you get all the grandeur and scope of a great epic with almost none of the action.To make this clear and simple, this book is about politics. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a book about politics, but if you read the description and you think this is a grand epic full of action and war and complex politics then you are going to get one out of three. If you want ALL three, I suggest that you read the original Dune series instead.It should be noted that when I was reading Foundation, the normal children were reading The Pigman and their idea of SF was William Sleator's Interstellar Pig and Jane Yolen's Dragon's Blood. These are all good books, but it just so happened that I wasn't normal and so I was reading Dune and Foundation.My point is this: your average run-of-the-mill younger reader will probably find this incredibly boring, but if you are one of the odd ones, the geeky ones, the ones who watch TV Sci-Fi and think \\"There has to be more than this,\\" you know, the kind who actually don't think that a movie being old doesn't automatically equate to a movie being BAD and/or isn't afraid of a book because it has more than 24 pages, this one just might be for you.If on the other hand, you think Star Trek or even Star Wars are the peak of SF (I did at one point) you may not be ready until you have a couple of years on you. Lucky for us the people immigrating to print SF are growing up with much more mature SF then I had on TV. Babylon 5, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, the first season of Heroes and the British New Wave shows like Doctor Who and Torchwood, completely and especially Torchwood are ensuring that the people who change over to print SF are much more well balanced then I was at that age. I had Robotech as my big Sci-fi epic and that was IT, and anyone who is a fan of THAT show knows that blueballs is no myth, we've been waiting for the end of that story for 25 years and.. but that's a different review.These books are a cornerstone of SF because they deserve to be. That doesn't mean you'll like them, but I hope I've given you a clue as to whether you want to pick them up. I hope so, but make sure it's the right time.Good Reading.P.S. If you still aren't sure, try to get your hands on the very cool BBC adaptation of the Foundation Trilogy. It's rather spacey and is more like Doctor Who meets Foundation, but if you can deal with that, you're probably a fan :)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"You would be hardpressed to point to another of Asimov's work and name it better the Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Over a decade ago I checked this book out of the library, only to return it later having read only a couple of pages. I bought a copy the other day and was pleasantly surprised.Asimov started writing the Foundation series when he was 21 and this novel was first published in 1951. In some ways the time period in which it was written can be seen. Nuclear power is envisioned as the be-all, end-all of energy. People smoke (although the cure for cancer was apparently found, so any carcinogenic effects would be annulled) and there's talk of \\"microfilm records.\\"That said, the story was well-written and the reader can clearly imagine the events depicted as plausible. There is an overarching narrative focusing more on the grand sweep of history, but it is told in vignettes from the lives of key characters at important moments in time.\\"Foundation\\" is a clever book with a storyline that ages well."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book, along with Frank Herbert's Dune are the two cornerstones of science fiction. Many subsequent writers owe a debt to Foundation, which is best read within the original trilogy (Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation. It is extremely exciting for anyone with a sense of the 'epic' questions of the fate of mankind, or for that matter, any large society or culture. A staggering achievement.It is hard to get to the end of this work and not want to pick up Foundation and Empire.Now I might add that I did not personally enjoy very much the subsequent \\"interference\\" with the books created by the subsequent novels - Foundations Edge, Foundation and Earth, and Prelude to Foundation. I think Asimov's idea for the story changed as he got older (certainly the \\"robot\\" angle is increasingly emphasised, which I think is to the general detriment of the series) and while I have not read much literary criticism on this topic, I would suggest the original idea was better."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read these books when I was in high school and althoughI almost never read fiction, and don't particularly like sciencefiction (even though I studied geophysics in university andwork as an engineer), these books made an immense impressionon me. As I began to study Judaism, I finally discovered thatAsimov, a non-observant, yet knowledgable Jew, was using theformat of science fiction to describe the Jewish concept of theredemption of mankind. A careful reading of the BiblicalProphets shows that the ideal world that history is leadingmankind towards has universal peace between nations and ade-emphasis of technology in favor of the development of man'sinner, morespiritual side. However, this development of man's spiritualqualities and move towards universal harmony is accompaniedby upheavels and wars. Jewish tradition also says that theworld is sustained by 36 \\"hidden\\" righteous people whosegood deeds and spritual superiority are vital from preventingthe destructive forces in the world, both natural andman-made from overcoming everything and leading the worldto chaos.Asimov used the two Foundations as his vehicle for describingthis cosmic process, and an important part of the story isthe necessity of the Second Foundation to remain \\"hidden\\" toallow the process to work itself out.As far as the story itself is concerned, it is true that it isdated...for example, Asimov places the capital of the GalacticEmpire on the planet Trantor which \\"is at the center of theGalaxy\\". Today, it is believed that the center of the galaxyis full of black holes and lethal amounts of radiation, so itis unlikely there would be life as we know it there. Also,Asimov posits atomic energy as being the ultimate form of powerbut physics has advanced beyond that point to fusion and otherexotic forms of power.On the other hand, Asimov wrote these stories in the wake ofthe Second World War and so he is quite aware of how so manyinstitutions created by men...including governments and religiousestablishments, even starting with the bestof intentions, seems to run into crises. Thus the GalacticEmpire, which brought centuries of peace and prosperity tomankind, is brought inevitably to a point of degeneration, andhow the (First) Foundation itself, founded by idealistic,intelligent people who are at least partly aware of theirimportant role in shaping a better future for mankind, rapidlydegenerates into a repressive dictatorship.As others have pointed out, these stories have almost no \\"action\\",which is fine with me (my favorite movies and TV shows alsohave no action, e.g. Twelve Angry Men) and in spite of thefact that these stories are 60 years old, I recommend themto anyone who wants a deeper look at mankind's natureand its destiny."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I do not know much about science fiction. For this reason, I read &lt;Foundation> just as I read a fiction. Although so far I read only the first one of the trilogy, I liked it.What is interesting and strange at the same time in this book is that, in every chapter, a new main character appears. It takes time for a reader to develop familiarity with a character and to get interested and affected by the character's thoughts and actions. By the time one forms such a tie with the character, however, the chapter somewhat abruptly ends and the character is finished! The chapters of this book, therefore, could be seen as self-contained short stories loosely connected by the theme of the development of the Foundation over one thousand years.One thing about this kind of way in which each chapter unfolds is that it may well have been inevitable for the author because he had to cover so long a time period. The other thing is that somehow it leaves a lot of room for a reader to think back more about what a character did in each crisis and how history set the stage for the crisis, whether this effect was intended or not by the author.This book was a good read both entertaining and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I always enjoy reading Isaac Asimov's writing, and foundation was no exception. The plot is imaginative and original, like much of Asimov's writing. Foundation is set in the future, a time when our galaxy is ruled by a failing empire. Hari seldon, a psychologist, must prevent the galaxy from falling into anarchy and barbarism by creating a foundation of scientists. Foundation is fun to read, and provides ample entertainment. I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the first book in the famous Foundation trilogy. The story is simple. It's over 50,000 years in the future and humans have spread throughout the whole galaxy, with millionsof worlds and quintillions of people united by an Empire. However, the empire is crumbling.Enter Hari Seldon, the pioneer of psycho-history - a kind of complete, mathematical social science that uses statistical averages and modelling to predict social trends in large populations for thousands of years to come. Hari's studies show that the collapse of the empire is invevitable. However, if he takes action now, the period of suffering before the next empire might be decreased from 30,000 years to 1000. So, he establishes two foundations on opposite sides of the galaxy to follow his master plan. This book is the story of the first foundation.As a work of literature, expect no marvels of prose or metaphor. Most of the chapters are dialogue between people. There is also little characterisation and a blatant disregard for the &quot;show, don't tell&quot; rule of writing. All of these things are there because the trilogy covers hundreds of years. As such, this novel is divided into 5 books with a gap of decades or centuries between each. The whole text is very episodic as we watch an entire civilisation emerge from a modest group of scientists to a powerful force in the outskirts of the galaxy.So, the concepts of the book were what I found interesting. Of course, the whole premise that human history can be mathematically be mapped out as a kind of law of averages seems ridiculous to me. I don't think that Asimov believed that either - he just saw it as an interesting idea for a story. The great Hari Seldon maps out the future history of the Foundation, ensuring that it basically has one cosmic path to follow - one which will end in laying the seeds for the new Galactic Empire.The first book details with around the first 200 years of the foundation, as several crises are encountered by individuals as forces of history. With few military resources, the leaders are forced to rely on their wit. I'm onto the second book now so should find out if that wit was enough.A great read in that you'll find in interesting even if you aren't a great science fiction fan - it has very unique perspectives social &quot;science&quot; and what makes a civilization."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov was one of the incredible path-breakers for science fiction, and the Foundation books are thought by many to make up one of the best and most far-reaching series of the entire genre. While Asimov was a biochemist by trade, he certainly understood the circular pattern of human history, regardless of the amount of technology available to mankind.Foundation is about the fall of the Galactic Empire that has ruled for times immemorial (so long, in fact, that the memory of the legendary \\"Earth\\" is but a myth). The Empire's fall will obviously result in much chaos as the wheels of law struggle to beat back the inevitable barbarians who rise to loot and pillage (rather than rebuild) the riches of the old Empire. All of this seems a rather bleak future for humanity, yet Asimov is a hopeless optimist (at least in my eyes) in that he sees the resilience of people as ever reaching. The Foundation series is therefore a group of novels about the ways in which humanity restores itself even after all seems lost.&quot;Foundation&quot;, the first novel in the series, focuses on a colony formed by one who foresees the destruction of the Empire, a man named Hari Seldon. Seldon therefore attempts to minimize the effects of the collapse by building a community made up of intellectuals called the \\"Foundation\\". The book is divided into three separate stories at completely different times in the history of Seldon's paradise, one at the formation of the Foundation, another at its troublesome infancy, and the last at the time that the Foundation becomes economically independent (it becomes internally capitalistic and externally somewhat imperialistic). Each story rather stands alone and, while the last is somewhat disappointing, each is worthy in its own right.Highly recommended; if you don't read this book, you can't understand science fiction as a genre."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Hari seldom, the man who predicted the fall of the empire in the first book, established foundations on each end of the galaxy to prevent the rise of a dark age. The fallen empire from the first part of the book has incresed it's strength and with that strength, it plans to seize control of the foundation. With an ambitious and skilled general, and dozens of battle fleets, the foundation faces it's greatest enemy.Personally, I liked the second part with the mule better then the war with the empire, because the main characters have nothing to do with the foundations victory, which makes the plot not a major factor for the story, but this also leads the reader into more surprises for the end of the section.\\"I am the mule\\". As the reader discovers the identity of the speaker, all loose ends are tied up while creating a great twist for the end. Even though Seldon's predictions guide the foundation to overcome the first four crises, this is the book where his predictions turn the foundation into a disaster. A mutant is born, having the power to fight against any great power of the galaxy, a man that is able to defeat dozens of battle fleets, with the intelligence greater then any scientist of the foundation. .The second part of the book is full of surprises, so please finish the book if you have started it or you might miss one of the best plots in science ficiton. While reading the story of the two couple's adventures, the reader needs to think deeply in their every move. Isaac lets the reader feel the negative consequences in prediction. The more hope the foundation has on Hari Seldon's prediction, the greater fall they will need to suffer. Although the plot of the couple's is resolved, the foundations destiny is discovered in the third book, the second foundation. I believe any reader that has read this book will definitely also need to read, the second foundation, so I recommend buying both books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed &quot;psychohistory&quot;. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This was the first book I have read by Isaac asimov and I can say it was worth the wait. While this book is very old it is still an excellent read. Asimov presents a very convincing future for humanity. The book is broken into several sections that were originally short stories in a sci-fi magazine. They gel togethor perfectly and the overall story is wonderful. This book details Hari Seldon and his prediction of the fall the galactic empire and the rise of barbarism for 30000 years. He however thinks he can avert the disaster and only have 3000 years of barbarism in the galaxy. Based on this he sets up two seperate foundations that are supposed so achieve this goal. This book is focused on the first foundation and it's trials as the fall of the galactic empire begins.THe characters in this book are good. While each section is short you really empathize with the characters and their lives. The plot is excellent some of the suprises he throws at you are quite extrodinary. My only complaint is some the terminology in this book is quite old and often times is quite funny to read. However the ideas, characters, and plot make up for the archaic wording in the book.I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The story of Foundation continues in F&E;, with the stories in this book taking us through the final fall of the old Galactic Empire and the power vacuum left in its wake. The most known aspect of the second book however, is the idea that psychohistory is limited in that it is not able to predict aspects caused by wild chance-- and in this second Foundation book, wild chance threatens Foundation in the person of a powerful mutant called the Mule.Well-written, as Asimov always is."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The trilogy is essential, but since Asimov also capitalized on his own genius by writing what seems to be hundreds of lesser Foundation stories, it can all get very confusing and a bit draining. This is the second book in the original trilogy, so it is from a science fiction point of view essential reading. The trilogy itself comes up with two highly memorable characters, Hari Seldon, the psycho-historian, who uses Mathematics to predict the future and establish a \\"Foundation\\" that will limit the dark ages after the fall of the \\"Empire\\" to a single millenium (as opposed to ten.) He reappears as a hologram at certain points in the story with more or less accurate takes on what is happening in \\"History\\" at that point.The other very memorable character is the Mule. He represents the variable that makes predicting \\"History\\" mathematically a tricky business at least, not to mention impossible. He is a nasty totalitarian character who strangely in Asimov's hands manages to elicit some sympathy. Asimov is playing with the idea of predicting human behavior scientifically (or controlling it scientifically,) but this character is also a humanistic meditation on how masses of people get overwhelmed by evil social forces like fascism and soviet communism. You can see that Asimov lived through the era of Hitler, Mussolini, Franco and Stalin and that these cult of personality tyrants and the submission of masses of people to their destructive and sadistic wills profoundly affected his view of human nature. Foundation and Empire seems to be an attempt to come to terms with that experience, and so has something to say about the specifics of twentieth century history, as well as about historical philosophy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation trilogy (three first books) and the Foundation series (all seven) are often regarded as the greatest set of Science Fiction literature ever produced. The Foundation series won the one-time Hugo Award for \\"Best All-Time Series\\" in 1966. Isaac Asimov was among the world's best authors, an accomplished scientist, and he was also a genius with an IQ above 170, and it shows in the intelligently concocted but complex plots and narrative. There are already 331 reviews for this Science Fiction novel, however, I still believe I have something unqiue to contribute which is stated in my last paragraph.This book and the rest in the series take place far in the future (allegedly 50,000 years) at a time when people live throughout the Galaxy. A mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new branch of mathematics known as psychohistory. Using the law of mass action, it can roughly predict the future on a large scale. Hari Seldon predicts the demise of the Galactic Empire and creates a plan to save the knowledge of the human race in a huge encyclopedia and also to shorten the barbaric period expected to follow the demise from 30,000 years to 1,000 years. A select people are chosen to write the Encyclopedia and to unknowingly carry out the plan to re-create the Galactic Empire. What unfolds in this book and in the books that follow is the future history of the demise and re-emergence of a Galactic Empire, written as a series of adventures, in a similar fashion to the Star Wars series.Even though this is arguably the greatest set of Science Fiction novels ever written, I do not recommend it to those who are only mildly interested in Science Fiction. Character development is not the focus of these novels and the large amount of technical/scientific details, schemes and plots can become both confusing and heavy for the unitiated Science Fiction reader. If you read this one you will feel the need to read the others which may take a long time. If you are new to Science Fiction start with something lighter and when you are hooked you can continue with this series. Also, in my opinion the second and third books were better than the first."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"[The quotation is from Salvor Hardin, Mayor of Terminus.]Let's say it's around 1940 or so; you're studying chemistry in grad school but your true love is history; you've read Edward Gibbon's _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, but writing a historical novel set in the _past_ would require just too much research; you get the bright idea of writing a historical tale set in the _future_, about the decline and fall of a _Galactic_ Empire, and you suggest as much to John W. Campbell, Jr.Campbell's response: he gets excited and suggests that you introduce some pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo about \\"psychohistory\\". Do you:(a) drop the idea and write something else?(b) write the story just as Campbell describes it?(c) use a little imagination, make Campbell's idea a bit more intellectually presentable, and crank out, not just a single story, but a Hugo-award-winning series?If you picked (c), congratulations; you're Isaac Asimov.The Hugo didn't come until 1965, when the Foundation series won for best all-time series (defeating even Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_ books). By then Asimov had long ago tired of the series; you can tell by the first part of the third book. (But the _second_ part of the third book is probably the best part of the original three volumes.)And heck, even in order to keep it going _that_ long, he had to introduce a radical departure from the Seldon Plan, in which the Mule initiates not just another Seldon Crisis but a new element altogether, one that wasn't accounted for in the Plan. (And in even later installments, it becomes pretty clear that Asimov isn't exactly thrilled by either the Plan or the Empire it's supposed to bring about.)But in the first volume, all of it is still fresh. Here we meet Hari Seldon for the first time, get slightly acquainted with his mathematical science of psychohistory, and learn what he's done to keep the decline of the Galactic Empire from leading humanity into 30,000 years of barbarism. He can't avert the decline, but he's got a way to reduce the period of barbarism to a mere millennium.He's set up two Foundations at opposite ends of the galaxy. And he's carefully set the ball rolling so that every so often there will be some sort of sociopolitical crisis, to which there's only one possible resolution. All the Foundation has to do is wait until the crisis narrows everything down to just one option, and then figure out what the heck that option _is_ . . .Well, I think you can see that the pattern leaves some room for the exercise of intelligence, but not a lot for individual initiative. No wonder Asimov let the Plan start going awry; the story might have lasted a thousand years, but the dramatic possibilities wouldn't.Anyway, it's a great, great series. This is where it begins in realtime, although the later novel _Prelude to Foundation_ is \\"first\\" according to the chronology of the Foundation universe. (And the Empire novels -- _Pebble in the Sky_, _The Stars, Like Dust_, and _The Currents of Space_ -- take place even earlier. So do most of the robot stories.)If you haven't read it yet and you think you might be an SF fan, you'll want to get around to it pretty soon. Start here, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is my favorite sci-fi book series, and also my favorite work by asimov. The first book in the series, Foundation, is concerned primarily with two concepts. The first is the concept that history repeats itself over and over again, and that just as great empires fell in the past, the same problems will in the future aflict empires once they become too big. And naturally after the fall of a great empire, chaos ensues. The other concept this book describes is the theory that science and mathematics are capable of predicting the trends in complex systems such as large groups of people.I am going to be honest. This book was revolutionary for its time, and a great many famous sci-fi writers were inspired after reading this book. I know that I personally could never look at world governments the same way after reading this book. It truly opens your eyes to tendancy of people to make the same mistakes over and over again, repeating the same patterns on a large scale. And not only is this book easy to read and greatly thought-provoking, it is also great fun. It uses Asimov's trademark style. Little violence, even less sex, but a great plot and lots of cool technology. If you take science fiction at all seriously, you owe it to your self to give this book a read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation (1951) is the first SF novel in the Foundation series. Although originally a series of novelettes published separately in Astounding, it was later combined into this novel.\\"The Psychohistorians\\" (1950) was created as an introduction to the series with the publication of the Gnome press novel. It describes the political maneuvering by Hari Seldon to establish the Foundation on Terminus.\\"The Encyclopedists\\" (1942) relates the first of the \\"Seldon Crises\\" when the Foundation is caught between the retreating empire and the growing Anacreon kingdom.\\"The Mayors\\" (1942) tells of the second crisis when Wienis, the Prince Regent of Anacreon, decides to take over the Foundation.\\"The Traders\\" (1944) depicts the third crisis after Askone arrests a Foundation agent trying to spread the Scientism religion.\\"The Merchant Princes\\" (1944) recounts the fourth crisis when a Foundation trader discovers a market for his advanced technology devices.Although the empire portrayed within this novel was actually based on the Roman empire, technology itself became a major force in the story. Thus, slavery was not a problem in this empire until it began to decline and lose its technology. This decline also allowed the Foundation to spread its influence through advanced technology.When these stories were written, computers were only laboratory toys. Thus, the original Foundation series didn't incorporate computers as such. These stories seem strangely old-fashioned without household, business and embedded computers. Nonetheless, the author did foretell the use of electronic hand calculators.The author did include computers in the robot stories written during this timeframe, but they were massive devices used in the factories to design and manufacture robots. The emphasis was upon positronic brains -- something like neural nets -- rather than true computers. Maybe our industry just hasn't yet caught up to his technological projections.This novel is one of the most famous works of science fiction. While it describes future sciences far beyond current capabilities, it still inculcated a sense of the methodology underlying real science and technology. While the author went on to become a major writer of science fiction, he also became one of the best elucidators of popular science in the world.Still, this tale contains all the flaws of Campbellian science fiction. The major characters are always male. The dialogue is somewhat stilted and old-fashioned. In addition, the story contains more ideas than action. Of course, this tale is also outdated because of all the imitations and stimulations resulting from it.Highly recommended for Asimov fans and for anyone else who wants to read classic works of science fiction.-Arthur W.

I am totally incapable of writing an unbiased, objective review of this book, just as I am unable to say unbiased, objective things about my first girl friend. This was the first SF novel that I read (actually, I bought it for a friend and then read it before I gave it to him -- the beginning of a life-long nasty habit) when I was 14.The scope of the story is breathtaking, the pace is good -- especially for Asimov who tended to be pretty wordy -- and the details engaging. Asimov wrote this as a series of connected stories for &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine, and this shows in the oddly repeated facts that allowed the 'zine readers to follow the plot even when they missed earlier stories. It also adds a certain pulpy flavor to the text, which I think works well. SF about grand civilizations that are galactic in scope doesn't need to -- and probably shouldn't -- sound like Great Fiction. I think the gritty, quick style of Asimov's pulp writing works well.One of my favorite things about the whole &quot;Foundation&quot; series (you need to real all three of the originals, by the way, the newer ones are optional) is the way they presaged certain now-routine SF conventions. The most notable, of course, is the globe-encovering city/planet of Trantor, most recently replicated by George Lucas in &quot;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.&quot; (The less said about SW:TPM the better...)You can also see in my signature above that Asimov has had other influences on me. Salvor Hardin was a character in this novel: a trader and an agent of the First Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov had an active and brilliant imagination - truly, a scientist writing fiction. This series is science fiction on a grand scale. When you keep in mind that this story originated in 1951, it is easy to see how much Star Trek, Star Wars and yes even Heinlein's & Clarke's later works borrowed from these ideas.Anyway, Asimov at his best was a creator; he had amazing ideas of the universe, how it worked, and how to structure stories that manipulated the readers expectations.The Foundation series is like a spider web that continues to become more intricate and complex with each chapter. The intricacy of the plotting is amazing, although honestly it's not self-evident in the first few stories of the first novel, given that they were published independantly, as serialized short stories told one at a time.Only with the second book did this change.The basic premise: The rise and fall of the roman empire, told on a galactic scale from a historian living in the 2nd empire a thousand years later.The setup: One man creates a science, called Psychohistory, a fictional precursor to Chaos Math (a real statistical science today). This psychohistorian, Hari Seldon, predicted that the vast Galactic Empire is about to crumble, dropping humanity back into the dark ages. This dark ages was due to last 30,000 years (I believe), and while it is too late to prevent this horrible breakdown of society, Seldon believes he can use this new math to shorten the time period between empires.To do so, he establishes two \\"Foundations\\" made up of scientists, one at the outer edge of the galaxy, and the other at \\"Star's End\\". In advance, Seldon plots out the future (using the math of psychohistory), and sets in motion a series of \\"domino\\" events. The Foundation faces crises and problems, forcing change in both strategy and focus for the next several hundred years. But Asmimov continues to modulate the story throughout each of the books, and building upon the previously-understood structure.In fact, once you think you've read enough permutations on the same idea, Asimov starts tearing the structure down, introducing variables into the story that further complicate matters.A caveat about the most often-touted complaint about Asimov: His writing style (or lack thereof):In 1951, when these stories were first published, Asimov was not a great writer - as in, a writer of literature. His descriptions, characterizations and storytelling technique all left a lot to be desired. His technique got better with the passing years, such that any of his fiction written after 1970 or so reads easily.But that is not the point, here. Asimov didn't create great characters (save for his robot stories) - he came up with mind-bending ideas and subsequent permutations.The litmus test of whether or not Asimov is for you: Read 'The Last Question'. It's a 12-page short story. Not brilliantly written, but a fantastic story with amazing ideas contained inside. When you get to the last sentence of it, you will probably be blown away. If you are, Foundation is for you.Read them - and commit to all of them, because they get better as they go, generally speaking. The first three were written in 1950 - 53. But the fans demanded that he someday continue the story, so he continued with a fourth book in 1983, and the last in 1986. Some complain that the last book is overlong - and I agree - but the last sentence of the last book is...amazing.The books:FoundationFoundation and EmpireSecond Foundation (contains the best story - Search By The Mule)Foundation's Edge (best overall book)Foundation and EarthAfterward, Asimov went back and wrote prequel novels (Prelude to Foundation, Foundation's End) taking place prior to and concurrently with events from the first book. He later admitted that he wrote prequels because the main story had gotten so complicated, he felt he'd taken the story as far as it could go.The prequels aren't too bad, but they are completely non-essential."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"First I should say that this is a great book. It is the second book in the Foundation Trilogy. And if you need some help on the order of the books, here tis : 1)Prelude to Foundation 2)Forward the Foundation 3)Foundation 4)Foundation and Empire 5)Second Foundation 6)Foundation's Edge 7) Foundation and Earth. #s 3,4, and 5 are the original trilogy. I have reviewed all of them. They're all good. This particular book has two parts. In the first part the Foundation is faced with the dying but still strong Galactic Empire, and in the second, more interesting part, they face the rising Mule. A few words bout him, he's not what or who you might think he is. The next sentence might be considered a spoiler, so choose to read it or not. The Mule is actually Bobo( this word only appears once in the book, and might be missed). Well, have fun reading!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the first published volume (which was originally published as four short stories in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine, 1942-1944, with an introductory section written in 1949) of Asimov's famous trilogy, which affected many later works. This trilogy, which won a special Hugo Award in 1966 for the best science fiction series of all time, was later expanded into further volumes by Asimov (in fact, two prequels are Asimov's &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;; after Asimov's death in 1992, other authors [for example, Gregory Benford's &quot;Foundation's Fear,&quot; Greg Bear's &quot;Foundation and Chaos,&quot; and David Brin's &quot;Foundation's Triumph&quot;] have contributed to the series [note that there are now five novels that serve as prequels to Asimov's first published Foundation book!]) . In these stories, spacecraft travel over large distances via &quot;jumps.&quot; The ships spend most of their time in a form of hyperspace, each jump being aimed at a certain target star. The central character, Hari Seldon, is a psychohistorian. Psychohistory is the mathematics dealing with the reactions of very large masses of mankind to social and economic stimuli (and the recent advances in chaos theory in advanced mathematics lends credibility to Asimov's psychohistory). His calculations predicts an end to the Galactic Empire (an empire remarkably similar to the Roman Empire on Earth). Two Foundations are set up to ease mankind through the dark area predicted (or else, the dark period will last 30000 years) and, after a thousand years, will join together to form a second Empire. Although Asimov's early writing style leaves much to be desired (recall this was all put together in his early 20s during World War II when he worked for the U. S. Navy and when he was finishing his graduate work at Columbia Univ.), it is still fun reading; I enjoy every time I reread it. It is particularly enjoyable in the context of the other volumes. This first published volume has five parts. In &quot;The Psychohistorians,&quot; an introductory tale (which begins about 46 years after the events described in &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and thirteen years after the events described in the last story of &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;), Dr. Hari Seldon and a young colleague are arrested on the planet Trantor (the governing center of the Galactic Empire) and tried for treason. Seldon's group are to be exiled to the planet Terminus on the galactic rim where they will form a scientific refuge. Seldon also plans to set up another group somewhere else. We later learn, in Part III, that this other group (the Second Foundation) is located at a place known as Star's End at the other end of the galaxy. In &quot;The Encyclopedists,&quot; taking place about fifty years later, a large number of members of the original Foundation are on the planet Terminus and are compiling a massive encyclopedia to prepare for the upcoming dark age. But, why were no psychobiologists and only one psychologist present among the original colonists? The remaining three parts continue the development of the Foundation on Terminus."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Originally written in the 1950's for serial publication, the Foundation Trilogy (and the additional books written in the series) is often hailed as Asimov's greatest achievement. Certainly, the original trilogy is high on my list of \\"must read\\" science fiction.The Foundation Trilogy presents us with a universe controlled by the Galactic Empire. The Empire has governed the known universe for tens of thousands of years and appears to be at the zenith of its power. But the Empire is burdened by the weight of the bureaucracy needed to govern millions of worlds. Trantor, the administrative seat of the Empire is a planet completely covered by buildings. A vast, planet-wide city, it houses the millions of functionaries necessary to administer the Empire. As wealthy and as powerful as the Empire seems, disaster is just around the corner. However, only one man, Hari Seldon, is able to recognize the Empire's impending doom.Hari is a mathematician who has developed the breakthrough field of Psychohistory. Psychohistory is the mathematical process by which the actions of people can be predicted in advance. This science does not work for predicting individual behavior, but instead predicts the behavior of a mass of humanity (billions of people). By analyzing the Empire with Psychohistorical methods, Hari has determined that the Empire will crumble within 500 years, plunging the known universe into barbarism that will prevent a new Empire from arising for 30,000 years!Fortunately, Hari has developed a plan that, if executed, will curtail the period of galactic decay to a mere 1,000 years. However, it is unclear whether Hari can persuade the Emperor to allow him to move forward with his plan. Can Hari and his fellow scientists save the universe? Or will the shortsighted aims of a greedy, grasping Emperor derail their plans?Although these works are science fiction, they would probably not be classed as \\"hard\\" science fiction. There is some necessary discussion of scientific principles, but not enough to bore any \\"technophobes\\" who may be reading the novels. The trilogy focuses mainly on the people involved in the Seldon plan, as opposed to the technology being used by them. Asimov always enjoyed speculating on how people would evolve and react to advanced technology and he lets his imagination run wild here.Two significant milestones were achieved with this work. First, Asimov became one of the first writers to theorize that atomic power would revolutionize society. Second, I believe Asimov was the first to present a planet that was entirely covered by buildings. The universe he creates is engaging and filled with fascinating, believable characters. Since the books were serialized, many chapters (especially in the first volume) contain complete plot lines and make the book easy to read if you need to break up your reading time into small increments. Lots of political intrigue and maneuvering keeps the action flowing through all three books.Foundation sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace.There is something here for everyone to enjoy. If you have never read this fine trilogy, buy a copy today. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov has always been a better science writer than a science fiction writer. He does not have the turn of phrase, the poetic endownment, the ability to have characters change and grow and become interesting...but, his ideas have always been cutting edge without being over the top.The vision of the breakdown of the future empire, of Hari Seldon and the school of psychohistory, the idea of setting up two Foundations at each end of the galaxy...great elements of a story. There has been talk that Asimov &quot;borrowed&quot; these ideas from Campbell but if so, he gave them a polish and a new direction that completely transformed the otiginal ones.One must grant literary, historical and scientific license to the writer in that many of the inventions we take for granted were only glimmers in the eye of a teenager in the 50's. The ideas are stunning in scope if not in execution. I would have loved to have seen a Heinlein or Pamela Sargent with this material. Still, it retains the reader throughout...and sets up the next novel in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read the Foundation series many years ago and made the mistake of loaning the books to a friend - of course, I never got them back. Recently I decided to buy the series again and once again I was amazed with how ahead of their time they were, considering how long ago they were written. The central premise of the story is imaginitive, and the plot devices by which Asimov drives the book forward are cleverly thought out.I'm not a fan of &quot;laser guns and spaceships&quot; science fiction, and I hold to the idea that people living hundreds of years from now will fundamentally be the same as us. We won't be wearing silver suits and living on a diet of vitamin pills. So it's refreshing to read a &quot;sci-fi&quot; story that doesn't get bogged down with high-tech stuff, but focusses on human development. I'd recommend it to any one, whether you're a sci-fi geek or not."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The 'Golden Age' of science fiction (typically defined as the period shortly after John W. Campbell took charge of Astounding magazine to the late '40s) produced many of the seminal ideas now taken for granted (and almost cliched) by the SF genre. Foundation was certainly part of this era, defining two major ideas: that the entire galaxy would be populated by humans (no aliens around - an early look at the idea that we might just be unique), and that mass human behavior can be codified in mathematical algorithms and to a certain extent is predictable. These ideas, along with several other lesser ones, form the background basis for Foundation, where the galaxy-spanning Empire (closely modeled on the Roman Empire) is in decline and Hari Seldon has created the initial equations of psychohistory, which predict the eventual complete collapse of the Empire and an ensuing 'Dark Age' lasting 30,000 years. Although Seldon can see no way to prevent the Empire's collapse, he does see a way to reduce the resulting Dark Age length to about 1000 years, by setting up a Foundation in the far reaches of the galaxy, whose nominal mission is to preserve man's accumulated knowledge in a repository called the Encyclopedia Galactica.With this as the background, the story revolves around particular points in the Foundation's existence where it is in danger of being destroyed or overrun. Originally written as separate stories, each crisis episode's (all foreseen via the magic of Seldon's mathematics) resolution progressively moves the Foundation forward from a backwater, isolated, and ivory-tower society towards an active political power, capable of dominating its surrounding stellar mini-empires, becoming an island of light in a sea of darkness and ignorance.Viewing each episode by itself, none of them are representatives of great writing, marred by weak characterization (a typical Asimov failing) and almost hackneyed plotting. The massive shift in viewpoint and background at the start of each episode is also jarring, as the reader must readjust to a whole new set of conditions each time. However, the power of this book and its two successors is in the grand scope of the entire story line, very typical of stories of this era, as they are far more idea centered than character or plot driven. This book almost cannot be evaluated by itself, isolated from the rest of this set, because the full panorama and scale of the complete story far outweighs the individual contribution of each piece of it.As an introduction to the Seldon universe, this first book is adequate, with surprisingly little dating, given that the separate pieces of this book were written almost 60 years ago. Yes, there are places where vacuum tubes still reign, but they sit right next to the use of holographic images, which weren't even on the scientific horizon when this was written. But the technology here is almost irrelevant, as the focus is on how to guide and shape a society of humans, to develop a proper government within which individuals can grow and be creative, while at the same time there is a background thread that asks if all human actions are pre-ordained.Take the time to read this; ignore some of the blatant examples of '40s pulp-level style. Look instead for the great ideas and their interrelationships; feel the sense of wonder. But to fully experience why this is considered one of the best classics in the field, Foundation &amp; Empire and Second Foundation are immediately required follow up reading."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the first book I have read on my own and really fallen in love with. I am in 8th grade, and I found it very easy to understand and tremendously engrossing. I just couldn't put it down after I started it. Sometimes I would laugh out loud as the characters would pull such amazingly witty and ingenious double-crosses on their enemies. A definite must read for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is just about the best SF series ever, and this book is the best in the series. If you want to get into Asimov's universe this is the place to start. Just as good are his Robot series. Every one of Asimov's characters are expertly defined and easyly remembered. One of the best reads I ever had. Excellent (that's why I won't spoil the plot)."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov's Foundation is one of the most extraordinary books I've ever read. Its brilliant plot, minute detail and far-ranging scope are unequaled. Another plus for this book is that you realised it didn't focus on 1 main character; it's focus was on the evolution of the Foundation as a whole. More, it's the first book in the most famous science fiction series ever. A must-read for any serious SF fan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's entire line of work, and namely the 'Foundation' novels, have long been considered by some to be the gold-standard of science fiction. As an avid reader of the genre, I felt implied to give the series a whirl, to see what all the fuss is about and to finally spend some time with one of the grand-daddies of the golden age. So I bought 'Foundation', along with the other two novels in the original trilogy, and away I went.Very boring. Very dry. Very forgettable. The problem here, I think, is that while Asimov had some very fantastic ideas floating around in that pioneering noggin of his, he was not exactly the best at nurturing them into full-form on the page. Thus, we have a series of novels that read much more like outlines of a stronger and more fleshed-out epic. The setting is grand, the characters are intriguing. The plot is one for the ages. The final product, however, does little justice to these ideas and I found that to be vastly disappointing. All throughout, I wanted more. I wanted more world-building - not necessarily technobabble and meandering Dickenson discription, but at least more insight into the nature of this vast civilization apparently on the brink of collapse. Very much the same with the characters - I wanted to sympathize with Hari Seldon as he worked to keep knowledge alive in the face of ignorance, but it was so hard to do so when he was presented as little more than a piece of animated cardboard. I was thinking constantly about what could have been, and that put a damper on the overall effect.I think the ideas and character tropes Asimov put forth in his trilogy have been worked with by other authors and brought to life far more successfully in the years since its initial release. Novels that come to mind are Dan Simmons's awe-inspiring 'Hyperion' series and Neal Stephenson's bulky 'Anathem'. In these books, great ideas are coupled with great writing. The results, as much as it hurts me to say it, put Asimov's original to shame.'Foundation' is a great series to read if you want to witness science fiction as it was in its infantile and supposedly-golden age. But I think that it#s nevertheless important to understand that pioneering ideas can further develop and be presented in far-superior ways as the years progress. Such is the case here. Imaginative, but slow and dated. Should most certainly remain in print and continue to be read, but I do not think it is the gold-standard classic it has been made out to be. Others have done much better."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is set about 12,000 years in the future where the weakening grip of the galactic empire is showing strong signs of decline.Enter Hari Seldon, key figure in the book, whom, as per his psycho-historical mathematics claims to bring 30,000 years of barbarism down to a mere 1000 by setting up two foundations at the opposite ends of the galaxy. The story about the first Foundation follows and here asimov attacks typical sociological issues and how the infant society deals with them.It is more of a series of well-connected snapshots over several decades, rather than a contiguos moving story/time line. The only weakness of the book, if you want to call it that, is the lack of good character development... but it doesnt impede the reader from following the twists and turns of the plot.Foundation is the first book in what is perhaps Sci-Fi's most imaginative and complete series by Issac Asimov. It's almost a sin to not finish the series which include (in order)foundation and empiresecond foundationfoundation's edgefoundation and earth &lt;-- best book of the seriesTo get most thrill out of the series, i highly recommend reading the robot series (the caves of steel, the naked sun, the robots of dawn, robots and empire) before moving on to foundation's edge and foundation and earth."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book has flaws, yes, as some of the earlier reviewers have pointed out, but they are seriously missing the point if they give the book fewer than 2 stars. Asimov was a man of great ideas and scientific knowledge, but I do not believe that he ever took a creative writing class. He was writing back in the days when a writer wrote, rather than talked about writing. So, OK, some of the characters talk as though they are in a cowboy movie. So, OK, some of the dialogic phrasings are awkward or stilted. So, OK, there is only one teeny tiny female character (as a black man myself, I might aslo point out that we of the African Diaspora are noticeably absent from the futuristic roll call). The whole idea of psychohistory is so engaging that you sit there for hours pondering it and thinking, and he was so young when he wrote this. So young. This is a great book, a true classic."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"While reading this book, I couldn't help exulting on the philosophy of the book and the characters' conduct. Though the Foundation keeps confronting belligerent forces, the heads of Foundation's government and those in charge do not resort to violence! Instead of the automatic jump to use violence in a threatening situation, they use civil disobedience, embargos, and gentle ways of subjugation. Even though some warhawks (the Actionists of Terminus in Hardin's time) agitate the Foundation to go to war, in the end, the doves prevail, using their tactics of nonviolence. Since Asimov (genius) published this book in 1951, three years since the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, I could tell that it was influenced by Gandhi's nonviolent philosophy. Albert Einstein recognized the enlightened mind of Gandhi, who advocated nonviolent tactics and change without shedding blood. Throughout Asimov's Foundation, published three years after Gandhi's assassination, Gandhi's teachings are very evident. Most readers probably didn't recognize this, but Foundation was probably influenced by one of the major figures of our century--Gandhi. Also, the nonviolent philosophies of Leo Tolstoy and Henry David Thoreau are also somewhat present."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I really liked Foundation. Then I really liked the first part (&quot;The General&quot;) of this. And then the Mule showed up... First, Asimov always had trouble writing a mystery. I identified the Mule the first time he showed up, and I figured out the basics of his mutation as soon as the Visi-Sensor was described. And that leads me to my second nitpick. The Mule didn't need to have such a powerful ability to affect others. The ability to read minds plus high intelligence would give the Mule the same ability to predict reactions as a trained psychohistorian, and the Visi-Sensor would give him the tool to exploit it. The story itself would go much the same way, with the Mule's ability to force predicted reactions replacing his ability to force actions, but with a tighter integration with the ideas of the previous book. Furthermore, it would have meant none of the psychic conspiracies which proceeded to dominate in the books Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, etc. The ability to twist minds transforms psychohistory from the powerful science of Foundation to simply a method of forecasting the societal impact of psychic manipulation. It also transformed the Foundation series from moderately hard SF stories about the impact of a new science to just another set of stories about mind control magic. BTW, I like fantasy and soft SF -- I just wish Foundation didn't change genres in mid-trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were written in the 1940's! Must you blame Mr. Asimov for &quot;inaccuracy&quot; in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In his Foundation Trilogy (later to be extended in additional books), the prolific science fiction/fact writer Isaac Asimov told a story of a small group of people who secretly steered the course of history using technology that we would now recognize as an outgrowth of memetics. By recognizing group psychology and the effect of various memes on populations, they were able (Asimov creates) to shorten the intergalactic Dark Ages by millennia.Is such a thing possible? We are seeing the beginnings of attempts at memetic engineering today. Advertisers are designing memes that are becoming fairly effective at penetrating populations, in hope that they will carry with them a message influencing consumer buying behavior. Have you heard someone say &quot;I love ya, man!&quot; lately? Anheuser-Busch is delighted if you have.More broadly, I'm seeing a steady trickle of organizations copying and mutating successful Profit Viruses (MLMs) and Power Viruses (cults). It's an interesting question whether the population as a whole will ever build up an &quot;immunity&quot; to this kind of thing, or whether the evolutionary-psychology buttons of lust, power, fear, and so on are too powerful to overcome.Who knows?

His plot twists never turn onmajor battles or laser fights, but always with the triumphof reason. It's all here in abundance."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Though \\"Foundation\\" was later tied to many other novels and stories that Isaac Asimov wrote, many of us considered this story to be the first of the Foundation Trilogy. We meet Hari Seldon and learn of the beginning of psychohistory. Hari has predicted, using psychohistory, that the 12,000 year old galactic empire is facing eminent collapse. Hari determined through this calculations that the collapse of the empire will lead to 30,000 years of chaos before a second empire forms. Hari also determined that by taking certain actions that the 30,000 years of chaos could be shortened to 1,000 years.Considering that this novel is only 256 pages long it covers a lot of ground. The novel begins on the ultra-urbanized planet Trantor and then heads to the edge of the galaxy. We watch the empire collapse and then the struggles of the Foundation as they attempt to re-start civilization. We also watch as the Foundation changes from a religious organization to a scientific one.This novel is the best of the first three Foundation books. Part of the reason may be that these stories were originally short stories. Also, Asimov was not trying to form a single cohesive story lasting 1,000 years; at this time he was just trying to launch an idea. I sometimes think it is easier to launch an epic adventure than it is to evolve the epic over hundreds or thousands of pages. Certainly Asimov's launch in this book was grand and is one of the best classic science fiction novels.The next two books in this series are \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation.\\"Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"My 14 year old loves science fiction and fantasy and I've introduced him and reintroduced myself to some of the Classic Works of the Genre that Predate Star Wars and Serenity.Its been at least 20 years since I first read the trilogy.

An edited version of it was published by Ace Books in the 1950s under the title \\"The Man Who Upset The Universe\\". It consists of two sections which are taken from shorter fiction that was published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940s. While better than the first novel in the series, there are still some weaknesses as a result of age. Asimov himself wrote in 1982 that the knowledge of astronomy at that time was \\"primitive\\" and that he could now take advantage of electronic computers in his stories, which hadn't been invented until he was halfway through the series in the 40s.The two sections of \\"Foundation And Empire\\" are:\\"The General\\" - In this story, the Foundation is attacked by what is left of the Empire. The Empire, though much weaker than it once was, is still stronger than the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"Dead Hand\\" in the April 1945 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".\\"The Mule\\" - Perhaps the best of the Foundation stories; in this one the Seldon plan is destroyed by its inability to predict a singular event.

Set far in the future, Hari Seldon's goal is to shorten an impending period of Dark Ages from tens of thousands of years to one thousand years. To do so, he creates an organizational entity, the Foundation, and maneuvers to create circumstances so that the Foundation will recreate the Galactic Empire amid a blossoming of science and technology.This book is the first in a series that will keep you happily reading for days. In Foundation, the stage is set for the problem, and you will begin to understand the plan that Seldon has employed by examining the first 150 years after the Foundation is established.The book is built around four crises (Seldon Crises) that shape the potential of the First Foundation to fulfill its goal. In the first crisis, the Foundation is viewed as being a traitorous activity by the political authorities. Seldon explains that his purpose is to create an encyclopedia to encompass all current knowledge before it is lost. The crisis is survived when he agrees to take the project into exile on a planet with few natural resources at the far edge of the galaxy.Fifty years later, that fledgling is threatened by its powerful neighbors who have greater resources and military power. The Emperor can no longer protect the Foundation. Thirty years after that, another attempt to militarily capture the Foundation occurs. Another seventy years later, a fourth crisis occurs when remnants of the Empire start funneling advanced weapons to planets at the edge of galaxy that oppose the Foundation.Each crisis is overcome with a different approach, by a different leader. And the Foundation continues to develop towards its eventual form.These crises are much like a good mystery story. You know there's been a crime that needs to be solved, but you haven't quite figured out how yet. Because there are four crises, you get to enjoy that problem-solving experience four times in one book! Pretty neat!The Foundation's advantage in all of these crises is that it has advanced knowledge and has applied it, while the rest of the Empire is losing knowledge. Pretty soon, things are falling apart technically for those outside the Foundation. The key technology is built around atomic power (as it appeared it would developed in the 1950s).Reviewing Foundation is a challenging task. This book has become a science fiction classic, yet many will see little value in it because the science fiction perspectives and forecasts about science are dated. The book has to be read in the context of the books that follow to be fully understood and appreciated, but how does that help the person who has just finished Foundation? Isaac Asimov used a most unusual style in the book, as though you are a historian uncovering bits of primary and secondary sources concerning a long ago period in time (that occurs in our future). That either makes the book more authentic (if you like that) or annoying (if you don't).At bottom, these contrasts require the reviewer to attempt to capture for the potential reader what makes this book an enduring classic.First, Foundation squarely asks a fundamental question: How should knowledge be built, maintained, and used for the benefit of all? A subset of that question is: What are the appropriate uses of knowledge? These are questions that we do not wrestle with nearly enough today. Many people enjoy thinking about these questions, and welcome their introduction by this book.Second, Foundation suggests that progress is faster with the benefit of planning that takes into account human nature. Seldon's discipline is the reliable behavior of large groups of people (psycho-history). Those who like to plan and those that do not will equally enjoy Asimov's scenario for making his point that we should build from our understanding of human behavior. You can debate the point and have lots of fun forever, based on what is here.Third, many social thinkers have been inspired by the Foundation concept to structure their own changes. Nonviolent political movements match the Foundation concept in many ways, for example. This book gives you a lens to consider many of the global agencies that have been created by international organizations.Fourth, what should be the relationship between knowledge and power? Usually, they are united. But the Foundation posits a world in which they can be divided, and that division could have some benefits. A current example would be the unharnessed knowledge of the Internet. No government will probably succeed in trying to hold dominion over it.Science fiction has long played a useful role in helping society to examine its most important scientific questions in advance. Then the concepts that seem useful become the early paradigms of scientific and social progress. In the case of Foundation, that paradigm here is applied to social progress primarily . . . not scientific progress. So think of this as a book about the science fiction of governing.Foundation suggests a world where knowledge has more power than today, and is also more effective at curbing harmful exercises of power than currently. That shining ideal, I believe, is at bottom the key to understanding Foundation's lasting and broad appeal.Whether you like, love, are indifferent to, or hate Foundation, I suggest you read the initial trilogy before making up your mind about this book. Much of the genius of Foundation (the first book) isn't apparent to most readers until the trilogy is read and grasped.One word of caution: Asimov wrote lots of one-draft wonder books, and was certainly not a great craftsman in his writing. Look past that writing quality to the conceptual brilliance of the picture he is painting.After you have finished the trilogy, ask yourself the question of how you can make knowledge more effective in promoting human moral and economic progress. I think you will find that to be an intriguing question well worth the attention you give to it. And you can think of Foundation to remind you of the question."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the epitome of the ideal of the pessimistic technocratic utopian. Strange as it may sound, the plot is as follows: pseudo-science finds a way to predict future, politicians banish scientists, scientists establish new citizenry, trade flourishes, scientists gain control through pseudo-religion. This supposedly tried-and-true pseudo-science is a way to predict the future by way of studying human behavior (an oddly fatalistic view of a scientific universe). However, I disagree with the notion and invest my interest in the rival fund of the \`Crazy Eddie' effect of Niven's Motie series where an individual can make the most drastic difference.I must further state that I was born in 1980 and began reading SF in 2007 with the likes of Niven, Bear and Brunner. I like my complex Iain Banks, voluminous Alastair Reynolds, mind-bending Greg Egan and ever-changing Brunner. Now while many of the so-called \`old timers' have proclaimed Foundation sacred like the novels of Dune, I am of the new generation and of the new voice, which can't be held to the same standard as the last generation (or two). Times changes, ideals change, perspectives change, terminology changes, tolerable prefixes change and personal development changes. While Dune may have been impressive in style and scope, it did not satisfy me in content, interest and follow through. To these effects, I wish to express my dissatisfaction with Foundation.To paraphrase an excellent book about the relationship between psychology and musical composition entitled \`Of Mind and Music,' the author states that repetition is an exploit of human emotion causing the listener (or in this case, the reader) to fall into a collective primal rhythm with fellow listeners (read: readers). Like in Foundation, the amount of repetition is akin to the acute attack of bass at a rave; theories are repeated endlessly, idiosyncratic allegories are scattered through every chapter and the word \`atomic' was shotgun blasted, litter strewn, scattered to the winds, chucked without consciousness onto nearly ever page (sign of the times, I presume?). Here is the alphabetical list of \`atomic' phrases found in Foundation:Atomic blaster, atomic drill, atomic drive (also the hyperatomic drive), atomic fire, atomic force, atomic force-shield, atomic gadgets, atomic generator, atomic knife, atomic power, atomic shear, atomic ships, atomic specialists, atomic techniques, atomic washing machine (bwah!) and atomic weapons.If \`style' could mean the expressed use of repetition, the Asimov has easily seduced the science fiction reader of the early 1950s. With the blossoming (pessimists read: destructive radiation) of the atomic age, the dream of an atomic future must surely have seemed to be an optimistic fantasy. Nowadays, the equivalent would be novels which saturate their content with micro- and nano- prefixes. Thus, it seems as Asimov had the initial bug of beginning of the \`atomic' prefix fixation? Did Asimov overdo it? In these regards, I stand to say that Asimov had a single-tracked mind.While reading the sciences and unfolding plot of the pseudo-science, I was constantly remained of the \`Seldon crisis' and the mightier-than-thou proverb \`Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.' As an educated reader, I only need to be reminded once to have the full effect of conveyance and depth. Throw in the tame pre-sensor curses of \`Oh, space!' and the cringe-worthy \`Great galloping galaxies!' and you have for yourself a novel which is mildly aggravating, almost maddening. Repetition doesn't mean a solid follow through. Rather, it just means the author is either under-evaluating the reader of filling up word space.Additionally, the characters were as bland as cardboard for breakfast. Everyone seemed to be a utopian plutocrat or an idealistic capitalist in a struggling capitalist society. Scientists know best, so scientists so rule, right? It's ONE vision of style of government but the path Asimov takes is one of superiority and, ultimately, disagreement. The approach is too preachy to the benefits of an ideal technocratic civilization. Throughout, I understood the relationships and the dealings between opposing parties, but I found the unraveling as tedious as the usage of the word \`atomic.' Politico scenes compounded by feudal titles bored me to bits, much like Herbert's Dune, Tepper's Grass and some of Wolfe's Long Sun series. While the over-all feudal scene works well with the future technocratic/religious society, I find the kowtowing to be overwhelming (more so considering I already live in a fairly visible feudal society).Inevitably, as the word and review suggest, I must say that the novel has failed to impress me in the year 2010 after 30 years of mortality and four years of reading science fiction. Surely, many modern novels must have been based off the ideals presented in Foundation, but from my standpoint in the ear 2010, I fail to see greatness which was intrinsically embossed upon it during its publication and further years of intense readership. In the year 2010, the novel does not stand the ultimate test of time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In his Foundation Trilogy (later to be extended in additional books), the prolific science fiction/fact writer Isaac Asimov told a story of a small group of people who secretly steered the course of history using technology that we would now recognize as an outgrowth of memetics. By recognizing group psychology and the effect of various memes on populations, they were able (Asimov creates) to shorten the intergalactic Dark Ages by millennia. Is such a thing possible? We are seeing the beginnings of attempts at memetic engineering today. Advertisers are designing memes that are becoming fairly effective at penetrating populations, in hope that they will carry with them a message influencing consumer buying behavior. Have you heard someone say &quot;I love ya, man!&quot; lately? Anheuser-Busch is delighted if you have. More broadly, I'm seeing a steady trickle of organizations copying and mutating successful Profit Viruses (MLMs) and Power Viruses (cults). It's an interesting question whether the population as a whole will ever build up an &quot;immunity&quot; to this kind of thing, or whether the evolutionary-psychology buttons of lust, power, fear, and so on are too powerful to overcome. Who knows? There may have been a small group of Illuminati steering us for millennia past without us even knowing...--Richard Brodie, author, Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Having just finished Greg Bear's brilliant &quot;Foundation &amp; Chaos&quot;, I've decided I can no longer wait to begin re-reading the original again. I wish I could take the next few months to start off with the Robot series, move on to the Galactic Empire series, and then finsh with the entire collection of the Foundation books (because it's all one big wunnerful story, doncha' know!). Well, not this year, perhaps, but in a few I may do just that. In the meantime, I will re-read &quot;Foundation&quot; with yet another new perspective of Hari Seldon and all that came before this original masterpiece... it truly never gets old."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is a great book, but it's not one that would translate to film. It converted me from Star Trek books to real sf. (Although Star Trek started me out so I'm not too harsh on it.) As a lover of history it drew me in. One of the major advantages of science fiction is it's ability to deal with grand scope of history &amp; it does it. Interestingly I like the later books too. In conclusion A movie version?????? I sure hope not they'd ruin it. However his End of Eternity ,which is one of my favorites, might be cinematic if they did it right."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation trilogy is the best work of science fiction I have ever read.

You may find the science of psychohistory a bit hard to believe, perhaps more so because history always celebrates the individual heros. But all leaders make use of mass belief to reach their goals. Asimov combines his observations of society with his scientific knowledge to create a masterpiece. A must read for sci-fi enthusiasts like me."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In 40 years I have read the Foundation trilogogy multiple times. Each time is just as intense as the first, if not more.

Not bad for fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is really great. It consists of two stories. Bothe stories invovle Hari Seldon's theory and promise that the Foundation will last forever against threatning enemies. The first stroy is about an Emperial general who threatens the Foundation, but obviously lose, since Hari Seldon's plan can not be changed. The ending gives the reader a broad prespective on Hari Seldon's plan and theory. I would rate the first stroy as very good. The second story is even better. This time the Foundation is threatened by a mutant, and the Foundationa is loosing. You must read the second story, which is EXCELLENT, juts for the surprising and excellent ending!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book was almost perfect. It was actually better than the stellar first book (Foundation), which was also great. I just hope that we will one day get to see a 'Big Budget' movie series on the Foundation Series.

Furthermore they were written out of order, Foundation was the first, and the other two, Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation were written 35-40 years later. Also, the stories were not &quot;tacked on&quot; each of the first three books is actually a collection of connected novellas, which orignally were published seperately in magazines."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this book as a teenager and was excited to be reminded of it recently.

I got lost in the pointless dialog and was unable to finish."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The book is written about an empire in the future. I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer. The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed. I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"So many people like this book and have called it a \\"classic\\" - I felt I had to read it. I am not a hard-core sci-fi reader, but I did enjoy reading books by Herbert, Heinlein, Bradbury, and the like. So I though I'd give Asimov a chance. To my surprise, I didn't like this book at all.I have read some bad books in my life, but this is the first bad book I bothered to read all the way through. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for the \\"eureka\\" moment when I finally understood why everyone likes this book so much. It never happened, and when I finally came to the end of the book, I realized that Mr. Azimov stole a good two hours of my life and gave me NOTHING in return.The story sounds interesting, and in the hands of another writer it may have bore fruit. Unfortunately, in Mr Asimoz's hands, the story falls flat in the implementation. Had the writing not been funny, I would have been completely bored. Of course, Mr. Azimov did not intentionally make me laugh - sadly, his understanding of the human condition appears to be based largely on old, cheap pulp fiction novels. The characters are completely one dimensional and unconvincing. I truly cannot understand why anyone would like this book - but calling it a classic is simply unbearable. I can only assume that most of the people reviewing this book favorably are children. In any case, they are certainly not familiar with truly good writing. My advice: avoid this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Being a sci-fi fan myself, I decided I wanted to try reading some of the works by the giants of sci-fi. I had always heard how great &quot;Foundation&quot; was, so I thought I'd start with this one. I was thoroughly disappointed! Asimov used way too many large words (&quot;using dollar words where dime words would suffice&quot;). The story seemed to jump around from one time to another. The characters were very one-dimensional and very flat...I didn't have that &quot;I wonder what's going to happen next to ---&quot;. I just didn't care what was going to happen next to the characters or in the story. There didn't seem to be anything to propel this story along; nothing to develop the characters or the story. I read over 100 pages and I still had no interest in what was happening. (Even Stephen King, who can be pretty tough to get into his stories, has me hooked within 50 to 60 pages!) I just don't get what all the hype is over this book. Could someone out there PLEASE tell me! I will try to get into his Robot series...maybe he has better character and story development in them...I hope!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed, the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic, illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls. The language is about as colorful as a newspaper.The ideas behind the novel may have been new and interesting 50 years ago, (although anyone familar with Wells, Huxley, or Verne would debate that), but now they are just tired and beaten like a dead horse."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is the best scifi, besides Dune. The book is so witty and so indepth. The story is great the writting is great, i strongly recamend this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The original Foundation trilogy won the Hugo for the best series of all time. It deserved it. For those who like &quot;hard&quot; (science-driven) sci-fi as opposed to emotion-driven sci-fi, this is a must. Actually, the premise is not as outrageous as it first appears... We can all vaguely predict the general reaction of the human race to a certain idea, which means it does follow some rules. It would be difficult, but not impossible, to find some generalised maths to describe it, but the rewards would certainly justify it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This review is intended for the entire Foundation trilogy and as such this series of books even though written in pieces in Science Fiction magazines is woven together in an astonishingly complex web of ideas and mystery. This series stands as the epitome of the science fiction classic, what science fiction should be about and how it should be written. As a classic it is only superseded by &quot;Dune&quot; and only a few others come close eg &quot;Ender's Game&quot; (Orson Scott Card) series and the &quot;Galactic Milieu&quot; series (Julian May). The whole series is epic and yet does not loose sight of the characters or the story which is all important in science fiction, without it the wizz-bang effect takes hold and the whole thing collapses, eg Terminator could not have been held together without the excellent storyline. Other examples of great science fiction stories include &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; both of which had great stories without a reliance on effects which some films have done eg the extra added graphics to the original Star Wars and too much graphics in Episode 1.These stories also provide a fascinating tale of science yet to come such as psychohistory which totally fascinated me when I read about it and some other physicists I have known. The possibilities are incredible a science of probabilistic mathematics used to predict the future given historical events. In addition we are of course confronted with the politics and the usual human weaknesses including greed, corruption and the like, much akin to the degenerate aspects of the Roman Empire. The new mathematics of psychohistory developed by Hari Seldon working on Trantor and trying to set up the two Foundations to at least control the eventual collapse and fall of humanity into a dark age and the Mule the one person not predicted by the original theory who is the defeated through remarkable twists and turns in the story which is full of intrigue and mystery, simply unputdownable. I have read the books many times and will do so again although psychohistorical mathematics is beyond current attainability I believe, but then maybe not.Other books are judged next to this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I've seen a few bad reviews of Isaac Asimov's Foundation and it grieves me, really grieves me. When Isaac Asimov first came up with the idea for his Foundation series it was planned that he would write the future history of our galaxy. It could be said that it was an experiment in a method of writing fiction.If Asimov's characterizations or scenery descriptions seem bland or garish to some readers, that's because Asimov's focus was on the story. Despite Foundation's original ad hoc nature, I have read no other series which has so intricately weaven the elements of the plot so finely together. Alone, the novel Foundation may seem mundane, and it may not be your best bet if you're seeking instant gratification. But together - together with the other two books in the trilogy, together with the two later written sequels, together with the later two written prequels, together with his other bodies of work which have been woven into an expansive interplay of stories and plot, together with three &quot;pre&quot;prequels written posthumously by outside authors, I know no greater complicated work that brings with it such depth and expansiveness.In short, Foundation, serves as a sounding board for a series of future historical accounts. And Asimov never fails to deliver suspense, drama, and surprise throughout them.But that's just my biased opinion ;)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"So, you're thinking about delving into Science Fiction and you just don't know where to start.Start with Asimov's _Foundation_. Simply put, this is where science fiction starts. You will be introduced to the concept of a vast, complex history of a civilization which is certainly not Planet Earth... and, get this, it was written several decades before we sent anyone to the moon.And there's more... Foundation leads to an entire trilogy which leads to another trilogy which, get this, actually leads you back to Planet Earth.Five stars. Possibly more."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I would recommend this series to anyone. Asimov is a great writer, who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall. For those of you who like hard sci-fi this is the series for you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"i loved this book and how the 2 great cultures of new and old me"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The foundation series isthe second best sci-fi series ever (clarke's rama series is the first) This is an awsome book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"F&amp;E shows in marvelous guise the slowly growing power of Terminus, the inevitable clash with the still powerful remnants of the Galactic Empire, and the downright weird occurrances that follow the conquests of the Mule, a Telepath who can shape other people's minds to suit his permanantly, and who aspires to dominance. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This was my first Asimov book. Based on the reviews I've seen for this series, I was expecting a more captivating story. However, another reviewer's comments has convinced me not to give up yet. That reviewer notes that this is an early work of Asimov's and the sequels are better. I'll give the next one a try."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Right where a character talks about his old age of sixty-two years.Yeah, right. An advanced galactic civilization, thousands of years old, with FTL travel and turnkey exoplanets just right for human habitation everywhere, never bothered to find medical treatments for aging. That might have sounded plausible in science fiction 60+ years ago, but much less so today. The novel also suffers from a lot of faults which other reviewers have noted. Perhaps Asimov's stories blew geeks' minds in the 1940's and 1950's, but his work hasn't aged well.BTW, Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Carl Sagan and a lot of other scientifically knowledgeable people in the mid 20th Century accepted the existence of exoplanets based on NO evidence at all until the mid 1990's, while at the same time criticizing similar claims without evidence as woo-woo. Just by coincidence the exoplanet faith position happened to resemble observable reality somewhat - but it didn't have to. Even then, the existence of so many \\"hot Jupiters\\" surprised a lot of astronomers involved in the hunt for exoplanets. Exoplanetologists may not find plausible earthlike planets for many years."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Political space tales aren't really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action, choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN, then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories, loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The time frame in which the book takes place can best be described as &quot;A Long time ahead, in a galaxy far far away&quot;. Yes, that is a cheesy Star Wars cliche. However, readers expecting anything star warsey about this should expect to be sorely disappointed. This book focuses primarily on politics. There is not one ounce of violence in the book, which is a good thing, it is a nice break from almost everyother contemporary scifi novel, which all seem to impress people with their space ships 'n' aliens. The book is very good, but sometimes does get a little boring. I suppose this may be my fault, as I do have a short attention span. Anyhow, this book does a few twists in it, as everything may not be what it seems with Hari Seldons dream!So if you've been on the fringe of being a sci fi fan, but detest the embarassment of carrying around a book with giant robots on it, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is my all-time favourite book. It is so amazing, especially the science Asimov created. And it made sense too! The story is awesome, and leaves you wanting more. This book (and the next two) beat of Lord of the Rings for all-time sci-fi/fantasy trilogy. Hopefully it will be made into a movie one day. Might even beat out LOTR with oscars too. It is a must read for anyone who loves sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"... but that didn't prevent me from intensely disliking it. The characters are flat, the story is contrived, and why are all people of power in this world men? Very realistic idea of the future."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read these books when I was in high school and althoughI almost never read fiction, and don't particularly like sciencefiction (even though I studied geophysics in university andwork as an engineer), these books made an immense impressionon me. As I began to study Judaism, I finally discovered thatAsimov, a non-observant, yet knowledgable Jew, was using theformat of science fiction to describe the Jewish concept of theredemption of mankind. A careful reading of the BiblicalProphets shows that the ideal world that history is leadingmankind towards has universal peace between nations and ade-emphasis of technology in favor of the development of man'sinner, morespiritual side. However, this development of man's spiritualqualities and move towards universal harmony is accompaniedby upheavels and wars. Jewish tradition also says that theworld is sustained by 36 \\"hidden\\" righteous people whosegood deeds and spritual superiority are vital from preventingthe destructive forces in the world, both natural andman-made from overcoming everything and leading the worldto chaos.Asimov used the two Foundations as his vehicle for describingthis cosmic process, and an important part of the story isthe necessity of the Second Foundation to remain \\"hidden\\" toallow the process to work itself out.As far as the story itself is concerned, it is true that it isdated...for example, Asimov places the capital of the GalacticEmpire on the planet Trantor which \\"is at the center of theGalaxy\\". Today, it is believed that the center of the galaxyis full of black holes and lethal amounts of radiation, so itis unlikely there would be life as we know it there. Also,Asimov posits atomic energy as being the ultimate form of powerbut physics has advanced beyond that point to fusion and otherexotic forms of power.On the other hand, Asimov wrote these stories in the wake ofthe Second World War and so he is quite aware of how so manyinstitutions created by men...including governments and religiousestablishments, even starting with the bestof intentions, seems to run into crises. Thus the GalacticEmpire, which brought centuries of peace and prosperity tomankind, is brought inevitably to a point of degeneration, andhow the (First) Foundation itself, founded by idealistic,intelligent people who are at least partly aware of theirimportant role in shaping a better future for mankind, rapidlydegenerates into a repressive dictatorship.As others have pointed out, these stories have almost no \\"action\\",which is fine with me (my favorite movies and TV shows alsohave no action, e.g. Twelve Angry Men) and in spite of thefact that these stories are 60 years old, I recommend themto anyone who wants a deeper look at mankind's natureand its destiny."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The greatest sequel ever! With a powerful storyline and surprise ending, the book leads right into the Second Foundation"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you're only going to read one SF book, this is the one. This was my introduction to SF many years ago and it's still my all-time favorite. Asimov was the original and is still the master."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation clearly deserved its awards and recognition for being a classic science fiction novel. The creative and unique story line presents the reader a sensation of the future. In the beginning of the book, Hari Seldon was introduced as a psychohistorian and mathematician who could chart the future of the human race for tens of thousands of years. He predicted a decline of the Galactic Empire, which had lasted for twelve thousand years, into a state of disorder and barbarism for the next thirty thousand years. Hari Seldon then established the Foundation to serve as the purpose of shortening the period of chaos into a single millennium or less.The book was extremely enjoyable and the pages went by fast. However, the only problem I had was that once I got to know the characters, the story went on to a situation a couple decades later with new characters. Though it bothered me, the way the author wrote his novel was necessary to put a whole century's plot into a book. Despite the many characters in the story, the author created a distinct personality for each. Yet, each of the leaders in the different parts of the book were similar in a way; they all dealt with conflict extremely calmly and ingeniously. They cleverly manipulated their enemies with their words and were always prepared against threats or opposition. They knew how to win the people's votes even when they were in a weak position to run for a government position. I could not help but to ponder about what I would have done in each of the situations. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction or anyone who likes reading about how characters cleverly solve their problems."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I think this is a great book by itself and worth the time in reading it but if you have time I would recommend reading the whole series. If you do that you might want to start with &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; but you don't have to. Pick up this book right away!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Re-reading Foundation showed it to be rather dated in its depiction of an advanced galactic empire, rooted in its 1940s science fiction environment. The overall plot, such as it is, betrays the novel's origins as separate short stories, and the characters tend to be wooden. Foundation and Empire, the next book in Asimov's original Foundation trilogy, is a much better novel, especially in its depiction of the character of the Mule. However, the concept of psychohistory introduced in this work is fascinating and the key to the other books by Asimov and others describing past and future developments in the Foundation universe."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"For beginners into this serie of Asimov, know that their are other books before Foundation, and they are all tied-up.-----------------&lt;Robot serie&gt;:I, Robot/ The Caves of Steel/ The Naked Sun/ The Robots of Dawn/ Robots and Empire&lt;Bridging novel&gt;:Tyrann&lt;Foundation series&gt;:Foundation/ Foundation and Empire/ Second Foundation/ Foundation's Edge/ Foundation and Earth----------------Some highligths:-I, Robot: The beginning of the robots themselves-The Robots of Dawn: Early mention of psychohystory as a possible new field-Robots and Empire: The Earth starts becoming unlivable-Tyrann: A view between the two series ('Robot' &amp; 'Foundation').

But all three books were in one volume, so I kept reading. I'm glad I did! Every time I've read them since, I discover something new to love. The ending of this book blew my mind! If there is such a thing as a literary high, I was on one for a week after reading this eight years ago. No book or movie you can name comes close to this kind of thrill or scope. And just when I thought Asimov couldn't take it any further, he does, with a character's last statement. By now the Foundation has gained dominance over its surrounding enemies. All part of Hari Seldon's (the Foundation's founder) Plan. And they are strong enough to face the Empire. The first half of the book is a power struggle of the leaders of the Empire, more politics, and a small band of traders, rebels, and scholars, who wait for the coming of the &quot;magicians&quot; to someday be their saviors. The second half of the book follows a small group of people belonging to the Democratic Underground who expect major political changes for the next Seldon Crisis. They hear of a man who calls himself the Mule. Generals surrender to him without a fight. His worst enemies become his most faithful subordinates. They seek him out, thinking he can help their cause. No one can explain the success of the Mule. Where did he come from? Was he planned by Hari Seldon? Hari Seldon appears, as before, as a hologram, explaining the crisis and the course of action. But he makes no mention of the Mule. Everything has gone awry, and Seldon's plan is out of whack, and the galaxy might revert to the 30,000 years of barbarism Seldon was trying to avoid. Hari Seldon counted on several things, that there would be no major changes in the galaxy's technology, such as something that could withstand any bombardment, or strange neurobiological weapons; and, that human reaction to stimuli would remain constant. If it's not the first, it must be the second-- the Mule has mental powers. How do they fight him? By seeking out this Second Foundation. Hari Seldon mentioned it vaguely, but there is no record of its purpose, and no proof of its existence. This same small band from the D.U., including a psychologist (as the Foundation considers one), set off to the center of what's left of the Empire, The planet/city Trantor, to search Seldon's records. The whole time managing to stay out of the way of the Mule's path of destruction, and ends with the awesome climax I mentioned. Does the Second Foundation even exist? What is their purpose? The psychologist, working on overdrive, seems to have found its location. &quot;It was so simple,&quot; he said. But he doesn't live to reveal his discovery. Did he really find it, or was his mind too distorted to make any sense? There are more surprises and excitement to come in the trilogy's third installment, Second Foundation. Some people have the gall to call these books wordy or boring. Keep in mind that Lord of the Rings had its slow parts, too, but the few exciting parts are what you remember and hold it all together. It's better to take these books as a whole. For that, one is not necessarily better than the other two, they are all essential to the whole story line. Perhaps someday we can look forward to a mutilated Hollywood version, then go back and re-read the books, and hold them dear to our hearts."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I thought the book was somewhat dull compared to the first &quot;Foundation&quot; novel, because there are no brilliant characters such as Salvor Hardin or Hober Mallow and no great accomplishments. The first part of the book about Foundation's struggle against the Empire is not impressive. The second part about the Mule was moving sort of slow until a brilliant ending. I was absolutely shocked at it and I thought that it was definitely worth reading the entire novel for the ending. In fact the emotion that I experienced must have been something like what people influenced by the Mule felt! I also realized I had a great affection for the Mule, it is fabulous that a person who is predicted to be a pathetic loser in life makes it beyond all expectations. I know that the Mule is supposed to be a bad guy, so now that I am reading &quot;Second Foundation&quot; I hope that its ending would not be overly dramatic for him."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This story is a very detailed, accurate and plausible one, with enough depth and complexity to remain entertaining even after many re-readings."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is one of the best developed and interesting books I've ever read"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is astonishing! Foundation was great, but this book was even better. I was hooked from the moment I started reading. It immedietly strung together details in the first book which I thought were meaningless. Although the war between Foundation and Empire was good, the best parts of the book was the story of the Mule. This was one kick-a** story! The moment when everyone found out that Hari Seldon's plan had gone wrong in the Vault was one of the series' finest written moments, and the end, oh don't even get me started about the end of the book. I won't spoil it for you, but it is a great plot twist!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"From Selvor Hardin taking power from the encyclopedists to Hober Mallow conquering Korell by doing absolutely nothing, I found this to be the best sci-fi novel ever. Ender's Game and Dune don't hold a candle to it. Each story is a 10 on it's own. The way the foundation grabs victory from apparent defeat is amazing. Even though Isaac Asimov (my favorite sci-fi author) has nuclear power be able to do anything, it doesn't take away from the story. It's the best book of the foundation series for sure. If you read sci-fi, you've got to read this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov continues with his narration of the history of the interregnum between empires in pretty much the same anthology format used in Foundation. Actually, upon further thinking, there's probably no way really to tell the story of a 1,000 year journey on the part of humanity without doing it in snippets. More and more the series begins to read more like a history book with some dramatic events being highlighted for their importance as turning points. These turning points are called Seldon Crises, foreseen events by Hari Seldon, Psychohistorian, which impel the people of the Foundation forward to galactic dominance. Throughout the first book and a half, Asimov establishes a bit of fatalism - nothing can stop the foundation by historical imperative, and for that reason the people of the Foundation, especially it's leadership, become apathetic.Asimov throws a wrench into the status quo with the rise of a mutant, a statistical improbability and anomaly that could not possibly be accounted for in the creation of the Seldon Plan and therefore the first truly unknown quantity with the ability to destroy the Foundation. This mutant, called the Mule, has psychic ability and the great revival of technology in the Foundation is powerless to stop him from manipulating people and working his way to dominance. The Mule consolidates his power, takes over the Foundation and destroys the remnants of the former galactic empire and it looks like Seldon's prophecies could be wrong. That a single individual upset the 1,000 year plan to turn the Foundation into the Second Empire, in only 5 years.Asimov again explores the themes of individuality, stagnation, complacency and religion. Choice and free will are major foci for the novel. If the Seldon Plan is mathematically and psychologically accurate like a prophecy, if certain things are meant to happen, just because human beings will predictably react in the same ways in given situations, do we really have free will? What is the role of the individual in society in in the historical process? Asimov treats history like a Marxist, influenced by Hegelian dialectics. Conflicts and crises between opposing forces give birth to a third new status quo until it comes into conflict with an opposing force. These moments of intersection are the Crises predicted by Seldon and the focus of Asimov's 1,000 year narrative. But the Mule changes that. He challenges the notion of inevitability and proves the fallibility of Seldon's prophecies. But by doing so he introduces another free will paradox. The Mule has the ability to modify emotions and create complete loyalty in people. He wins victories by converting the opposing sides' generals and leaders into giving up and then serving him, destroying free will again by creating it out of the tight confines of the Seldon Plan. It's truly and interesting concept. How will the Mule be stopped? Enter: the Second Foundation. Established on the other side of the galaxy as a failsafe in case of the failure of the Foundation. But no record exists of where that foundation is or what type of society it will become. Will the Mule find it and destroy it? Does it exist after 300 years?My major problem throughout the narration is that it is assumed that the Seldon Plan represents the ideal in some way. Seldon was a human being, capable of manipulating and creating situations a millennia in advance and manipulating the fate of quadrillions of human beings. Who says his plan needs to be fulfilled? What if people don't want Seldon's future? What if they don't want to live in an all-encompassing empire? I would maybe believe Asimov wants you to question that, but he gives himself away in little asides in the narration, inserting emotional declamations against the upset of the Plan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this as a youngster. I loved the idea, and the time vault opening at various times was brilliant. It's a bit slow, however, and there wasn't enough fighting for my tastes. I like the vast scale. This is space ships of the grand era, with galaxy-spanning empires. There aren't enough of these kinds of stories written these days."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"By now you should be familiar with psychohistory, and the exploits of Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, and Hober Mallow. If that first sentence just left you slightly confused then go pick up Isaac Asimov's \\"Foudation\\" before reading \\"Foundation and Empire\\". \\"Foundation and Empire\\" picks up where \\"Foundation\\" left off, with the First Foundation rapidly expanding throughout the galaxy. In \\"The General\\" (the first half of \\"Foundation and Empire), Foundation space bumps up against what remains of the old Empire, and the Foundation must square off with Bel Riose, the last great Empire general. This story is basically a continuation of the ideas started in \\"Foundation\\". \\"The General\\" is definitely the weaker of the two stories in \\"Foundation and Empire\\", however it is a necessary story to show the growing strength and influence of the First Foundation, as well as the decline of the Empire.\\"The Mule\\" (the second half of \\"Foundation and Empire\\") tells the story of the Mule, a mysterious galactic superpower who begins conquering planets in Foundation space. The leaders of the Foundation struggle against their new enemy, and try to figure what it is that makes the Mule so efficient and effective. Meanwhile, a small group of characters working for an underground group try to find the all important location of the Second Foundation before the Mule can beat them to it. The ending of \\"The Mule\\" is absolutely amazing, and the grand reveal at the end can be foreseen by an observant reader, which makes it all the more satisfying.In short, \\"Foundation and Empire\\", along with the rest of Asimov's Foundation Series, is a great science fiction story, beautifully blending advanced mathematical and scientific ideas with good ol' fashioned adventure. Some readers complain that Asimov's characters are not as deep as they could be, and they do have a point, but Asimov never wrote the Foundation books with the intent of having deep, realistic characters; it was all about the story and the ideas. If you are looking for strong characters in your science fiction then go read Heinlein, however if you are looking for a drop dead fantatic story propelled by great scientific speculation, then you can't go wrong with picking up \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and the rest of the Foundation Series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have similar reactions to all of IA's books... that is simply that they are great fun, an easy and enjoyable read, but not terribly challenging in any respect. I would wholeheartedly recommend any of his various books to friends and family, but I wouldn't expect them to come away really grappling with social issues or anything afterwards. Don't get me wrong- he does go after social issues and examines some things in interesting ways that can be somewhat eye-opening if you're the kind of person who never thinks that way, but it's just not earth-shattering.This sounds horrible... but I don't mean it to. I love this books. I really do. :)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is tied for first place in all books I have read (other book is Atlas Shrugged). The series in all is great but this book tops them all. Imagine a combination of psychology and math used to predict the outcome of population mobs and how a man would apply it to an empire he sees falling apart (not really a spoiler cause that's a bit of what they tell you in first 2ish chapters). This book is great not just because of the idea but because the characters are relatable, face extremely difficult situations, and yet take what seems to be the only logical way out. I highly suggest you read this book and the whole series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The original Foundation trilogy is today revered as one of the best works of science fiction, by a veritable giant of the genre, Isaac Asimov. Begun originally as a series of eight short stories published in Astounding Magazine between 1942 and 1950, the first four were collected and published for the first time in 1951 under the title of Foundation.The Galactic Empire has ruled the galaxy in splendor, magnificence, and domination for the last twelve thousand years, but now its significant chapter is coming to a close; only no seems to realize this, except Hari Sheldon. Through the revolutionary science of psychohistory, Sheldon has calculated that in five centuries the empire will come to an end and the galaxy will devolve into a hostile, barbarian world that he has predicted to last thirty thousand years. But Sheldon has a plan to cut this time of the dark ages down to a mere millennium. It will take decades and centuries of planning, with the initial creation of the galactic encyclopedia, where all knowledge and record will be stored and kept for the future. To make this happen, he creates a small civilization on a remote planet that he names Foundation. Only through the years and decades, warlords rise up around the galaxy, looking to take down the Foundation, and it is up to Sheldon's planning for the encyclopedia and this small civilization to survive.In Foundation, Asimov doesn't focus greatly on complex character development (or female characters of merit, for that matter), but takes the sociological made-up science of psychohistory and has fun with exploring just what one can do with a world over a period of decades.Originally written on February 4, 2011.Go to[...]for over 500 book reviews and over 50 exclusive author interviews."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second of the first Foundation trilogy, Foundation and Empire was originally published in 1952. Originally published as two novellas in Astounding Science Fiction, \\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule\\" cover the next two periods when the Foundation receives its first full-force attacks.In \\"The General,\\" the Galactic Empire is well on its way to its inevitable end, but under the command of General Bel Riose, an attack is planned against the Foundation. Bel Riose has gone mad with power and will stop at nothing to obliterate the Foundation, somehow believing they are behind the fall of the empire. He amounts huge forces if armored gunships with plans wipe the Foundation from the galaxy. But one man from the Foundation knows about this, and he also knows knowledge is power, and since the Foundation is soon as that which has all the knowledge, he knows Bel Riose can be stopped, so long as he gets to the Emperor before the general attacks.In \\"The Mule,\\" the Galactic Empire has fallen into a selection of barbaric kingdoms, while the Foundation has become strong and powerful, but also full of corruption, composed of approximately thirty outer planets. But there is corruption within the ranks and things are stirring within the Foundation's empire. Meanwhile there is a new leader who has rise, an enigmatic mutant known as \\"The Mule,\\" who has only known scorn and suffering and is a hardened creature who respects no one, but he also has the ability to read and control people's emotions.

It begins a thousand-year project that, through the cleaver acions of the protagonists, attempts to save humanity from a prolonged and chaotic interstellar Dark Age that was bound to follow the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Through the use of a mathematical application on history(as well as psychology and sociology) called Pschohistory, the founder of that field of study (Hari Seldon) developed a plan to truncate the Dark Age period from 10,000 years to 1,000 years.He begins this plan by setting up a colony on a planet at the rim of the galaxy called Terminus called the Foundation. From then on the inhabitants and their descendants of Terminus choose certain actions and follow certain policies that do not always make sense to the reader until or to other characters. Sometimes the Foudation seems to be self-desctructing or that the leaders are being treacherous. But not is all that it seems. Every once in a while, sometimes after 50 years, or 30 years, the Foudation is in a situation that either spells destruction or conquest by a neighboring kingdom. This is referred to as a Seldon Crisis. This is usually a turning point in the Foudation's path of history that was calcutaed by Seldon and part of his plan to bring about the New Galactic Empire after the fall of the old one. The important part is that Seldon Crises or the events thta bring them about are done through clever acts of political, economic or diplomatic manipulation. (Even psychological) What is most important to the plan is that Seldon needed the Foundation to be unaware of the path the people of Terminus must take. Thus, there are few social and psychological scholars to notice the trends and provide warning. THis way the actions taken are contolled for the sake of executing the Seldon plan.I did enjoy the book and will be reading and reportin on the sequels in the future. I thought it was cleaver and insightful on human nature as wellas a good understaning of history without hitting me over the head with it. The collapse of the Galactic Empire, which stretches into the sequels, is a clear reference to the long (relatively) fall of fthe Roman Empire. It seems that just like the Romans, the Galactic Empire will not be comquerds in on campaign liike Alexander did to Persia, but instead eveolve into another form of civilation with competeing factions comparable to the Catholic Church, the absolute (so-called) ruling kings, the nobles, the equestrians, and the outside threats such as muslim caliphs. The book was originally published in 1951 AD so it did not anticpate specifc technologies and the referce to nuclear power as \\"atomics\\" is a bit outdated. I would have hoped for nuclear fusion or the equivalent of such an epic transfornmation. Also, a bigger role for women characters other than the harpie wife of a foriegn aggressor in the book would have been nice. Maybe because I was reading Steig Larsson and some Star Wars novels recently I had gotten used to female protagonsts and antagonists. But FOUNDATION was written long ago and the audience for this genre was and may still be male dominated. There are sequels and prequels to for me to explore and for Asimov to redeem himself. JK. (Observe, I wrote one of those texting acronyms.) I just hope every character does not have sound like Isaac Asomov. (as much as love him) Out of a galaxy, I give it 878,124,550,100 stars. That is fairly good."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Slow on the pick up as many of the early characters are not developed very well making it difficult to sink into. However, about midway through, things begin to get going and characters are finally given time enough to develop. After that point is really when the book becomes a classic and hard to put down; even if it has aged. A classic by any accounts even with it's few bumps."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say, I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov's fictional Galactic history."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I'm not a fan of sci-fiction, but really enjoyed it.

I picked up the first one I found and it happened to be this one, so why not give it a go?I was intrigued right from the beginning, drawn into the story easily. Asimov's style of writing is fluid and engaging, easily allowing the reader to picture and understand everything. In addition the plot came together nicely and, in a simplistic complexity (oxymoron?), you were able to see the growth of the Foundation from a fledgling world to... well I won't reveal anything, suffice it to say the natural progression that Asimov portrayed fit together very nicely.My only complaints with Asimov, though, was that it did come together to nice and neat, never really engaging the reader to the extent of wondering, thinking, feeling and diving into the story. Instead you are almost lead from A to B to C without any guessing and wondering, without any involvement, with everything almost being a foregone conclusion. Add to this his style of writing is a bit simplistic, in that there isn't anything too complex, which isn't altogether bad because he backs it up with a fluid and believable plot that is more than enough to add credence to the story. In fact we've seen this in fantasy as well as David Eddings wrote simplistically but backed it up with a story that was enjoyable to read.I will definitely read Asimov again, especially the rest of the series, if only to what Asimov would do, being a pioneer of the genre. I would certainly recommend Asimov to anyone looking to start reading science fiction and/or a light, quick read. A recommend.3.75 stars."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire\\" by Issac AsimovTwo hundred years have passed of the 300 Hari Seldon predicted it would take for the Empire to fall. All things have gone according to the Seldon plan and the Foundation is one of the most powerful states in the galaxy. This might change though because there are 2 more Seldon Crises on the horizon.This is another good addition to Foundation trilogy but as is typically the case not quite as good as the first. Foundation and Empire covers the next period of time for the foundation when the Foundation is finally brought back to the attention of what remains of the Empire. The Empire has heard of the power the Foundation now wields and views them as a threat and two different generations of Empire men seek to remedy that threat...The Good: The same aspects that were good in the first are present in the second. The idea overall and the way each story unfolds is good. Foundation and Empire ends with a Cliffhanger of sorts or at least without true resolution which would appear to lead into the next book.The Bad: The characters are a little flat and though it isn't as problematic in Asimov's stories as it would be in others it is a little more problematic in this than in the first. It was a non issue in the fist book because there are 5 Seldon crises and hence 5 different groups of characters. The stories are event driven and not character driven so when 5 events are spread across one event driven book it works out. \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is similar in length to \\"Foundation (Foundation Novels)\\" but only covers 2 crises so we are forced to deal more with the flat characters and less with events in an event driven story. This in no way ruined the book as it was still very good but is just a highlight of one of the weaker points.Overall: If you liked Foundation you will probably enjoy Foundation and Empire. If that is the case pick it up and give it a try."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" was my favorite book in high school. I read the other 2 books afterwards, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\" right after, and by then Asimov finally finished what he started so long ago by writing new books to the Foundation saga, more Robot novels, and prequels. I am re-reading Foundation right now, only this time on my Kindle. It's just as good now as it was 20+ years ago. Asimov's novels remind me of Star Trek because the stories could probably fit in any time or place, including right now. My only issue is that Asimov is deceased for a number of years now. Other writers have tried to take on the challenge of continuing his stories but no one tells a story like Asimov!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Over the years I have read a great many books from many, many authors and yet the \\"Foundation\\" series pops back into my head somewhat regularly. I often wonder why it has not been made into a series of movies. After all in my mind it would rival \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Isaac Asimov was a gifted writer and I was fortunate to know his works while he still lived. Unfortunately I never got to meet the man. This series is some of the best stuff he ever wrote. It delves into humananity and how our unique abilities may sometimes stand out. In the case of \\"Foundation\\" it centers around one empire and it's unusual ruler that expands their domain beyond any other into the far reaches of space. It looks closely at how a handful of people truly make a difference in the scheme of things and what becomes of that empire. Another great series, the \\"Robot\\" series was later linked to this series and although I enjoyed the link not everyone may enjoy it. Nonetheless you should read the \\"Robot\\" series as well if you get the chance. I will be very surprised if after you set the \\"Foundation\\" series aside, it doesn't make you reflect on it the rest of your life.

The earlier books are the best, as the latter books aren't as good. This is favorite of the earlier books.It's broken into two halves. The first half is pretty good, but it's really the second half, called The Mule, that's incredible. It's fantastic.It's style isn't like modern sci-fi, which is usually dark and action-packed. If that's what you're looking for, you won't enjoy this series. This series is much more about imagining a universe with a certain set of rules and how those rules might play out over time. To enjoy it, you have to think and imagine along with Asimov. If that \\"golden age\\" style sci-fi suites your taste, you will love this book.Obviously you can't read this book in isolation. You really need to read the Foundation before it and Second Foundation after it. The three togother make the best triology I've ever read. After those three, you can continue, but the quality of the books trails off from there.If you're a \\"golden age\\" sci-fi fan and somehow haven't already read the Foundation series, get the first three Foundation books.

The very first time I attempted to read the book, I was unable to get much further than the first part (The Psycho- Historians). As soon as you begin to get used the characters, a shift takes place. Unfortunately, this happens again and again. When you read Foundation, it becomes neccesary to think of each of the five parts as a short story.While the story was displayed in the best way I could imagine, the classic simply did not live up to my expectations. The emphasis is on the plot, and very little is put into the characters. While the book has it's flaws, I find it simply amazing when the date it was published is taken into consideration. Put simply, it's like the majority of 'classics' out there; while they were astounding in their own time, they simply can't stand up to the best of modern modern literature out there."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read this book when I was young, perhaps in my early 20's. I remember it as astounding, but recall little of it's content. In my early 30's, I went through and reread the entire trilogy straight through, which by then was a total of seven books. I believe Isaac is a true genius beyond most any man of our age. His insight into politics, religion, society, hope, hatred, love, friendship is beyond most anything I have known. And how he was able to incorporate these things into a series of books about the future of humanity nearly overwhelms me when I consider it. Most of what happens in the world, especially in the world of technology, has been shown in his books. It seems as if he must have has a direct link to the future."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Fifteen years ago, this book was the zenith of SF to me. Today, I know there are many better books.

Most SF writers allow themselves embarrassing blunders that make their universes physically absurd. In this book, you're not likely to find anything like that. To really appreciate Mr. Asimov's genius, you should read other SF novels written in the same time. Nearly all of them look ridiculous in the year 2000. Mr. Asimov's books don't.

Since I read this epic book in eighth grade it has stuck with me due to the relation of structural decay and rebirth in a future universe that mirrors our own rather perochial existance. The serendipity and foresight combining thought and action to build a better future for mankind in the Milky Way galaxy will leave the experienced, educated readers feeling they have witnessed the true future of our reality.

He is not known to let you get too close to any of his characters to feel for them in any sense of the way, EXCEPT the Mule. Out of all the Asimov books, I feel that this one is closest to being ready to become a movie (I am not sure why I, Robot and Bicentennial Man were before this one). If you have not read this one, you are in for a treat. If you have read this one, then you know it should be added to your collection."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the first book of the outstanding Foundation Trilogy. Asimov builds drama with believable characters struggling against bureaucracies and political manipulations on a grand scale. As a central government weakens, planets often show less respect for the core authorities and go there own way, sometimes forming their own alliances. Hari Seldon, master of Psychohistory, uses Psychohistory to make predictions far into the future. Hari Seldon does more than predict outcomes--he has a plan. Seldon does not expect to alter the eventual course of huge historical events, but constructs a strategy to minimize the length of time of the darkest days for the Galactic Empire.The emphasis of the book, and what makes the book a true science fiction classic, is the imagination that takes the reader through mind whirring possibilities for the future."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The great thing about Foundation is it's scope. It's a bit unsettling at times that you don't really get to know a character considerably well as the parts of the book break down over the span of several generations, but reading everything unfold and the implications that the events have in the long term is really fascinating.Asimov's writing is a mixed bag. It's imaginative and has a great vision. But at times the people seem too... squeaky-clean to be people. Every character seems unrealistically eloquent and proper and the dialogue doesn't fall too far from what I'd imagine Asmiov may say himself. There are few differences between the characters in regards to linguistic tendancies. Also, and I know the book was first published in the early 50's, but there are hardly any women even mentioned in Foundation and they certainly don't play significant or visible roles.It's still quite imaginative and quite good, in spite of these flaws. I understand Asimov was my age (21) when he began writing Foundation, so taking that in consideration it seems like an even more awesome literary feat."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire,\\" the second in a trilogy of classic science fiction novels by Isaac Asimov, is a must read for historians of science fiction. For those who like science fiction itself, this volume is also valuable. Asimov can madden, especially in his early novels, but his imagination is wonderful. His strength is conceptualizing systems (whether empires or cultures) and he often plays with big ideas.I first read the trilogy while in college, and was fascinated. This triggered a long-lasting interest in the fiction of Isaac Asimov (and some of his non-fiction works, as well).Those familiar with this trilogy know that the key character is psychohistorian Hari Seldon, who believes that one can predict the behavior of large masses of people via mathematical equations and, thus, predict how events will develop in the future.This book is a bridge between the novel \\"Foundation\\" and the third in the series, \\"Second Foundation.\\" And, of course, later in his career, Asimov returned to the Foundation well--with more interesting and literary results. Indeed, in one of the great tour de forces in science fiction, he ends up linking two classic series--the robot works and the Foundation series. But I'm getting way ahead of myself.This novel focuses on two instances--one, the rise of a youthful and talented military leader who goes after the Foundation. And, just as Hari Seldon's mathematical equations predicted, he failed. The logic for this is classic Asimov, and is why he was so entertaining to read, even though his characters have little life in these works and even though his writing style is, at best, functional in these works (he improved with time).Then, there is the case of the Mule, where Seldon's equations failed in prediction. And that itself is fascinating, as explained in this novel. Thus, the comparison of the correct prediction and the failed prediction add some real heft to Asimov's tale of the rise of the Foundation as the Empire slowly descends to its end.For those who have never read Asimov, the Foundation trilogy is a good place to get a sense of his talents, of seeing big pictures. His writing style is not great, but the images of this future that he developed are compelling. I still enjoy going back to the Foundation series, the Robot series, and their fusion as Asimov's vision evolved."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Any fan of science fiction needs to read this series.

After all the acclaim it received, I was expecting something truly exceptional. Instead, I got a historical narrative that is closer in style to something you would read in the Brittanica for a school assignment. It is really a kind of &quot;mutant&quot; between a novel and a documentary. What's more, it is exceptionally boring. What kept me going was the Asimov name on the cover and the hope of better things to come. This is not to say that it is a really bad book. I must confess that it has some interesting parts and of course, the series as a whole is an absolute classic. Every other novel in the Foundation series is so brilliant, that they cover for this disappointment. It must also be remembered that Asimov wrote this book in the early 50's when he was still a young and inexperienced writer"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is an awesome book, but if you're looking for battles and Star Wars style action, the sequels to this story have more. This novel spans the first 100 or so years of events that take place after the fall of a Galactic Empire. It's a very thin book and a quick read. Some terms such as \\"Gallopin' Galaxies\\" appear in the book, but be mindful of the times in which this book was written...and the intended audience.What is entertaining and interesting is how the characters solve Hari Seldon's predicted problems throughout the book. How cool would it be to have an entire planet of scientists (make that two)...a tiny portion of the galaxy that is pretty much responsible for running it. As a fantasy, it's as fun to dream of scientists in charge as it is to imagine winning the lottery. You might even glean tactics for handling dopey managers, or solving problems without going into combat. Asimov's wit and intrigue throughout make for an entertaining and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I like Foundation because it's a solid piece of sci-fi from olden days. (George Lucas's stealing of Asimov's city-planet for his Coruscant - tsk tsk, Georgie - amazed me most.) Foundation does have peculiarities. People hundreds of thousands of years in the future speak like us. They use phrases like us. They also have the same atomic technology as people did in the 1950s. Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland. As for A's style, I found his use of long adverbs rather funny. In sum, a good book if you can ignore this stuff."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This story is epic.

There's a clever premise to raise the stakes a bit; this society is the Foundation of a new Galactic Empire, created to close the gap of a fifty-millenia barbarity."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Iaasic Asimov is one of the best known Science-Fiction Writers, and for good reason. He wrote this award-winning book at the age of 21.

Asimov utilizes very realistic facts in a novel placed 15,000+ years in the future. In the year 1951 when the novel was written was just 5 years after the first computer showed its face. Yet Asimov utizlizes the common computer and calculator in many scenes in this novel.The use of nuclear power for showing superiority is also used often. This book was way ahead of its time.Anyone who enjoys science fiction or even one who just enjoys being entertained by realistic facts put into a story will enjoy this book. Foundation is also very suspenseful. Such as life-changing decisions to be made, assination attempts, spaceflight, and the exploration of new worlds in detail, the reader feels like he is in the mix of the action."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I was trying to find it a long time ago and in amazon it was so cheap.Good quality, fast shipping"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years.

I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money.

It won the Hugo award to prove it, spawned many sequels, and even a couple of prequels. I was excited to read this book, expecting it to live up to its many accolades.Boy, was I disappointed!The basic idea of this novel is fascinating: Hari Seldon foresees the demise of the galactic empire using the science of psychohistory. He puts a plan into motion to lessen the catastrophic effect of this collapse. Will it work?This is a good concept to work from, and I liked the plot. It's classic SF.What I did not like was the writing.Asimov relies too heavily on dialogue. It reads like a play. The only narration present serves as &quot;stage direction&quot; to indicate that someone moves, or smokes, or exits, or whatever. I was not able to imagine most of what was going on, as Asimov never adequately sets the scene for us. People simply talk back and forth. Everyone talks excatly alike, and none of the dialogue sounds natural. With little attributions (he said, she said, etc.), it's often hard to tell just who is talking, anyway. It's an extremely frustrating experience as a reader.The other problem with &quot;Foundation&quot; (perhaps, its central problem) is that it tries to cover too much in too short a period of time. This is unfortunate, because, again, the premise is so good. A story like this must cover a great period of time to achieve its goals, of course. We have to find out if Hari Seldon was on the right track. Asimov introduces a host of charcters, but none of them stick around. Consequently, there's no one in the entire book that you know or care about. This is a major failing. A great SF novel cannot be just a clever idea. The great books of the genre have great characters who help us to understand and appreciate the clever idea. Look at &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, or &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Each of these features great ideas and great characters.If this book were fleshed out a bit more with better descriptions and deeper characters who were actually given time to develop, I would like it much more. As it stands, it feels too thin -- it's the kernel of something really great.I recommend this only to die-hard SF fans who are getting back to the genre's roots, or those who value ideas over writing quality.I believe you must have both to be a true classic."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"A good solid beginning to a stunning series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Well, here goes. You mention that Foundation is dated. Of course it is, it's 60 years old! You'd be surprised at how badly dated some of the stuff being written today is in 60 years. You say a galactic empire can't be made with 'atomics'; you call it good old nuclear fission. Well, not all nuclear power is fission; there is also fusion, which was not a bad idea for space travel in 1941. Strike one. You also mention that Asimov writes in the old 60's detective style of writing. So this dated book is writing in a style popular 20 years in the future. Strike two. You ask if anyone edited the corny dialog; you call it tripe. Of course it was edited; it was made into the editors idea of what would sell in 1941! Remember science fiction wasn't taken seriously then; it was supposed to be rather childish. One need only read later Asimov work (something you admittedly haven't done) to see that he wrote for the market at the time. Books such as 'The Gods Themselves' even have (gasp) sex in them, something that would never have gotten past any editor at the time of Foundation. And guess what? It was written in 1972, a time when society as a whole was more tolerant and ready to accept such topics. 'The Gods Themselves' would have been banned as obscene in 1941. Strike three. To answer your query - Why in the name of antimatter would a galactic civilization be organized along the lines of a fuedal system as were the Middle Ages? - why not? Just because it isn't very popular nowadays on Earth doesn't mean it can't work elsewhere. Besides, the story is a retelling of the decline of Rome - shouldn't there be obvious parallels? Strike four. You mention that the plot doesn't go anywhere. How would you know? You've only read one book. Asimov does a brilliant job of reconciling the original trilogy with the robot novels - especially considering he began the fourth novel 40 years after the original trilogy was written. At a minimum, to really understand the story you would have to read at least the next two books. Strike five. You say the book is pointless. Well, ask yourself this. If that were true, would it have near-unanimous rave reviews? Are you one of a select few that have been able to see the book for what it truly is - a piece of junk? No, the reality is that the state of science fiction in 2001 is that it is generally read by intelligent people - thoughtful, well-read and informed. The wool hasn't been pulled over their eyes, it has been pulled over yours. Strike six. And you misspelled premises and neutrino - Strike seven.

This Armageddon is foreseen into 3,000 years of barbaric emptiness. Dr. Seldon comes up with an idea that a group of psycho historians will need to work together with Seldon so that they can compose an Encyclopedia of the Galaxy's history to prevent about 2,000 years of political unrest. A Foundation is created. This Foundation represents the community of these historians to produce enough updated volumes of this Encyclopedia every 50 years so that the rivalry that will occur between the time Seldon dies and this Galaxy destruction occurs, it's ready to be of service to those struggling in the future. I found that the most interesting piece of this whole story is that as the struggles get stronger between the Foundation's cycle leaders and the surrounding planet's \\"prefects,\\" the leaders of the Foundation start to create this religion amongst the science involved with the Encyclopedia. These religious \\"high priests\\" become the power and influence amongst these interplanetary societies. It's so great to see how the higher power called the Galactic Spirit is slowly becoming a widespread belief amongst the psychohistorians and their counter parts.I keep thinking about the impact of these thoughts and ideas on our own society and how similar some of these reactions would be. I see a lot of conflict between our country, the United States, and Middle Eastern countries where we are planting ourselves on other's territory so that we can suck from their few and far between plentiful resources that are of high value to us, so we make these deals that are appealing to 2nd and 3rd class countries and once that is started we ultimatley have all of this say over what that country is up to. I feel like Foundation shows how this peaceful and well- intentioned planet is working to create righteous things and there are these outside planets wanting control over how they are going about this and need some sort of power over a smaller community in a self-serving way. The character development is my favorite part of the book because of the different personalities that Asimov creates to work out the story line of the book. The different leaders are these very he-men type characters that are young and self-righteous, working towards the destruction or protection of their homeland.Clashing righteoussness is all over this book and I think that it definaltey symbolizes some of the conflict that exists in our own country today. I did not however feel like Asmiov gave women any role at all. I can't think of one woman that played ANY major role in this book, and when there was a mention of a woman she was nothing but a secretary or a mediator of some sort. I felt like there were just too many hormones flying around this book and I kind of wonder what this says about Isaac Asimov and his life. A great writer but maybe needs a love life? All around this was a great book and I recommend to all of you die hard SF fans!!!

It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly).

It's important that it doens't and makes a good point.The Mule however is where the meat is as others have stipulated. He's a monkey wrench in the whole plan Hari Seldon put together to save humanity during the 'Dark Ages' after the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Well written and a definite must for any who claim to love sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read Foundation as a bored teen, with no idea what it was about. Foundation is a book which demands to be read quickly, and thus the impression, amidst the brilliant storyline, is often shallow.I read it this time in a couple of hours; I would've read it quicker without work and cafes and other impediments, but basically I devoured it. And because it read so fast, the impressions of the individual stories flickered past too.The sense of history as pattern is stronger in this book than any single narrative. Having read the brilliant new Foundation trilogy, written by the three Bs (Brin, Benson, and Bear) which tells the personal life story of Hari Seldon, the very brief treatment of Seldon in the first trilogy is more notable for what is unsaid. Hari is just another name in history for Asimov; the hero is the idea, even the fast-flow of the narrative of itself might be called the Hero, because the whole notion of story here is webbed against historical patterns so closely.Briefly, then, Foundation has the setup and three payoffs. The setup is Hari Seldon arranging exile to Terminus.Salvor Hardin's politicization of Terminus is the first payoff, and is especially brilliantly written.Smyrnian Trader Limmar Ponyet's chicanery on planet Askone's closed market demonstrates the limits of religion and is the second payoff.Then Hober Mallow's power grab and abandonment of religion for trade as a means for influence in the third.The story starts and ends with court cases, first against Hari Seldon and last against Hober Mallow. The ideology of the book is anti-violence and pro social and economic measures. In fact it may be the first really positive exploration of what has come to be called \\"soft power\\", of which the European Union is the present example.The great touches of image serve to cast a deeper shadow on the role of public morality in sustaining a civilisation. For instance, the ambassador from Anacreon presents the hilt of his gun as a symbol of peaceful intentions when he visits Salvor Hardin on Terminus.In the context of history the book is extraordinarily complex and sophisticated. Social and economic complexity is reduced and strained free of dense matter and difficulty, like consomme soup, made to be thin yet delicious and easily consumed. The very first thought I had at the end of reading Foundation was \\"how I wish there were a history of Rome so readable and fast and easy to consume!\\"Normally I read Foundation in a great hurry (as I have this time) in combination with the other two books, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. But I only have a copy of the first book of the trilogy and must make do with it.The first payoff is quite brilliant, because it is delayed and played out indirectly, thus deflecting the thrill of emotional rush into intellectual wonder. Specifically, Salvon Hardin delays the confrontation between Terminus and Anacreon for thirty years, years which Asimov summarizes in a bitter and brilliant battle of words between the old Hardin and young Sek Sermak. Thus the reader feels that the payoff is deferred. The reader senses an even bigger payoff at the far end of the section, \\"Mayors\\". And Asimov does not fail us. For Salvor Hardin travels to Anacreon to personally entrap the evil regent there and defeat him - again, inevitably, with soft power. Hardin defeats his enemy on the enemy's territory, at the precise moment when it seems all is lost for the Foundation.One is left with the distinct impression that brains defeat brawn, skilled inaction and insight defeat busyness and boldness, and that the power of wisdom and foresight overcomes even a social collapse on the scale of the fall of the Roman Empire - as indeed they did. For the Fall of Rome resulted in the rise of Christendom, and with it a grand tradition - so Asimov's message, by locating a historical European lesson in the distant future - becomes a timeless affirmation of human excellence.Foundation thus stands virtually alone in the field of science fiction novels in excellence."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Clear intelligent prose marks this as well as Asimov's other books. The fact that there is hardly any action in this trilogy, and yet it is still fun to read, shows you how good Asimov is at writing just \\"intellectual\\" fiction.But the truth be told, Foundation is not \\"the greatest sci-fi series of all time.\\" Sure, it won the Hugo that said just that. But that was only about fifteen years after the trilogy was published, and, remember, only fifteen years after the Hugo Award was instituted. Fifteen years isn't long enough to be making grandiose all-time statements like that.After Foundation, Asimov was to grow as a writer. He said so himself. He admits its faults: lack of a strong cohesive story; weak characterization; hardly any females. It is also now extremely dated. You can just \\"feel\\" that it was written circa 1950.The books aren't even novels, but a collection of stories. That's how it was executed; he never set out to write a trilogy. It is not as complex as you'd think the \\"greatest\\" should be. It lacks a certain depth. Just look at Dune: how Herbert portrayed the religious mind, how religion and commerce and politics all affected one another. On the other hand, Asimov never really understood the religious. So in the Foundation trilogy, priests are like frightened children, driven only by superstition.It may be a classic, but it is not a timeless classic. Yes, Foundation is definitely not his best series. Try the Robot novels."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"You've already read the publisher's summary for yourself, so let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one, \\"Foundation,\\" creates the future world, its declining culture, and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two, Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule, and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain, books that offer good mysteries, and books that make you think about bigger things in life, than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov is a must read for any science fiction reader. Even though the writing style leaves something to be desired, the pure imagination of his writing is something memorable. It's hard to imagine Star Wars or any other sci-fi without this book. Asimov barrels through time and the universe passing through hundreds of years in the turn of a page in a way that is rich and convincing. He builds many worlds, characters, and ties it all together through Hari Seldon and his psychohistory (a previously worked out map of human reactions, and thus events, for generations to come) and the Mule (a mutant who throws a wrench in the plan and--like most bad guys, or in this case mutants--seeks world domination). What's incredible about this villian is his strange depth which the reader gets completely secondhand. The book goes on and on with one beautiful idea after another. For example, a strange jester/clown character, Magnifico, that the heroes--Bayta and Torie--pick up plays an instrument called the sono-visor. This instrument harnasses the alpha waves of the brain and mixes melody with image in each listener. Now how's that for cool? Asimov wows the reader again and again with clearly explained inventive ideas. This book is the first of a trilogy. A must read for anyone with an interest in literature or science-fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is timeless. Asimov is the master.

Yeah, sure, it's dated...it was written in the forties, it's going to be dated, but that doesn't lower the quality of the story.Now that that's out of the way: this book is great. Asimov is unbelievably smart, and Foundation shows it. The story to Foundation is interesting: the Galactic Empire is crumbling and its demise will turn the entire galaxy to barbarism for thirty thousand years, if steps arn't taken to lighten the blow. That's where the Foundation comes in. Through a series of crises, the Foundation should be able to shorten the length of time of barbarism from thirty thousand years to only a thousand.Foundation just covers the first few crises, so the book skips forward in time. This causes the trouble with the character development that everyone complains about. When a character is given only a few chapters to develop in, they won't really develop.Asimov really is the master of science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Ive been a long time sci-fi/fantasy fan. However, it has taken me many years to finally pick up a book Ive heard so much about. Through the first half of the book, it felt like the average sci-fi novel. However, as I neared the end, I found myself enjoying it. Asimov included some witty political resolutions to the puzzles and 'Seldon crisis' throughout the book. I kept wanting more of these carefully crafted shorts and was very entertained towards the end.Asimov could have executed the story a little better so that the timeline didn't skip fifty years after every short. The lasting effect of this piece is somewhat diminished by this fact. Also the repetition of plot will keep me from reading any more of the series. I think it is the tragic flaw in Asimov, too much of a good thing. He has books published about everything it seems. Search for 'Asimov' and you will see what I mean.Overall it was a good book and I highly recommend it. It was an enjoyment to pass the time with."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Being a science fiction fan for some years, I picked up a copy of Foundation after hearing wonderful things about this series and loving I, Robot. On the whole, I think I, Robot is a better read, largely because I got to know and empathize with the characters in that set of stories more, which is my main criticism of this book.Nevertheless, Foundation is still very worthwhile, and while I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone, there are certain friends who I think would love it - it's for a select audience who loves science fiction and/or Isaac Asimov. I am going to continue on with the series - and we'll see how it goes!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book was recommended to me for a writing exercise, and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it as much as I learned from it. I had lumped Asimov in with Clarke as a boring SF writer, and I was quite wrong. This book also works amazing magic with the passage of time and circumstance, and despite how quickly characters drop out of the landscape of the novel, the reader remains interested. A masterful work from one of the great masters.If you don't know much about SF, this is a good book for you; if you are a SF fan who thinks Asimov has nothing to offer you, this is a great book for you. Pick it up."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"People like to throw five star reviews at just about anything. I suppose they feel that almost everything written is as good as it gets. Foundation is one that deserves all five stars.It's a classic. The premise is intriguing. The story unwinds brilliantly over three books. Don't expect to read The Foundation alone. It does leave you hanging. The next two books in the trilogy are a must.This is one of a handful of solid, enduring works that will be enjoyed long after other works fade off the lists..."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Ah Foundation, this is perhaps one of the best and highly original works of Dr. Asimov. I was impressed that a man of only 20 could come up with such a creative vision of the future, it was not only the very distant future but one aside from most of the common stereotypes. This books plot line was excellent, he sounded like he really knew what he wanted from the get go, and not make it up as he went along. If i had to change a thing, it would be; i would like to see some of these characters come to a complete close, I'm not saying that i would like to put a stop to the big gaps through time, but make the characters have a little more closure.I think that you will get a lot out of this book as far as understanding plain human nature, it shows that no matter how far you go into the future there are some human characteristics that will never go away such as faith and greed. Foundation really opens a door for science fiction, especially in the two books remaing in the trilogy, you should definatly read those, as for the other four, that is your choice, i would read the reviews before reading them.As for Foundation, it is an excellent book, the characters are as defined as well as can be for the time alotted for them to portray the story. This is a must read epic that spans almost a thousand years (if you read the whole series) ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation. Arguably the greatest creation of science fiction to date, from the most prolific writer of the genre. Isaac Asimov's tour de force first graced the pages of the May edition of Astounding Science Fiction in 1942. By the time the last instalment of the saga was finished in 1992, (only a matter of weeks prior to Asimov's death), the story had gone full circle so that you finished almost where you had set off from. We are initially told of The Seldon Plan; A one thousand year strategy mathematically and statistically conceived by Hari Seldon, to potentially minimise the eventual downfall of the once almost omnipotent, but now crumbling Galactic Empire. Seldon's Plan is for a group of specially chosen settlers to emigrate to Terminus, an uninhabited planet in a remote corner of the galaxy, from where they will create the Encyclopedia Galactica, a definitive omnibus of information necessary to aide a new and even stronger Empire rise long after the anarchy of it's predecessors demise.Throughout five of the seven Foundation books Asimov wrote, the reader witnesses the unfolding of The Seldon Plan, and how the original settlers of Terminus evolve over the centuries, as the work of the long dead Seldon comes to fruition. The two 'prelude' books in the series tell of Seldon's life, and his initial realisation as a young man, the gravity of what must be done to save the people far into the future, while simultaneously trying to instigate his master plan.Upon reading the end of the last of the books in a chronological sense (Foundation & Earth), the reader is gifted with the biggest jaw-dropping, mother of all twists in the story, which turns almost all of what you have read in the previous books upside down. Read Foundation, and guaranteed you'll read the other six books all in immediate succession."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I am not a science fiction fan without being a fan of the big idea, but in the Foundation Asimov introduced galaxy-wide empires and a plausible new science. There's no new compelling themes in this book. Without that quality, you are left to Asimov's weaknesses: one-dimensional characters and stark writing style, but hey - its still Asimov and his stuff is always fun to read.Like the last book, this is a hodgepodge of short stories Asimov wrote separately. The first half of the book is about a rising general who fights against The Plan but gets swatted down because he can't fight the mathematical forces of psychohistory. The next part is the fun part. One factor was not counted for in his equation: a mutant who knocks The Plan off kilter. To some the identity of the Mule will be laughably obvious. Personally, I was uncertain whether I was on the right track or not.It reads like a mystery novel , though dry in style and severely lacking in the human quotient. Nonetheless, it is a continuing tale of the rise and fall of future civilizations, telepathic mutants, and psychohistory. This is THE classic sci-fi trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In this sequel to \\"Foundation,\\" Asimov continues to channel Edward Gibbon, charting the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire and the subsequent rebirth, like a phoenix from the ashes, of a new and improved federation.On its own, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" suffers from an acute case of Middle Chapter Syndrome--and this is somewhat surprising since Asimov originally published his trilogy as a series of nine novellas. The reader who isn't familiar with the first \\"Foundation,\\" with its extended prologue and four installments, will be at a loss. In the previous book, each chapter details a different interplanetary chess match between (on the one hand) the long-dead \\"psychohistorian\\" Hari Seldon, who had predicted the empire's demise and who initiated events that will accelerate the rise of a second empire, and (on the other) various individuals who struggle in vain to change the course of that inexorable future.\\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule,\\" the two episodes in this volume, will surprise the reader by departing from the pattern in the previous book. The first and shorter story is the lesser of the two; all the \\"action\\" occurs offstage, and the protagonists wait in suspense for a catastrophe that never really materializes. It's a bit of a letdown, but Asimov presents this incident to make a point: those who think they know when and where historical crises will next occur might miss out entirely on the real predicament at hand.The meat of the book will be found in \\"The Mule,\\" which is presented as a mystery of sorts (although I find it difficult to imagine the reader who won't discern the Mule's \\"secret\\" well before its unveiling). More successfully, this novella is an extended chase scene--it would make a great space adventure movie--in which the Mule's minions pursue our heroes through the far reaches of the universe. The unexpected appearance of a mutant species, represented by the Mule, throws into chaos Seldon's psychohistorical calculations--or does it?Asimov's prose style has always been a bane to language mavens, and the experimental qualities of \\"Foundation and Empire\\" serve to spotlight many of his most pervasive faults. Even by the loose standards of pulp fiction, these two stories suffer from more than their fair share of tautologies, pleonasms, comma splices, sentence fragments, and worse. (No chapter should open with a sentence like either of the following: \\"There was reason to the fact that the element known as 'pure science' was the freest form of life on the Foundation.\\" \\"The blockade was run successfully.\\")But Asimov's fans--myself included--don't turn to his novels for their literary qualities. Instead, we enjoy his ability to present a complicated story and tie up all the loose ends, to weave politics and philosophy and science into his fiction, and to make us think."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have heard so much about this book over the years but didn't like Asimov's writing so I never read it. Well, I thought maybe this was different but no, it's the same poor writing. I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew, glad I got this out of the way."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the first of three books in the original Foundation trilogy. It's a wonderful exploration of what might be if psychology, sociology and statistics could be melded together to predict the future with a high degree of reliability. I found it fascinating as a spiritual analogy, even if that was unintended by Azimov. Read it through the lens of Hari Seldon as a god-type, perhaps you'll find the same interesting subtext that I did."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Great classic Sci Fi. Loved it. It was fun to notice some of the technology that is already outdated, like microfiche and televisions, how nuclear power was so important, but this didn't affect my interest or enjoyment in the novel."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I put Asmimov's Foundation series among the finest science fiction ever written. Up there with Lord of the Rings. His brillance is amazing and he takes you into a world of the future that makes sense."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a reread for me (I read it way back when I was in high school), and to be honest, I can't decide if I liked it more then or if I liked it more now. Which probably means that I felt the same way about it both times.Which is that it is a well-written, intriguing work of thoughtful science fiction.When it comes down to it, Foundation is the type of science fiction that I SHOULD love. It takes place in a believable, scary future, Earth isn't remembered or maybe doesn't even exist, the entire galaxy is populated, and there are lots of cool future gadgets. More than that, it is filled with intelligent people who have to think in interesting, convoluted ways to make the things that happen happen. It even starts off with a mathematician - brilliance!And that is why I DID love this book - I loved trying to figure out how the people were going to think or how they were thinking and what conclusions this would lead them to. It was like a mystery, but one in which you just have to unravel intelligence. The narrative flows beautifully, and the plot is just complex enough to keep you exited and thinking without feeling like Asimov was trying too hard.When it comes down to it, Foundation really is the perfect science fiction novel, and it's no wonder that it won the Hugo and was named \\"Best Science Fiction Series of All Time.\\"But (you knew there was a but coming), I'm not the hugest fan of short stories, and Foundation is, essentially, a series of short stories. Granted, the short stories are so well-linked that you sometimes forget, but when it comes down to it, each chapter is a new story. In each chapter, at least 50 years have passed since the last one, entirely new characters are introduced, and the old ones, for the most part, are rarely mentioned again. The thing linking them is Harri Seldon and the Foundation that he created. It is because of this that, even though I loved it, I can't say that I LOVED it.Still, Foundation is one tight piece of work, and I would recommend it to any and all lovers of science fiction. I mean, when it comes to science fiction, this is it! And I know I'll be rereading the others in the series as well!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I've come to start with four stars as I note that no book is perfect; considering this is just a story, it can't be perfect. My giving a book much less this one four stars is no knock on it.Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clark are considered the beginning of 'hard' sci-fi. It's not strictly true as there were guys like H.G. Wells Jules Verne and might I add Johannas Kepler? There's also the Frankenstein story. A point I want to make here is that it seems that nobody has been able to follow in their footsteps! Why? They didn't necessarily mean to just be scientificaly accurate. Their message was scientific humanism. It's the philosophy of being scientific that is portrayed in their books and not just robots and spaceships.Something else that needs to be pointed out is the difference between Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. Some would suggest that Arthur C. Clark was more technically sophisticated than Isaac Asimov. Was Arthur C. Clark really all that technically sophisticated in his books? He had guys shooting through a vacuum to get to an A.I. computer gone haywire! Isaac Asimov has faster than light travel by means of space folding in his foundation books(a prediction that may not be so far off . . . in either technical accuracy or time; meaning it could happen sooner than you think!); he has mind reading; we have the ability to plus computers into brains and read what they're thinking and saying now; it's not mass produced(yet); but, it's there. I for one only liked Isaac's first volume of his foundation books because he has this mind-reading which I didn't like; well, what do I know?What seems to continue to set Isaac Asimov's Foundation appart is that of a galactic empire and how it dies(human neglect of rationalism). It should be noted that Isaac managed to connect his foundation books with his empire and robot books; so, he shows how intelligence really grows to dominate a galaxy, and then shows social ways that it can crumble(inspired by the fall of the roman empire).Despite Isaac's reliance on nuclear power as the high technology of the day, his foundation books symbolizes the real issues facing humanity and not what you get on the news channels(actual politics channels; they just call them news channels); they seem to argue for the same things each election year but never solve the same problems! Meanwhile, the science world keeps on chugging(word?lol!) along."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"one would be hard pressed to find better sci-fi in the last 60 years than the foundation novels. what amazing insight these books had."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I like science fiction in a generalized idea, but sometimes in particular it doesn't work. I think this is mainly because I see two kinds of science fiction. One is what are essentially westerns in space. The second tries to give perspective on the current times by creating some sort of objective viewpoint on current events by giving it distance in space or time. Asimov is more of the second one. I haven't read much of his work as an adult, but I did like his short stories as a child in magazines. Genre stories, until lately, haven't had any pull in the academy so they don't get studied or legitimized scholastically. I like this second kind much better.I like this book, the first of a trilogy and the foundation for several others (pun intended). Asimov explores our relation to information and the predictability of the future based on full information awareness. I will read more of these books, perhaps the whole series because I enjoyed and was tantalized by the possibilities of action in the future of the series. However, one interesting thing is that although Asimov was looking to the future, he was still a product of his time. When he was writing, the technology was nuclear and the future was nuclear. Thus, the future Empire is ruled by nuclear technology. Compare, for example, the cyber-punk fascination with computer technology as a driving force. Computers are almost absent from the world of the Empire and the Foundation. Instead, there are still newspapers (96) and messages are transferred physically. At the very least, if you take this as a futurological document, humanity abandoned mythological superstition. So - you have to read this book as both a look into the future and a historical document. Asimov is a fantastic writer, but he couldn't overcome the limitations of his time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Parts of the book I really enjoyed. I appreciate the twists played by characters on one another. I felt that after reading through the entire bit, though, that not enough had actually taken place. I didn't feel I walked away with a story I could remember. I did read in one review that this was \\"serious science fiction,\\" so with that in mind, I still give it five stars. I only would have liked that the pace be quicker.I really really enjoyedThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I would recommend that over this book Foundation, based on my personal taste."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation series is one of the most renowned arcs in all of science fiction. Spanning several volumes, and thousands of years of time, Asimov provides us with a blueprint for our own decadent, ailing society--a prevention, if you will, against the society of the 21st century, as realized later by men like Stephen Baxter inTitan.In the billion-star inclusive Galactic government, Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician, devised a way to accurately plot the future by analyzing past events, trends, and movements in human history. Branded a madman, he and his followers are given a kind of half-exile, half-grant to the planet Terminus, to found their Foundation, which, it seems, is to be a focal point of knowledge for Seldon's predicted coming galactic catastrophe.But is that all the Foundation is? A glorified university?Asimov is the herald of a new age, filled with robots, spacetravel and weird technologies beyond our understanding, and sometimes, even our imagination. A thinker, philosopher, and theologian, Asimov's books are chock-full of singular personality and wit.I recommend Foundation as necessary-reading to any fan of science-fiction who has somehow escaped it thus far. You will NOT be unimpressed."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I never imagined it would have been so political. I also never imagined I'd enjoy a political story so much. The characters are brilliant and well written. I was concerned for them despite how quickly Asimov moved on to the next group. It's more realistic this way than to have just one protagonist that you know will make it to the end of the book. This story take place over a long period of time, though it provides for a surprisingly quick read. A good balance of action and brain stimuli. (Not for adrenaline junkies.)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the only book I have ever read twice. The second time around, I was shocked to realize that not much ever happens. There is something about this series that makes it one of the best I have ever read but I am not sure what it is."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Having always been a big Asimov fan, (after readingmany of hisshort stories, along with some of the Robot series) I was very excited to start reading the Foundation series. The Foundation series describes a world in which humans live on planets throughout the galaxy. In this world, the 12,000-year old Empire is in decline, and Hari Seldon has established a Foundation in the corner of the galaxy in order to reconquer and rebuild a new empire after the current one dies -- he estimates the intermediary period of barbarism can be reduced from 30,000 years to only 1,000.Going into the first book of the series, I have to say I had high expectations, but this book managed to exceed them. Many people complain about the character development in these novels, but while each of the five stories introduced new characters, I still found each set of characters to be interesting in very important ways. Throughout these stories, the question of individuality is touched on: are these characters merely following Seldon's plan with no ability to shape events, or are our heroes shaping their futures through their decisions? I have only read Foundation so far, but I expect this theme to continue in the other novels.Also, I have to say that Foundation is very easy to read, entertaining, and I would recommend it without question, even to someone who had never read Asimov, and also to someone who had no interest in the Foundation series. Though, anyone who finishes Foundation will likely want to proceed to the other novels in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you haven't read this or the other two books in the original trilogy, you're in for a treat. This series is almost 50 years old but still among the best SF stories ever"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Throughout the past 12,000 years, the Galactic Empire has been expanding from Trantor, its capital planet, throughout the galaxy. How humans found Trantor, or where Earth is (and other questions about Earth), are currently unanswerable. All that is known is that this empire, which controls billions of worlds, is in a permanent social and political recession -- in other words, it is dying. Hari Seldon, reknowned psychohistorian (AKA scientist who predicts future trends) has predicted that 30,000 years will pass before a second Galactic Empire will rise. To shorten the dark age to 1,000 years, he has created a Foundation - a group of people dedicated to preserving knowledge - on the edge of the galaxy in the hope that they will share their knowledge after the fall of the Galactic Empire and create a new, and greater, Galactic Empire. Foundation is divided into four stories, which go through history from Seldon's project through the ascent of the Foundation. Taking concepts from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Foundation is an extraordinary book and is strongly recommended to all readers of science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In a word, story. That's what this is book is meant, story. As a best-class story-teller, Asimov, leads the reader into an intrincated, labyrhynthical STORY, where mathematics play a role as important as human emotions, meanwhile, both are interlaced so closely and deeply, that psicohistory raises up to capitalize human knowledge in &quot;favour&quot; of the final survival of the galactic culture.Despite the general opinion of classical criticism , that Asimov was not quite a good SF writer, but a fantasy one with no base to be considered in the universe of &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi, I should say that it's a long way walk between writing and simply reading a book, and this may not be the most-spectacular guide to science and techno-details, but it's in a way (a very particular one) the best ever writen"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Many of the ideas and terminology is very old time, and retro.

The story of the last years of the Trantor Empire helped me understand a lot about our society. Even though I read it in College I still have Harry Seldon name stock in my mind. Isaac uses this story to present his theories on how science and religion influence our society. It is a marvelous saga of a loooong story of a new Empire (USA?) build after the fall of an old one (Britain?). More or less this will be a very entertaining textbook on social science of history. A must for a serious SCFI reader."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The fall of the Galactic Empire having been foreseen by the great Hari Seldon through his Psychohistory, a colony, of sorts, of scholars was established on a planet far from the center of the Empire.This Foundation, as the colony is referred, is intended to limit the chaos sure to follow from the Empire's eventual fall. Proceeding the fall, various small dominions erupt, and for a time the Foundation treads water as a neutral entity, but things soon come to a head, and action must be taken. Unfortunately, scholars are not the best equipped to handle such situations.From the outcome of these events, the political structure of the Foundation is altered, and from there again does a conflict occur. As there was such a concentration of intellectual beings in the Foundation, there was no decline in technology as in the rest of the former Empire. And so might superior technology aid in the well-being of the Foundation, as well as its regard from neighbors.This book is actually several separate stories, taking place at different times in the early history of the Foundation, as the citizens try to fulfill the goal of Hari Seldon, now long dead, but nonetheless still influential. These stories are very well written, and obviously had a great deal of thought put into them as to how the collapse and restoration of such an entity might proceed. If you like REAL science fiction, I highly recommend this book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation series is the best ever. True, it is set in the future but you don't have to like sci-fi at all to appreciate the true brilliance of Isaac Asimov. The Foundation is a short book. Give it a try. I'll be surprised if you don't immediately pick up the next in the series when you are done!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Two stories in one, this book is an excellent follow up to Foundation, and a dramatization of the strength of mind over muscle.First the Foundation is threateded by the Galactic Empire. While I disagree with the unimportance of the individual (after all, wasn't Hari Seldon himself one person who changed history), it does show the travails as a small group of Foundationers try to stop the General, when he is stopped by the very corrupt bureaucracy he serves.In the second, he brings in a new factor. The Foundation, secure and dominant but not agressive, is threatened by the Mule, a person who can control the emotions of others, reshape them into whatever he wants. Part of a slightly more fantastic area of Science Fiction, he still pulls it off well. This time it does come down to individual effort again to stop the Mule, by opponents who could not defeat him one on one but do so by their determination and individual organization.This time, he did not labor under the false assumption that he had to write a limited number of pages, so he was able to flesh out the characters more and make the plot twists more intricate, and did a truly excellent work."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"First I will detail the faults of this book. It is too brief. Mr. Asimov was working under the assumption that he had to keep it under a certain length, and so abbreviated it unfairly, cutting certain amounts of plot and character development.That aside, this book is excellent, showing the struggle against adversity and brains versus brute force that is so lacking in most modern literature. It is true that Science Fiction is the Modern version of Romantic (the time period) literature, and Asimov carried the beacon."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I was so disappointed in the first book, Foundation, I gave it two stars. I've been wanting to read the trilogy for years and I couldn't believe that that mediocre pulp was it! But Foundation and Empire is the saving grace. I look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the second Foundation Novel I have read in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This book really brings into light the tone of the series and where it can go. Honestly Asimov is a genius. :)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!When I wrote the review for the first book in this series my review was number 336, this time I'm number 90, which probably means that most reviewers said what they had to say about the trilogy in their review of the first book. This is ironic considering this second book is where the real fun begins.I'm assuming here that you read Foundation, I'm HOPING you even liked it. If you did then you will probably notice that there are only two stories in this book as opposed to the five in the previous one. Don't let the lack of quantity bother you though, These stories are longer for the simple reason that they need to be.For me personally, there was always something that bothered me about the premise of this series. Simply put, I didn't like the fact that humanity is reduced to mathematics. That's TOO simple though, because I happen to think that if you try hard enough, you CAN reduce (or perhaps distill is a better word) humankind down to mathematics, but the Seldon plan makes no allowance for the individual.At least, that's what I thought after reading Foundation. As it turns out, these two stories deal with just that theme. Not only that, but they seem to state opposite views on the subject.The first part of the book finds the Foundation taking on the remains of the Great Galactic Empire. The heroes of this part are, as usual, simply the mouthpieces for the various viewpoints and have little personality of their own. They run about and try to save the Foundation with some daring do (but it's Asimov so the said daring do mostly involves people arguing with each other about stuff) while the Foundation calmly trounces the Empire and renders their whole storyline moot.Here, the group wins out while the individual is rendered completely impotent while the group kicks butt. So, group 1, individual 0Then comes the second (and significantly longer) story: The Mule. The Mule is notable for having the first attempt at creating characters that are in any way interesting. For the most part I personally don't think he succeeds, but as I said in my review for the first book, I don't read Foundation for that reason so there's no great loss there.The Mule is a psychic who comes out of nowhere and crushes the Seldon Plan to dust! Since the plan cannot take individuals into account, a weird mutant can do more damage than the old Empire could do. Here, the individual rules and the mighty Foundation is brought to its knees.So, group 1, individual 1. We'll have to wait for the next book to see who comes out on top.As much as I love this classic work, the ideas behind it seem muddled and somewhat contradictory. I would imagine this came from the fact that these were written as discrete short stories and not as a cohesive whole.Despite these criticisms however, this is still very readable if you liked the first book and I'm sure you can find some criticisms of your own in here. Also, keep in mind that there is another Foundation out there... \\"At Star's End\\"So let's head there shall we?"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second book in the Foundation series continues the narrative of the first; it chronicles the defeat of the decaying Galactic Empire by the Foundation, and its subsequent defeat by the mutant intelligence that is the Mule. Asimov's books are an almost perfect blend of suspense, action, dialogue, character-building, world-building, narrative, and plot. He knows how to keep the pages turning. Even the less interesting half of the book (the first-half) is still enjoyable - it's just that the second part is so much more interesting; the twist at the end is especially something to be savored. Like all his books, the joy comes from not just the narrative itself, but the situations that Asimov places his characters in, and how they ingeniously improvise solutions to their dilemmas. The Foundation series is, irrefutably, classic science fiction, and it makes one wonder why Hollywood hasn't taken these literary gems and processed them into something less fine and lacking luster.One minor grievance; some phrases seem to reappear in multiple books of the series. Asimov seems particularly fond of the adjective \\"sardonically\\" - but this can scarcely be deemed a flaw, just something that one might notice."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second book in the original trilogy, and the fourth book overall, Foundation and Empire is the great sequel to Foundation. It's really two different stories set many years apart.The first story covers the empires attempt to conquer the First Foundation led by its last great general. The second covers the mutant known as the Mule and his attempt to conquer the entire galaxy. The mysterious Second Foundation comes into play for the first time at the end of this book.Like its predecessor, at only 320 pages it makes a quick and interesting read. As one of the few sequels I've ever read which isn't a let down from the book it follows, I highly recommend it as well as the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov has crafted a sci-fi masterpiece in this novel. It is this novel that takes the Foundation series to a new level of brilliance. While the original novel is strong, this book is stronger. One advanatage of this book over its predecessor is that it is a single story as opposed to a series of novellas. This yields greater investment in the characters as they develop throughout the book. Asimov displays here all the attributes that have earned him monolithic status among sci-fi writers--unforgettable characters, ahead-of-his-time technology, and an entrancing plot with endless twists and turns. Essential reading for sci-fi fans."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Great book! Second in the series of three novels, all three are worth the read. I read all three in about two and half weeks. It might be interesting to read them in conjunction with Kuhn's Structures of Scientific Revolutions. Every \\"Seldon Crisis\\" brings about a \\"new world\\". Really fun stuff. Don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read the foundation triology in high school in the early 60's.Nearly 50 years later, reading it again was almost like reading forthe first time. Asimov added two more books later, but the first threeare the real classics here. The concept of psychohistory may be as importantas the novels are good. I haven't seen any movies made from thesestories, but it seems like they deserve that.Before there was ever an x-man there was the mule;that chance of genetic nature of a psi mutant who could change mens mindsas he pleased. The plan couldn't account for this, but the second foundationwas never found by the mule. I recognized in the mule a manvery like the French Napoleon who could take advantage ofthe weaknesses of others. In later life Asimov became verymuch 'hard science' orientated so that these early space operatype novels were actually rationalized into an artificial unified time linethat really does a disservice to their original intension in my view.I still like this book with age!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you consider Star Wars as George Lucas's answer to Asmiov's \\"Foundation\\" then this is very much in the mode of Episode V. Asimov spent the first book building up his psychohistory paradigm just to knock it down in Foundation and Empire. A much darker and more intense book, downbeat in mood, and leading to the inevitable conclusion in Second Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is certainly an excellent \\"first\\" book in the Asimov series. Even if one has not read, Prelude to Foundation, you can pick up right up and enjoy the series. Sets the stage for the next books in the series, but also makes one think, \\"What would happen if America lost its power sources?\\""},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It's taken me quite a while to get around to reading this one, and I hesitate to review the first book of a trilogy when I haven't completed all 3 books, but I figured I'd better get this one in while I can, as it may take me another 10 years to finish the series.I'm surprised that it took me this long to finally read &quot;Foundation&quot; by Isaac Asimov, but I can say that I'm glad I did. Actually, I didn't have high hopes going into it, as I am not a big fan of Asimov's writing. While his technical approach is always entertaining, he tends to become very stilted and ham-fisted when it comes to characterization. It was this quality that turned me off of &quot;I Robot&quot; and almost got me to give him up completely; however, seeing as the Foundation trilogy is regarded as a classic of the genre, I had to give it a shot.As everyone has said over and over (and I'll do it, too), the Foundation trilogy is a futuristic parallel of the fall of the Roman Empire and the following Dark Ages. Hari Seldon, father of Psychohistory, sees the writing on the wall and establishes the Foundation in order to buffer the fall of civilization and technology. The first book of the series, &quot;Foundation&quot;, does a good job of setting the stage for what is to come. The book is told in 5 parts, each one focusing on a different character or time period in the early history of the Galactic Empire's fall. Surprising to me, Asimov actually does a fairly good job with his characterization. There's very little melodrama, and the story is evenly paced, holding up pretty well for a tale begun in 1941. The only complaints I have with the story are that the main characters always seem to be overly confident in themselves, as if they are holding all the cards and can easily handle any adversity while blindfolded (presenting a tense situation fails if the protagonist has no concern or doubt for how things will be resolved). Also, as the different parts of the story skip a hundred years here, 30 years there, etc., it may take some imagination on the reader's part to develop a &quot;big picture&quot; of what the Empire is really going through. These are minor issues, however, and should not detract from enjoying the book.One last observation - I have noticed that Hari Seldon appears to be getting younger with each new printing of this book. My copy of &quot;Foundation&quot; from the early '80s, with cover art by Darrell Sweet, shows a decrepit, bent, wizened Seldon (as I feel he should look). The next cover, by Michael Whelan from the early '90s, shows a more healthy and happy Seldon. The cover of the latest edition, shown on this page, features a Seldon who looks like he's about to jump out of his wheelchair and punch you out. You have to love that artistic license..."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Keep in mind: this is the first book in a trilogy. Even though each book stands on its own as a classic of science fiction, you have to take them as a whole, I think. Besides, once you've read Foundation, you'll want to read the others. That said, I first came across this trilogy in the library and was reluctant to read it. On first reading, I was weighed down and a little turned off by the politics, and I almost lost interest. Hari Seldon, a mathemetician, predicts that the mighty Empire, centered on the giant planet/city Trantor, will be destroyed in 500 years, which will be followed by 30,000 years of barabarism and social decay. Only after that will a new Empire emerge. He devises a plan to shrink that dark period to 1,000 years, and new rulers of his design will take over. After a trial, Seldon and his band are exiled to a backwater planet, Terminus, surrounded by stronger and more resourceful enemies. What band? Those working on a great Encyclopedia to preserve the knowledge of mankind once the dark period strikes. They wouldn't travel to the other end of the galaxy on their own accord. Forced exile was the only way Seldon's Plan would work. Soon the true purpose of the Plan is revealed. Seldon was dead before the Foundation established itself on Terminus. But he appears as a hologram during times of crisis. It turns out Seldon predicted these crises, and the Foundation's actions are forced down one path. The Foundation slowly gains advantage over its enemies. It will still be centuries before they are strong enough to take on the Empire. The Foundation gains these advantages sometimes by heroic acts of its leaders. But according to Seldon, the actions of the individual are unpredictable and can't be counted on. So is there some greater power guiding this whole scheme? The question is not approached until the next book, Foundation and Empire. We and the men of the Foundation know that Hari Seldon formed two Foundations, and that's all we know. You might spot elements that George Lucas borrowed for his Star Wars movies: Empires, small versus the mighty, parsecs, blasters, and as you read further, mind control. Foundation sets up the series strongly. Read it, and keep reading. The politics don't bother me so much anymore. They are a necessary part of the story. That's why I say to take the trilogy as a whole. All three books are essential to the whole story, one is not necessarily the best, but the real excitement and surprise endings are saved for the next two books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"\\"Foundation\\" by Isaac AsimovIn the distant future: humanity has spread to the stars and it has been so long that most have forgotten which planet humanity originated from. All of the inhabited planets (almost 25 million) owe allegiance to the Empire, a gigantic centralized government that is located on the planet of Trantor. Hari Seldon is a scientist and the utmost expert of new science known as \\"Psychohistory\\". Hari uses psychohistory which is mathematics based to map out the future in detail. He has determined that the Empire will fall within 300 years. Hari knows that he cant stop the fall but wishes to minimize the dark ages that follow in which he predicts that most science will be lost and that it will take humanity over 30,000 years to get back to where they currently are. Hari thinks he can minimize this amount of time by forming the Foundation whose job it will be to compile all knowledge into a galactic encyclopedia.........This was actually a very good and well thought out story. The story unwinds in an interesting and unique way that is very different from most sci-fi stories I have read.The Good: The story was well thought out and unfolds interestingly. Asimov is a great world/universe builder and his take on the emerging society of the foundation and its purpose driven evolutions is excellent. The story is well paced and never really felt like it had time to slow down. It is surprising that Asimov managed to tell his tale which covers an expansive amount of time in just under 250 pages and still make it feel fleshed out.The Bad: Some say the characters in \\"Foundation\\" are flat. This isn't untrue however as surprising as it may sound this doesn't have an extreme adverse effect on the story. The reason it doesn't is because the story isn't character driven. The characters act more as small pieces in a large extended chess game and merely serve to move an event driven story along its path.Overall: Foundation was a great and unique read. Pick it up and give it a read!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot, etc. so I will not do so here to any depth. This is one of those works of SiFi that will appeal to certain taste, while others may find it not to their liking. There is a great deal of politics (almost Pre WWI European) involved in the story line. As the story covers (all books included) over one thousand years, there are many, many characters to track and keep track of. This is indeed a series of short stories, all linked. I personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not. That being said, it, the book, can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such. You certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination. I enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is an amazing story about the ingenuity of one man whose quests bring him to the brink of barbarism-- in a time a million years from now. Hari Seldon is the character we'd all like to be, and Isaac Asimov is the writer we'd all like to be. Definately five stars. I recommend for anyone with a likeness to math, history, or science, or anyone who has read anything by Asimov, Brin, or Bear."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"With all the rave reviews about this book, perhaps I set my hopes too high. I just really didn't care for this book. There is almost no character development (since every chapter spans huge jumps in time) and the \\"science\\" in this novel takes a back seat to the political ideas of the author. With endless pages of dialog and few reasons to care about any of the characters, I had a very hard time getting through this one. And while I know it was written years ago, the author's science-fantasy was pretty much limited to \\"nuclear powered devices.\\" That just didn't feel like much of a stretch of the imagination, all things considered.I thoroughly enjoy sci-fi when told by authors such as H.G. Wells and Ray Bradbury. These authors know how to paint a picture in your mind and bathe your imagination in colorful imagery. In Foundation, however, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the style, context and story as told by Azimov - it was boring, unimaginative, and I never even had the pleasure of painting the scene being played out in my mind. I would definitely not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"For its time \`Foundation' by Isaac Asimov was a tale that predicted futurism as the calculation of the eventual outcome of each technological economic progression that mankind could, and would, go through, if it stuck to certain paths, especially the implementation of the concept that \\"small is better\\" with an economic drive that produces its best results when under stress, such as wartime. This model is pretty much the way the world works today with technology leaps made when there is a demand for it to do so and at no time is this demand greater than when a nation is faced with a possible crisis. Asimov's \`Foundation' is a story about a society of colonized scientists that have been chosen by Hari Seldon, the creator of psychohistory, who sees a crisis developing in the cosmic empire that can only be avoided if certain conditions are met for each impending emergency that is predicted through psychohistorical analysis. He sets up an off world colony at the unknown edge of the galaxy, the foundation, that goes through several generations, with each generation reaching a hidden 'Seldon crisis' point that becomes the focus of several successive stories in the book. Futurism was actually an artistic movement originating in Italy around 1910 whose aim was to express the energetic, dynamic, and violent quality of contemporary life, especially as embodied in the motion and force of modern machinery. Nowadays it means to believe that the meaning of life and one's personal fulfilment lie in the future and not in the present or past. Foundation symbolizes these ideas. Although not the most exciting or action packed SF you could read, is also somewhat limited in its SF feel, is more of a revelation of economics and is the kind of literary material that would impress the business and politically minded reader more than the seasoned SF reader. None-the-less this is still an important work that remains relevant today as it did in the early 50s, but the sequels might be a bit of a hard sell on the bases of this educational SF novel."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I love this book and now fully understand why Asimov is considered one of the grandmasters of this genre. Over the years I have read a considerable amount of Science Fiction; books ranging from military exploits to technological exploits, but never have I read one that I would consider high literature.In this book Asimov deals with issues such as religion, politics, economics and the control that they all grant in such a deft way that it in no way detracts from a riveting and page turning novel. Take, for instance this quote from page 210.\\"The religion we have is our all-important instrument toward that end. With it we have brought the Four Kingdoms under our control, even at the moment when they would have crushed us. It is the most potent device known with which to control men and worlds\\"In regards to the power of economics\\"The whole war is a battle between those two systems; between the Empire and the Foundation; between the big and the little. To seize control of a world, they bribe with immense ships that can make war, but lack all economic significance. We, on the other hand, bribe with little things, useless in war, but vital to prosperity and profits.\\" - Pg. 231My one complaint is really based on a personal preference. I really enjoy a novel which has one central character that I can get to know and even identify with. I think that it helps to draw the reader into the story. However, Foundation covers several hundred years in just a couple hundred pages thereby making this impossible. This is a small point, but for me detracts slightly from the story.That said I adore this book and am eagerly looking forward to finishing out the series. If you have not read it then I say move it to the top of the list. This is truly one of the great SciFi stories of all time.Leave a comment below and let me know what you think!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation surprised me. I had been expecting dry, hardcore science fiction with hard to grasp worlds and characters. I couldn't have been more wrong. Foundation takes politics, psychology, statistics and survival and showcases them in a galaxy far, far away.Time passes quickly in the novel, so you don't get very attached to any of the characters. The focus is the big picture, the future, and the steps taken to prevent the coming anarchy. More than that, the focus is on the plot. Clean dialogue and a lack of heavy description keeps the plot constantly moving forward. The pace the plot progression sets makes the book very hard to put down. Foundation is a smart and easy read that deserves its label as being the best science fiction books of all time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Comes this novel, given to me on Christmas, by my dad, on the recomendation of one of his co-workers. I am not a big science fiction fan, not that I've read dozens of sci-fi books and hated them. It's just that besides what I run into in the occasional Koontz or King, I have little interest in sci-fi.So after Christmas, a month or so goes by, and I finally open \\"Foundation\\". Doing research before reading this, I am quite impressed at how popular this series is. After reading the book, I clearly see why. The first few pages took a re-read, as I was very confused. Before I knew it, im onto part 2 and not able to put this book down. All I can say now is I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the series. I was in the mood for something different than my usual reading, and this really delivered. Asimov writing is intelligent, yet simple. His character's aren't deep, but the plot amazes. His imagination is amazing.What I especially enjoy about this book, is that each of the five parts takes place many years after the previous part, so you really feel as if you know the whole empire's history.All in all, this book took me from not caring much for sci-fi, to at the bare minimum reading the rest of this series, and eventualy, probably reading alot if not all of Asimov's work. A book that's on the short side never contained so much in opinion. I am now an Isaac Asimov fan. Recommended HIGHLY!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"After reading the whole trilogy I must say that the first installment still has the biggest impact for the single reason that this is where the whole grand idea was conceived and presented for the first time.The best aspect of this story is, of course, the awsome interplay between technology, politics, religion, economy, and culture within the galactic periphery in the immediate vicinity of planet Terminus, the location of the so called First Foundation. This interplay is cleverly woven into a series of plots propelled by a handful of characters. That focus upon a few key characters in a sense brought the whole story down to earth (and for the better).The founder himself, Hari Seldon, is already long dead by the 2nd chapter but the plan he and his co-conspirators set in motion lingers on.Couple of problems are evident with the story and some suspension of disbelief is required to overcome them.First is the time scale in which the changes are set in. To put it simply, descend of parts of the galaxy encompassing hundreds of planetary systems into that sort of technological and scientific barbarism\\" within mere 50 years is not belivable. Establishing a religion based on technology within 30 years after that is still kind of on the less belivable side but it depends strongly on the magnitude of the technological difference between barbarians\\" and the foundationeers, so there is room for interpretation.Second is the technology itself. Nuclear fission has been known and used for 60 years and lost most of its appeal as the ultimate energy source of the future.In the meantime there has been countless ideas about alternative sources of energy much greater than fission and entirely possible (notably: nuclear fusion and matter/antimatter annihilation). To put it simply, the idea that nuclear fission will be powering everything at the point in time 12 millenia from now is archaic.Besides nuclear power, there are number of minor ideas introduced in the book that also did not hold well or at all since its writing (prevalent smoking, for instance). Together, the whole technological and cultural setting of the book has sort of a retro feel now... kind of like the Fallout games.All that, however, can be forgiven for the most part since it is often impossible to write about technology of the future merely decades from now let alone whole millenia from now. Asimov was a writer and a scientist, not a psychic.Striking is also the absence of biochemistry or genetics, since one would assume that those would be Asimov's strong points for the fact that he majored and worked in biochemistry.Third, while the passage of time had appropriate atmosphere of scale (more or less), the galaxy felt kind of small. The distances weren't shown or explained very well so a trip from the Periferies to Trantor or Kolgan(sp?) seems like a trip to an amusement park only some 100 miles away.Nevertheless, the best what Foundation has to offer more than makes up for its shortfalls."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Imagine an empire so humongous it stretches across the Milky Way galaxy. Imagine a mathematical formula that can actually prove future events. Then imagine that formula predicts this galactic empire will soon crumble and a new dark ages lasting at least 30,000 years will follow.If you can imagine all that, you get the gist of Foundation by Isaac Asimov and the beginning of a highly regarded series of books in the science fiction genre.What happens next is a group of people try to find ways to circumnavigate, though not necessarily halt, the new approaching dark age.Asimov isn't for everyone, and I can't admit to loving his prose. But his ideas for plots are top notch. This book, and the series of books that follow it, are proof of this.Asimov's writing is often considered too dense for the casual reader, and there's some truth to this. If you like your science fiction with lots of action and ray guns and alien spaceships flying about, Asimov isn't for you. But if you like hard science fiction based upon hard, indepth science, this Asimov is probably right for you, especially the Foundation series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said, there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters, but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics', etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling, and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I'd like to begin this review by saying that I typically don't particularly like most science fiction. In fact, I hate most of it. What Asimov did here was create an outline of continuity that seamlessly followed a logical progression, displayed memorable characters that begin and end as heroic figures, and never once does he insult the intelligence of the reader.The primary difference between Asimov and the Sci-Fi writers that I loathe so much, is that Isaac does not stoop to create melodrama; he doesn't exaggerate his descriptions or dialogue in order to convince the reader that the heroes are great, rather he let's their actions demonstrate their greatness.The only thing that does bother me about Asimov, is how many terrible authors who have clearly attempted to emulate his ideas and writing style only to create abominations of thought and literature. I'm looking at you, L.R.H."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When I was a teenager, I was stunned by \\"The End of Eternity\\". When later I started reading the Empire and Foundation novels, I was unpleasantly surprised by the style simplification that seemed to accelerate with every novel. Now, when I've read them all, I think I understand what happened: there was no time for a better literature craftsmanship, new universes took all the time. Somehow, it resembled Federico Fellini's movies - same feeling of creation of the worlds just in front of you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"A science fiction book where the science is more political than technological. Psychology had advanced to the point where mathematical models of mass psychology could predict large group social behavior far into the future ( rather like the meteorological models attempt to predict weather several days in advance). The predictions in this case extended over several centuries and predicted the galaxy would undergo a dark age in which civilized learning and behavior would decrease and collected knowledge could be lost. A Foundation was formed at the far edge of the galaxy with the sole job of organizing and saving all knowledge. Since the book takes place over a long period of time we follow the adventures of several heroes involved with the Foundation's effort to not only maintain knowledge (for the time when civilization will return) but to do so while maintaining peace. This was done first by creating a religion based on the fact that only the Foundation had technology, most importantly nuclear power. This source of power, needed by all, then became an object of worship, and priests were trained in how to present the dictates of the Foundation (Source of Power) as a reason for good behavior. When this sham began to fail, it was found that trade between the high tech Foundation and the low tech other nations was more profitable than war, and could maintain peace. This is the first book in a series of three, so most likely the next book tells how the trade idea worked out. Although my description does make it sound boring, I found it to be an interesting book, the politics of which sound familiar in today's world - I may read the next in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Oh how avidly I read these long ago.

But let's say that it encompasses a future history spanning tens of thousands of years at it's most crucial time - when the very fabric of its society is about to plunge into a dark age. Only one man can save it, Hari Seldon, by writing an Encyclopedia Galactica that will redirect the knowledge of mankind into a small group of scientists who can rebuild humanity in just a few thousand years.Epic in proprtion, brilliant in detail, this is a must read for anyone who not only savors the salt of Sci-fi literatue, but anyone who just wants to read the best of the best of any genre."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Great book!

Unlike most students and academics, though, Asimov also was a superb writer in each area and could distill the essence of his knowledge into entertaining non-fiction or fiction. Read his books regarding history of civilization or about Black Holes or about religion and I'm sure you will appreciate his knowledge about such diverse topics and his ability to keep you awake at night reading!I'm not saying you will agree with his every point - only that you will be exposed to a well-articulated discussion.In the Foundation series, it is clear Asimov has combined history and psychology to an extraordinary degree. The question is, was this young man of Russian birth writing of Russia's future or was he merely writing of England's past?You see, a great civilization has encompassed all the known world. Then, inevitably, it will begin a collapse. As in other empires, collapse begins in part due to the burdensome administrative hub (Moscow, Washington DC or London?), combined with a recession at a time when the outcast and downtrodden are fed up with unemployment and unfulfilled promises of a better future (Eastern Europe or the inner cities of America or Britain). This dilemma is further exacerbated by revolutionaries and terrorists in the hinterlands.Enter Mr. Seldon. Clearly he is based on the alter ego of Asimov himself, for the man is a student of mathematics, psychology, religion and history, as well as of politics.I could write a book to dissect the brilliance of the writing and the lessons for all leaders, but will simply say that Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation make up my favorite all-time trilogy. No knock against Lord of the Rings intended. LOTR is terrific but not quite as good."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Having suffered the derision of fellow sci-fi fans for many years, I recently picked up the Foundation Trilogy for the first time; I was actually pretty disappointed by my first exposure to Asimov's longer works. Obviously the man is one of the renowned masters of science fiction because he got there first: he wrote about a Galactic Empire long before it became cliche, speculated about the limits and triumphs of science, etc. That said, what struck me most about this beginning to the Foundation series was that Asimov's story exactly parallels Hari Seldon's theory of psychohistory: only movements, not individuals, are significant in shaping history, and even the main characters in the book are accordingly underdeveloped to the point of being forgettable. I enjoy world-building as much as the next sci-fi/fantasy buff, but I also appreciate well-constructed sentences and good characterization, both of which I found sorely lacking here. Also, &quot;Foundation&quot; is clearly a man's world, setting a tradition of male adolescent sci-fi in which strong and/or interesting female characters have no place.I give the novel three stars only because it sets up the background for the next two in the series, which overcome some (but not all) of the faults in this first effort. But I think that I will return to my personal favorites among the old masters, including Robert Heinlein and Theodore Sturgeon, who have always delivered philosophy, wit, and imagination along with excellent storytelling."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The story is one of the most detailed, most thought-out stories ever.

The story had some interesting moments and actually started off quite solidly. But then, the politics took over and the Sci-Fi aspect was completely lost. This book felt like a drama class play that could have taken place anywhere and almost at anytime. I never felt like I was in space or that anything related to Sci-Fi was present. I didnt mind the story so much but being a Sci-Fi book means that I expect some technical \\"sciency\\" details and didnt get anything in this book. I also did not like the huge jump from each major chapter regarding time. Just when you feel that the plot and characters are \\"settlling-in\\" you jump 80 years and have to start all over again. Lastly, there was very little scene setup. I rarely knew where the dialog was taking place or what the surroundings were...hence the comparison to a stage play.If you like Arthur Clark's style of Sci-Fi like me and prefer the Science aspect of Sci-Fi to be featured in books you read then I would not recommend this book. It is somewhat over-rated and isn't really Sci-Fi In my opinion...."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from &quot;Foundation&quot; to &quot;How Not to Write a Book&quot; or &quot;Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English.&quot; I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction, but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read, I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book, I felt it was good, but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking. Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable, he views plot as the central element to his writing, at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First, there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people, but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes, there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks, I like to view my characters as a little more than men at work. Everybody is always scheming, there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future, such far-off planets.Secondly, there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the description of the false religion that Salvor Hardin invents. And this only helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to &quot;understand&quot; how important it will be in our era, with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future, such as super-intellect, robotics, biotechnology, etc. I don't know if Asimov was just lacking in creativity, because with the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor, the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly, romance does not play a role in the book. There no women in the book, which means there can be no romantic intrigue, or world events influenced by a woman. Also, there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far off worlds is sparesely and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms.On the other hand, if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history, you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic, political, and sociological macroforces that shape history, you will like this book. If you're more about the game than the players, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation consists of five stories separated by several decades each. The Trantorian Empire has lost its hold on the outer perimeter of the galaxy. Hari Seldon, founder of the predictive science of psychohistory, knows that the Empire is doomed to collapse and that thirty millennia of barbarism and anarchy will ensue before a second empire will rise. But Seldon claims to know a way to shorten the dark ages from 30,000 years to a single millennium.The stories in Foundation chronicle the infancy and development of Seldon's Foundation society initially established on the remote planet Terminus. Seldon's psychohistory predicts several crises that the Foundation must survive in order to bring about the desired drastic shortening of the dark ages. Four of the five stories each describe a crisis that confronts the Foundation.So far I've read the Robot series, the Empire series, and the first three books in the Foundation series (Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation). I find the epic story so far to be extremely engaging and imaginative. The stories in Foundation are a bit disconnected and not fleshed out enough, but nevertheless do a more than adequate job of describing the fall of the Galactic Empire."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is amazing. After waiting all these years to jump onto the Asimov train I am glad that I am finally here; the book is thoughtful, smart, and paced wonderfully. The solutions to the Seldon problems all provoke different themes the novel wishes to convey.The book is a short easy read and if you like Sci-Fi, I recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I decided to reread the Asimov series in order. Asimov's &#34;Foundation series&#34; novels are classics of the science fiction genre. Some of the foundation novels drag on a bit but &#34;Foundation and Empire&#34; moves along well. The Asimov style emphasizes interpersonal relationships as opposed to showcasing gee-whiz science fiction apparatus. If you like science fiction you should read the foundation series novels as they are the basis of a lot of subsequent science fiction novels. Indeed, Star Wars may have been based on the Foundation novels or at least influenced their development."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I bought the complete series of the Foundation for my husband, because he hadn't read it before. There are 7 books, not three, and I can say that Isaac Assimov is one of the great brains of the past century.

Although a good book, I didn't really get a good mental picture of the different worlds involved in it except Trantor in the very beginning of the book. It was mostly about people and politics with very little of the landscapes they lived in. I guess that is why I liked the Dune and Hyperion series so much."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I avidly read these novels and really enjoyed them.

It did not seam as rich as I thought I remembered it. Was glad to see a Kindle Edition so it was easy to revisit this classic."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"No matter how many times I read this book, it is impossible to get tired of it. Most definitley the best Foundation book Asimov ever wrote. Two very superb stories, which show that you don't need a million word novel to produce a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Being an avid sci-fi fan, I've read many books of the genere, but Foundation was the first Asimov that I had read. Foundation was an amazing book, in what I imagine is an incredible series. (I haven't read the others yet!) Asimov hooks you with a flawless story-line and personable characters, and reels you in with superb twists and turns and a way of resolving things that is limited to only his intellect. His visions of the future are as or more astounding then Orson Well's and his story-telling ability ranks among the best. It might be a &quot;Seldon&quot; crisis if you don't read this book. In other words if you are looking for a well crafted, enthralling, completely enjoyable novel, this is it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is truly one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written.

Isaac Asimov has shown himself to be a true Grand Master."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The spectacular universe created by Issac Asimov in Foundation is excellently complemented by the second in the series.

This novel however does get a little bizarre with its Mule character. If you like Asimov and the first novel, than you will probably like this one. But beware, it is a little different"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation novels were a great pleasureto read, and I was surprised at the detailand intelligence Asimov puts into hisbooks. Having written over 300 books ofdifferent genres, he is a scientific masterat writing, and he is considered an above-allsuperior science fiction novelist of the 20thcentury. The Foundation novels, all worksof art, are a nirvana in his ability."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Being a Foundation nut, I have given a 10 to all of Issac Asimov's Foundatino books. (and will probably give all his other books 10's too) The basis behind this story is that it describes an Empire- a Galactic Empire, mind you- that seems to be the same incredible picture of strength that it had been for 12,000 years. The brilliant mathematician, Hari Seldon, developes his science of Psychohistory, a way of predicting the course of future events and discovers that the Empire is decaying and will soon collapse. He then works out a plan to place two &quot;Foundations&quot; at &quot;opposite ends of the galaxy&quot;, so that in the course of a millenium they will converge and form a new and greater Empire on the ruins of the old. The novel is sort of like a fictiona"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is one of Asimov's early masterpieces. However, I would not recomend it to those who like action books. This has only a little bit of action in it. The main attraction to it is the intellectual stimulation. The Galactic Empire is falling after 12,000 years. Hari Seldon realizes it and, using the science of psychohistory, the prediction of the future in broad, statistical terms, establishes two Foundations &quot;at opposite ends of the Galaxy&quot; to cushion the Fall. This, the first of the classic Foundation series to be written (though only 3rd in chronological order), traces the early development of the First Foundation as it struggles first simply to survive in the prescence of powerful, hostile Kingdoms (which had formerly been parts of the Galactic Empire), and then to gradual growth and domination of its area of the Galaxy, and the promise of eventually establishing a Second Galactic Empire. Not a traditional novel, but perfect if you like history, as it traces the &quot;historical&quot; development of a nation. This is the epitome of the future history genre"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"A truly intriguing series that has kept me spellbound for quite a while. Of the fourteen books in the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series, I have seven of them. I just need to find the final of the Foundation series &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;. I just wish Mr. Asimov was here to keep the series going. Each book holds your attention with the drama and suspense of what's going to happen next. The imagination really soar's! Recommended for every Sci-Fi reader!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It was my first Asimov book, and I can't stop to read all of his books about Fundation and Robots. I think, it is Epic. It is not a fast-read book, it has little dialogs, but it is great !."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I do not read science fiction, generally, but Asimov's fantastic tale of the future was so accesible, so fascinating and original, that it just blew me away and before I knew it I was hooked on the series. OK, OK, it's kinda dated; some characters are caught using &quot;the futuristic version of the slide rule&quot; and there are apparently no women at work on the Foundation Product, and EVERYTHING is powered by nuclear energy, but cut Ike some slack! This was the 50s, after all... Anyway, the series gets far more...progressive...as it goes along. And, to me anyway, the dated bits were more amusing than anything else. Anyway...in a genre convoluted by over-used lasers, aliens, and so on, Asmiov's FOUNDATION stands out as a story about the evolution of humanity. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this series, just a humanitarian. This is one of those books that should be long to everyone's private library!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you think you might even possibly like science fiction, this is a must read book!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is my favorite American Sci-fi. There are almost none of the crudities of most other American sci-fi. I prefer the Foundation and the first novella of Second Foundation to the latter half of the trilogy; Asimov grew a little tired of his main theme as he progressed, although he still has some memorable scenes, such as the description of Rossem. The French translation of this is itself a classic, and irons out Asimov's occasional 'mass-market' juvenilic elements into a very high level of literate expression. But the English is far from bad to begin with, and has, if not a Gibbonian, at least an H.G. Wellsian flavor. Asimov's later Foundation novels are far below the three volumes of the Foundation trilogy proper. They resemble the common run of American sci-fi - aimless plots, flavorless language, etc. I am always puzzled that some people don't think Asimov has convincing characters. Who remembers, or cares, about the characters of a Heinlein or Clarke? But Asimov has at least a dozen characters that are known to every sci-fi fan. Asimov possesses a masculine vigor of language and an episodical manner of imagination that pleases me very much."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The best example around of Asimov's work. It is intellectual, interesting, and just plain entertaining. reading it, you can feel the danger that the fledgeling Foundation is in when threatened by its aggeressive neighbors and there are unconventional solutions. I have only two complaints. The book is dated and there is little action. Get past those and you're sure to enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"One of the problems with the original Foundation was that Asimov seemed unsure of where he wanted to go. However, in Foundation and Empire, he finds his way. The story of the Mule is pure genious. With psychic powers being a cliche in SF today, it is hard for the modern reader to appreciate. The part when the Mule's identity is revealed gave me chills, even the second time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I really liked this book, but I want to give you some warnings about my tastes &amp; what I found odd about it. First I used to read history books for fun &amp; sometimes I still do. Second there were absolutely no female characters in this one. This struck me as bizarre then &amp; it still does (by the way I'm a male &amp; most definitely not a feminist)The later foundation books ,especially those written in the 80's &amp; 90's, are better characterized &amp; women are much better characterized. Also this is a 1940's view of the future. That doesn't mean it's dated (are Dumas or Poe dated?) it just means you have to put it in context. Why did I like it then? My love of history, the ideas, the grandness, &amp; unrepentant sentimentality. I think if I read it again I might not like it as much, but the memory of it's great. If you know a teenager reading star trek books do what my dad did &amp; give them this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have read every book in the Foundation Series. The First must be read to fully appreciate all the others, but the best one in the series is Foundation and Earth. It's so unfortunate that the publishers who don't have the rights to this novel in the series don't include it in their lists."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have read 5 of the 7 foundation books. I find this one to be the least enjoyable, but I still consider it a classic. While Asimov's writing style improved over the years, Foundation is still a great read. Psychohistory is such an interesting idea, that it makes one think if it is possible. Although the books get better as the publishing years increase, the first one is still a great one. One note, though. Asimov's style of &quot;action&quot; here is not excellent, so be forewarned. Personally, I find his Robot series more enjoyable, but Foundation is still one of the best series ever written. I would give 4.5 stars, but unfortunately I cant."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"50,000 years in the future and they are still smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers, the main power source is nuclear energy..and they carry nuclear guns???

Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.I know that \\"technology as magic\\" and \\"religion = magic\\" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.IOW, religion is subject to criticism (\\"it's not measurable\\") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this \\"religious cover for nuclear technology\\" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"What more can I say? The Mule? Give me a break. How can anyone consider this to be great fiction? Go read something else...."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As an avid sci-fi reader, I felt I had to rectify an oversight and read the book that really is a foundation of much of today's sci-fi. When I started the book, I planned to read the entire series. I was so completely let down that I don't know if I'll ever read Asimov again. Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating. Kudos to Asimov for opening the door for better writers but too bad his work (at least this early work) is terrible. Don't waste your time reading this one. Go straight to the many better post-Asimov authors."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I hate this book. I don't just &quot;not like it,&quot; I hate it! Such a bad book.

It was written in a time when Afghanistan was the most developed country in Central Asia, and still a popular destination on the hippy trail.Nancy Dupree is one of the leading American authorities on Afghanistan. She has traveled and worked on archaeological excavations in the country since the 1950s. Her guide contains some excellent historical discussions about the numerous monuments and colorful cities of Afghanistan. It is impressively well-researched and documented. The section dealing with the Jam Minaret is particularly interesting; as are those devoted to Nuristan and the now destroyed Buddhas of Bamiyan. As you might expect, much of the statistics and logistical information she provides are today obsolete. However, the itineraries described are still of some value.The principal strength of this book resides in its social and cultural depictions of the Afghan people. Clearly, Dupree knows the Afghans intimately and loves their country. She is also an accomplished anthropologist, and does a great job of presenting their ethnic diversity and cultural richness in a simple and concise format. How amazing it is that 30 years of war have not managed to eradicate the fabulous heritage of this beautiful country!I frequently refer to this book if I need to check up on Afghan history or culture, and would heartily recommend it to anyone with an interest in Afghanistan."},{"Title":"An Historical Guide to Afghanistan (Afghan Tourist Organization Publication)","review":"To say that a guide book on Afghanistan written in the 1970s is out of date should be an uncontroversial statement, but it's one that doesn't quite hold for this work. Although the terrain has changed since then, mostly human but sometimes quite literally the landscape as well, it likely still remains one of the most complete and interesting works looking at Afghanistan on a local level. The book frequently has interesting historical tidbits about otherwise rarely discussed parts of Afghanistan, and its period actually lends it some interesting perspective on Afghan-Soviet cooperation in projects across the country."},{"Title":"Plasticville","review":"This is a gem of, a wonder of, a book. Nothing meets Trinidad's careful eye without sizzling in it or turning 360 degrees until spun and respun into gold. That's, yes, the Midas touch, which our poor tired cultural icons and ephemera sorely need. Only Trinidad could grace Marilyn Monroe with a crown of sonnets or set model trains chugging on their perfect couplet tracks. It's like Christmas morning in your mind--only better. Because this one can be enjoyed over and over without getting worn out--the profound play here is married with a depth that rewards rereading.

Discovering this has really changed the way I think about verse and books in general. The best thing about it? NOT boring. I'm so sick of the innocuous, adjectival, over-written, meaningless poems in so many journals and &quot;literary&quot; magazines of our time. David Trinidad is smart--read for pure pleasure, and then read again and look for the subtle tricks and talent he employs to make these poems truly great art! Truly fresh, too. No one else is writing about our tarnished culture like Trinidad. He is truly unique, and like I said, the best compliment I can give is that this book is not a bore--something that 98% of all books of poetry these days are! Thank you Mr. Trinidad!

I had heard of Trinidad before, even read his last book Answer Song, a friend had it. Plasticville renewed my interest in reading poetry. The work is fresh, plain, clean -- and while Trinidad can sometimes be a rigid formalist the material lightens the load. Having become bored with much contemporary American poetry, Trinidad's Plasticville helped to renew my interest. From the pop-culture material to the more intimate, domestic stuff (written in the voice of his dog!), Trinidad's Plasticville is refreshing, well-written, and a pleasure to read.

Sadly, certain areas of the book are also subject rather exaggerated and, while such liberties may help make dramatic titles and sell copy, they do not make for informed debate.Although there are very few other English language texts that focus on the MoF, this one is not scholarly and I would advise you to skip it (there is another book on MoF by Brown - available on Amazon - but I have not read it yet). Gerald Curtis provides more insightful comment into Japanese politics, and Takatoshi Ito offers a far better review of the workings of the Japanese economy. These texts may be more general, but they will give readers a more balanced and rounded view of the Japanese political and economic system."},{"Title":"The Ministry: How Japan's Most Powerful Institution Endangers World Markets","review":"Published in 1998, this book describes an institution that no longer exists: the Okurash has given up its name and most of its power to become, more conventionally, the Ministry of Finance, also known as MOF in English or as zaimush in Japanese. It is only a shadow of its former self. The core function of supervising the financial sector has been handed over to the Financial Services Agency. The Bank of Japan is jealous of its independence. A large part of the budget's preparation work now takes place at the Cabinet Office.On top of that, the victory of the Democratic Party of Japan at the 2009 Lower House elections and the long awaited alternation in power has led to a \\"government led by politicians\\" where bureaucrats are now required to apply the directives of their political masters. This comes as a shock for an institution which, according to Peter Hartcher, worked \\"under the assumption that politicians represent special interest; it is left to the bureaucracy to represent a national interest.\\"Some things have changed and some haven't. The building is still an old-fashioned pre-war concrete construction with long corridors and high ceilings, and the offices are still stacked with the piles of paper and crammed desks that made Paul Krugman deride the lousy work habits of Japanese bureaucrats. Economists are still a rare breed: \\"In Japan, and specifically in the Finance Ministry, writes the author, economists rank second and remain suspect.\\" The great bulk of men--there are still very few women--appointed to the top echelons of the MOF are graduates of Tokyo University's faculty of law, not economics. After entering the ministry, they are sent overseas for two full years of postgraduate studies, and some of them thus get exposure to economics and financial theory as it is taught on US campuses. But many remain defiant of US-style capitalism, and insist on the distinctiveness of Japan.The author notes that there is a curious paradox in the ministry's approach to economics: \\"In its approach to regulating markets and industries, its impulse is interventionist. Yet in its approach to the overarching question of the size of the government, it favors small government and lower spending.\\" MOF officials see themselves as the nation's fiscal guardians. They are constantly lobbying, so far unsuccessfully, for a raise in the consumption tax rate in order to match growing social expenses with revenues and shift the national debt down from its explosive path. As the author notes, the Budget Bureau's preoccupation with minimizing government spending has shaped the ministry's overall approach to the policy mix.One thing for sure is that MOF officials do work long hours. \\"Let's get home while it is still dark\\" is still a catchphrase in Kasumigaseki. The preparation of the national budget is a year-round time consuming task.In additions, bureaucrats have to work through the night to compile lists of questions for their Minister when he appears before the Diet on the following day. They have no time for going out and flirting with the opposite sex. The Minister's Secretariat therefore used to provide matchmaking services and arranges \\"omiai\\" opportunities with daughters of senior officials or politicians.It also used to look after top civil servants after they retired from the ministry, usually at age between fifty and fifty-five when a member of their age cohort reached the top job of administrative vice-minister. The practice of \\"amakudari\\", literally translated as descent from heaven, has now come under heavy attack from politicians and is practically banned, although there are still some postings available to senior MOF officials in public institutions and international organizations.How did a book about a lackluster and slow-moving bureaucracy in a faraway place found its way to Harvard Business School Press? There are certainly no lessons for private sector managers to be learned from this book, as Japan's Ministry of Finance is by no means a model of efficient organization. Contrary to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (or METI, formerly MITI), the Ministry of Finance does not influence the strategies of large Japanese corporations, and it has only an indirect impact on their competitive environment. The purpose of this book, and others which focused on Japan's macroeconomic policies at about the same period, was no longer to find the roots of the Japanese miracle, as Chalmers Johnson did with MITI.Rather, it is a tale of hubris and failure, and the question asked in the subtitle is how Japan's most powerful institution endangers world markets. In retrospect, the MOF bears a heavy responsibility for the policy failures that plunged Japan into its first home-grown recession since World War II. But it did not engineer a world recession, and the \\"lost decade\\" was contained to Japan. This book is not the best one available on the course of macroeconomic policy in Japan during the bubble and post-bubble years. But it is to my knowledge the only source available in English to lift the veil on the functioning of this key Japanese institution. Of course, readers proficient in Japanese will have access to many more sources, as reporting insiders' stories from Kasumigaseki was and still is a popular genre, with many journalists and disgruntled former bureaucrats specializing in the subject. For more scholarly inclined types, the books on the Okurash's demise by Masaru Mabuchi from Kyoto University are still considered as the best sources on the subject."},{"Title":"The Ministry: How Japan's Most Powerful Institution Endangers World Markets","review":"The entangling bureaucracy that keeps a chokehold on Japan is exposed at last!

I selected this book for my program as the most interesting and readable book. Alice Low writes in a clear style and systematically introduces the Greek gods and heroes while also making references to the other stories. Too many books on this topic are written in old-fashioned language that discourages the reader. Most other books fail to link the various stories to one another, leaving the reader feeling a bit disjointed. Low interweaves the tales, which gives a smooth narrative flow. The fact that 10-year-old children became enthusiastic about Greek mythology demonstrates the value of this book."},{"Title":"The Simon & Schuster Book of Greek Gods and Heroes","review":"When one is trying to get a basic overall grasp of Greek mythology, it can be an overwhelming and formidable subject, and one can be at a loss for the best place to start. Most books I've found either give too much detail too fast or else are hit-and-miss selections that don't give a very comprehensive introduction. If that's been your experience too, this book could be an excellent solution to your problem. It gives a highly readable thorough introduction without overwhelming you with details. As an introduction to or review of Greek mythology, it is therefore highly recommendable. Although probably aimed primarily at children, I suppose grown-ups too, if not already expert on the subject, won't find it too elementary."},{"Title":"The Simon & Schuster Book of Greek Gods and Heroes","review":"This book has great myths.

Not only for young readers but for anyone who want to know the most significant stories in Greek Mythology. This book makes a good basic reference for any history class. Anyone can learn easily from this book because it is easy to read, yet you receive a lot of information. It also includes colorful illustrations that giulds the reader through.This book includes sections such as: &quot;Mother Earth and Her Children&quot;, &quot;The Gods and Foddesses of Mount Olypus&quot;, &quot;Zuez and the Creation of Mankind&quot;, and &quot;Triumnphs of the Gods&quot;. It has such stories as: Prometheus and His Gift to Man, Pandora, Echo, Medusa, Jason, Odysseus, and much more.A personal favorite of mine is the story of Jason. One man fell for the love of a youthful princess, and tempted to leave his wife, Medea. Medea spent much of her money and prepared a feast for Jason. The revenge was sweet....

I question the accuracy of some of the tales, as they differ slightly from other versions I have read. However, it is good, light reading and it covers nearly all of the major Greek gods and heros.

Sheldon's most poorly written chapters appear to be out of the area of his expertise. The book has some glaring errors in scientific discussions. It's obvious the author is not a scientist. He does a better job on chapters dealing with economics and Jefferson's character. He totally drops the ball in his chapter about Jefferson and science. Sheldon believes that Jefferson would reject evolution. He writes &quot;...radical evolution holds that the world and it's species develop out of themselves, internally, not out of an external creator&quot;. Thus, Jefferson, who was a deistic scientist, would reject evolution. The quote is a false statement and shows the author's ignorance of science. True science does not have an opinion on things it cannot observe. It only attempts to explain what it can observe, therefore true science is open to the theory of natural evolution being born out of a creator. However, at this time such a theory cannot be tested or proved. Sheldon also quotes evolutionary scientist, Dr. Stephen Gould, grossly out of context. Gould would be furious to see how Sheldon has misused those writings. Something smells fishy. What is the author's hidden agenda here? I believe Jefferson, the true scientist he was, would side with the vast majority of scientists and accept evolution. In conclusion, I feel Jefferson would be proud that in only 200 years we have become the greatest nation on earth surpassing empires built over thousands of years. I do believe Jefferson, who hoped that U.S. citizens would eventually turn Unitarian would be disappointed that there is still so much superstition in the U.S. Jefferson saw knowledge as light, and superstition and ignorance as darkness. So what would Jefferson say about the book &quot;What would Jefferson say?&quot; I believe he would say the same thing he said about the Bible. He would call it a &quot;dung hill.&quot; Sheldon corrupts Jefferson's beliefs in the same way Jefferson believed the Bible was corrupt. They were both put together to manipulate the uneducated. Sheldon makes Thomas Jefferson sound like Pat Robertson who, I have little doubt, Jefferson would have despised. For anyone who really wants to learn about Jefferson, I recommend reading &quot;Jefferson and Religion&quot; by Eugene R. Sheridan. Leave Sheldon's book to those who want to lie to themselves and make Jefferson into something he was not."},{"Title":"What Would Jefferson Say?","review":"Attention! Sheldon's views of Jefferson's thought to not reflect on Jefferson's! I could not believe what I was reading when I opened up this book. I hought that Sheldon had at least a relatively firm grasp on Jefferson's thought after reading his book &quot;The Political Philosophy of Thomas Jefferson,&quot; I was sorely disappointed. It appears that Sheldon may understand what he thought, but is not able to translate it to the events of today. It is a shame that Sheldon failed in his effort, because such a work as this, properly done, would be wonderful to see. If you truly interested in what Jefferson would think about current events today, let me sum it up for you. He would be outraged and saddened to see what happened to the once great nation that he helped to found. He would be enraged at the tyrannical activities of our government. As for his political leanings, he would most certainly be a radical libertarian."},{"Title":"What Would Jefferson Say?","review":"Although easy enough to read and laced with numerous Jeffersonian quotations, this book, on balance, is far more concerned with Professor Sheldon's appraisal of contemporary society than it is with the opinions of the nation's third president. Sheldon's conservative Christian viewpoint is obvious and gives rise to the legitimate concern that he may have been quite selective in his use of substantiating information, employing only those facts which are consistent with his own stance on issues while creating the illusion that he is presenting the reader with an unbiased perspective. Some of his &quot;supportive evidence&quot; is anecdotal and may very well have no basis in fact. For example, twice Sheldon mentions a comparison of surveys regarding educational problems in 1940 and 1990 in an attempt to prove a decline in educational and moral standards. These &quot;surveys,&quot; however, are a fiction concocted by former Ft. Worth businessman T. Cullen Davis, an evangelical Christian who has openly admitted that he created the poll out of his own imagination in order to advance his personal views. Professor Sheldon may very well have done much the same thing. Lack of precise supportive documentation is the most disturbing feature of this book. Virtually nowhere is it possible for the reader to easily verify the accuracy of what the author states or to learn the context from which quoted remarks are taken. Given Sheldon's obvious bias, a reader who wants a more scholarly, objective account of Thomas Jefferson's thoughts would be well advised to look elsewhere, like Joseph Ellis's &quot;American Sphinx.&quot;"},{"Title":"What Would Jefferson Say?","review":"I am 17 and a Senior in high school. I read this for a report in my government class. One weak point I discovered while reading this was there was just too much biographical information. I bought this book more to find out what Jefferson's thoughts would be rather than to learn about aspects of his life. I realize that there must be some info of Jefferson's life so that we will know where Sheldon is coming from with his ideas, but there was just too much in my opinion. Also I was never really sure whether Jefferson's opinions on current day subjects were what Sheldon truly felt Jefferson would think or whether they were his own personal feelings. Also when Sheldon mention some good deeds about presidents like Reagan and Bush he says about one paragraph about their deeds, but when he mentions Jimmy Carter Sheldon goes on for about 3 pages which clearly shows his personal feelings for Carter. That specifically gave me some doubt on whether or not this book is &quot;on the level.&quot; Those were the main problems, but otherwise I enjoyed this book and I learned a lot from it. I feel that if I had read it without having to do a book report on it, I would probably would have enjoyed it more. Overall though it was a good effort and a nice book."},{"Title":"Get Busy, Beaver! (Book and Audio CD) (Paperback)","review":"\\"Get Busy Beaver!\\" is a book with an interesting lesson written by Carolyn Crimi and with extremely cute and pleasing illustrations by Janie Bynum. In this story, Thelonious Beaver's family is all in \\"hurry, hurry, hurry\\" mode to get their dam built, and built big. Well, all except for Thelonious himself, that is. Thelonious just can't seem to get into it. It's not really that he's lazy or anything, it's just that he keeps getting distracted by other things. He stops to watch clouds, to watch the leaves float by, or watch the winking of the fireflies. He's in love with nature --- a dreamer --- but the other beavers are so busy with the dam that they can't seem to appreciate the beauty that's all around them.Meanwhile, work on the dam continues. It's like it's never done, because it isn't just about their family. They're also in competition with the beavers across the way and so their dam is never good enough. While they slave away, Thelonious gets an idea. It's something that's going to turn everything on its ear, but also something really special.\\"Get Busy Beaver\\" is a wonderful story in a time when many could use a lesson in slowing down and taking the time to enjoy the world.

Heinlein's Stranger in a strange land","review":"Works of criticism are not my normal fare, as I rarely listen to critics of any stripe, but I do make an exception for those pieces that refer to Heinlein, as I have consistently felt that he has never gotten the deep analysis that he deserves, and what little has been done has been sloppy and wrong-headed.In my opinion, for a critical work to be worth spending money on, it must provide the following:1. New insights into the internal structure and meaning of the work in question.2. A good exposition of palpably discernable influences.3. Valid comparisons to other works in the same milieu.4. If applicable to the work in question, an investigation into the chronology of its writing and interrelationship with the author's life.5. An analysis of what the author did right and what didn't work.How does this work stack up in light of these requirements?As a starting point, this work decides that the main structure of Stranger in a Strange Land is satire, which can work under different rules than, say, a novel of manners, romance, or confession, in terms of plot, character, and a host of other factors. As one of the main elements of satire is irony, most of this work is involved in identifying specific instances of this. The authors definitively point out that much of the book depends on sets of (apparently) polar opposites: Jubal (experience) versus Mike (innocence), The Church of All Worlds (Appolonian) versus the Fosterites (Dionysian), Jill and Dawn, the Carnival (heaven ) versus the Zoo (earth), etc. Also pointed out is the Heinlein tendency to structure his works in terms of starting from a point, logically expanding from the point, and then retreating back to the original point, now from a new perspective. In terms of meaning, this work clearly catches the fact that Stranger is intended to raise questions, not provide a blueprint for a new religion, and each of the points of irony or complement pairs shown here have a clear basis in the actual work. Thus in terms of the first requirement, this work did an excellent job, and it provides a strong basis for better analysis of Heinlein's later 'World as Myth' works. As exposed here, Stranger reveals depths, meanings, and complexities that are not directly obvious, a pattern of strongly sculpted variegated positions than can be very illuminating to the reader.The authors also do a good job of pointing out the influences on Heinlein, both literary and philosophical, not just in Stranger, but in many of his other works, showing a clear line to Mark Twain, Nietzsche, James Branch Cabell, and Korzybski. The (possible) relationship to Aleister Crowley (as analysed by Whence Came the Stranger: Tracking the Metapatterns of Stranger in a Strange Land) is also examined, without any definitive conclusions, but an opinion that this connection is somewhat unlikely. Happily, the authors clearly document the line to each of these influences, and don't try to force associations that may not be real. Surprising to me, however, was that no comment was made about Rudyard Kipling, to which Heinlein's work has been compared by multiple other critics.Good comparisons are made to other satires: Gulliver's Travels, A Modest Proposal, Tristam Shandy, and several others.There is a fairly long exposition of the germination and writing history of Stranger, along with the publishing conditions Heinlein was working under at the time, all relevant to the final form of the book. However, although there is considerable surprise expressed over the fact that both the original (cut) and expanded version are selling very well side by side, there is really no analysis of the differences between the two versions. But it does quite properly de-bunk the link between Charles Manson and Stranger.The last item on my list is, unfortunately, almost totally ignored. We not only do not get an overall evaluation of how Stranger stacks up versus the rest of the literary world, there is zero discussion of the flaws of the book. Instead there is a sharp discourse on the failings of other critical looks at this book. Tackled here is Panshin's Heinlein in Dimension and William Atheling Jr.'s (James Blish) The Issue at Hand, along with several others. I re-read these works to see if the criticisms of the criticisms were valid. In general, I agree with their assessments. Re-reading Panshin was an agony - in many cases it seems that Panshin just couldn't see the forest for the trees, most notably in his consistent panning of all four of RAH's Hugo winners. The very fact that these works did take the Hugo should have at least warned Panshin that his analysis was probably lacking or incorrect. The authors of this book take Panshin to task for his identification of a single Heinlein character type, finding this to be very dubious. Blish is attacked for wrongheadly describing the book as a religious tract, with the esthetics of an engineer-turned-writer.As an added bonus, there is an appendix to this book that lists at least some of the meanings of many of the character's names in Stranger, which is important to understanding some the ideas presented in the book.This book is obviously written as if intended for use in a literature class, using the rather arcane idiom of academic criticism (which can be rough going if you're not used to it), and complete with a set of reader questions and exercises at the end of each chapter. A minor annoyance is, at several places in the book, the exact same point is made, as if for the very first time. Some better editing should have caught this. A summation assessment of how well this book is written as a totality would also have helped. But overall this book is a very good addition to the limited supply of reasonable criticism on Heinlein.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Swinger of Birches with Book","review":"This book has opend up my eyes.

For each pattern I have substituted the wool and have had much success."},{"Title":"Nursery Knits: 25 Easy-Knit Designs for Clothes, Toys and Decorations","review":"This book comes with many cute knit patterns, all of which I would consider making. (When buying books usually the case is 1 or 2 patterns worth a look, and the rest of a book turns out to be junk, as many of you know.)For once, I found all of the patterns adorable: there is a dolly, a teddy bear, blanket, hat, mittens, and so on. That being said - for as cute as the items seem to look, I have a few problems with this book.1)This book, like many others, pushes specific types of yarn and doesn't give other suggestions. For every pattern it suggests either a brand called \\"Jaeger\\" or \\"Rowan\\". The author is British, and doesn't seem to consider anyone outside of England might buy this. Personally, I've never heard of Jaeger, and haven't ever seen a store near me carry Rowan. Could these be British yarn companies, or just ones I've never seen? No idea, but she could at least say what weight yarn was used so you could substitute your own. I don't know about you - but I can't afford her pricey suggestions such as cashmere, and the ones she used aren't available to me anyways. So, you are left to assume she used a sport weight and hope yours works out the same.2)Again, this author forgets to consider outside of the UK a little. In the patterns there are first the metric measurements, and then the equal size is given in inches so they do help you out there. However, many of the patterns are made with UK size 3 mm needles. Now, if you look in the back of the book to see which UK size equals what US size, you will find a blank. This is because there is no US equivalent to UK 3mm needles, (UK 2 1/4mm = US 2 and UK 3 1/4mm = US 3). So, you are left to decide for yourself whether to use US size 2 or 3 needles and hope it works out.3)Some minor things: in the back under the helpful abbreviations page there is an error. g-st should stand for garter stitch, not grams. g stands for grams, but it says both g and g-st stand for it. I presume it's a typo. Also, as cute as the scarf and matching hat are - for a toddler I think a scarf is still somewhat of a choking hazard. In addition, I found some of the ways things are explained in this book confusing.4)There is some more guesswork in this book. I have tried out 2 patterns, the hat and also the booties, and have had problems with both. For the booties, it says work a stitch until it reaches a certain length, but neglects to specify which side of the work should be facing before you move onto the next instructions (something like \\"ending with a purl row/ or knit row\\" would be helpful).For the hat, it tells you to increase several times throughout the pattern but doesn't tell you any specific way to do it (does it want a YO increase, a cast on, a M1 ? etc). There are several ways to increase and there aren't any notes in the pattern for any particular type so you are left to come up with whatever you think is best I guess. I haven't really given any of the rest of the patterns a good look at how they are worked out, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are similar problems with the other items.Very cute patterns, but too much guesswork for me. If you are an advanced knitter, I'm sure it's easy to come up with whatever might work out a problem. But for beginners, this may give you a headache as it isn't specific at times."},{"Title":"Nursery Knits: 25 Easy-Knit Designs for Clothes, Toys and Decorations","review":"I am still quite new to knitting but I have been trying to build up my library for inspiration. If you have or know a little boy or girl I would highly recommend this book as an addition to your own library. The patterns appear to be relatively simple but are really lovely and original. The author has included a bit of everything; clothing, toys, and some really adorable decorative items for a child's room. This year I think I may try the play cubes for my son and perhaps next year for Christmas I will make him the puppet theatre. Sometimes I have a hard time finding a book that has a variety of patterns that would be appropriate for a boy and I was very pleased to find that this book has several patterns that would work for my son like the adorable 1-2-3 sweater. I'm very pleased to have purchased this book. I only gave the book a four out of five stars because I haven't yet worked the patterns and also because I noticed that the pattern for the play cubes is not really specific about what to fill them with...which overall is a very small thing but I feel worth noting."},{"Title":"Nursery Knits: 25 Easy-Knit Designs for Clothes, Toys and Decorations","review":"I really fell in love with this book. I am a young adult and my motherly instinct is kicking in. I absolutely loved the look of the baby snuggle. However, the book only came with the gauge for the smaller sized needles (which are used to create the edging on the hood and sleeves, I believe), so the main portion of the snuggle is turning out to be much too large (I calculated it out to be 36 inches!) I've only done a little more than half of the first side and I am getting so frustrated! My life would be so much easier if the gauge for both needle sizes were in the pattern instead of the gauge for the smaller needles only. This is the only pattern I really wanted to knit from the book because it is so unique to all the other baby patterns I've seen. I'm afraid that now I may have to rip out all of my work and start over with much smaller needles. I would love to know the previous reviewer's gauge as mine seems way too big for a newborn child. Maybe a 1-2 year old would fit it. I have no idea. [...]"},{"Title":"Starck's Prayer-Book","review":"When somthing is worthy of remembering bought and shared with my kids.

Compound elements (such as adjectives) are cited along with their free forms and pre-pausal forms are cited where they cannot be predicted. Short notes on pronunciation and morphology are provided. The range of vocabulary is fairly comprehensive within the limits suggested by the designation 'concise', with roughly 4800 words in each section with a one-to-one correspondence between the English-Hopi and Hopi-English sections.This is an excellent intermediate dictionary and the fact that it is two-way makes it indispensible for all learners of Hopi."},{"Title":"A Concise Hopi and English Lexicon","review":"Concise is an understatement. I was looking to translate our Indian Princess names into Hopi, since we're the Hopi tribe, and I find that there are a lot of words missing.

It really hasn't and I have had to use different words to replace them. One tribe member is called Running Pheasant. There's no word for pheasant, so he has to be Horned Owl.

It also talks about healing through the Eucharist which is important to me as a Catholic.This book also uses sound psychological concepts to help a person heal both physical and emotional hurts.

She said, \\"Of course. Go buy this book.\\" I ran to the bookstore and have been deeply indebted to the Linns ever since. This amazing book is a brilliant application of Christian concepts to psychology, and vice versa. Can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Healing Life's Hurts: Healing Memories through the Five Stages of Forgiveness","review":"First off, this book explains how Jesus healing ministry really worked. His healing was not some show off magic trick, and irrelevant today. Jesus healing power is very much alive, and scientifically legitimate. This would be great for advancements on holistic health. The book has accurate evidence of how fostering your mental and spiritual health can bring about physical healing.Secondly, this book is good for Christian counseling too. Unfortunately there are hosts of Christian counseling programs who act anything but Chritian. Unfortunately many programs have used the whole counseling based on fear, shame and guilt to get us on the right path. All this really does is promote hatred of oneself, unnecessary anxiety, and depression. With this form of Christian counseling, we are to truly get in touch with God, and ourselves in a loving matter. Instead of fear of divine retribution, we are introduced to Gods love for us. Instead of shame for our sins, we are told to love ourselves, which motivates us to overcome our sins. We are also given a blueprint on how to work through our sufferings, not wallow in them. We understand that pain is not used as a penalty, but as a source for good.Thirdly, this also has some good tips for secular psychology. I have found with pop psychology, pain and suffering are seen as evil, and should be avoided at all costs. All this does is mask the problems, or make it impossible to get past. Too often, psychologists want to analyze the problem, and try to rationalize the whole problem, without acknowledging and working throught the pain. This book shows that it is okay to suffer, and to work through our burdens. In fact, most world religions teach redemption and maturity through our sufferings.This book offers a good middle ground for both secular and religious psychology. We dont need legalistic guilt of \\"Jesus paid the price for sins, now its your turn\\", or the hip \\"Come on get happy\\" fake psychology. We are essentially shown that Jesus came to us to enter into our sufferings, and his passion was a sign of his assistance in our sufferings."},{"Title":"Healing Life's Hurts: Healing Memories through the Five Stages of Forgiveness","review":"Still working on it but getting through even though the process is slow.

While interesting in a voyeuristic, sensationalist sense, Tallant's far-too-obvious biases and penchant for letting his interview subjects give sound bites like \\"Old Marie Laveau looked just like the devil herself, and she's settin' [sic] on a throne in Hell today,\\" means that the image of Voodoo as a religion and/or money-making practice is frustratingly one-dimensional. Tallant seems content to let his interview subjects discuss the \\"devil-worshipping\\" without giving a well-rounded picture of what actually was being worshipped. He quotes newspaper articles with an almost pornagraphic fervor, and neglects to analyze the exoticism encoded into their language.The book is good as a fun, tabloidesque read, and those people who have studied Voodoo religion will be able to puzzle together rites and loa blithely corrupted due to Tallant's distance from actual services. It is also a fine study in biases of the time, but should never be read without a very LARGE grain of salt."},{"Title":"Voodoo in New Orleans","review":"Any book you see on Voodoo today, is either talking about Santeria or Haitian Voodou. Even the &quot;New Orleans Voodoo Tarot&quot; is mostly Voodoo from OUTSIDE of New Orleans. Here you will find the most mature research on Marie Laveau, which is worth the modest price of this book, alone. But you also get history that you will not find anywhere else. Tales of an entire lineage of conjure men and root doctors, the real heart of Louisiana Hoodoo. This book introduces you to men like Doctor Koku, Rooster, Papa Melon, Don Pedro and many others. If you want to see both sides of the New Orleans Voodoo coin, this is the only book that pulls back all the curtains of it's history."},{"Title":"Voodoo in New Orleans","review":"I really don't understand the negative reviews of this book at all. Even Anne Rice recommends it and what better recommendation about voodoo history in New Orleans can you get than Anne Rice!?! Yes, the story is old, but it's a fantastic look of the smaller details of a hidden culture. I love New Orleans, and Tallant's book is well researched. Why do you think it's been reprinted since the 1940s. That's staying power, people. The history of Marie Lavaeu is worth the money. This is not a book to tell you how to practice voodoo or to give you a romanticized version of the religion. This is a book which tells the evolution of a special society within a very special city.

It was originally published in the late 40's early 50's and the writing reflects this but it is so interesting. The book is full of historical anecdotes, newspaper reporting, other references. I have visited New Orleans five times pre-Katrina and I so very much wish I had read this book before going. I love New Orleans for it's marvelous blend of cultures and history. This book also communicates the struggle of Black Americans with mixed heritage. Their genius, strength and determination that is a huge part of American culture. It was a fascinating and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Voodoo in New Orleans","review":"I've done anthropological work on Voodoo practices in New Orleans, both the newer Haitian forms and the traditional religion of the faithful. As pointed out by all the scholarly reviews both back then and today, Tallant has collected an interesting set of folklore narratives about Voodoo but no actual information about the religion as it is practiced. Also, some academics have looked through his notes from his interviews and found that he later added elements to the published versions of stories to make them racier and more exciting. Therefore, folklore scholars should be careful.None of the narratives in Tallant's book match up with historical evidence for how Vodou was practiced in the times of slavery, during the time when he did his fieldwork, or in the modern context. In fact, it is so inaccurate that scholars of Vodou (such as myself) often use this book as a litmus test. If someone cites it as an accurate source of information about Vodou then you know their work is pretty much worthless/that they didn't do any fieldwork.Unfortunately, there is very little written about Vodou practices in New Orleans that is worthwhile. Most of what is out there is sensational speculation. Tallant, unfortunately, falls into that category."},{"Title":"Voodoo in New Orleans","review":"Book is a little interesting. It is sometimes confusing to read. Uses words that no longer used in 2011 so sometimes you will have no clue what you are reading. The parts that are understandable are interesting. I gave it 3 stars because the author doesn't have much facts to back up what he is writing. He interviews people who tell him 3 different stories about things that happened in new orleans and then tells the readers that he doesn't know which person is telling the truth but says any one of the stories could be truth. The book has you wondering what is the real story behind the matter they are talking about. Not enough facts. It was more of a he say she say book and figure out who might be telling the truth."},{"Title":"Voodoo in New Orleans","review":"I should preface by saying that I do not know much about VooDoo. However, from what I have gleaned so far, this book is unusual in that it gives first-person accounts of VooDoo that date back to the late 19th and early 20th century. Those who urge us to read other, perhaps more \\"accurate\\" accounts of VooDoo, seem to be referring to books which have been written far more recently, such as within the last 20 years. This book was first published in 1944 and thus has the advantage of being able to include accounts and testimony of those who actually encountered \\"Marie II\\", aka the daughter of the original VooDoo Queen of NEw Orleans, Marie Laveau.The descriptions of VooDoo given in this book are not flattering. VooDoo rituals are invariably described as involving the sacrifice of live animals, sometimes done in a cruel or beastly fashion, such as when live animals are torn apart by human teeth: \\"LIve pigeons and chickens were sometimes introduced into the rites, to be torn to pieces with the fingers and teeth of the dancers.\\" (p. 13) Live black cats are often immersed in boiling water, or slain at midnight in a graveyard. Numerous VooDoo \\"killings\\" are described. The VooDoo Queen herself is reduced by some witnesses to a glorified Madame: \\"The way I see it, that place wasn't nothing but a fancy kind of whorehouse, and Marie Laveau was the Madame.\\" (p. 85)The practice of VooDoo is depicted as mainly having to do with types of manipulative, and quite often overtly harmful magic and spells that fly directly in the face of what has come to be many a modern occultists' ethical guideline: \\"An ye harm none, do what you will.\\" VooDoo curses fly back and forth between persons who apparently do not have the psychological maturity to imagine that the misfortune they experience might be a result of their own behavior, or simply chance. In the VooDoo-saturated society of turn of the century black New Orleans, VooDoo work and \\"fixing\\" is superstitiously perceived to be at the back of every unfortunate event, and VooDoo itself is viewed by observers such as author Tallant as having power primarily over those folk who are sufficiently simple-minded to be susceptible to the self-fulfilling prophecies that suggestions of a curse can evoke. The author points out that VooDoo power apparently had little effect upon many whites, who, when finding a VooDoo \\"conjure ball\\" on their doorstep, simply swept the trash away with a contemptuous sneer. By contrast, Tallant suggests that those blacks who believed in a curse, seemed to kill themselves with their own fear.Curious readers of this highly engaging well-written, \\"I can't put it down\\" book will come away with unanswered questions, such as how it is that so many of the VooDoo spells worked, when directed at those who knew nothing of them. They may wonder with trepidation and awe, what exactly was seen, when Feltie Butler's widow observed \\"3 slimy snails and a little green frog\\" jumping out of his mouth, just before he died a \\"HooDoo death.\\" Or why Corinne Mothershed saw 8 little blue snakes leap out of her MOther's mouth, before her mother apparently died by a similar VooDoo curse. However, given the generally scary picture that's painted of VooDoo by this book (we don't see much healing or life-affirming work going on), many readers are likely to conclude that if this is VooDoo, then they'll want to distance themselves from VooDoo and its curious power."},{"Title":"Voodoo in New Orleans","review":"This book is falsified and exaggerated. The press attempted to frighten the public at the time this was published. The Voodoo's also were trying to scare \\"outsiders\\" who criticized them away with wild, false stories. Don't believe everything you read in this book. It's a hoax."},{"Title":"Voodoo in New Orleans","review":"Regardless of what anyone feels about this book , it is a time stamp in Hoodoo history. The man needs credit for attending Hoodoo meetings and facing up to the Queen's of the time for interview requests.

The first paragraph in page eleven puts the proper perspective to the changes that brought about the end of slavery: \\"Children reared by Negro nurses loved them as they did their own parents and they were served by by their Mammies and other household servants with a fierce devotion.\\"The South, though divided even as Tallant records, was the home of the co-mingling of races, though the change came even as some, then and now, perceived or perceive as one or the other of either morality or immorality.Reading this book will give you a true picture of the myths and perceptions of Voodoo, but more than that will give you a true perception of the bond of humanity, be it good or bad, moral or immoral, religious or irreligious, that has separated and, at least in this country, initiated the actions that (imperfectly, as yet) bind us together."},{"Title":"Voodoo in New Orleans","review":"Voodoo in New OrleansThis is an old classic which, if you are interested in either \\"Voodoo\\" or New Orleans, you probably should read.

And the great part is that you can still have fun even when you do not like it. I read this book before I visit New Orleans and it is resourceful to provide some materials to impress your knowledge of New Orleans. That is always welcome. And the author tells the stories light and relaxed. You can have a good time reading it."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"The set-up was a little weird and random but the writing was excellent. It was fun to read."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"I received a copy of Letters from New Orleans a little over a month before Hurricane Katrina blew in. Rob Walker and his girlfriend moved from New York to New Orleans and found them in a whole different world. Unlike many modern municipalities which have interchangeable commerce, social settings, government, and seem to be cookie cutter cities, New Orleans is its own world. Life has a slower pace, rules are more relaxed, and the good life is not reserved only for the wealthy (though it helps). Photos without the book add flavor and illustrate that often content is more valued than appearance. Walker highlights some of the gems of the city, the music, the traditions, the food, the welcoming atmosphere along with the political corruption,everyday crime, and devil may care city planning. Walker and E don't hesitate to immerse themselves in daily life. This is a book rich in description and the author shows a real affection for the people and city, despite its quirks. Not only do I reread this from time to time, I have given several copies to friends."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"This book started out as a nice snapshot of the characters in New Orleans. About halfway in, it devolved into a sociology disseration on the racial/class ills of the city. I grew up there and am well aware of the problems. Some of the ideas put forth by the author were simplistic at best. Otherwise, a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"Wow! It's like they transplanted someone from Kansas to the epitone of hip cities. There is no sweat, no sips on a hurricane. There is no funk! This is not a city that can be described from the passerby. You might know the names, know the places, but you ain't experienced a thang. You gotta step on a Coke cap and do a little soft shoe. You gotta bar hop, swipe your brow with a hanky in a smoky club where the jazz is the only thing hotter than the weather. You gotta suck a neck of a crawldaddy, eat rice and beans on laundry day. This is a city of great storytellers, and this ain't one of them!"},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"Rob Walker may use his day job as a New York Times Magazine Columnist to support himself, but with the publication of LETTERS FROM NEW ORLEANS he clearly steps into the arena of fine writers whose messages stand solidly on their own. This collection of shared letters via email does not come across as yet another Blog site, but instead reveals a writer of sensitivity of observation, calm excitement of discovery, and an artist who can enter a space apparently foreign to him and make it not only his experience but also that of his reader.This too short book covers a period of time when Walker moved to New Orleans and adapted to the idiosyncrasies of that magical city in daily exploration of its peculiar wonders. With his companion 'E' he attends a New Orleans church service (as the only white people present) and learns to appreciate the gospel singing, the attire and the unconditional love that pours from the congregation; he dresses for Carnivale and participates in the traditions of bead throwing and costuming that have only been images in films and photos; he takes us on a journey through the celebration of a New Orleans funeral - which is anything but morose - and teaches us about the 'cemeteries' of tombs above ground in this city below sea level; he ponders on the traditions of firing guns into the sky to celebrate most any event; he explores the famous 'St James Infirmary' of song fame, sharing the origins of the place and the myths; and he mixes with the people in this city of poverty of pocketbook but wealth of mind.Reading Rob Walker could be experienced as a prelude (or postlude) to appreciating the art of Tennessee Williams and the Jazz Greats. His technique in writing is to keep it simple and observational, and in doing so he raises his writing to the level of poetry - succinct with themes and variations that always return us to the spirit of one of America's most treasured cities. Highly recommended reading. Grady Harp, February 08"},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"Rob Walker's LETTERS FROM NEW ORLEANS is part travelogue, part memoir with a little social commentary thrown in for good measure. According to the introduction, this book grew out of actual letters he began writing to friends after he and a girl friend identified only as \\"E\\" moved to New Orleans in early 2000. Four years later the couple left the city \\"for reasons that remain unclear.\\" Since they at first were not meant for publication, perhaps that is why these meandering letters are so wondrously conversational and totally unself-conscious. To a letter, they are a delight to read and made me want to revisit this most European of U. S. cities.Mr. Walker covers some of the subjects usuallly associated with New Orleans: Mardi Gras, jazz funerals, fine dining, the French Quarter and the relentless humidity. Although he obviously loves this city, he does not shy away from writing about the blight of public housing, urban decay and the fragile balance of race relations. The book is chock-full of both memorable characters and places. Whether they got that way on their own or were made that way by Mr. Walker's pen, it really doesn't matter. We meet Ernie K-Doe, the R & B singer who gave us the hit \\"Mother-in-Law,\\" whose funeral Walker writes about. And Galatorie's, the restaurant that fired a popular waiter-- who apparently couldn't keep his hands off women diners-- and so incensed its clientele that the article covering the firing in THE TIMES-PICAYUNE generated more reader comments than any subject since September 11. Don't forget the part-time embalmer at the funeral home Over by Rhodes and fulltime cashier at the grocery store Save-A Center. Or the notorious Gennifer Flowers. I feel better knowing she wound up in a club in the French Quarter where she now occasionally holds court, sings a little and will be photographed with you for $6.00. It seems appropriate that her now club once was a bar with what the writer describes as a \\"high-end whorehouse\\" upstairs.The author is nothing is not thorough. In one of the longest chapters in his book, he tells us everything we ever wanted to know-- and then some-- about the song \\"St. James Infirmary.\\" Although I had never heard of the song before, I'm going to find the Harry Connick version and see what the fuss is all about. Mr. Walker is that good at making his case for this music.One of the most intriguing things about the LETTERS is that Mr. Walker never tells the name of the woman who is living with him although he mentions her constantly. She is simply \\"E.\\" Elvira, Emily, Evangeline? We do not have a clue as to what the \\"E\\" stands for. Since he tells us that she left a good job in New York City to move to New Orleans with him, we are probably safe in assuming that he is not guilty of transporting a minor across state lines. On the other hand, perhaps, as Garrison Keillor would say, E thought she could do better and insisted on remaining anonymous.Finally, although there are many interesting photographs scattered throughout the book, we never see a picture of the author. Most readers want to see what a writer they like looks like-- and like Mr. Walker you will. LETTERS FROM NEW ORLEANS is a fascinating, informative read."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"I've collected dozens of books about New Orleans, all in an attempt to further my understanding of the mysterious love affair so many of us have with the Crescent City.In \\"Letters From New Orleans,\\" Walker examines his own love affair by crafting slice-of-life vignettes shot through with the kind of colors and detail that make the reader want to tumble right down the rabbit hole with him.Walker gets gets off Bourbon Street and gets real. \\"Letters From New Orleans\\" is personal and yet has wonderful, broad appeal owing to Walker's skill as a writer and storyteller. One need not have lived there or even visited to enjoy this book, but those who have had the pleasure of New Orleans, will be further delighted (and educated). It left me wanting more. I've read it three times; I'll read it again.As for books about New Orleans, this little gem is a huge must. It captures the wackiness, the peculiarities, the enchantment and the \\"je ne sais quoi\\" that makes this American city unlike all the others. Rob Walker is donating the proceeds to hurricane relief efforts, which makes reading it even sweeter."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"It may have taken a hurricane for Rob Walker's \\"Letters from New Orleans\\" to get the attention it deserves, but if anything uplifting came out of Katrina, it's this book. New Orleans, as he deftly observes, is a place that tosses tradition up in the air, lets it crash back to earth and institutionalizes the wreckage. Where else could wacky traditions like jazz funerals or house burnings along the levee as a Christmas Eve celebration come from? Walker digs beneath the banality of Mardi Gras, Bourbon Street and Girls Gone Wild to expose the city's heart -- its people, from fringe to establishment, with the fresh eye of a rapt outsider. It's the best book I've read about New Orleans in a long, long time -- and I live here."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"There are those kinds of fans of New Orleans (see review below) who lack the ability to see beyond the tourist-ridden cliches and preconceived ideas of stumbles through the French Quarter and the local hangover eats of their frat boy reminiscences. They cannot conceive of New Orleans as anything but a theme park with a 10 song Jazz soundtrack loop, populated by grinning, drunken, performing stereotypes, doing things that you're apt to see in a marketing video for the city. This book is not for them.There is of course, nothing wrong with sucking crawfish heads or red beans and rice, or all the bars everybody already knows about. It's just that Walker realizes there's nothing new to say about these things, and chooses to look beyond the obvious.This beautiful, thoughtful collection is produced by a writer with the imagination and intelligence to see past the prepackaged notions of a city that is so much richer, funkier and more interesting than a buggy ride through the French Quarter, funny costumes, and an appreciation for a few quirky local customs we're all familiar with by now.Walker looks into the crevices, and behind the curtains of the typical tourist facade (sometimes perpetrated and beloved as often by locals as the tour books) to see what we didn't expect, what we haven't already heard a thousand times. New Orleans IS a special place, but one that is filled with real human beings, with lives and relationships that are shaped, complicated and sometimes warped by the realities of a very specific environment.Yes there are colorful characters, see especially chapters about Ernie K-Doe and Gennifer Flowers, but in this book they are not just cardboard cutouts speaking with funny accents, part of the same backdrop as the pretty, antique architecture, but rather actual 3-dimensional human beings with real stories of their own. Yes, there is mention of parades and carnival balls, but it's not just mindless spectacle, it's an examination of the meaning of the customs to outsiders and insiders, and the structure of a pretty unusual social system.This is not a book for those wanting to check items off of a list of what they already think they know. Yup, Cafe du Monde is charming, uh-huh, tap-dancing-little-boy with coke-bottle caps on shoes wants your money, right-o, hurricanes will get you loaded fast, check, people get naked and drunk at Mardi Gras, mm hmm, yup. It wasn't written to reassure you that what you believe is correct, to validate your fondness for the familiar.This is not a book for those attached to looking at New Orleans through bleary, soft-focus lenses. It is for readers who want to see the city for its more complicated, uglier, stranger, fascinating and consequently more beautiful self."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"In my 65+ years, New Orleans is the place I have returned to most often, almost like a second home. This compilation of writings--done before Katrina--echo mine experiences so closely, I get the feeling that the \\"Spell\\" of this great city affects others like it did and does me.I was in New Orleans when as Katrina approached and the Mayor urged visitors to leave. I was lucky to get three connecting flights home to California. \\"Letters from New Orleans\\" was like a balm which I needed to feel something other than sorrow."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"Through a series of essays, Rob Walker has captured elements of New Orleans that are rarely, if ever, written about. Walker shows what it is like to live in a city that steals your heart and breaks it at the same time. While one essay may be about Mardi Gras Indians, and another about Galatoire's Restaurant, what each essay is really about is the character of the people and the character of this unique city. New Orleans is not the city of television and movies. It is a poor, dying city selling itself as a carnival and barely hanging on. As Walker has captured in these essays, when you live in New Orleans, you feel so many emotions toward the city: love, excitement, anger, aggravation and, ultimately, sadness. I highly recommend this book as a way to see into the real New Orleans, the one where people live and work; the one that has nothing to do with Bourbon Street and drunken Frat boys."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"If you've yet to visit New Orleans, the candid \\"snapshots\\" of Walker's letters will surely entice. If you're familiar with the city, you'll nod your head & sigh in remembrance - & hope for the future to be as sadly sweet & savory - & unsavory; yeah that, too, as the past. These \\"letters\\" capture the crazy ambience of the whole package perfectly.I am curious about one small detail, why DID the author leave?"},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"This is real New Orleans. It's not a guide book. It's a take on the spirit of place that is the unique city of New Orleans. If you want a genuine feel for the city by someone who's lived there for a few years, buy it. More than ever, we all need to learn more about the fathomless Crescent City of the Moon."},{"Title":"Letters from New Orleans","review":"I've never drunk and eaten my way through an hours' long lunch at Galatoire's. I don't own a white suit nor do I normally hang out in jazz clubs. Sleazy bars may possess charms, but I seldom indulge. I've never dug the Comus or Zulu krewes or jumped for mass-produced Chinese beads in the streets. This is all because I've never been to New Orleans. But I've done the next best thing---read Rob Walker's LETTERS FROM NEW ORLEANS. What I liked about Walker's emailed letters to his family and friends that later got collected into a slim volume is that they offer a view of the city that is far more sombre and penetrating than the one we used to get before Katrina turned the place into a bad news hub. Yeah, \\"The Big Easy\\" definitely had its downside even before floods killed hundreds and destroyed the low-lying sections. Murder in the projects was not unknown pre-Katrina, corruption, decay, and poverty ruled much of New Orleans behind the tourist glitz. Your quaint atmosphere of down-at-heel tradition rested on the stunted lives of a lot of black folks who were caught in an old web. I never had a great desire to visit the place, not thinking someone else's misfortune very picturesque. Still, reading Walker's letters, I felt that I got the feel of it---small details, a chance conversation that you might not have elsewhere, strange characters in electric blue suits, church music. He doesn't intrude much into his descriptions, yet you feel that he liked the place, he didn't judge it with the amused or jaundiced eye of many others. Small incidents reveal many facets of the city---the controversy over a fired waiter, explorations of a freeway ramp, attending a jazz funeral, a burning teddy bear at an annual bonfire. I liked the conclusions Walker drew--not sweeping, drastic ones, but more like collections of observations and questions left to the reader. The small black and white photographs that fill the book are strangely obtuse. They hint at things rather than illustrate them grandly and perhaps that sums up this charming little book.P.S. If you ever wanted to know stuff about the song \\"St. James' Infirmary\\" but were afraid to ask, rest easy. It's all in here."},{"Title":"The Gnashing of Teeth","review":"From the first pages of the book, Gnashing of Teeth, I fell head first into the story of a young man's journey. Tim's departure from home for the unknown, the bravery and terror he faced at the front lines of the Korean War, the love he felt for a young woman, and finally his homecoming after the war. I was made to feel what Tim felt, fear, bravery, sadness and joy. I was moved to tears when after all Tim went through his homecoming was not what he expected. A must read for all those who served in the military and all those connected to someone who has."},{"Title":"The Gnashing of Teeth","review":"This book would make a great movie! The author's a natural storyteller but also a masterful writer who keeps the story rolling in this never boring tale of how a young American lived through and was changed by being drafted to fight on the front during the Korean War.I felt like I was right in the trenches! There was a constant fear of attack by the suicidal Chinese enemy who always came in darkness. You could feel the vulnerability and terror of being overrun by endless waves of quilted jackets bent on killing you. There's also the slow torture of no showers or clean clothes, your skin inflamed, stinking, even rotting in places as a result.Add to this the sense of injustice that your peers back home were spared all of this if they could afford to escape in college. Meanwhile, you get a whopping $12 dollars extra a month for combat duty.Interwoven in all the strife are camaraderie and periods of sensual romance at home and in the Orient.This is the best book I've ever read about soldiering and a wartime experience.I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"The cruelty that Francis Bok experienced at age seven--and which he recounts here--defies civilized human conception. One day in 1986, his mother Marial sent him to Nyamlell's market from their Southern Sudan Dinka village of Gourion to sell eggs and peanuts. His father Pial Bol Buk had recently called Francis \\"Muycharko\\" --- \\"like twelve men.\\" He would be successful and achieve something important.Eventually, as this book bears out, his father's hope proved prophetic. But in 1986 Francis could count to no more than ten and still played alweth and Madallah --- Dinka hide-and-seek and cricket. His mother sent older friends to supervise his first independent market trip.The Catholic boy nicknamed Piol, for rain, that day lost his childhood and world to the murahaliin. After torching the nearby villages and slaying their inhabitants, 20 light-skinned Juur horsemen charged into Nyamlell. They severed the heads of all Dinka men with single sword strokes, left them rolling in the blood-soaked market dust and stole Piol's older friends Abuk, Kwol and Nyabol. A rifleman permanently silenced a crying girl with a bullet to her head. A swordsman sliced off her sister's leg at the thigh. Francis tried to flee. Terror squelched his cries. He was halted at gunpoint, grabbed and slung astride a small saddle, crafted specifically (as he later recognized) to carry abducted children, and ridden far north.Bok recounts the role he played in pushing President Bush to toughen and sign the Sudan Peace Act on October 18, 2002. As he points out, this made Americans increasingly aware of Sudanese Islamic government support for mass enslavement and genocide of Southern Sudanese Christians and animists.But as he also notes, while there may be some kind Muslims, the ongoing genocide against 2 million Southern Sudanese Dinka is merely a modern manifestation of Islamic tradition in Sudan and elsewhere throughout North Africa.Francis Bok recognized in his treatment an institutionalized cruelty. He was beaten, forced to tend and sleep with animals, fed rotting meat, and cursed as a jedut --- maggot --- even after his master pressed a Muslim name and prayers on him. Abdul Rahman ironically means \\"servant of the compassionate one.\\" But there was not one second of compassion during Bok's 10 years of captivity, although he was one of the lucky ones.He many times tried to escape, and failed. His penalties were mere beatings. Other Dinka escapees routinely lost their limbs when recaptured. Giemma Abdullah threatened the same; Bok didn't believe him, until he saw other Dinkas, limbless. Finally, at 17, Francis Bok took the cows one morning, and from the road near their grazing area ran all the way to Mutari. After further privations and imprisonments, Bok finally hid in a truck en route to ed-Da'ein, fled to Khartoum, to Cairo, and as a refugee, in 1999, to the U.S. He landed in the U.S. poor, illiterate, and 20.But Bok admits that he was like all its victims unaware of the jihad institution's name or history. During 10 long years of enslavement by Giemma Abdullah in Kerio, Bok learned that the Arabic word abeed carried three meanings --- \\"slave,\\" \\"black\\" and \\"filth.\\" Half his lifetime among Muslims taught him that they considered themselves better than Southern Sudanese infidels. But this hardly educated him on the institution to which his 20th century captors and masters subjected him.The privations Bok suffered and the constant jihad in Sudan are typical of those suffered by non-Muslims, as pre-eminent Islamic scholar Bat Ye'or notes inThe Decline of Eastern Christianity. Rudolf C. Slatin'sFire and Sword in the Sudan: A Personal Narrative of Fighting and Serving the Dervishes, 1879-1895, recounts 10 years of captivity by Khalifa Abdullah, searching for slaves and booty in Christian and animist regions. One finds similar accounts by Greek historian Speros Vryonis Jr. and in Nobel laureate Ivo Andric's 1924 Ph.D. thesis,The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia under the Influence of Turkish Ruleand in October 20, 2003 issue of the Vatican-vetted La Civilt&agrave; Cattolica.Francis Bok's book recounts his journey to freedom, education and the fulfillment of his father's dreams. This account resounds with the voice of twelve men, speaking as it does for the enslaved Dinka masses, still suffering razzias in Southern Sudan --- and for non-Muslim dhimmis across time.--Alyssa A.

Not only does he tell HIS truth--but he also tells the truth of all of us who are both black and Sudanese. This is a remarkable book, one that should be important to ALL humanity, because in the larger sense, it is not just about being black or being Dinka in Sudan, it is not just about slavery...it is about human beings failing to honor and cherish the lives...of other human beings. This is one of the best books of the year!!!As an Arab/Oromo woman born in Omdurman--and as a Northerner--I would like to testify and back up Mr. Bok's truth, because I personally witnessed much of what he writes about in his book.of course.I witnessed entirely different events at an entirely different time, because being the daughter of an Arab Egyptian, I was able to see the slave movement from its \\"infancy\\"--before it became visible and I was also an 8 year old child playing in the home of Dr. John Garang as my father, Garang (a Dinka) and other Arabs discussed at great length...what would years later become the SPLA....PLEASE BUY IT RIGHT NOW!

Bok was taken into slavery at age 7, after a jihadist raid on his village in the Sudan that left his entire family dead. (With one exception, as he movingly reveals late in the book.) After ten years in captivity and living in an animal shed, he escaped and eventually came to the US. This book should be read by everyone, including younger readers, because it's a first-person account of something that most of us think was abolished in the 19th century, but in fact continues to this day. The author does public speaking and I hope our church will invite him to talk to our congregation. An amazing, moving story of imprisonment and triumph."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"This is an absolutely moving description of modern slavery. It could have easily been written to include grisly details of specific tortures that Bok and others suffered. But, this story's purpose is not to be shocking or voyeuristic. Instead, it is meant to inform the world about what most of us think ended hundreds of years ago. Sensationalism is not necessary. The indignities inherent in slavery, the sorrows of stolen lives, and the struggle for freedom are heartrending in themselves. And, there is always the understanding that as horrendous as his life of slavery was, millions of others continue to live even harsher lives enslaved.It is a shame that the situation is not well-known. Obviously, people should work as vehemently against slavery today as they ever did before. Though the book ultimately urges activism, simply being knowledgeable of this issue is undoubtedly a tremendous step forward."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"We have all heard tales of slavery through the past centuries. This is an account of slavery today. The young Francis Bok was captured and enslaved at age 7, and was not able to escape for ten years. This book tells of the survival of that child, and of his becoming a man.While the horrifics of slavery and all it entails are important, and very much a part of this book, there is something else to me that stands out, that makes it important to read.The childhood of the young Francis for the first seven years is the basis of his will, strength and ability to survive his captivity. The loving up-bringing from his family, extended family and friends gave him the strength to survive."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"When I started this book, I'd heard of Sudan, but didn't know exactly where it was. I'd heard of the Dinka's, but knew little about them. I'm reminded daily on the radio of how awful we Americans are and how we should be punished for every having had slaves. This book told an awful truth about the existence of slavery alive today, all around the world, about children losing their limbs, about little girls being raped and stolen from their families. But this book also told a wonderful story about America and its open arms and the possibilities, the wonders, awaiting everyone who is blessed to live here. It told about how accepting, and welcoming Americans are, how the jobs are out there, of the precious value of our education system and so much mroe. Of course, there's a lot that needs fixing, but this book gives such wonderful hope to all who read it. And it blesses us with an introduction to an inspiring, strong, moral young man Mr. Buk."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"I ran into this book at a local store this weekend. I saw the word slavery and looked at the person on the front cover and was surprised that the picture was not medieval but one of a modern looking young gentleman. I went on to buy the book which I read with heightened interest within five hours. I admire Francis' strong will and determination for a better life for his people and his pursuit for peace in his country. I am Kenyan. A luo to be precise. Our tribe migrated from the Sudan about 500 years ago in the wake of war and famine. As I read this book I noticed that some of the Dinka names are ours which means that I may be a descendant of a Dinka. I am therefore shocked and appalled at what is going on at my old home. I don't know why my country never publicized this war while I was growing up. (I was twelve in 1986)."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"A relative gave me this book, and it sat for months on my shelf unread. It was hard to get up the motivation to read what I thought was a chronicle of poverty and disease, oppression and struggle. I never felt that there was an appropriate moment to pick up the book and delve into that world.Boy, I was stupid. One day I just picked up the book, and within 24 hours I had read the entire thing. It's well-written, flows easily, and Mr. Bok, while letting us know the details of his slavery and capture, does not exploit them. While the conditions of his life as a slave are shocking, his escape and success in the United States are even more so. Reading about Mr. Bok's journey through the Sudan, Egypt and Fargo, North Dakota (yes, you read it correctly) is a fascinating look into how one man can work to save his people. It is also a unique look at the growth of a human being, the challenges of entering a new culture, and a reminder that every single person, no matter how old, deserves the right to life-long education. I thank Mr. Bok for his courage, and his mentors for providing us with this story.Any glance at the news is reminder that slavery and conflict in the sudan STILL EXIST TODAY. American foreign policy exists outside of the scope of the Middle East, and I hope this memoir will serve to make more people aware of the horrible human rights abuses that continue, and they will pressure Western governments to provide more relief to Sudanese refugees, and encourage peace and development in the region.As a former teacher, I would recommend this book to any high school or program. I understand there is also an educational text offered to accompany it. There are some interesting anecdotes about Mr. Bok's experiences as a 21-year-old student in a classroom full of high-school drop-outs; it might spark interesting discussion to a classroom with unmotivated students."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"Two days ago I began to read \\"Escape from Slavery\\". I have hardly wanted to set it down since I picked it up. I have been saddened but incredibly inspired. I am forcefully reminded that freedom is a miracle too easily taken for granted. Until this week, I admit I was completely ignorant of Sudan, let alone the plight of it's people. In fact, I only knew Sudan was another big country \\"somewhere in Africa\\". This book is not a history of Sudan, but it does put it on the map for you. It does not try to expound on all of the political issues, but it paints a very human picture of how the government affects the people. This is one young man's compelling account of his early life and journey as a slave in Sudan. It is told in a simple, clear and honest voice. For me, Sudan is now the birthplace of Piol Bol Buk - known today as \\"Francis Bok\\". It is the place where Piol laughed and played with his family. He made clay cows with his friends, and dreamed of being like his father. It is the place where Piol was entrusted one day to take his mother's produce to sell at the market...and would never return. Here was a little boy forced to witness unspeakable violence, and who had everything taken away from him. However, no one could take his indomitable spirit. Sudan is a place where innocent lives are crushed every day, and yet it is also the place where Francis Bok was created. Francis humbly and painstakingly details his escape, the agonizing immigration process, and the miraculous turn of events that ensued. Francis has begun to fulfill his father's prophesy that someday he would do \\"great and important things\\" and would have the strength of \\"twelve men\\". This is a story about slavery, but it is really a story about hope, faith, will-power and determination. It is a miraculous story. Who could have imagined that this young boy with no hope of survival would make such a huge impact for his country already? Truly inspirational! This is a testament that the human spirit can survive unspeakable things - and then can rise from the ashes. When you find a story like this, you just can't wait to share it with the world! Francis Bok lived through such horrific pain, and yet now we have the chance to listen to his story, and to make a difference in the world just like he has. I hope that you will choose to read this story. I know that you will be so grateful!"},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"Frances Bok lived through what so many of us don't even know still exists. Brought up in rural Sudan, his village was raided, most of the adults killed, and most of the children taken into slavery. Frances was 7 when this happened and forced to live through horror after horror without any kindness, any love, without any affection.Frances saw adults and children brutally murdered and it was clear to him that fighting back would cause him to also be one of the casualties.Frances was kept in a barn, given scraps of food to eat, refused any kindness. Even the children of his captor were horrible to him. What kept Frances going was the love that had been given to him before captivity and the belief that some of his family may have survived. Indeed, there is a bittersweet ending to Bok's story.Frances, gratefully and amazingly, does escape and live to share his memoir. When I read this book last year, I participated on a message board. I tried to share this book with educated people who adamantly refused to recognize that this story isn't all that unusual. This is STILL happening today. The perpetrators of these crimes are from a culture that devalues those that are different. Slavery, genital mutilation, abuse to women, honor killings. . . it seems as if, although we hear of these stories on a daily basis, we are still reluctant to characterize the culture as faulty. And, so it continues."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"My only problem with Francis Bok's story is that it took me so long to finally hear it. It is eye-opening and inspiring. A very quick read, that will leave you wanting to meet and listen to this amazing man."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"I hoped to be enamored of this book. Unfortunately, it fell way short. Basically, Escape from Slavery is a Cliff Notes version of what could have been a much more compelling account of a nation that has lived a hell.Francis Bok is a Dinka who was enslaved for ten years, from the age of seven to seventeen, in northern Sudan where he was subject to beatings and raw treatment from an Arab family. The father had capture Bok in southern Sudan during one of many raids made by the powerful Islamic forces of the north on the Christian and animist people of southern Sudan.After escaping, Bok traveled to Khartoum and then onto Cairo where he was given a coveted UN Refugee card, allowing him transport to any country that would take him in. Fortunately for Bok, a Lutheran group sponsored him and placed him in Fargo, North Dakota. He moved to Ames, Iowa after six months to be closer to other Dinka. Eventually his story made its way to a Boston-based anti-slavery group who convinced him to tell his story. In less than a year he was speaking to the Congressional committees in Washington about his story. His climax was an invitation to the signing ceremony of the Sudan Peace Act, a somewhat flawed piece of legislation aimed at ending the debilitating civil war in Sudan but a positive step nonetheless. Today Bok continues his work as a spokesperson for anti-slavery forces. I wish him the best.However, this book is not the best. While I am sure it is faithful to his story, it is weak and very thin. Edward Tivnan, the real writer, takes a couple of political pot shots at the Khartoum government that is dominated by Moslems but he never gives the reader a fully balanced and historical account of the conflict raging in Sudan. Because of this, Escape from Slavery only marginally advances our knowledge of the deep and powerful forces that shape the conflict in Sudan. If Bok and Tivnan intended to expand knowledge of the war and grace reader's minds with the tools necessary to rationally comprehend what is happening, they have missed their mark. The southern Sudanese have a telling story to tell and Bok's account of his time in captivity is compelling and important to communicate. Regrettably, this book could have been much more."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"contineously zionest snakes spit out their poisons. One reviewer wrote &quot;the Arabs have been trading christian slaves for 1500 years ago&quot;, well, 1500 years ago THERE WAS No Islam and No arabs there and no Chrestians. The people of that regions are African tribes whom adopted Arab language. That happened several hundered of years ago. YOU CANT SAY about all East African nations they are HALF ARABS - because half the SWAHILY language is Arabic. Since the down of history it has been the custom among premative tribes (and old civilizations) to enslave war prisoners and/or their families, or chlderen. Let it be not far of your assumptions that Mr Danka wouldn't be there if it wasn't for his slavery, no praising this doomed costum , but it is highly propable that he would have died after loosing his family with starvation or became a baby solider in Karank army and died in battels.The book did not address how rehtric christians supported slavery by buying slaves to free them , did not discuss how pagan groups where forced to be cristians."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"I heard Francis Bok speak in Washington DC a few years ago and so I knew his basic story about being a slave for ten years. But even already having heard his story, the details he goes into in this book still brought me to tears! His will to survive makes Francis a roll model to freedom loving people everywhere. This book will make you cry along with Francis when he learns why he is a slave, but then also laugh along with him when he moves to America and learns about things like pizza and snow. This book is a \\"must read\\" and a \\"must give\\" to everyone on your holiday list this year!"},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"People must read this book and share with friends and family. So much horror is going on in this world, and reading Francis Bok's tale of slavery IN THIS DAY AND AGE is staggering and a shock to the system regarding the lack of heart and soul of his capturers, and those that are still enslaving people. WE CAN HELP--just read the book!"},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"So it's the 20th century, slavery was abolished more then a century ago right? Wrong as is made plainly clear in this extraordinary story of struggle and survival. This is the story of the Sudan where for the last 1500 years Arab slave traders have been enslaving Christian and animist Africans. In modern times no effort has been made by anyone including the west or the U.N to outlaw slavery and slave trading in the Sudan. Other African countries are no longer plagued by European and Arab slavers but the Sudan is still beset by this evil.The author was born in the Sudan where slave traders raided his village, murdered the men and enslaved the women and children. The Women were used to sexual recreation for rich Arabs while the boys were used for simple housework. The author explains the terrifying events he experienced and his struggle to try and escape his sadistic masters. The author finally managed to escape and immigrate to the United States where he has worked to expose the world to the trauma of ongoing slavery in Africa. He exposes with brilliant language, reminiscent of Fredrick Douglas, the horrors of slavery.This is an important book. Few know anything about Africa and even less is known about the continuing aspects of Arab slave trading which are brought to light in this important and seminal work. A wonderful piece of literature about an obscure subject, an easily readable account, a necessary addition to any library."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"This is a powerful book. It is written in a clear and engaging style. It is important that people know about the human rights abuses going on in Sudan. Mr. Bok's story does this in a meaningful and moving way."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"I have taken particular interest in the situation in Sudan for months now. Whenever I think of it I get enraged, the whole animal in me comes out. I read the book and was simply incensed! Francis Bok is a man worth twelve men, if not more. He is brave, handsome, and his courage is worth emulating.I am wondering why the world is doing nothing about this. The slavery in Sudan is a centuries-old practice of genocide. It's shameful that the Western media would rather televise naked Dinka men wrestling and drinking milk--and yet the world is oblivious to how these people have been torn..literally - by slavery, famine, and war.The Dinka, Shilluk, Nuer, and other tribes in Southern Sudan are an African treasure and people today should be doing more. It's unfortunate that people would just rather avoid the situation and question whether or not it's genocide.Time is running out!"},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"Francis Bok was only seven years old when he was kidnapped in his southern Sudan village and forced into slavery by a brutal Arab Muslim farmer in the north. Sadly his tale of slavery and torture is only one example of the centuries old practice of slavery and genocide during Sudan's war between the Arab Muslim north and African Christian south. His master treated Francis poorer than his livestock and he was often given garbage and rotten food to eat. He was virtually cut off from other young Dinka slaves in the area and as a result was forced to withdraw into his own mind for survival.One of the truly remarkable aspects of this book is Francis' positive attitude throughout his ordeal. He never lost hope of escaping and creating a better life for himself. Although he was forced into slavery for ten years and lost contact with his tribe customs and language he never lost his will and determinism to learn about his culture after he was free. Additionally I was impressed with his sense of helping others who are victims of Sudan's war and sending back money to friends in Egypt who were denied United Nations refugee status. In the United States where individualism is the way of life it is refreshing to read how Francis reached out to help others instead of falling into a trap of only caring for himself.ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY is a contemporary narrative that effectively shatters the myth that slavery is a problem of the past. It is sad that the world has kept silent about the appalling problems in Sudan. Time is past due for humanity to stop the needless slaughter of innocent southern Sudanese by their northern neighbors. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"I found that this book was very well written, and was written with a great deal of detail. Although I think the book was well written i also think it is very bias towards the northern Sudanese peoples. I, being from North Sudan, know that the northeners of Sudan have made a great deal of mistakes in the past, but i feel as if the book portrayed my peoples as savages. I'm not saying that we are all angels and indeed some are savages but North Sudanese have a beautiful culture which was not portrayed in the book. There are many northeners trying to bring the civil war in Sudan to an end, and i have a great number of aunts and auncles who are living in Canada and The U.S. as refugees from Sudan because of there beliefs of what is going on in Sudan and their views towards the Sudanese government. I also have some who are still in Sudan ad fighting for the south.This book is still a great book and should be read by all to show that slavery does still exsist in Sudan and many other parts of the world and some one should do something about it. I wish Francis the best of luck in his future and would like to invite him over to meet my family and have some tea to see Northern Sudanese culture at its finest.Asim Musa"},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"I read this book for one of classes and I must say that while I tend not to be a fan of non-fiction I was completed enamored by this book. Bok wrote a very engaging story about his life and his involvement in making a difference in what is occurring in Sudan. I liked so many things about this book. It was a personal story. Someone really overcoming the odds placed against him. A true underdog story. The story was heart-wrenching in parts, especially when confronted with the truth about slavery in Southern Africa. I couldn't have more respect for Bok, he overcame horrific hardships and continues speaking out. I really reccomend this book!"},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"this is the story of what happened to one little boy,who was kidnapped from a loving family in the Sudan, and forced to become a slave at age seven.

I never even knew slavery still exisited; however, it still does! This specific book examines slavery in Sudan with Piol Bok Buk (Chrisitan Name: Francis). This is a story about Piol, who innoncently goes to the market -to a village not far from his own. He is very excited that he finally gets to go by himself, but hes going with some cousins. He went to the market only to be raided my Sudaneese muslims from the North. Francis was in captivitiy for 10 years after 3 escape attempts, its a charm! Francis then moves to Egypt to try to get passage to a different country as a U.N. Refugee. He is granted to the United States. The last half of the book focuses primarily on his life in the United States, and what is happening now. It is really a remarkable book, and I STRONGLY recommend it!

He spent 10 years enslaved, suffering frequent beatings and, perhaps worse, almost total isolation, until his escape in 1996. Resettled in America, in Fargo, North Dakota, he put his energies into learning two new cultures, the American, and the Dinka culture he had had snatched from him.America was a shock in almost every way - the food, the language, the freedom, and the pace. Of his first job in a pallet factory, Bok says, \\"For ten years I had been forced to work with Giemma's animals, but not once had I returned home as weary and dirty as I was every night after a shift in the pallet shop.\\"But there was more to come. Feeling his way, Bok quits his job, finds a new one, locates a group of Dinka in Ohio, moves there, acquires one job, then a second, saves for an apartment, makes more friends and discovers contentment. Only to give it all up to move to Boston and become an anti-slavery activist. Despite his total lack of schooling and English, Bok spoke at churches and schools, testified before the Senate and called on two presidents to act. Meanwhile he attended school, and it wasn't easy to place a 6-foot-6 non-English speaker without a first-grade education.Bok's memoir is told in simple, matter-of-fact prose, and the horror and pathos come through all the more strongly for being understated. Throughout his captivity, he slept in a barn, was not spoken to except as related to his work, and was not allowed to associate with any other slaves. He learned Arabic by force of will and kept himself going with thoughts of his parents. Only in America did he find out they had died in the raid.And it's in America that he learns the history of his war-torn country, which he relates briefly, illuminating an old culture clash over land that intensified with British colonization and has since been manipulated into a war between Arabs and Africans, Christians and Muslims.Bok's strength, melancholy and sense of wonder come through on every page, whether he's describing the joy of shopping for hip-hop clothes, the taunts of American classmates, or the awe of speaking before the Senate or meeting President Bush. A heartbreaking and heartening story."},{"Title":"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America","review":"Francis Bok is a very lucky man. Thousands of others of his tribe aren't. The shocking story of slavery that continues TODAY in the Sudan (and possibly other African and Middle Eastern countries) must be understood by anyone who still has enough heart and soul to care. This story is real! The names have NOT been changed. There are no INNOCENT to protect, only victims of the greatest possible injustice in the world today. If you can read this and not realize the implications for you and your family, and others whom you love, then I weep for your loss of humanity. Although it is the telling of a personal story, this book has truths for the state of the world. In America, we may well be living in a \\"fantasy land\\" where \\"rights\\" are thought to be a Constitutional promise. What is it that stands between us and our children and the terror and hardship experience by Francis Bok and his family? How much difference lies between the undocumented maid or yard worker you employ on a weekly basis and a teenage herder who was stolen from his home and family by killers?

This book is one of the best and most uplifting of all the books I have read about the process of healing in a way that empowers you and frees you from the fear and pain. It has many helpful and uplifting suggestions to bring more 'light' in your life too like building a garden of courage. As a survivor I highly recommend this book to other survivors healing from ritual abuse. Unfortunately, the wonderful book, &quot;Safe Passages to Healing&quot; by Chrystine Oskana is out of print. I found a used copy and it is also one of THE best for therapists and survivors.I am very grateful to the author of this book. It gave me wonderful ideas of how to use my own creativity to help me heal and overcome. Chrystine Oskana wrote that a survivor needs the 3 C's: Courage, Creativity and Commitment.

Although this book describes the different types of ritual abuse, it only gives examples from Satanic abuse. This is where the book suffers greatly. In order to be more accesible to the wide range of ritual abuse survivors, the author could have done more interviews with people who survived the other types of ritual abuse that she defines.There is a lot of good advice for therapists that can be applied to various clients in this book, but the narrow scope of the examples impedes its application. A lot of issues around ritual abuse is overlooked because of the book's focus on evil and Satanism. Hopefully, the author would consider a rewrite of the book with a more general focus.

Any therapist who has worked with a ritual abuse victim for more than a year would not get anything from this book. Neither would anyone who has been in this hellhole beyond the initial discovery stage.

RMT has been shown to generate mostly false images: images that feel like real memories, but which are of events that never happened. It is also important to realize that Multiple Personality Disorder has now been rejected by almost all therapists. This book feeds into the victim culture of the 1980s and 1990s. It is thus dangerous to victims of recovered memory therapy and will probably delay their recovery. There are many books available that contain a realistic assessment of ritual abuse: K.

All in all, this is a handsome edition that will physically grace your library.Fraser's commentary and footnotes are helpful and abundant (note: this is a reprint of a 1901 work, so there is of course no commentary on how Berkeley has been read in this century).The only thing I would have wanted different than what I got would have been translations of the Latin essays into English.Insofar as Berkeley the philosopher, he is one of the major philosophers of history, and one of the clearest writers. He is also often scathingly funny."},{"Title":"The Works of George Berkeley (Major works)","review":"Since Berkeley is best remembered as a philosopher and it is therefore highly likely that anyone interested in this is interested in that part of Berkeley's collected works, that is where I will focus this review.The most important work of Berkeley is &quot;A Treatise Concerning the Principals of Human Knowledge [Part I]&quot; (there is no part II - the partial manuscript for it was lost while Berkeley was travelling). &quot;Principals&quot; has two principal sections: one epistemological and the other metaphysical.In the epistemological section of &quot;Principals&quot;, Berkeley argued that when we use words to describe entities which we literally cannot imagine, we block our own understanding - &quot;that we have first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see.&quot; We can use words to stand for a multiplicity of different entities (such as &quot;triangle&quot; to stand for all possible triangles), but that an abstract triangle, one that is &quot;neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but all and none of these at once&quot;, (here he was quoting Locke) is an impossibility. The significance of this is subtle, but critical to his argument since he came back to it again and again throughout his works to differentiate between meaningful and meaningless words.Having laid out a differentiation between meaningful and meaningless words in his epistemological section, Berkeley then proceeded to the metaphysical section, in which he attacked the idea of matter, principally as expounded by Locke. Berkeley argued that matter is a meaningless word, signifying nothing that we can imagine. He argued that all of the properties that materialists ascribe to matter are either perceptions (non-existent in the absence of a perceiver) or utterly meaningless. Thus, Berkeley argued that a theory of matter to account for our perceptions was a meaningless proposition. Our perceptions of the world (our ideas of it), however, still required an explanation. To this end, Berkeley argued the things we perceive are ideas that are put into our minds by God. They differ from things that we imagine by our lack of control over them, and in their consistency and vividness - properties that are the result of their being the product of a mind other than and vastly more powerful than our own. In this argument, Berkeley felt that he had discovered a powerful counter to atheism, that his theistic idealism could account for the world whereas atheism, with its dependency on matter, could not.&quot;Principals&quot; did not meet with the acceptance that Berkeley had hoped for it (to say the least), so he presented his metaphysics again in a more accessible form in &quot;Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous.&quot; &quot;Dialogs&quot; is easier to read, but not as good a source as &quot;Principals&quot; for really understanding Berkeley. In either form, the critical side of his argument against matter had and has great force, even if his proposed alternative has never attracted many adherents.Berkeley also presented his metaphysics again in less detail in two other works: the fourth dialogue in &quot;Alciphron; or, the Minute Philosopher&quot; and in &quot;The Theory of Vision, or Visual Language, Shewing the Immediate Presence and Providence of a Deity.&quot;&quot;Commonplace Book - Berkeley's notes from 1705-08.&quot; is a collection of short notes that Berkeley jotted down while he was working through his philosophical ideas and preparing to publish them. &quot;Commonplace Book&quot; itself was never intended for publication but is of interest in understanding how Berkeley's thought developed.Berkeley also wrote on scientific matters, consistent with his views as laid out in &quot;Principals&quot;, on vision in &quot;An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision&quot;, (which he actually wrote before &quot;Principals&quot; which he hoped would soften the audience for the presentation of the full theory in &quot;Principals&quot; and also in &quot;De Motu&quot; (On Motion).Berkeley also wrote on mathematics, again consistently with his philosophical writings in &quot;The Analyst; or a Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician&quot; and the follow-on works &quot;A Defense of Free-Thinking in Mathematics&quot; and &quot;Reasons for not Replying to Mr. Walton's Full Answer&quot;. &quot;The Analyst&quot; - an attack on the foundations of Newton's calculus, set off a furor in British mathematics that lasted a century.&quot;Alciphron&quot; alluded to earlier, was a work of Christian apologetics, and was Berkeley's longest work. It is not without interest today, but it has not aged as well as his other works mentioned above.&quot;Passive Obedience: or The Christian Doctrine of not resisting the Supreme Power&quot;, was a work of political philosophy. It is not at all connected with his other philosophical works and was regarded as dangerous and somewhat subversive.The last work of Berkeley that deserves individual mention is &quot;Siris: A Chain of Philosophical Reflexions and Inquiries Concerning the Virtues of Tar-Water and Divers Other Subjects Connected Together and Rising From One Another&quot;, a curious (to put it mildly) work on both &quot;tar-water&quot;, which Berkeley held to be a panacea, and metaphysical speculation inspired by reading classical sources (if you don't know what tar-water is, don't worry - you can get the recipe in &quot;Siris&quot;). &quot;Siris&quot; was written near the end of Berkeley's life. The metaphysical speculation in it did not constitute an abandonment of his earlier ideas, but it did not strike me as at all developed - he was going somewhere new but had not yet arrived when he wrote it.Apart from his intellectual endeavors above, Berkeley also led a full life and was an active Anglican clergyman. He travelled, wrote on purely religious matters, and also wrote in support of social justice and tolerance. These works round out the man, as does &quot;Life of Berkeley&quot;, Fraser's biographical essay at the start of the collection.The collection is not without its flaws. Chief among these is that &quot;De Motu&quot; is left in Latin and untranslated both it and &quot;The Analyst&quot; really require more extensive introductions to be easily understood by a contemporary reader. Douglas Jesseph's &quot;De Motu and The Analyst&quot;, Volume 41 of &quot;The New Syntheses Historical Library&quot; is a highly recommended supplement to the &quot;Works&quot;."},{"Title":"The Works of George Berkeley (Major works)","review":"An influential writer of philosophy and just about everything else.

Her boss and best friend bets that Tessa cannot stay out of Mitch Ryder's bed for a week while she takes care of his marketing campaign. Mitch was Tessa's first love and the man she compares all others to, which might account for one divorce and one broken engagement. Now Tessa returns to the beautiful Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, the site of her first love, to prove her resistance to the man she thinks of as aphrodisiac on legs. After all, Tessa figures she can survive Mitch's appeal for seven days.Eight years ago Mitch had no intentions of offering Tessa forever. He doesn't intend forever now. After all, he isn't the kind of guy she really wants. Now Mitch needs Tessa's marketing finesse to make Mogul Ryders' new product line a success, although he doubts Ms. Trench Coat and Heels still retains that adventuresome spirit that brought them together. Nevertheless, Mitch intends to complete the business side of their relationship and then recapture that chemistry they once shared, at least temporarily. Then he learns she only plans to stick around a week, which raises the stakes considerably.Author Joanne Rock sets off an inferno when she reunites old flames in TALL, DARK, AND DARING. Rock proves that just seven days can transform lives. Mitch's salesman skills matches Tessa's own as he teaches her to have fun again, but the consequences defy his expectations. Tessa's gradual relaxing as she catches snowflakes and savors bobsledding reveals an enticing exuberance that makes her an incredibly engaging character. Moreover, The author's savvy understanding of the need for compromise in modern relationships makes the novel sparkle, even as Rock deftly reveals the sensual longings, the secret wounds, and the hidden desires of a couple who has buried their secret needs. A sensual treat, TALL, DARK, AND DARING comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tall, Dark and Daring (Temptation, 897)","review":"After assigning her the Mogul Ryders marketing campaign, her Westwood Marketing boss Ines Cordova bets Tessa O'Neal that she cannot stay out of Mitch Ryder's bed for a week. Ines knows it is a sure bet because she has heard enough times how Tessa measures all males against her yardstick, Mitch, her first love. No one including an ex husband and the nice Rob she just ended her engagement to has come close to living up to Tessa's memory of Mitch though he deserted her.Tessa plans to do the job and escape Lake Placid, New York with her soul and heart intact because she knows based on what happened eight years ago that Mitch cannot commit. Mitch anticipates sharing sex once they finish his business requirement though he also plans to split as he did once before. However, when he learns she intends to stay for only a week with no sex, he elevates the game of love.Readers will enjoy reading the heated TALL, DARK, AND DARING, a fun second chance at love romance. The story line emits heat through Mitch even as Tessa tries to avoid being burned again. Though readers might not like Mitch's cavalier approach to relationships, the audience will agree that Joanne Rock paints a compelling realistic look at modern day coupling.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Anthology of American Folk Music","review":"I can't add much more than the previous reviewer. I will say I was very pleased with what I paid for this especially compared to the other prices I see quoted by sellers. There is an excerpt from a Mike Seeger interview with Frank Walker who provided the collection that Harry Smith picked from for the anthology. It's quite interesting though Walkers memory is admitedly fried by the point he was spoken with. There is also a short excerpt from and interview with Moses Asch talking about some background info on the anthology. Both offer some great anecdotes. Ash also speaks about the 4rth volume of the anthology and why it never came out (it has now) and Harry Smith's idiosyncrasies in compiling the original set.For me the tabs and lyrics along with lyrics to 47 songs (across all 4 volumes) and 3 to 4 paragraphs of background on each song are the heart of this book. The pictures are great but I would have preferred photos of the artists and others involved with the project than the \\"mood\\" photos included. They are great, but this could have been better.The 4 vs 5 star rating is mostly to do with the cost of this item as I see it listed now."},{"Title":"Anthology of American Folk Music","review":"This 1973 book is keyed to Harry Smith's famed music anthology, now available on CD. It is edited by Josh Dunson and Ethel Raim, and includes interviews with Moses Asch and Frank Walker, as well as song lyrics, chords (for many but not all songs on the Anthology) new anecdotes, and very nice b & w photos of artists and rural scenes (folks hanging out on front porches, etc.) Some of the anecdotes are a bit disturbing--about Bascam Lunsford's racism and anti-semitism, for example--but it'll save ear-strain trying to grasp some of the numbers. May not be worth the hefty price being asked here, but a nice volume for those of us drawn to this strange, exciting music."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the Toefl: Test of English As a Foreign Language (Barron's How to Prepare for the TOEFl IBT)","review":"I am a professional TOEFL prep instructor.

Instead, the audio portion of the book comes on 4 CDs. So, if you do not have a CD player, you will NOT be able to listen to the Listening Practice. This book does NOT have a computer test. Instead, it has some questions in the book that simulate the computer questions. Half of the tests are written for people who have to take the paper test, the other half are for people who have to take the computer test.If you can only buy one book, you need a review of grammar and other sections of the test, and you want some practice tests, this book is your best choice. It has a lot of grammar explanations and lots of practice questions. So, it is a great value--the price is low, and you get a lot of questions.However, the book is not perfect. Some of the questions are old, and you will not see those types on the TOEFL anymore. Furthermore, many of the questions are easier than the real TOEFL, especially the reading sections. Many of my students have said that the reading section is very, very hard and that they were not prepared for the real TOEFL when they took it.In short, if you can only buy one book, this one is okay, but you really should buy official TOEFL materials so that you will be ready for the real test when you take it."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the Toefl: Test of English As a Foreign Language (Barron's How to Prepare for the TOEFl IBT)","review":"I think i got everything from this book.I learnt test tactics to get good score and the book helps me to take model tests and to improve my score.

It is a fascinating portrait of the history of modern acting and also of Russian history. Absolutely key for understanding the Method, and the development of today's theater."},{"Title":"My life in art","review":"Stanislavsky is still the most influential figure in modern or contemporary theater. In this book, he is open about his life especially the rough years in Russia, his first exposure to the theater, his first time at directing. He also writes about his professional relationship with another Russian, Anton Chekhov. He writes about his travels mostly in Russia such as his journeys to Petrograd, the Russian provinces that inspired many of Chekhov's plays, and of course his first journey abroad. The book is really for theater junkies like myself who would have loved to have been a theatrical actress or director but life isn't so bad. He has directed William Shakespeare's tragedies like Othello and Julius Caesar along with Chekhov favorites like The Cherry Orchard, The Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya and The Sea Gull. Stanislavsky also founded and developed the Moscow Theater Company. He did it all for love, not money nor fame. He became rich in so many other ways."},{"Title":"My life in art","review":"For those in the arts, and especially those in dramatic art, this book is a must. It is the account of the father of modern truthful acting and a look into what a life spent towards creating art is about.

It is so wonderful to have an account of this mans amazing life in his own words to read, study and eventually aim for.A must read for those of the stage!"},{"Title":"My life in art","review":"This book is Stanislavski account of his experiences in working at the Moscow Art Theatre that he Co-founded with Vladimir Danthcheko ( who also wrote a similar book from his perspective titled ' My life in the Russian Theatre').

Sherwood seems to have researched her subject well, but the book seemed to be unnecessarily vulgar in a number of places, and this made the book all the more unpleasant to read."},{"Title":"Vindication","review":"Frances Sherwood masterfully retells the life and times of Mary Wollstonecraft. Friend to William Blake, Henry Fuseli and other artists, her biography is here given distinctly modern treatment. A fascinating woman, she witnessed the French Revolution, spent weeks locked up in infamous Bedlam, and had a series of disastrous love affairs. Sherwood's recreation of 18th-century London draws the reader in completely. Once started, you will find it difficult to put this book down"},{"Title":"Vindication","review":"A thoughtful assessment of a tortured lifeSherwood's touch is pitch perfect, bringing to life 18th Century England, days of abject poverty and the insurmountable chasm between poor and wealthy. Mary Wollstonecraft is born into a family that lives on the edge, everything meager, from scarce provisions to scarcer emotions. This familial absence of love mirrors the lack of all in a family defined by misery. Mary's childhood is a nightmare of drunkenness and depravity visited upon the girl and her helpless siblings, the father a drunkard and the mother his willing victim.Mary's awakening as a woman is much delayed, albeit inevitable, having wasted so many years trapped by dire circumstances. Her attractiveness exponential to her fearless intelligence, Mary's writing consumes her, yet is a separate agony from the one regarding the men in her life. Predictably, Mary is haunted by childhood abuse, insecure in her dealings with men. In a beautiful blend of fact and fiction, Wollstonecraft experiences firsthand the horrors of Bedlam, the day-to-day insanity of the French revolution and the Age of Enlightenment. This novel is not frivolous; the crafting of Vindication is superb, but painful: nothing in this woman's life is without difficulty. Although her childhood experiences shadow the rest of her days, Mary's intellect is intransigent. Through her suffering comes an intimate knowledge of women's roles in a world that inevitably restricts their choices.Wollstonecraft's seminal work, A Vindication of the Rights of Women, published in 1792, is a logical extension of the Enlightenment's determination of the rights of man, as seen through the eyes of a woman. Her publisher entertains a salon with contemporaries like William Blake, William Godwin, Thomas Paine and, of course, Mary Wollstonecraft, the equal of them all. Yet Mary is dogged by a constant discontent, \\" a kind of celestial poorhouse overseen by Father Time and monitored by Mother May I.\\" Eventually, Mary becomes more attentive to the energetic rhetoric of the weekly discussions.Sherwood focuses on daily life, shrewd and unflinching. Each of Mary's foolish romantic fantasies is tempered with the feral details of life in 18th Century Europe. Although the luminaries that are Mary's contemporaries wax poetic on the nature of the universe, reality is actually quite tedious. The author's consummate skill is obvious in the quality of her characters, especially Mary, her complexities, questioning spirit and drive to succeed. Accomplishing a prodigious feat, Sherwood's Mary Wollstonecraft comes alive in the pages of Vindication, correcting, arguing and searching for a sense of comfort that she will never know. The rendering of this tortured life is exquisite, determined and inspirational. Luan Gaines/2004."},{"Title":"Vindication","review":"I knew from history class that Mary Wollstonecraft was an early feminist and the mother of Mary Shelley, the author of \\"Frankenstein\\". I had no idea what an incredibly eventful and meaningful life she led until I read this book. Wollstonecraft's childhood was very edgy and anxiety-producing, with an alcoholic and abusive father, and a mother whose own perversity played to his abuse. The reader gets the impression that the mother has to participate in the disfunction to keep a roof over her head. Her loving paternal grandfather, who knew how unreliable his son was, left a will taking care of both his grandaughters and grandson. Wollstonecraft's brother who had been a co-sufferer with his two sisters in the traumatic setting of their childhood, betrayed them by challenging the will in court. He succeeded in overturing the non-traditional will so Wollstonecraft and her sister were left indigent in spite of her grandfather's wishes. In that era, a woman's only option for supporting herself was marriage, witness the desperation of Wollstonecraft's mother. A freethinker, Wollstonecraft continued to walk a tightrope all through life, getting involved sexually with several intellectual leading lights of her age (with results ranging from embarrassing and frustrating to disasterous, just like nowadays), bearing a child out of wedlock, and always lacking in any kind of security in spite of her own prominence in the intellectual arena. The effects of her individualism even resulted in imprisonment in the infamous asylum \\"Bedlam\\". This is the amazingly written story of a very interesting woman from history. If you read this, you will definitely not be bored, and you will see what important changes feminism has brought about in a relatively short period of time thanks to people like Mary Wollstonecraft."},{"Title":"Vindication","review":"Vindication is a fascinating look at the life of a woman born too soon, who was intelligent, spirited, and disillusioned with the man's world she found herself in. Frances Sherwood does a tremendous job of exploring Mary's forays into independence followed by regression into the traditional, accepted woman's role. In answer to other reviews, the sexual situations are not extreme (if you're reading historical fiction, you should assume that the author has the right to imagine what her character was like in every aspect of her life) and help to explain why Mary was continually pulled back into relationships with men...she enjoyed physical intimacy. Unfortunately, she equated intimacy with love and acceptance and like many women then and now, found herself seduced into hoping for \\"happily ever after\\", but on her own terms. This book is an insightful look into life in the 18th century for both sexes."},{"Title":"Vindication","review":"The blockheadedness &amp; utter insensitivity of the two reviews below, in an open forum such as this, demand a response.Frances Sherwood's reimagining of the life of the brave Mary Wollstonecraft, the woman who wrote the groundsbreaking &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women,&quot; proves quite the equal of her subject. Sherwood brilliantly recreates her protagonist's haunted Enlightenment world, at once alive with new ideas &amp; half-smothered in medieval fears &amp; prejudice. Better still, however, her history goes far beyond the merely correct, investing its conflicts with the chilled yet heightened humanity they must've engendered at the time. The &quot;Mary&quot; of this book has the wallop of her namesake, providing a new testament to women's toil &amp; tragedy while never losing her humor, her smarts, or her desires."},{"Title":"Vindication","review":"Vindication is really a treasure - a big red ruby of a novel that penetrates such important history witha raw heart and fierce intelligence.

It was the fashion source that women turned to for the most current information on what to wear. If you have ever wondered what they really wore, and why they wore it then I would suggest that you look to these books for the answers. Typically these books have a full year bound together. Each month should have a color fashion plate featuring the current wardrobe fashions. They also have music, poems, short stories, knitting and crochet patterns, health tips and cooking hints. They provide a valuable insight into the era. If you are a civil war reenactor there is no better source for accurate information, and if you are just a fan of American history, these books are an outstanding source."},{"Title":"Publishing Secrets: A Comprehensive Guide to Getting Your Book Published in the Lds Market","review":"I highly recommend this book and would have given it five stars except for the fact that there was a small typo or two in it--not the fault of the authors, who are all excellent writers.Although the book states it's for LDS writers who want to break into the LDS market, the advice given applies to national market publishing in many cases.I purchased this book at the beginning of my writing career, when I knew nothing about how to get my work published, and learned extensively from it.

Daly, Professor of German at McGill University, is one of the founders of modern Emblematic research. His book is one of the best, holistic, introduction to the emblem and emblematic studies. Emblematics is one of the most curious sub-disciplines in Renaissance studies. Some professors that I've talked to believe emblematics was a phenomenon of the 1970s and 1980s, and that its \\"fad\\" has since died out. I don't think this is true. A brief search using the MLA bibliography shows that new articles and books in this field are published every year. I think emblematics will gain more popularity as time goes on, in large part because of its interdisciplinary approach. Emblematics combines studies in myth, fable, art, painting, literature, philosophy, semiotics, and visual media--and of course Renaissance emblem books.In short, I highly recommend this book to those are interested in Renaissance studies, as well as to those who are just curious about how the gap between the fields of art history and literature has been bridged."},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I thought there would be more unique recipes using more vegetables (ie; Spagettie squash, broccoli rabe, etc) and variety of beans not just substituting dairy for soy cheeses."},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"RECIPES ARE DELICIOUS, VERY GOOD DESCRIPTIONS AND EASY TO FOLLOW STEPS.

In fact, most of the ones I tried all kind of taste the same. I don't notice a huge difference from one recipe to the next. There's a bit too much reliance on the same combination of herbs and spices, as well as eggplant (there's LOTS of eggplant in this book). There also seems to be a heavy reliance on cheese substitutes. I don't mind the occasional vegan cheese here or there, but it's in almost every recipe.So not my favorite cookbook.

Fantastic vegan fare."},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"This is a wonderful book with a nice combination of quick and other more involved recipes. I love Grogen's side notes on the recipes and her comments in the beginning of the book. The recipes are divided up into courses of an authentic Italian meal, so it's easy to plan a full menu, or just a single dish. These dishes would appeal to anyone, vegan or not. These are good, wholesome meals. Grogan mentioned in the introduction that Italian was her favorite cuisine with Chinese and Indian running a close second. Maybe she could be convinced to write a Chinese Vegan cookbook next?"},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"Bryanna tackles Italian, a traditionally cream and cheese-rich culture, with as much authenticity as possible. Since Italian is a big part of Bryanna's heritage, as she details in this cookbook, she seems to handle each recipe with care and very detailed explanations for those of us who may not be intimately familiar with the makings of each dish.Those who are vegan or simply egg-free will love her guide and recipes for making fresh pasta (yes, I said fresh egg-free pasta!); those who crave the rich flavors of cheese will delight in the alternative recipes for mascarpone, Parmesan, and ricotta (Bryanna typically provides soy-free, nut-free, and at times gluten-free options for staple recipes such as these); and those like myself will be drawn in by the many comfort food recipes. The countless recipes for cream sauces, risottos, potato dumplings, stuffed pastas, rich casseroles, pastry cr&egrave;mes (5 recipes for different pastry cr&egrave;mes alone), and tarts are enough to make me want to hibernate in my kitchen for the winter!Beyond dairy alternative, vegans will also like the many traditionally meat-filled Italian dishes that Bryanna takes on. Though my family is still omnivorous, I must admit that veal cutlets and Italian meatballs are no match for her animal-free creativity.Of note, Bryanna writes very detailed instructions, often with many alternative options. This can be a very good thing, but, like many traditional Italian recipes, some of the recipes can be involved, best for a leisurely Sunday afternoon. This by no means covers all of the recipes though. Most of the sauces can be whipped up in minutes, and there is a plethora of pasta, hearty soup, and vegetable dishes that could actually be considered quick and easy. Among these, I was particularly taken by the creamy Bechamel sauce and the Pasta with Spicy Eggplant. Plus many of the recipes, like the potato dumplings (I am dying to try the pumpkin version!) become quite quick to make once you get the hang of it.If I were to suggest any change for this cookbook, it would be simply be a minor layout issue. Though not a deal breaker by any means, I often mess up recipes when they are in a \\"run on\\" format. That is, one recipe may start in the middle of a page, run on to the next page, and immediately be followed by the next recipe, and so on. It could just be my poor eyesight, but I find myself accidentally reading from the wrong recipe when they are in this free flowing format. However, I must give kudos for the well-sized print and the notes for calories, fat, and carbohydrates on each recipe, which many people may find useful.And just in case you were wondering, there are recipes for pizza, calzones, and tiramisu!"},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"What a wonder this cookbook is! I don't hesitate to say this is by far the most wonderful vegan cookbook I have ever bought; it is simply packed with recipes (and variations), and don't be scared off by the lack of photos, every recipe is simply so mouthwatering! Bryanna Clark Grogan provides delicious alternatives to dairy-, egg- and meatproducts, and there is simply everything you'd need in this book: bread recipes, antipasti, soups, pasta dishes, vegetable dishes, meat-style dishes, desserts (great ice-creams!), you name it. I find myself reading the book again and again, thinking how will I ever have time enough to try out them all ... it is an essential to any vegan kitchen!"},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years, concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years, writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are \\"The Professional Chef\\" by the Culinary Institute and \\"Culinary Artistry\\". With more than 500 cookbooks in my collection I am usually disappointed in my recent cookbook acquisitions. I am also very tough on Italian cookbooks in particular.My husband and decided to try a vegan lifestyle about 3 months ago to reduce cholesterol. However, having to give up many of our favorite Italian foods was extremely difficult. Thankfully, as I was beginning to consider adding dairy back to our menu I found this book. It is a much better Italian cookbook than I expected it to be.The book is outlined as follows:1. Italian Cuisine2. Ingredients and Equipment for Italian Cooking3. Basic Recipes and Techniques4. Sauces5. Appetizers, Vegetable Side Dishes6. Making Fresh PastaFirst Courses (Primi Piatti)7. Pasta in Sauce8. Stuffed Pasta: Dumplings, Crepes, and Baked, Layered and Molded Pasta Dishes9. Pasta in Broth and Soups10. Cornmeal and Rice DishesSecond Courses (Secondi Piatti)11. Baked Dishes: Omelets, Savory Cakes, Tarts, Gratins, and other Vegetable Casseroles12. Vegetable and Bean Entrees and Stews13. Meat Free Entrees14. Bread, Rolls, Pizza, Hearth Breads and Stuffed Breads15. SweetsSome of the basic recipes that the author includes are: Tofu Ricotta, Tofu Mascarpone, Tofu Ricotta Salata, Almond Ricotta, Soy Free Almond Ricotta Salata, Cashew Mascarpone, Tofu version of Heavy Cream, Vegetarian Burger, Vegetarian Hot Italian Sausage, Vegetarian Sweet Fennel Sausage, Seitan (Beef, Veal, Chicken, Pork, Burger, Hot Italian Sausage versions). She also includes a number of different variations for Polpetti (meatballs).Many of the recipes included in this book are time consuming. However, this is no different than standard Italian homemade items. I don't recommend this book to people that have limited time or limited experience with Italian cooking.Bottom line, this is a much better cookbook than I expected it to be. Can I tell it isn't meat and/or dairy? Absolutely I can tell the difference. The author's variations are satisfactory substitutes if the alternative is the unpleasant health effects that come with the regular consumption of high fat animal products. I would recommend this cookbook to anyone that loves Italian food and wants to cut back on his or her consumption of saturated fat."},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I've been vegan for about 4 years now, and I've been cooking all of my meals for 2 or 3. I've spent over $100 on a shelf full of vegan cookbooks. This one is the best I own. It's the only cookbook I have that has recipes that make food that's outright better than anything I ate before I went vegan! Ever since I started making my own vegan pizzas, I absolutely stopped missing the greasy things that I'd been getting delivered, and the pasta recipes here are the best I've ever had.The only problem with this book is that the recipes can take a while to prepare. If you're not a big fan of cooking, this probably isn't the book for you. But if you're glad to spend an hour in the kitchen making a meal and want to have some great vegan food, this book is a must!"},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"This was a great addition to my collection of vegetarian recipe books. Not only does it list authentic vegan Italian recipes of all kinds, it explains every ingredient and gives background on Italian food and veganism in general, without dwelling on things we already know as informed vegetarians! It would make a good gift for anyone who loves to cook, vegetarian or not."},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I must admit that I haven't tried out all the recipes in this book so far. But the vegan tiramisu is so outstanding, that even if it was the only tasty recipe, this book would be worth it!!! My non vegan friends can't believe it is made without dairy and request me to make it for birthdays and other celebrations. When I became vegan I thought I would never be able to eat tiramisu again, but thanks to Bryanna I can enjoy my favourite dessert again! I can\`t wait to try the nondairy cheese fillings!"},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"This book is not only a must for vegan kitchens but for everyone who likes Italian food. The recipes make very authentic tasting vegan versions of popular dishes. My vegan friends are enjoying this food too, always the best sign."},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I have had this cookbook for several years and it has become one of those books where I wonder if I should just copy out the 3 or 4 recipes I actually use onto recipe cards and ship it off to the second hand bookstore to recoup the shelf space. Don't get me wrong - I think Bryanna Clark Grogan is a skilled vegan cook - it's just I didn't appreciate the approach this takes to Italian Vegan cooking, or find it very useful to me overall.The Pros -1. The author clearly knows what she's talking about. There is a lengthy section in the beginning of the cookbook providing a wealth of information about Italian cuisine and ingredients. She is also of Italian ancestory, so she is familiar enough with the cuisine to provide reasonable vegan alternatives.2. There are several innovative techniques introduced which help make particular ingredients or dishes more accessible to the vegan diet or to the average cook. This includes instructions for making risotto in the microwave, or using chickpea flour as a replacement for eggs in fresh pasta.3. What I was most looking for in this cookbook is an introduction to Italian recipes which will contribute somthing to a vegan diet, ie. traditional items which are already vegetarian/vegan. There are some examples of this, although not nearly as many as I'd hoped. For example, the lemon granita recipe is absolutely wonderful, and provides a totally satisfying alternative to dairy-based frozen desserts.The Cons -1. I found far too many of the recipes were attempting to make vegan versions of meat and dairy heavy dishes. While there is some place for this, generally the result is time-consuming and heavy soy and gluten-laiden meals you wouldn't want to eat very often.2. On a related note, many traditional Italian recipes rely on the taste of Parmesan cheese for their flavour. Rather than focusing on recipes for which this is not the case, the author makes frequent and heavy use of a product called Soymage Parmesan cheese, which she notes she buys BY THE CASE. She indicates that there is no other commercial vegan product which can be substituted, but does provide a recipe for a soy-free alternative. Unfortunately, it's yet another one of these gross vegan powders laced with nutritional yeast flakes. I did try it, and wasn't at all happy with it. Ironically, because Soymage isn't sold in my area and I'm not about to mail order in fake cheese, I was unable to try many of the recipes until I stopped being vegan and was able to use dairy parmesan.3. My biggest disappointment with this book is the lack of recipes focusing on vegetables - which I assumed would be plentiful in a vegan cookbook. Despite the impressive variety of ways that vegetables are prepared in Italian cusine, the \\"vegetable\\" chapter is only 9 pages long. At the beginning of the chapter, the author explains that she doesn't have the space to describe how Italians prepare vegetables, and instead recommends the book From an Italian Garden by Judith Barrett (which was also published as Cooking Vegetables the Italian Way), which is unfortunately currently out of print.Overall, the book has some great recipes, but since I'm not really interested in eating Seitan and fake-soy cheese everyday, nor do I have time to regularly prepare extremely time consuming and complicated recipes, it hasn't been as useful to me as I'd hoped."},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I am Italian, I love cooking and I love eating, and I am also a vegetarian tending to vegan, and that's why I got this book.This book contains many favorites of Italian cooking, in vegan version. So where meat is called for in the original dish it's replaced by seitan or similar vegan meat substitute; same with cheese and other animal products.It's very useful if you are vegan but not everyone in your family is, as you can cook the same dish in two version, like I often make hunter's chicken for my husband and a hunter's seitan (or other meat substitute) for my daughter and myself.The reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that the book is not always precise in its descriptions of original dishes and many of the Italian names are mispelled, sometimes badly; from these two aspects it looks like the Mrs. Clark-Grogan didn't do an accurate research, but instead relayed on her relatives to give her the correct information. But overall, the book is a great buy, and I wouls suggest it to any vegan and to anyone who wants to eat good but also healthy."},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"As an Italian who grew up in a meat eating household, I was looking for tasty Italian meals that are not meat centered. This book is excellent and the recipes I have made are very flavorful. My meat eating husband likes everything I have made from this book. I am not actually a vegan, but limit my dairy and have had great results with this book. Also, I love the multiple details and explantations she give about Italian history and food.One note though, many of the recipes are involved so if you don't like to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, this may not be the book for you. Also, I am not into meat analogs, so I have avoided this chapter. But, other than that I think this cookbook is excellent for anyone looking to prepare healthy veg. Italian meals!"},{"Title":"Nonna's Italian Kitchen: Delicious Home-Style Vegan Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I was looking for another vegan cookbook to add to my collection and chose this b/c of my Italian heritage. Everything looks wonderful and tasty but also very time-consuming. As a mother, I don't have enough time to make my own pasta. Also, several recipes call for other recipes in the ingredients so you are really making 3 or 4 different things and then mixing them into one dish. Not an easy thing to do, but obviously real Italian food is never quick to prepare. All in all, it's good but I'd look for a less time-consuming one next time."},{"Title":"You Eat What You Are: People, Culture and Food Traditions Revised and expanded second edition","review":"Having written a reference work on food myself, I fully realize how difficult it is to research and write such a book as this, and how easy it is to find fault and criticize. And if I had seen the original edition of this book when it was first published, I probably would have found it valuable and interesting. If it had been heavily revised and brought up to date, it still might be. But it isn't. I have been reading the chapter on Iceland and I have to say that it is very misleading. What is being described - and not always correctly - is Iceland in the 1950s and 1960s. A few examples - there are many more in the text:&quot;Some homes have refrigerators with freezers&quot; (yes, about 98% of them) &quot;but most manage with cold closets.&quot; I'm the only person I know who has a cold larder (and a refrigerator and a freezer, too). Refrigerators have been in most homes here since the early 1960s at least. \\"Fresh fruits are scarce\\". They haven't been scarce for the last 30 years at least. These days you can even get exotic fruits like ramboutan and mangosteen. \\"Cattle are mainly used for dairy products, rarely for beef.\\" Beef is now as common as lamb. &quot;Pigs are all but nonexistent; pork is rare and expensive and said to have a fishy taste ...&quot; Now common, inexpensive by Icelandic standards and quite good. \\"Icelanders have a deeply rooted objection to eating birds of any type\\" - oh, come on, chicken was not much eaten but not because people didn't like it, rather because it wasn't economical to raise the birds on imported grain. They are very popular now. And wild birds have always been eaten - in some regions they were a large part of the diet. \\"... margarine and butter (all unsalted)\\". Totally wrong. Both margarine and butter is almost always salted. \\"Salt is seldom added (to food)\\" Wrong. Salt is added to most savory food and many people salt their food liberally. \\"Preferring to talk in separate groups, men and women disperse after the meal, it still being considered &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;forward&quot; if women join in men's conversations.\\" Possibly in the 1950s; certianly not now.Flatbrau (rye griddle cakes) is never ever served with sugar or preserves, always with butter and meat or cheese. Steiktir partar are not &quot;thin wafer-like pastries filled with sweetened whipped cream&quot; but fairly thick, flat wheatcakes, deep-fried in fat and eaten cold with butter and often meat or cheese, never a sweet topping. I could go on and on - there are so many errors here.Reading this book made me realize once again how much Icelandic cuisine and society has changed during the last 30-40 years and the same is true for most other Western nations. This book is supposedly revised and updated but these updates seem to have been minimal in the chapters I've looked at so far (the only sources cited for Iceland that are published after 1967 are The New York Times 1998 Almanac and the Lonely Planet guide). Unfortunately I feel this is a reference work that I can not trust - it is so inaccurate and out of date."},{"Title":"You Eat What You Are: People, Culture and Food Traditions Revised and expanded second edition","review":"Me encanta leer libros de cocina y pense que este ser&iacute;a &quot;el libro&quot; para conocer arte y costumbres culinarias de otros paises.

As I am researching on the cooking of my home state in India, I was hopeful of finding a lot of information in it. But to my great disappointment, several historical facts were incorrect. Thelma Barer-Stein began the historical narrative on India by saying that all foreign conquerers came to Delhi.History reminds us that the Poruguese navigator Vaso da Gama arrived not at Delhi, but at the other end of India, at Calicut, in the state of Kerala. The Romans, Greek, Syrians and the Arabs had invaded the southern part of Inida way before that. About religion she says&quot; Greek thinking in 300 BC and Buddhisam in 200 BC was followed by Hindu beliefs&quot;. First of all Hinduism was there first, and Buddhisam originated India, both before the invation of the Greeks. About food, the statement &quot;fruits and vegetables are eaten in season only sapraingly; more consumed in the form of pickles, condiments and chutneys&quot; is totally wrong, written by someone who has not tasted the varied and rich vegetarian cuisine of India. Then she goes on to write about several fruits, completely ignoring India's favorite fruit the mango. Finally the statement &quot;In Cochin, in Kerala province, foods are very plain, and rice and coffee prevail. Rice, fish and vegetables and seafood make up the diet...&quot; is waht is prompting me to write this review. Probably the author only ate these foods in Cochin; but as a native of Cochin and a life long vegetarian, I can assure you that our vegetarian cuisine is neither very plain not very bland. Our vegetable crop is enriched by the centuries long foreign invasions. There were several other incorrect facts in the chapter. I did not read any other chapters and my comments are strictly about the chapter on India. But I have to say I was very disappointed and returned the book the very next day.I understand the author undertook a herculian effort study the food and culture of the world. This book makes one realize how vast and uncomprehensible the subject is."},{"Title":"You Eat What You Are: People, Culture and Food Traditions Revised and expanded second edition","review":"I know Australia is at the end of the world for most Americans and Canadians, but I would presume that an ethnic cooking &quot;expert&quot; such as Barer-Stein presents herself to be could access more up to date information than the 30 year old sources used in her book.Inaccuracies abound - including &quot;home freezers are not yet common&quot;, &quot;skim milk is not widely accepted&quot;, &quot;cheeses are not a usual part of the diet&quot;, &quot;potatoes are expensive&quot;!!! and the unbelieveable lunch &quot;the working person will have an inexpensive hot plate of mince, potato, and peas&quot; -- Yuk! And certainly not a food habit of my living memory.Not to mention the glossary: an amazing hodge-podge of food from the 1950s, New Zealand Maori seafood and strange fare such as a molehill &quot;a desert of almond-filled prunes coated and mounded with gelatin, whipped eggs and cream and topped with chocolate&quot; which nobody I know has ever heard of.We also now eat kangaroo, emu and crocodile steaks, but never never never has goanna &quot;a large fatty lizard, often eaten grilled&quot; ever graced any South Australian table.So - don't waste your money. This book is a sloppy updating of the author's 20 year old study. Firefly Books should be embarrassed to have it in their catalog."},{"Title":"You Eat What You Are: People, Culture and Food Traditions Revised and expanded second edition","review":"Most of the reviewers here are giving it one star because they are upset that the book has a few errors regarding their native cuisine. So what? This book is wonderful. Its very crybaby-ish to get upset about inaccuracies regarding food. There are some errors, but that can only be expected in such a comprehensive volume. I have traveled many places in the world, and the book is absolutely correct about some things regarding the food in those countries. Its also very comprehensive and covers food and dietary habits in countries all over the world, including various regions of the U.S.A. (Eastern seaboard, Hawaii and Alaska, Midwestern, New England, Pacific Northwest, New Orleans, Southern Regions and Southwestern). I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys sampling food from other countries, its also a good reference book for chefs and cooks."},{"Title":"You Eat What You Are: People, Culture and Food Traditions Revised and expanded second edition","review":"This book is truly a labor of love.

I have found her research to mirror much of my own research and I would highly recommend this book to those who look at cooking from an intellectual level and are curious about other cultures.My grandmother has always told me I have a Norwegian heritage and I was delighted by the 7 carefully written pages on this subject.If you want an overview of cooking from Africa, Albania, America, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Holland, England, France, Germany, Iran or even Japan....this is the book for you. While you will not find recipes you will finally understand what Mealie-meal is or why Bobotie is so good.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"The Columbia Anthology of Modern Korean Poetry","review":"Although I believe McCann's anthology does give English-speakingreaders a glimpse into the richness of modern Korean poetry, Icould not have begun to understand the poetry without having taken a course at the University of Chicago in order to understand the myriad allusions in many of the poems. Although a brief biography of each poet was given, I longed to have more context. In many instances, although the poems were written by men, the narrators used a woman's voice, and this was not clear to me when I read the poems on my own.I realize that translation of poetry is especially difficult, but I thought that many of the poems sounded stilted and could have been improved if a native English speaker had collaborated with the poems translated by Korean speakers. For example, one stanza of Chu Yohan's poem, \\"To Catch the Moon\\" is translated as follows:One spring day to catch the moonClimbing the night, I ascended the sky.But the moon revealed only half its face:\\"How would you have come if not for the dream?\\"Moreover, after our class compared translations of the poems withtheir originals, we were aware of different nuances that changedthe interpretation of the poems. Although Hwang Jiwoo's wonderful \\"Vanity Fair 1984\\" was translated well, considering itsextreme difficulty, the final line was translated: [Big Brothersaith] \\"Looks good to me!\\" Yet, in the original, there was anobvious allusion to Genesis in which God looked at what he hadcreated and saw that it was good.I think the anthology would have been far more valuable if ithad been presented in the manner that one finds translations ofSouth Asian poetry, especially by the late A.K. Ramanujan, inwhich the translations are both smoother and more carefullyexplained. However, I believe this volume is a good first start, and I hope that additional anthologies of Korean poets will follow."},{"Title":"Ray Bradbury: The Life of Fiction","review":"This is a superior book throughout. If you're a Bradbury fan, Eller & Toupence will give you a new appreciation of an old favorite. The biographical details and info on the pulp magazine world of the 1940s and 1950s were eye-opening as well. Reading this, I came to understand how Bradbury worked his ass off to bring us the stories and books that have become part of American culture. On their best days, Poe and Hemingway couldn't touch R.B. Kudos to Eller & Toupence for their fantastic work. (I recommend, though, skipping the lengthy introduction, which is an academic-style snooze, unlike the rest of the book). Here's hoping mainstream literati will read this, and celebrate Bradbury as the genius he is. In other words, a damn fine effort."},{"Title":"The island keeper","review":"While I was in middle school I checked the book out numerous times. I loved the book. I loved Cleo, I loved her story and her strength. I even knew the exact location of that book and what the hardcover picture looked like. Move on in time to high school and college and every so often I would scour for the book (the title of which I had forgotten but I knew the authors last name began with an 'M'.) So finally after finishing college I went back to my old town and asked to go into the junior high library. I found the book. On the same shelf, same location and with me being the last person to have checked it out."},{"Title":"The island keeper","review":"Wonderful book that I discovered in junior high. Several years later I bought a copy and this novel has become one of a treasured few I read again every year. The central character (indeed, practically the only character for most of the book) grows so much during her experience that you remember her life changes long after you put down the book. As always, great fast-moving, realistic storytelling from Harry Mazer."},{"Title":"The island keeper","review":"I first read this book when I was in ninth grade. Ever since, I have kept Cleo's experience on that beautiful island in my heart. When I began college memories from the book kept resurfacing. I knew I had to find it! I couldn't remember the author's name or the title, so my search was pretty close to hopeless. Finally, after asking many librarians and looking through endless card catalouges over 8 years, I accidentally found it in January while using the WWW.AMAZON.Com search engines. I ordered it immediately and read it as soon as I recieved it. To read it again now as a 28 year old was a whole new adventure, but it also brought back old memories and feelings that I had as a 14 year old. I recommend this book to any teenager or adult looking for an escape. The experiences that Cleo goes through are so real, and well-researched. I'm so glad to have found this wonderful book after such a long search!"},{"Title":"The island keeper","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I bought it a week ago and finished it in 1 day.

In third grade, my elementary school library was selling some of the books in the library for real cheap..this is the one i bought because I was drawn to the cover. As an avid childhood reader, I started reading this book but had difficulty understanding it. My dad actually took it away from me because he said it was too old for me (I was 8). As I said, I was an avid childhood reader - I read hundreds of books as a child, but this was one I knew I had to save for the day I could comprehend it. As it turns out, I went into the basement just today to help my mom bring up Christmas decorations. I found this book, and something drew me to it. I've been trying to get back into reading for a while. I started reading this book (I barely read anymore, I haven't read a book in over a year) and I completely fell in love. Cleo became my hero in a matter of hours. After just finishing this book, I'm shellshocked. I'm definitely going to start reading again, this book is unbelievable and has inspired me in ways I might never fully understand. Cleo's struggle to find out who she is, her character transformation, the amount of strength she endeavors upon her journey to the island..it's so well written and relatable.

My daughter recently read a book called \\"Hatchet\\" by Gary Paulsen which is very similar in overall plot. Hatchet is about a boy who is stranded alone and must fend for himself though.

Once I had watched it, I had to read the book.I even went to Cold River in the Adirondacks in 1994, but in order to get to the spot where the book takes place, one needs to ride on horseback (ask at Cold River Ranch, they offer horses).That did lead me to read Harry Mazer's \\"The Island Keeper\\" (an even better wilderness book about a girl surviving all by herself on an island in a huge lake...Mazer wrote the book in 1981) which unfortunately never became a movie although one reader review mentions a movie, but I checked us.imdb.com, Harry Mazer is not in their database.\\"Snowbound\\" is another Harry Mazer book I can recommend to everybody who enjoyed \\"Cold River\\" and \\"The Island Keeper\\".If you are interested in some other great wilderness book escapes, read Anne LaBastille's autobiographies \\"Woodswoman\\" and \\"Beyond Black Bear Lake\\".I forgot the name of the author who wrote \\"My Side of the Mountain\\" (there are two sequels) which became a good film, too.And last, but not least there is Gary Paulsen who wrote two great books about Brian who survived an airplane crash and ended up being lost in the wilderness in winter (good books, good movie)."},{"Title":"The island keeper","review":"The Island Keeper is a great adventure book.

Of the half million or so items in the museum, some 200 have selected by the museum's curators for photographing and presentation in this large format book.Included are paintings by Catlin, Russell, Moran, and Remington. The front cover of the book is Moran's \\"Tower Falls\\" perhaps the single thing that caused the Congress to set aside Yellowstone National Park.While the subject of the American West may be thought of by some as not suitable for serious work, some of the painting, such as the night time scene of the Pony Express (Frank Tenney Johnson) are of as high a technical quality as can be found anywhere.A mere book is not the same as visiting the museum, but is about as close as most of us can come.Beautiful Book!"},{"Title":"Treasures of Gilcrease: Selections from the Permanent Collection","review":"This is a great guide to the Gilcrease collection in Tulsa, OK. After visiting the museum I wanted more and this book filled the bill. It contains a nice collection of pictures of the key pieces, both paintings and sculptures, in the museum as selected by the curators and also contains pictures and postcards from the archives which are not on display all the time. This book adds completion to my visit to this wonderful art collection. This is a nicely produced book with complete descriptions of the pieces presented."},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"I can't help but think this book would have been far better as a non-fiction piece. The characters are not really that absorbing, and I feel that the narrator has much more to say about the experience of kayaking or canoeing the Northwest Coast from Sitka to Oregon than the fiction format allows him to. The description of the sea and land is really amazing and makes it absolutely worth reading. However, I have a bit of sympathy for the reviewer who said it was boring because the plot is not as gripping as a summary would suggest (4 men escape from Novo-Arkhangelsk, now Sitka, in order to eventually return to Sweden). It is a man against nature story, but I suppose I found the nature part much more interesting than the men.A non-fiction reflection retracing this journey interwoven with the author's own thoughts probably would have been much more gripping.Still, it is worth reading nonetheless."},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"I have only read one Doig work which did not completely enthrall me.

Mention is made of \\"Okhotsk 011 the coast of Siberia\\", where \\"011\\" in the original was presumably either \\"on\\" or \\"off\\". A character is introduced as having been \\"Horn on the isle of Gotland\\" instead of \\"Born\\". These are only a few examples of the many transcription errors one could cite.

The descriptions would have been better if the author had not tried to use big words which made the voice of the book seem pretentious. I read it for a book club and had a hard time getting through it. The sad thing is that the story itself was interesting as were the characters. It was just an awkward book to read.

Doig's literary style, though, is a bit Hemingway-esque to me (I like 'real' Hemingway but not Hemingway-esque). His characters speak in stoic monosyllabic bursts, although the narrative voice seems in contrast torrid and mannered. These stoic characters sporadically explode with highly emotional self-revelation: a guy who barely puts two words together for the whole trip suddenly burst into tears revealing his sad reason for a gambling addiction. I wish Doig had let us \\"in on\\" his characters a little earlier in the game, but perhaps that would be inconsistent with the style of the story.For my money, Doig has a superb handle on nature and adventure and a less good handle on character, but fans of adventure in general, and the Pacific coast in particular, will still enjoy reading this."},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"Descriptions of the Pacific Northwest are accurate and beautiful. The rhythm of the book captures the frustration of its characters and makes it part of your life. I felt I was on the sea paddling for seemingly forever. What kind of characters are required to make a superhuman effort? What kind of relationships are developed by disparate humans when pitted against great odds? Doig helps to answer these questions. This is a MUST READER for understanding the Pacific Northwest."},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"This book is an excellent story of courage and strength against the harshest forces of nature. The four characters in the story are all brought together through one goal--freedom. Even the fierce and mighty ocean will not stop them from what they wish to obtain. Although their lives as indentured servants in Alaska are not horrible, they are still willing to risk it all for just a taste of freedom. Ivan Doig has a wonderful grasp on the Pacific Northwest and the society in the mid-1800s. His characters are developed quite effectively throughout their struggles and triumphs. Yet at the end, the reader is left to decide whether the voyage was entirely successful. It is important to remember that, to these men, adventure and freedom were more important than a life of security and dissatisfaction. This book is great for those who live in the Pacific Northwest or for those who wish to learn more about it."},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"I have lived in Washington and Southeast Alaska for 25 years. Over these years I have been to or seen most of the places Doig writes about, from Sitka to Dall Island (crabbing with a friend), to Vancouver Island and Prince Rupert, as well as the Pacific coast of Washington. The mere thought of getting into a canoe and crossing Dixon Entrance in the winter sounds like suicide. The images of the mountains, trees and water are so true I could feel them.The story about the men is also very true and brings back to me experiences with men over my life, in circumstances good and bad. We are weak, fragile things and usually hold onto the normal and cozy for comfort, but these men took on the unknown and elements with a courage few can muster; though whether they would have done this if they had known what they faced is questionable.Doig does an admirable job of capturing the beauty, the menace and the feeling of SE Alaska, as well as the courage and weaknesses of men."},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"Wonderful story. Fear was the constant. I could hear the voices, see the scenery, smell the smells. I loved it."},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"After a recent trip from Seattle to Juneau on a small cruise ship (100 passengers) I read this book, which is based upon a true story, upon the recommendation of a fellow passenger. It was the perfect post script to a modern day cruise up the coast of British Columbia and Alaska's &quot;inside passage&quot; (along its southeast coast). Author Voig's four Swedes, all indentured servants escaping from the the Russians, take a similar route, but they do it in 1860 (when Alaska was &quot;Russian America&quot;) and they head South from Sitka to Astoria, Oregon. They travel in a twenty foot open dugout canoe stolen from the &quot;Kaloshes&quot;, a sect of Northwest Indians (Tlingit). The Swedes experience the same unpredictable weather, seas and coastline as they modern day traveler, but they have no cablin, dining room or tour director. And they have to paddle all the way - a distance of over one thousand miles. The tale is a tribute to the human spirit. Ivan Voig knows this part of the world, and he enabled me to relive my fabulous trip as high adventure from my living room chair."},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"Based on a true incident, this tale of the escape of indentured workers from a fish packing plant in Alaska in the 1800s is hair-raising adventure. Doig's descriptions of the trials the men face in the unforgiving wilderness are masterful and vivid. There's humor here too. At first, the syntax was challenging, but Doig succeeds in giving the narrative a Scandinavian and historical flavor through the language. This boat takes some startling turns, so hang on!"},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"Ivan Doig is a word-smith who crafts wonderful stories in beautiful language. This early book of his is no exception. Taking a sparse, true account from the mid-1800's he develops a wonderful tale of escape and survival."},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"An enjoyable survivalist tale, along the lines of \\"The Long Walk\\" or even Shackleton's \\"Endurance.\\" Basically four workers escape an indentured work camp in Alaska, steal an Indian canoe and try to make it down the coast of British Columbia and what is now the state of Washington to make it to the settlement at the mouth of the Columbia River.The depictions of the water and scenery is good. The author spent some time researching the surroundings. The rough humor and tension between the men is hilarious. As they battled starvation during their journey my only question is why didn't they catch more fish, as that coastline is chock full of fish, but that's a minor detail. Love the scene where they get to witness a Northwest Indian tribe bring in a whale, as that is of historical significance. You'll feel an ache in your own back and blisters on your own hands as you empathize with their journey.First book of his that I've read, and I now want to find more."},{"Title":"Sea Runners","review":"This is a stellar example of how beautiful prose writing can be.

Many detractors of Carnegie's doctrine have suggested that he merely affirms the obvious; yet the intrigue is buried within the notion that while apparent, few people actually in fact apply these simple principles.Carnegie's standards are derived from countless studies, trials and investigations; thus his premise is sound and proven. He delves into a all encompassing overview of what is needed to fully be an effective public speaker. Each chapter has a mission and covers such topics as confidence, content, reading the audience, and being persuasive.I have no doubt that anyone seeking to improve, perfect, or even start a public speaking endeavor should review the principles outlined in The Quick & Easy Way to Effective Speaking, thus I recommend this book favorably."},{"Title":"The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking (Revision of Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business by Dale Carnegie)","review":"I wasn't planning on giving a speech when I read this book -I just thought it would give me some ideas in case I had to do so in the future. As with Dale Carnegie's other books, \\"The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking\\" presents individual points of advice fattened by entertaining anecdotes and examples from the lives of well-known people and from Carnegie's own experience. As Carnegie himself suggests, the actual advice could be summarized within the space of a few pages (There's a summary at the end of each chapter) but the stories and examples make the the information more digestible. This edition was actually edited and released posthumously by Dale Carnegie's wife. The title is a little misleading because the number one lesson of public speaking to take away from the book is the importance of practice and preparation. There are no shortcuts. Although some of the examples are a little dated, this is still a worthwhile book to read especially if you enjoyed Carnegie's other books."},{"Title":"The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking (Revision of Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business by Dale Carnegie)","review":"I loved this book.

This book seems to be an updated revision of a book on public speaking by Mr. Carnegie which was written long before.

This book would only be useful for someone who has years of public speaking experience. But for someone like me who has no public speaking experience, this book is useless and gets quite boring.

The author, who taught public speaking at seminars for 40 years, has learned alot and communicates his ideals well in written form. I really envy those who had a chance to listen to his public speeches. That is the weakest part of this book, which the author admits. It doesn't matter how much you read about speaking, you have to go out and do it, or you can't get better.With that noted, this book does a great job at describing the speaking process. It starts by reviewing &quot;the basics&quot; and then divides his book into the special potential needs of its readers. At its core, this book tries to address the fears of its readers. It appear that public speaking strikes fear into more people, then anything else. If you are scared, you can't think well or express yourself clearly. Thus, if you can conquer your fear, you are on your way to giving a great speech.&quot;Quick&quot; discusses three things to do. First, be prepared. You can't talk intelligently about any topic, if you don't understand it. Second, try to speak to your interests. The more you care about something, the more interesting will be your speech. Third, remember your audience. Even if you love __________ (fill in the blank), you need to understand that your audience may not. Since, no speech is effective if you lose your audience, you have to remember their needs.The other thing &quot;Quick&quot; does is give you good tips. Don't try to use them all at once. My advise, pick the one, or two you like the best and work on them. Once you perfect them, or decide you don't like them, try something else. For example, I like &quot;Quick's&quot; suggestions of using names when you tell a story. &quot;Imagine a hero with no name&quot; who would remember him? Well, if you want to use an example with people, give them names, it makes it easier for your audience to relate to them.This is this book's strongest foundation, the colorful examples and the author ability to relate to his readers through them. He quotes famous people like Lincoln and Julius Ceaser repeatedly. He also cites more ordinary people to show how real people have good insights into life.Overall, the examples and the organization are interesting and add to its strength. &quot;Quick&quot; is a good book, a good &quot;primer&quot; for new speakers. I don't think more experienced speakers will enjoy it as much, but there is enough here to please most people who want to improve their speaking skill, novice or expert."},{"Title":"The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking (Revision of Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business by Dale Carnegie)","review":"The book has been reworked so may times and improved by the experiences of the Dale Carnegie Organization. That is what makes this book so good. This last revision by Dorothy Carnegie based on Mr. Carnegie's notes and plans is benefited by a strong editorial approach. The most important persistent advise is to talk about things you care about and are extremely knowledgeable about. Be excited about the subject or pick a new topic. Find every opportunity to speak and prepare for each one as a major opportunity. It tells how to limit your subject so that you have time to fill in the details that make it a winning talk. It guides you on how to personalize the speech and use words that have impact. The easy introduction to the methods of studying and understanding your audience are very important. It makes a good start on the field of audience participation. This book provides excellent advise on rehearsal.This book along with every other speaking book drives home the point that there is no such thing as a good impromptu talk unless you were very lucky. In reality you work on subjects and material with a plan to use it at some future time. When you are speaking there are many things to watch. If you speak impromptu on a new subject some thing is going to suffer.Introducing a speaker or presenting an award seems to stimulate reckless behavior much like the cutting desire to hurt people of newscasters. This book explains why this behavior is so short sighted.Having read a Dale Carnegie book decades ago, I put off reading this book for fear it would be full of positive thinking dribble. This book is completely straight forward in style. It is in textbook format, but it is extremely easy too read. The examples of actual students and successful speakers get a little shallow sometimes. The outstanding thumbnail review of each part of the book is very helpful. I have read 21 books on public speaking. Right now this book is my leading candidate for someone that is only interested in reading one book on public speaking. It just happens to be a very low price."},{"Title":"The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking (Revision of Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business by Dale Carnegie)","review":"I've been a member of Toastmasters Clubs and been trained in all the &quot;fundamentals of speaking&quot; but I'll tell you something: Carnegie's three fundamental principles are all you need. He's the only speaking teacher I've ever read who points out that all the superficial effects, like your voice quality and your gestures and whether you say UM or not, these aren't important. What really matters is that you're speaking about something you really believe and really want to say to this group, and something that you REALLY know, either from experience or intense study.If you only speak on those topics, all the superficial stuff works out. You communicate. And you'll feel comfortable doing it. Carnegie's three fundamentals are the most important you'll ever encounter on speaking.I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I'm an expert on the subject, and I'm telling you if you want to help yourself to better speaking skills, study and practice the principles in this book and forget the superficials."},{"Title":"The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking (Revision of Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business by Dale Carnegie)","review":"Before I joined Toastmaster International about year ago, I always wanted to speak better in public.

No elaborate theories, just plain simple but extremely effective ways of preparing talks, short or long, what audience likes to hear about, how to give attention getting openings and closings in your speeches among others.All these ideas I put them to work right away in every speech.

I've suggested it to many people over the years and have never heard anything but compliments.Someone wrote a negative and mean spirited review of this book, even suggesting it was written by someone else after Mr. Carnegie passed away. What garbage. To give himself creditability he indicated he was a college professor. Maybe he is, maybe he isn't but I also teach at a university and I felt compelled to write this.Despite what this person says, Dale Carnegie's book on speaking has been in print for many years and sold copies in the millions.

'The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking' is no exception!To be honest, though, the title probably doesn't do the book justice, because while being an effective and very marketable title, if fear of public speaking had a 'quick and easy' solution, there wouldn't be so many folk out there still fretting about it.That said, if you want a beginner's guide that startes out by covering the fundamentals in a clear and user-friedly way, then you wouldn't be making a bad choice if you opted to read this.'The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking' covers the basic speaking process, dealing with the fear of public speaking, which, if we are honest, is THE key element that leaves us tongue-tied or backing away in dread, which in turn, is bound to affect the quality of our speech, no matter how well prepared we are in other ways.On choosing a topic for the speech, Dale gives us refreshingly realistic advice - to choose a topic that we already love and know a lot about as a basis for a speech, but to be aware that it may not be your audience's choice.All in all, you're in good hands. Dale draws upon his vast experiences as a speaker himself, and a teacher of public speaking to help the reader understand the process.

The first section regarding the birth and circumstances of Douglass' flight to freedom was full of what I consider &quot;psychobabble&quot;. The author makes too many conjectures concerning the relationship of Douglass with his owner, including possible latent homosexual feelings but never includes any information to back this claim up. The story picks up when Douglass moves to New England and becomes involved in the abolistionist causes. His travels to England and his relationship with women working for the cause of women's suffrage is particularly interesting. However, the remainder of the book seems to meander with no purpose.I am still searching for a biography which puts this man's life into context."},{"Title":"Frederick Douglass","review":"Frederick Douglass is an authentic American and a heroic figure. For those wishing to become aquainted with a chronicle of his life, McFeely's book will do the job.Born a slave in Maryland, Douglass accomplished the difficult task of self education in an era when slaves were not taught under penalty of law. &quot;Running away with himself&quot; (as Southerners used to describe slaves who escaped) twenty years before the Civil War, he became one of our country's great orators in telling the tale of his life as a bondsman and urging that America embrace emancipation of all slaves. He was perhaps the anti-slavery movement's best spokesman. Not only for the sheer eloquence with which he captivated audiences, but as living proof that a black could be educated to a level reached by few people of any race.Douglass did his part for the Union in the Civil War and bought into Republicanism as the best political vehicle for achieving the end of slavery and the leveling up of blacks to their rightful place in American society. His hopes were frustrated after the Civil War when his party turned away from Reconstruction and blacks were subjugated anew by racism, indifference and Jim Crowism.Douglass was an idealist in that he believed that America could be exhorted into granting slaves not only their freedom but their civil rights and social equality. His country failed his vision miserably and he ended his life personnally successful (as successful as his skin color could take him in the 1890's) but very distraught at the chasm between his hopes for a free America and the reality.This is an adequate book, though dry at times. It follows Douglass chronologically. In episodes where his life was a fascinating story -- as a slave, his escape, his establishment in the North, as a politician and as US minister to Haiti -- the book is a fascinating tale. Not so fascinating are long accounts of his work on the road delivering speeches as an agent of the anti-slavery movement. Part of the problem with writing a biography of a man who was in large part a professional orator is that the chapters focusing on that work are not very exciting. Mcfeely spends a lot of ink detailing his journies on the stump and his meetings with many characters who were part of the American and English anti-slavery movements. Douglass's life flow, when examined chronologically, produces a story of varying degrees of drama. Although any biograhpher is limited by his character, I had the feeling throughout that Douglass's life could be told with more verve without sacrificing the facts.What McFeely should have jettisoned were several parts where he delved into psychobabble -- speculations about sexual attraction or the depth of feeling between Douglass and several figures in his life. Human feelings and attractions are an important part of any biography and certainly shaped Douglass's life. McFeeley speculates on several without any facts to support his views. These are relegated to the first half of the book and do not intrude greatly, however.If one needs or wants to learn about the life of this great American, McFeeley's book will fill the bill."},{"Title":"Frederick Douglass","review":"I am curious to know the previous reviewer found William McFeely's observations/analysis of Frederick Douglas racist. I too found a lot of overly subjective tones within the work of Mr. McFeely's analysis of Frederick Douglas, but I also found that his analysis captured, for me, Frederick Douglas' strong positive character, and sense of universal humanity. Mr. McFeely's analysis, while in some instances deductive, yet subjective in others, presented a man - not a God, who held fast to is universal convictions, but who was also subject to human frailties. Mr. McFeely's analysis of Douglas has reinforced my admiration in Frederick Douglas even more."},{"Title":"Frederick Douglass","review":"I have just finished reading this book & as a white person didn't find it at all racist but perhaps I am missing some things? McFeely is a Pulitzer Prize wining author (for his bio of Grant) & a professor of literature at the University Of Georgia..It seemed to me meticulously researched & very scholarly. Much is taken from The writings of Douglass. The author is very discreet about Douglass's personal relationships because there is nothing to factually support anything definitive. His first wife & mother of his 5 children was certainly not his intellectual equal & they had nothing in common except for race & their children.After Lincoln's death, Andrew Johnson became president & he was a real southern bigot. Douglass began seeing all the great hopes he had of moving forward being slowly unravelled.I found it very interesting that all the liberal forward moving attitudes came from the North. The North was not without much de facto segregation , but compared to the South, it was a paradise!The states of the Confederacy have rewritten history & have up to the present time been an albatross around our country's neck.Douglass died just as new laws of Jim Crow were being enacted & right before the Supreme Court said separate but equal was legal. How can one understand why these 9 men (at the time) were so warped in their thinking. How could anything be equal when one group is separated legally from another because of race? What about having separate facilities for blue eyed people & brown eyed people.?I was glad he got a post in Haiti as some sort of recognition but it wasn't the best place for a man of his immense talents.I never heard of Ida B Wells until I read this book but she was the author of legislation to stop lynching and , among others, carried the torch for him after he was too old to go on. Very tragic that he could not have lived to see Obama as our wonderful President.Douglass was for universal human rights but many women suffragists (Susan B Anthony for one) felt that granting males universal suffrage wouldn't be acceptable because half the population would still be disenfranchised. When Douglass married his second wife, Helen Pitts, a white woman who was really his companion & helper, Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote them a congratulatory letter but Anthony told her not to make it public for fear of losing the support of southern white women. Was Anthony a racist? I really don't think so but she certainly was politically practical about her MAIN goal of the vote for all women equal to men.Within 20 years, slavery by another name was being enforced in the deep South with Jim Crow laws & chain gangs \\"renting out\\" convict labor.I would like someone to tell me what they thought racist in this book because I didn't see it.am I just obtuse?"},{"Title":"Frederick Douglass","review":"I, also, cannot understand why the first reader found this biography on Fredrick Douglass, racist.

I can fix a semi-homemade microwave lasagna quicker than I can run to Vons for Stouffers. So what if the book uses branded products? They're just a recommendation. I assume the author has tried these products, found them to be high quality, and is passing that information on. That used to be called being helpful.

I say theoretically because what Sandra Lee does in this book and on her show is not cooking in any sense of the word, and if the Food Network were really a cooking station Lee would have been on her rear end years ago.To put it plainly, this is a book for people who are not very bright. Lee basically takes overprocessed, ridiculously expensive premade foods and arranges them into new combinations, adding the odd badly made homemade garnish or ingredient to her typical hopeless mishmash of precooked overprocessed chemical-laden garbage. She presents this as some kind of new method of cooking, when in fact it's just a combination of mental laziness and indifference to real flavour and nutrition.The entire idea of a cookbook is to show the reader how to cook food from scratch. Lee proudly proclaims that nothing in her book is from scratch, which is somewhat like a model proudly proclaiming that every one of her attractions was created by her plastic surgeon. Most ingredients called for in her \\"recipes\\" are heavily processed, pre-salted, pre-spiced, and pre-cooked to appeal to the lowest common denominator. There's no ingenuity, no creativity in her ideas. It's as if she, a food writer, cares so little about food that she puts convenience and conventionality above flavour.One of the most disturbing features of the book is how Lee seems to think her cooking is somehow 'budget'. It's not. Her method of cooking is unspeakably expensive compared to cooking from scratch, simply because processed food costs more than basic ingredients. Certainly if you're unwilling or not intelligent enough to learn how to cook and if you buy everything premade in packages, taking those packages apart and mixing their contents together will not increase your food budget, but you could save a lot of money and eat much better if you would only put a little effort into your cooking and actually learn to make things from scratch.This book is one of the most pathetic excuses for a cookbook I've ever read. I definitely do not recommend it. In fact, were I to see it on the bookshelf of a man I was dating, I would break off the relationship."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I have to take issue with those reviewers who have attacked this book so passionately! True, there are \\"gourmet\\" cooks who wouldn't dream of adding any prepared foods to their recipes; they obviously have the time and energy to spend hours in the kitchen every day. However, I don't understand why a \\"gourmet\\" cook would even consider buying a book entitled \\"Semi-Homemade\\" anything!This book was obviously written for people like me, who no longer have the time or energy to spend all day in the kitchen, and \\"Semi-Homemade Cooking\\" has been the answer to my prayers! I probably own a hundred cookbooks, most of them gathering dust on a bookshelf in the living room. I've been cooking for forty years, and only a few cookbooks have stood the test of time well enough to remain on my kitchen counter; this is the newest one to make the grade.No, I do not consider myself a \\"gourmet\\" cook. I used to make complicated, time-consuming dishes that took hours and hours, but, frankly, many of them weren't any better than my favorite quick & easy recipes! And at 63, I want recipes that I can put together quickly and that everyone will enjoy. I am having a great time trying one recipe after another from this cookbook because none of them have taken a lot of time, and every single one has been delicious! Try Country Biscuits and Gravy, for example; my husband asks for it every Sunday. And Salad Chinois (Chinese Chicken Salad) is superb!Bottom line: This is not a book for food snobs! This is a book for people who want delicious meals they can prepare themselves with a minimum of fuss. Try it, you'll love it! Many thanks to Sandra Lee -- I'm ordering \\"Semi-Homemade II\\"."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"Very disappointing The recipes are filled with unhealthy ingredients .The concept is great but the nutritional benefits are not there-- so it isnt a quick fix for me.Hard to imagine Wolfgang endorsing such a book"},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"This woman cannot cook. It's a travesty that she has her own show on the Food Network with the likes of Mario Batalli and Alton Brown. Okay, here's one of her brilliant ideas.1) Pumpkin Pie Petit-fours: Bake your own crust in these small tins, then buy a WHOLE PUMPKIN PIE, scoop out the filling, and pipe it into the new crusts. Why not eat the damn pumpkin pie that you just bought!? She did the same thing with a cheesecake. She ruined a perfectly good cheescake just so she could pipe the filling onto her petit-fours crusts.Doesn't that seem a little backwards to you? If you were to make a \\"semi-homemade\\" petit-fours tray, don't you think you'd want to just make the filling yourself, and then use storebought crusts?Here's another great idea of hers.A vanilla wafer, topped with a slice of banana, with a dollop of store-bought banana pudding on top. Voila, instant crap! She really has mad skillz, doesn't she? Mad culinary skillz. I could've done this when I was four.I swear, the lady can't even make hamburger helper.Semi-homemade my butt. More like barely-homemade. More like \\"I bought everything pre-made and then ARRANGED it to look nice.\\" That's not cooking, that's lying.And her \\"table-scapes\\" are horrible."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I am all for shortcuts in the kitchen and I am not a health nut or a food snob, but I was hard-pressed to find more than a handful of recipes in this book that were edible. Most of them were seriously lacking in the flavor department. The fact that most of them are very poor, nutrition-wise, also concerned me a lot. She seems beholden to too many ingredients that are high in fat and sodium, as well as chemicals and preservatives. I mean, why use artificial coffee creamer in an eggnog recipe? I received this book as a gift, from a well-meaning friend. I would have much rather gotten one of rachel Ray's books, as she really knows how to make fast and simple meals from fresh ingredients."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"just because the recipe says to use pre-made ingredients doesn't mean you can't take the extra time to make as many of them from scratch that you can, like shredding your own cheese, cutting up a onion, or making your own mashed potatoes, etc. I sub as many fresh ingredients as I can for the pre-packaged and I still have a good meal made in no time. That may defeat the purpose of the cookbook, BUT, the recipes are what stand out, and any can me made with fresh or pre-packaged items.They are good, everyday family meals. The photos and lay out are outstanding, and the books are well priced for the quality we get from them. Worth the money."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"Sandra Lee is known to audiences nationwide from her appearances on the QVC shopping channel and numerous network and cable television programs. Her Semi-Homemade solutions have also been featured in People, Redbook, Better Homes and Gardens, Traditional Home, Country Home and Victoria. She has also appeared on NBC's Today. FOX's Good Day LA and Good Day New York.Sandra Lee is a member of the International Association of Culinary Professionals She also studied at the acclaimed Cordon Bleu.When selecting a cookbook, normally I will buy cookbooks that promote \\"cooking from scratch.\\" This is the first cookbook that claims that \\"Nothing is Made from Scratch.\\" What Sandra means is, you will still be cooking, just parts of the recipe are \\"convenience/prepackaged foods\\" or packet mixes. This slices time off making cakes for sure!Firstly, these recipes looked far too easy and so I was a bit skeptical. Secondly, I don't normally buy anything not in its raw state. Buying \\"pancake mix\\" was new to me. Heading home from the grocery store, I almost felt a little sinful.This cookbook contains 101 recipes such as Pumpkin Cinnamon Pancakes, Southwestern Turkey Chili, roasted Pepper Soup, Kahlua Tiramisu and Berry Cookie Cobbler. You will find recipes for appetizers, soups, salads, main dishes, desserts, snacks and even treats you can make for your pets.The beauty of this cookbook is almost more in the \\"Semi-Homemade\\" techniques than in the actual recipes. Technically, you can adapt these recipes for your own use in many ways.Tonight I made the \\"Steak Pinwheels with Sun-Dried Tomato Stuffing and Rosemary Mashed Potatoes.\\" In the recipe, it calls for sun-dried tomatoes that are not packed in oil, but I just used the ones I had in oil and reduced the amount to 2 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes in oil.The Stove top stuffing mix I found was only 6 ounces, but the recipe called for a 6.6 ounce box. It still worked fine. Instead of just salt and pepper on the skirt steak, I used garlic salt and freshly ground Tellicherry peppercorns. Ok, so I cheated and made the potatoes from scratch because I had potatoes I needed to use up.Then, for desert, no lies! I waited to make the desert until \\"after\\" dinner. This was new. I didn't feel stressed at all. I took the pound cake out of the freezer, cut it into cubes and drizzled the rum-butter sauce all over the cake. Yum! Then, for an added touch, you can mix in some frozen raspberries with the jam. I also used frozen raspberries on top and added whipped cream. The \\"Raspberry Trifle with Rum Sauce\\" is absolutely delish! She doesn't say to use whipped cream, but Trifle without whipped cream just isn't the same.So, to explain how much time I saved, I made the recipe in about 10 minutes. Since the vanilla pudding was already cold and the frozen raspberries cooled down the entire desert very fast, I could have served this almost immediately. Not having to make the pound cake was a real treat and hey, I didn't even have to make custard.My husband absolutely loved the Trifle and the gravy for the Steak Pinwheels. I was queen of the kitchen!The full-color, full-page photographs are really tempting. Unlike other cookbooks, the food I made actually did look exactly like the pictures. Each recipe has time estimates and suggested brand-name ingredients. If you are looking for a cookbook for entertaining, this one has some excellent time saving ideas.I noticed that Sandra also suggests you plan your entire week's menu in advance. This is a great time-saving idea and has worked for me for years! Keeping \\"staples\\" on hand is always useful.Contents Include:Grocery Shopping - Hints and Tips to get you in and out of the store fast.Brand Names, Prepping, Cooking, and cooling Times, Budget, Leftovers, Storage, MusicSome Examples of the Recipes:Breakfast - Muffins, Crepes and Country Biscuits and GravyLunch - Curried bowtie Salad, Beefy Stew or Gnocchi DippersDinner - Dijon Chicken and Mushrooms, Meaty Microwave Lasagna, Tropical SalmonDesserts - Vanilla Cream Pie, Bananas Foster Pie, Rum CakeAppetizers - Sesame Chicken Drumettes, Italian Fondue, Smoked Salmon and Olive Blini or Oriental Pork WrappersSoups & Salads - Roasted Pepper Soup, Cheddar Potato Soup, Bay Shrimp and Avocado Salad, Spicy Crab Salad.Snacks - Caramel Popcorn, Hummus Pitas, Bagel Chip DipGravies & Sauces - Sherry Mushroom Gravy, Pesto, Hollandaise SaucePet Foods - Bone-Nanza Bones, Healthy Hound Stew, Kitty Katafornia RollsSandra starts each chapter with a note about the recipes to follow. There is a full index, but each chapter also has its own contents page.Semi-Homemade is for any cook who is looking for \\"shortcut\\" strategies. You really can make delicious meals in \\"minutes.\\" If you are looking for more leisure time, but want to still enjoy home-made meals, this might be for you.If you are looking for low-salt, low-fat cooking, I think you could adapt many of the recipes by purchasing low-salt beef stock or mixes that say low salt. With prepackaged foods, that has to be a consideration. Although many of the recipes are healthier because she uses techniques that make them low-fat. Like her \\"Healthy Onion Rings\\" that are made in the oven.I can't wait to make the Tropical Salmon and Pumpkin Cinnamon Pancakes.A cookbook to make your life easier! Really inspired me to get back in the kitchen and have some fun. It was like a cooking holiday!~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"After reading a few of the reviews of this cookbook, I was a little confused. I bought Semi-Homemade Cooking without reading any reviews, and I'm glad I did. I'm a regular old mom and housewife, and one of my main goals every day is to make a delicious, hearty meal for my hard-working husband to appreciate when he gets home. I can't make a from-scratch masterpiece every day (especially with a one-year-old running around), so that is where this cookbook comes in handy!Sure, there is some obvious brand-name dropping, but that doesn't make me buy them. So far, the mushroom steak and sweet mash as well as the sweet and sour pork recipe have become regulars in our monthly meal rotation. The easy cookie cobbler was delicious and a cinch to make. My only problem with this cookbook is there were far too many alcoholic drink recipes and fancy-pants-type recipes. Not the type of stuff you'd make for an every-day family dinner. Overall, Semi-homemade Cooking lives up to its name and will save you some time while still providing your family with a great-tasting, satisfying meal after a long day!"},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"My mom bought this book for me and I read through some of the comments that people posted here (both positive and negative). As a working mom with a toddler I have to admit that the ease of these recipies is what appeals to me. I like that Sandra Lee offers brand name items to purchase and that many of her recipies are not labor intensive. Do I wish she used more vegetables and fresh ingredients. . . sure. But I also know that I can substitute those in on my own.Initally I liked that there was a section of kid friendly recipies but this became my big disappointment in the book. Many of her kid recipies are deep fried and I have NO INTENTION of frying food for my child (nor do I own a deep fryer). For many reasons, the biggest of which being that it is simply unhealthy. There is a place for fried food in cooking but I don't think that place is with kids. In this regard, I wish she has provided modifications for baking some items instead."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I flipped through this book recently and was pleasantly surprised at what I found. Sure, the brand names are gimmicky, so use your favorite tomato paste, or your favorite refridgerated pasta instead. Come on...do you always make pancakes from scratch? Hello? Is someone a bad person because they don't make lasagna noodles from scratch ALL the time?I'm a purist by nature. Cake mixes make me gag, but there is a place for this just as there is a place for my personal hero, Julia Child. And sure, I'm not going to use Kraft Mac & Cheese as the base for something...but there's a balance here and you pick and choose. This book isn't meant for organic types, nor is it meant for vegans, vegetarians, and so on. It's still a heckuva lot better than a boxed meal (just empty into a casserole dish and bake). Now THAT's something to have a heart attack over :)"},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I would recommend this book for a way to get additional recipes for your collection that are easy to do. I am a pretty good cook, and can do lots of fancy recipes from scratch, but sometimes I just don't want to take all that time, and just want to throw something together from the cabinet (other than Hamburger Helper). The writing style of the book is easy to follow - you don't have to be a master chef to understand the ingredients, yet you also don't get sick of a bunch of cutesy words (EVOO anyone?) like some other popular cookbooks.If you are learning how to be a great cook, this is not the book for you. But if you want some quick and easy meals, this and her other Semi-Homemade Meals book are great choices."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"This book really isn't about eating on a budget or nutritious food. The way I see it, it is all about advertising. While this may have changed with the 2nd release of the book, the first release is just pages of her brand loyalties. Do we really need to use her brand recommendations for butter? Or saltines? Come on!I bought this cookbook with the hopes of finding new recipes that I could cook on the quick but I didn't end up finding anything worth making. While my boyfriend was drawn to a few recipes, we decided that none were worth the nutritional suicide.I would definitely consider checking her books out again if she started showing interest in healthy eating but, in the meantime, I'm sticking with the other Food Network personalities."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"Delightful, delectable, quick meals that taste like they were made from scratch. Most, if not all, of these meals can be made in thirty minutes or less and nobody will know that you didn't spend hours in the kitchen. The recipes are clearly explained and easy to follow so that anyone can be a success in the kitchen.Divisions include breakfast, lunch, dinner, appetizers, cocktails, soup, salads, snacks, gravies and sauces, and even a short section on pet foods. Try the biscuits and gravy for breakfast (preparation time of about 15 minutes) or the Dijon Chicken and Mushrooms for dinner (preparation time of about 30 minutes) or perhaps the Cheddar Potato Soup (preparation time of about 15 minutes).If you find yourself often in a hurry and trying to put together a delicious meal in a short time then you will not be disappointed in this book. Granted it takes a lot of short cuts to get you to the end result with a minimum of effort, but it does not sacrifice taste to do so. The only thing that I did not like about the book was that it was not spiral or comb bound. So, it was hard to keep it lying flat so you can actually read it. Still it fills such a unique niche that it is a recommended read."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I'm so mad!

If you, like most of us, would rather spend time savoring a meal than cooking it, you'll buy this book and beg Sandra Lee for more.Refreshingly, this book makes good on its promises - quick and marvelous and nothing is made from scratch. It goes even further to meet the demands of the more discriminating palate - that food be innovative and attractively presented.The book is so artistic it wouldn't be amiss on your coffee table. It is a trifle large for the kitchen, but its generous size is more than made up for by its pleasing format. Each recipe receives two pages, with a gorgeous, full-page color picture on one side and the recipe on the other. Recipes range from everyday comfort food to glamorous meals for special occasions, with individual sections for snacks, appetizers, cocktails and desserts. The Banana Foster's Pie alone is worth the price."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I am a single mom with two kids to feed and a boss that thinks I should work 50 hours a week just like the guys.

It is also great for those weeks when I do not have the kids and have to cook for one. I could pop in a Lean Cuisine or make pasta yet again but this book has many ideas more creative than that. It has reasonable portions for single servings and I can take any leftovers for lunch. It is a bargain."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"Everybody needs two kinds of cookbooks.

Terrible. The scourge must be stopped! Whoot!"},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"Okay, I admit it, I hate to cook. I'm single and when you're cooking for one, why bother? But takeout is expensive, fast food is fattening and frozen dinners get old. And one does have to be social and entertain. So I bought this book, primarily because it seemed simple and straightforward, had humongous pictures and included brand names, which is extremely helpful when you don't have clue one what you're doing. (What IS this impassioned issue over brand names? Would you rather wing it and have to call Domino's -- oops, your generic pizza supplier?) There are also wine and CD suggestions with each recipe. Again, a welcome extra. They're not always my taste, but even if you don't use them, it gives you ways to make a meal special.I made steak pinwheels with sun dried tomato stuffing, candy butter salad and white chocolate fondue for my boyfriend's birthday. He couldn't believe that I, queen of takeout, had whipped up this totally yum meal in my unpretentious little kitchen. He actually accused me of having it catered! I might actually learn to like this cooking thing. :)"},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"Semi-Homemade Cooking introduces the idea of producing foods which seem time-consuming but only take a fraction of the time.

I don't have a lot of time or money. This should help that, right?Except it doesn't. Buying a load of packaged convenience foods and then arranging them festively isn't any easier, or quicker, than cooking with fresh ingredients. I'm not some foodie hipster dweeb who claims that everything needs to be fresh, local, from scratch, homegrown, organic, et cetera. I'm something of a pragmatist, at least. I use canned tomatoes, chickpeas, and frozen veggies with regularity. But if I can whip out an excruciatingly tasty risotto in 30 minutes using seven bucks worth of ingredients as I did last night, so can everybody.Take the time to learn a few basic techniques, maybe treat yourself to a basic cooking class, buy the freshest and least processed ingredients possible, spend some time experimenting, and you'll be able to improvise meals far tastier than anything out of Sandra Lee's book while spending less money and time. Cooking is only as hard as you make it. The reason it takes forever and isn't any fun is, frankly, because most people don't really know how, and their effort tends to be inefficiently applied and fraught with errors and unnecessary difficulty. It doesn't need to be that way. Sandra Lee teaches you how to cop out and let ConAgra do the prep work; why not simply learn how to cook well so that you can do it quickly and enjoyably?"},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"As a wife, mother, grandmother and food stylist, I appreciate the work that Sandra Lee has put into her book. It has minimized the time that I need to spend on dinner and maximized the time that I am able to spend with my family. We have enjoyed the Southwestern Turkey Chili and the Corn Bread, the Dijon Chicken and Mushrooms. The Raspberry Trifle with rum sauce and the Berry Cookie Cobbler are delicious. My daughter made the Gooey Mud Pie for her father-in-law's birthday and it was declared the best birthday dessert ever. This book is a MUST for singles, newlyweds, working couples and empty nesters who want good, tasty food with minimum fuss. Food purists may be put off by the simplicity of the recipes, but in the real world of work, carpools and hurried routines...this book is a treasure!This is a book that I will enthusiastically recommend to friends."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I am not an impulse buyer, but I saw this book in the bookstore and knew it was for me. I used to cook big meals every night. But now I keep my grandson, who is nine months old, and I just do not have the time or energy to cook like I used to. The book is well organized and gives helpful information, even for experienced cooks. There is a lot of variety, which comes in handy when you are cooking every day for a family. The Dijon Chicken and Mushrooms is one of my husband's favorites. The Southwestern Turkey Chili and Cornbread saved the day when friends dropped by to watch the game. My son and grandson love the French Apple Raisin Sandwiches. They don't know I cut corners. They think I make it all from scratch. I am not about to tell. Though I might slip my daughter-in-law a copy of the book for Christmas. I almost hate to share my secret, but this one is just too good to keep to myself."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I'd like to say that I'm an avid cook but the truth is I am mediocre at best. So anytime I can make food that looks great, tastes great, and gets me in and out of the kitchen in an hour I'm a happy camper. This book does all that and more. It is well laid out with each recipe attractively presented, with everything from soups and salads to dinner and dessert. I especially like the pepper peach chicken skewer. It is in the lunch chapter but I make it for dinner. I could eat it every week and so far I have! I recommend this book to anyone who likes to cook but doesn't want to or can't cook well from scratch. I give it four and a half stars!"},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I watched a TV show in Dallas, TX in which Sandra Lee presented a few of her recipes. This convinced me to go out and purchase the cookbook. On Sunday I prepared the Caramel Popcorn for the football games. It was easy and quick to prepare. I had to make two recipes at seperate times it was so fantastically good. The guys and kids loved it. After the game I made the Southwestern Turkey Chili and Corn Bread. I dare anyone to not like the corn bread. It is sooooo good. This is chili country and let me tell you that this chile is great. Quick preparation and there wasn't a drop left over.The shoppping was easy and the prep was fast, easy and few dishes to clean.I recommend this book for everyone. My daughter tried the Berry Cookie Cobbler for dessert. We did it in a large baking sish and with Vanilly ice cream it was to die for. I recommend it to end a great easy meal."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I never buy cookbooks anymore. They are all the same and I already have more that I have room for. But when I heard about this book I thought hmmmm. I decided to try it.I like the wide range of foods and recipes it offers, but at first I was a bit put off by all the brand names, like some others seem to be. I too thought maybe Sandra was getting paid to endorse them. But then I saw Sandra on the Today show and she said the companies didn't even know she was using their products or naming them in her book. She said she uses Bon Appetit editors and testers to help test the recipes and uses what works the best. In my experience, the brand names have turned out to be an unexpected benefit. It's true that they are sometimes a tad more pricey, but most I had in my pantry already and there is no question that they are quality. It does take the guesswork out of grocery shopping and food prep, especially when you are pressed for time. And you really can't quibble with the results.

Every recipe has turned out better than I had hoped. There are no hard to find ingredients, no two-page directions, no elaborate cooking equipment or supplies to go out and buy, no fancy cooking terms to learn, no experience necessary! All you need is half an hour and an appetite because these recipes are good! I have just placed an order for three more books. Guess what my friends are getting for Christmas!"},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"This is one of the most user friendly cookbooks I have found. The photos are large and lavish and show the food close up. There is a lot of space so I can make notes right on the page. I do a lot of improvising, adding things and occasionally substituting so I can write my changes beside the recipe instead of paper-clipping a note, which invariably gets lost. This is very helpful when I'm remaking the recipe. And I like that the book is divided into meals so I can turn directly to the chapter for the meal I am planning -- breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, snacks, etc. Even the brand names are helpful. If I like another brand I just use it instead. The recipes come out fantastic and the book makes fixing them easy. Just what I need."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I'm a guy. I work. And every other week two kids descend on my house fridge like hungry locusts. I may not enjoy cooking but it is necessary evil. They'l tell their mother if we do takeot every night and then i get an ear full. After making a fe recipes i have to say, they are definitly doable. They go step-by-step and are written for layman. I don't have to deal with 50 ingredients, I just mix together a few things, hat it up, and we're good to go. My kids get hot food, they actually eat it (more times than not), and i fek like a good parent.

Some of the recipes she brought on the show were things I had not seen before which is unusual because I have WAY too many cookbooks. She said they only took a few ingredients and were ready in 30 minutes, including prep time. I thought \`we'll see'. I went on her website ... and got the recipes and tried them and they were just as she promised! So I bought her book which has some of the same recipes plus a lot more. She does a nice job of offering all different kinds of recipes for different meals and occasions and even offering music and wine selections for each. Of course you may not have the CDs she recommends. The recipes I have cooked for my family got rave reviews at my house. And sure enough they took only 30 minutes, give or take. Sandra Lee really does make cooking easier."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"My husband and I love to cook, but our crazy schedules during the week don't allow us to cook meals from scratch like we love to do on the weekends.

This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes.

O'Rourke: \\"...the only reason you would cook this would be to convince your ex-wife (or parole officer) that you were trying to live like a human being.\\" But that's not really fair (or true) and the material here is better than that quote implies.It's obvious that \\"Semi-Homemade Cooking\\" is targeted at two large sections of the market: a) people who suffers from mental blinders in regards to cooking and b) people who simply have no mental energy to put together time consuming \\"from scratch\\" meals on a regular basis. In this regard, SHC does an excellent job of providing simple checklists of ingredients with brand names and precise amounts to produce dishes that may be relatively high in trans fats, sodium, sugar, high fructose corn syrup, MSG and other additives...but are still probably better for you (and cheaper) than anything you could get from the fast food drive-through.I have to admit that until recently I was in category \\"A\\" above - I mentally blanked out over any dish or procedure more complicated than \\"reheat in microwave\\". I probably would have benefited greatly from the \\"Semi-Homemade\\" concepts. And ieven now, I would not turn my nose up if some friend gave me one or more of these volumes.But now that I have a slightly higher level of education and training and motivation (which means that I watched some cooking shows, bought a few cookbooks and made some meals) I am struck by how falsely disingenous the promise of \\"Semi Homemade Cooking\\" really is. As countless shows and cookbooks have demonstrated repeatedly in episode after episode, cooking from scratch (or \\"semi scratch\\", heh) isn't really all that difficult once you get into the habit and know what you are doing. And in fact there are dozens of excellent cookbooks on the stand dedicated to the idea of easy, efficient, economical cooking from fresh ingredients with just a bit of help from the convenience foods that Sandra Lee relys so heavily on in her series. My current favorite in this mold would be the \\"Eating Well\\" series of cookbooks, Anderson's \\"How To Cook Without A Book\\" and Robin Miller's \\"Quick Dinners\\". I'm no one's idea of a substitute for Julia Child, but \\"Eating Well\\" lets me put excellent dinners with mostly fresh ingredients on the table from a standing start in less than 45 minutes, and Robin Miller lets me do it in less than 20. Heck, even Jacques Pepin himself (\\"Fast Food My Way\\") gets great food on my table - a four course dinner (with dessert) in 30-40 minutes.Looking at the SHC recipes (and having tried three of the more ambitious ones) I have to say that shopping for the recommended brand names isn't all that easy or convenient.My local WalMart and SuperTarget simply didn't have many of the brand names for the spices or products in question, which negated one of the supposed advantages of Lee's format. I also noticed that it took nearly as much total time and effort to prepare and serve most of these dishes from convenience ingredients as it does to start them from scratch. There may indeed be a little time savings in there, but all these recipes saved me was a bit of chopping and peeling, and maybe a bit of marinating, browning or blanching here and there.These are great looking books, with good professional layouts and accomplished food photography and a reasonably accessible recipe format.That's worth three stars out of five. And I am sure that many people will benefit from these books who would otherwise spend the evening meal with the Colonel or the Clown. But I can't see spending money on this series when it simply takes a bit of time and effort to learn to cook properly."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"It is one brand name after another, don't waste your money.&#60;br /&#62;This book has more fluff then recipes that you can use everyday, plus it will not save you money with all the package and can food you have to search out and buy."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"I went to two stores trying to find the exact brand name products that Sandra Lee insist we use.

What I like the most about this book is that the recipes are so unique and explicit. It tells me how long it takes to prepare the ingredients, then how much more time to cook it. I love the brand names. I don't know what brands are the best, so it's nice to get advice from the person who invented the recipe. It's also nice to have recipes for every meal, not just all pasta or chicken like some cookbooks. It even has party food for when we have people over (like maybe my in-laws).

Maybe Lee can put together a show about how to make mixed drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic - because she seems to know all about them).To think she follows Ina Garten (who can actually cook) Monday-Thursday, is indicative of the fact that The Food Network doesn't have a whole lot of requirements as to who gets a show on their channel."},{"Title":"Semi-Homemade Cooking: Quick, Marvelous Meals and Nothing is Made from scratch","review":"As the mother of three active children who also works full-time, I have always found preparing quick and healthy meals a challenge.

They \\"conveniently\\" forget to include prep time so it ends up taking hours to get dinner ready or else the food is bland or the ingredients are a chore to find. This book isn't like that. The prep and cooking times are spelled out and are pretty realistic. I can have most meals on the table in less than half an hour. The price for speed is the use of pre-packaged ingredients but frankly after my husband and I drag ourselves home after another long day at the office, every little thing we do not have to do ourselves is a godsend.

There is a lot of unrecorded information regarding Nirvana and thier early recording history, especially behind the scenes of the sessions prior to and including the Nevermind sessions. This book doesn't delve into Kurt's drug addiction, relationships, and eventual tragic death it stays focused clearly on the music from beginning to end and engrosses all the way through. The only book I've found on the Seattle scene that was more accurate and informative is LOSER. Check that out too."},{"Title":"Nirvana and the Sound of Seattle","review":"This book is mainly a fast overview of the Northwest/Seattle music scene in the late 1980's. In fact, it reads more like a long magazine article than a book. Not to say that it's \\"bad\\", it just moves very quickly from one thing to the next without going into any depth. For the first half of the book Nirvana is in it, but just as part of the scene, not as the main focus. It talks about Soundgarden, The Melvins, and other bands, and talks about the punk scene. Later on in the book it does focus more on Nirvana, but that part has to do with drugs, Kurt's burn-out, Courtney Love, feuds, etc., and not much about the music itself. It is a fairly interesting, fast read if you don't know much about the Seattle scene from that era, but for anybody who knows the music scene from that era fairly well it probably won't tell them much they don't already know."},{"Title":"Busted!: Drug War Survival Skills","review":"Wrong! The police no longer care for your well-being. Instead of stopping violent crime, they want to spend their time tracking down your local pothead. If you:-have ever done any drugs.-have ever used someone else's prescription.-have drugs in your house.-have drugs on your person.-are friends with anyone who does drugs.-are ever in the presence of drugs, (yes, just being near a drug or paraphernalia can land you in jail).-Or you just want to know your rights (or lack-of) get your self this book.The police go through training to learn to trick you into incriminating yourself and as Fabricant shows, people have gone to jail for years for as little as .0042 grams of meth. Therefore, you need to know how to compose yourself when the cops show up. This is going to tell you what to do. Don't worry Fabricant is a lawyer. One of his main ideas is to get your self good representation.As a lawyer, his writing is very knowledgable and also very funny. Many times I found myself laughing out loud.Alls fair in love and war, and as far as the war on drugs goes- the police will do anything in order to get another conviction on their resume'. Don't make yourself an example of how locking up drug-users will never solve anything."},{"Title":"Busted!: Drug War Survival Skills","review":"More than anything, this book is hilarious. Any page you open to has a great anecdote - like how one cop felt he had probable cause for a search because he HEARD (yes, HEARD) the tell-tale sound of a bail of marijuana hitting the floor in a private house.The book is also useful, not just for people that use or sell drugs, but for people that are around people that use or sell drugs. PARENTS: This means YOUR KIDS. If they go to an American high school or college, they're going to have friends that use drugs. Think what you want about whether they should be legal or not or whether they are harmful or not, the fact is: YOUR KIDS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH A BUST because they might just be pulled over and one of their 'friends' has his stash in your kid's glove compartment. Then, of course, it might be your kid's stash, but then they need this book more than anything (besides a good lawyer).Ultimately the book is a little frightening. The anecdotes, while individually funny, add up to one scary picture of the drug war. In this country, we lock up the people with a personal problem (call it a sickness or whatever) with people that are real criminals; we do it using methods that violate civil liberties in scary ways; we punish people differently for similar offenses in a way that smacks of racism (the classic coke vs. crack sentencing issue, not to mention the light sentencing that hard-core-addicts of Mother's (and Rush Limbaugh's) Little Helpers get versus your street-variety smack).Fabricant knows his stuff. He's passionate. He's funny. He's a really good writer. This does indeed make a great gift, particularly with the great R.

Spellman skillfully crafts the narratives, while wisely allowing his subjects to tell large chunks of their stories in their own words.It becomes clear as one reads the book that it took a lot of guts to be a jazz musician during the '50s and '60s (and still does). All four of the musicians faced major obstacles in pursuing their art.McLean, who enjoyed the greatest amount of commercial success of the four, especially early on, battled drug addiction. Taylor and Coleman faced open hostility because of their challenging, groundbreaking approaches to playing their instruments. Nichols (the only one of the four who is not still alive) was just plain ignored, despite his brilliantly original playing (check out the two-disk Blue Note compilation of his music), and spent much of his all-too-brief career playing in Greenwich Village dives.In spite of bad accommodations, poor pay, public indifference, critical hostility and difficulty finding gigs, these artists, the book makes clear, would never play anything other than jazz. In this sense, the book has an underlying inspirational message. Still, it remains for America to fully embrace its only true indigenous art form, something which to this day has not occurred.The book also offers insights from the musicians on the creative process and about the historic changes in jazz that occurred during the '60s, from the perspective of men who were on the front lines of the battles between critics, musicians, and the listening public.Required reading for the serious jazz listener."},{"Title":"Four lives in the bebop business","review":"This book is a great resource for someone looking for words to match the music of such greats as Ornette Coleman. Not only does it look at the lives and developments of these people as musicians, but also at the constant struggles such artists faced (still face?) in the music industry. I can't imagine there was any other book of its kind back when it was first published in 1966, but that aside, its still worth a read now that such important jazz figures are more widely appreciated. Spellman has a deep respect for the musicians he writes about. More than a respect, a reverence. This is particularly true of the section dedicated to Herbie Nichols. I picked this book up simply because I'm a huge Ornette Coleman fan, but I think my favorite parts of the book were the conversations with Cecil Taylor. His perspective on Stockhausen is priceless and pretty entertaining."},{"Title":"Four lives in the bebop business","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. The four biographies were wonderful and deepened my understanding of the bebop era and what life is like for career musicians. I was at first drawn to this book because of the biography of Herbie Nichols; I own the complete works of Herbie Nichols on CD but until I read this book only knew that he was unappreciated during his lifetime. Now I really understand Mr. Nichols and my respect for him and ability to appreciate his music is much deeper. Same for Ornette Coleman, who until I read his biography here was to my mind merely an eccentric who had helped ruin the commercial viability of jazz. Thanks to this book I now understand how sincere and committed and courageous Ornette Coleman was. I bought this book on Amazon about a month ago and I do not understand why Amazon lists it, a month later, as &quot;out of print&quot;. I urge anyone who wants to deepen his/her understanding of jazz music to read this wonderful book. People who want to learn jazz can no longer simply go to 52nd Street in NYC and learn from the masters directly. Books such as this book, videos, and CD's are the only way for the current and future generations to learn about the golden age of jazz. Thus, this book is *essential* for a sincere student of jazz. The book's high quality is worthy of the heavy responsibility it thus bears. By the way in the course of the four biographies it contains a lot of fascinating detailed insights about Theolonius Monk, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself 101 Key Ideas: LINGUISTICS","review":"&quot;Teach Yourself 101 Key Ideas In Linguistics&quot; offers concise and comprehensible presentations of linguistics concepts, from 'Acquisition of Language' to 'Writing System'.Use this book to refresh your knowledge of linguistics concepts. Or use the book to grasp what key ideas interest linguists.To explain certain key ideas of linguistics, the author contrasts English with other languages. Throughout the book, the author uses interesting and humorous examples that establish the relevance of the linguistics ideas he presents.I'm using the book as a quick-reference, but if you're new to linguistics, you might use the book to learn what makes linguistics worth doing."},{"Title":"Partial Seizure Disorders: Help for Patients and Families","review":"Anyone whose life is significantly impacted by partial seizures, whether directly or indirectly, should own this book. This is the only book that I have come across that specifically addresses partial seizures (simple and complex), and as such it is tremendously valuable to parents, friends, family members, and people who have Epilpesy themselves. It seems that books on Epilepsy are either very cheap (and broad and shallow in scope) or extremely expensive (and bordering on encyclopedic), but this book falls nicely in the middle. It weighs in at a reasonable price and provides a wealth of information that an interested person might otherwise only find by sifting through a large volume.I have read this book twice and I was still learning as I read it the second time. It includes lots of personal accounts, both by people who have seizures and caregivers (mostly parents of children with seizures). I think that these varied accounts provide a great deal of insight, particularly for those who don't themselves have seizures but must face its issues. The book includes lots of resources in terms of books, addresses, websites, and organizations, and also includes a good section on insurance issues. If your life is affected by partial seizures, you should have this book."},{"Title":"Partial Seizure Disorders: Help for Patients and Families","review":"The information in this book surpassed any expectation I had. What a helpful resource this book is. It explains what seizures are, clearly, for the nonscientist, and then goes on to explain how a diagnosis is arived at. The book continues with advice on living with a partial seizure disorder, dealing with school, jobs, etc., and what kinds of treatments (medical and less traditional) there are available. There is not a wasted page in this book. All of the information is valuable and helpful. If you need a book to help you understand partial seizure disorders, this book will satisfy most every need."},{"Title":"Partial Seizure Disorders: Help for Patients and Families","review":"This is THE BEST book to come out for epilepsy in a long time. It is great for both adults or parents of children with epilepsy, covering everything from medications, complimentary medicine, the various types of seizures and possible causes. I found Ms. Waltz's information is very up-to-date (writing this in June 2001). The reference guide at the back of the book is a helpful resource for finding various support resources, including oversea pharmacies. I highly recommend this book to anyone whose life has been touched by seizures."},{"Title":"Partial Seizure Disorders: Help for Patients and Families","review":"This book is informative on all aspects of partial seizure disorders, from discovery to diagnosis and treatment. I loved how easy it was to read. I read this book in less than 2 days! My only disappointment is that the book didn't touch a little more on the psychological impact of the disorders (and subsequent consequences)."},{"Title":"Partial Seizure Disorders: Help for Patients and Families","review":"Partial Seizure Disorders: Help for Patients and Families by Mitzi Waltz is now the second book I've read about seizures since having another seizure last month. This book is an excellent complement to the first book I read on living well with epilepsy.While this book does not have some of the details that the previous book I read has, this book has more information overall which is why I found them to be complementary.The author begins by distinguishing between the different types of seizures, explaining the parts of the brain, and explaining how seizures work. She ends the first chapter by talking about what to do when you have a seizure or when you see someone having a seizure. This information was very enlightening to me because I didn't know that seizures are rarely harmful. If a person is kept away from anything harmful, and people around them, make sure that they do not suffocate on food or anything else in the mouth, unless a seizure goes on for a prolonged period of time, the best thing to do is be with the person and try to help them relax (15-16).In the second chapter, she explains how to diagnose the type of seizure - if it is a seizure - that one has experienced. She incorporates first-hand accounts to flesh out the doctors and procedures that are used. She also discusses things which may look like seizures which are not.The third chapter deals with how to live with having a seizure disorder, and she discusses ADA, discrimination, rates, and limitations that one will have to accept. She discusses how important it is to have support from professionals and family and/or friends.The fourth chapter deals with seizures in children and has a wealth of information about how to deal with the school system and help that is available to children in schools. She not only talks about schools in the United States, but what help is available in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.The fifth chapter deals with medical intervention. She discusses antiepileptic drugs and has a detailed description of the most used ones, their side effects, and tips about them - which is immensely helpful when you're first trying out drugs. Whether it be this book or the PDR or some other drug handbook, it is important for the patient to do his or her own research and be able to discuss with the doctor what different drugs do and do not do. Some doctors will not like to be questioned, but it is the patient's right to understand what's going on and what might happen. The chapter continues looking at blood tests, EKGs, as well as other tests, surgery, and ongoing research.In the six chapter she looks at dietary treatment, environmental triggers, vitamins and supplements, herbs, and general care of the whole person.In the final chapter. She deals with issues of health insurance - and again she looks primarily at the United States but also looks at benefits and Canada, the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. She also looks at alternatives to insurance. These issues become very important, especially when treating chronic condition - and because most health insurance policies have very limited mental health options.The book ends with an appendix of resources - where one can find information about epilepsy, seizures, the ADA, support and advocacy, medical references, drug company assist programs, and on and on. This appendix alone would be worth the price of the book.Second appendix includes an example of a seizure diary which can be helpful in keeping records as one diagnoses and treats seizure disorders.Finally, there is an extensive glossary of terms, which will be very helpful for reading this book, talking to one's doctor, and reading other books on this topic.This is an excellent resource, and I have found it helpful as I am learning about what is going on in my brain and how to cope with it."},{"Title":"Partial Seizure Disorders: Help for Patients and Families","review":".......with basic factual info. A must have if you were recently diagnosed with partial seizures."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I read this book, and I am only 17 years old. This is an extremely good book, but I would not reccomend it to anybody under 16 years of age...I thoroughly enjoyed it, was scared out of my mind, and was disturbed to the point where I wanted to put down the book but found myself reading on to find out what happened next. READ IT YOURSELF!!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Last year I found this book and once I opened it I could not put it down. Bugliosi is excellent at bringing the details to life on the page.

The murders were described in extreme detail. I had nightmares every night while reading the book. This book has showed me the horrifying dark side that is in some people, and showed why this monster, (Charles Manson)could have ordered the murders. It was also fascinating that the murderers in Manson's &quot;family&quot; were hypnotized to do Manson's deed. I would reccommend this book only to mature readers."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I first discovered this book early 1992 in the UK and have read it at least twice a year since then. It fascinates me, horrifies me to think that such a thing might happen again, makes me think, there but for the grace of God go a lot of us .... but above all I wonder what has happened to those involved in the story - particularly Linda Kasabian, Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Outen, Tex, Patricia Krenwinkel, Sandy, Squeaky, Bruce, Bobby .... well, all of the family. PLEASE could an 'addendum' giving known information be included in future editions?"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter is the best book I've ever read.

Read it in a couple of hours I was that drawn in."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is THE best ever written about the horrific deaths caused Charles Manson and his &quot;familiy&quot;. After reading it, one understands how a criminal investigation works and how a prosecutor puts together a successful case. Even in the jaded '90's, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; still ranks as frightening piece of true crime literature."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I've read Helter Skelter four times now and every time &quot; Hell has been scared out of me &quot;.It's a must read for anyone who loves true crime."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Vincent Bugliosi, the lead prosecutor, and co-author Curt Gentry write a disturbing yet intriguing account of Manson cases. Bugliosi and Gentry spare few details in describing the events before the murders, the murders themselves, as well as the successful prosecution of Charles Manson and members of his cult. The descriptions of how the Manson cult operated paints a picture nearly as tragic as the murders themselves. Although Bugliosi and Gentry make an excellent effort attempting to answer the question of \\"Why,\\" such a question may be unanswerable. Bugliosi and Gentry also continually ask the question of how much control to cult leaders have over the followers? This is a provocative question that comes up during the trial. At the end of the book, this question is re-evaluated in light of more recent events such as David Koresh and Jim Jones.The one minor criticism I have of this book is that it wasn't entirely clear on how the Manson cult was first brought to the attention of law enforcement as possible suspects. The book goes from the murders to ostensible suspects, which are the cleared and then the case goes cold. The book jumps from a cold case to Manson cult as suspects, without much explanation."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Ever since I've read this book, I've been fascinated by Charles Manson. I'd really love to learn more about him in present day and know it is accurate. Vincent Bugliosi should try to conduct current interviews with him. Bugliosi does a wonderful and accurate job of describing the story!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book was haunting, but regardless I couldn't put it down until the end. It is however pretty graphic at times, and I am not one for violence so it may not be for everybody. But deffinatly worth the time because I learned a lot about the people involved and the cases themselves."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is one of my all time favourites. Compelling, well-written, chilling and suspenseful, it is also an excellent social study as well. Bugliosi did a wonderful job not only in prosecuting the case but in writing a book for the ages about it. To get the full flavour of the times, listen to the Beatles' \\"White Album\\" while reading this book. That album was a huge influence on Manson, and one of its songs would end up providing the title to this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This is prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi's 1974 first-person account (with co-writer Curt Gentry) of the Tate/LaBianca murders committed by the infamous Manson Family. The compelling 600+ page narrative proceeds chronologically, starting with the discovery of the bodies at the Tate residence on Saturday morning, August 9th, 1969. It continues through the massive investigation and the eventual June to November 1970 trial of Charles Manson and three of his \\"Manson girls\\". Bugliosi was the assistant district attorney that was appointed as prosecutor, and he became actively involved in the LAPD's investigation, helping to link these murders with other crimes and eventually the Family. The authors excel at explaining police procedures and legal proceedings in plain language, though occasionally slow the pace of the story with excessive detail, mostly during the trial segment. The book contains over 50 pages of black and white photographs of the major characters and physical evidence, including the crime scenes. Bugliosi penned a 30 page afterword in 1994 with updates on most of the major characters. A national bestseller upon its publication, this is billed as \\"The #1 True Crime Bestseller of All Time\\". Like a previous reviewer, I became aware of this book after seeing recent media coverage of the 40th anniversary of the murders."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I didn't find this book (and audiobook in the case of this review) \\"scary\\" in the most real sense of the word, but it certainly was one of the most chilling I've read. Something that law-abiding citizens often don't truly understand (usually until it's too late) is the cold-hearted and very matter-of-fact nature of criminals who are capable of acts like these, something this book captures perfectly through Bugliosi's conversations with the Manson family members and other accounts from the trial. I knew the story but not the details and it was shocking to hear them.The narrator, Robert Foxworth, does a nice job to match the somber tone of the text, as it's written in a very straight-forward way; not a whole lot of inflection on this one, but certainly not dull. In the cases where some animation is needed, Foxworth delivers well."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I read this book for the first time in the early '80's as a child. I picked it off my aunts dusty book shelf. I took it home to read and it scared the pants off of me it was so chilling. Such an evil story."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"What do you say about a book that has sold 7 million copies? That is so unbelievable it has to be true? A name that 40 years later still strikes terror into people? That is the problem I am having as I am sitting here thinking about this review, I just don't know what to say.Before I read this, I thought I knew a lot about Charles Manson. I mean, I DID know a lot, but I didn't know as much as I thought I did. Everyone who has told me they read it has said it affected their life. That is was a compelling read, but they wouldn't read it again. I don't understand that. I think I will there is more to be learned. Mr. Bugliosi is an excellent writer, he tells not just what happened, but details his search to find out the motive behind it. He explains what Manson believed \\"Helter Skelter\\" was. The influence the Beatles had on him (one of the things I didn't know). In an afterward written 25 years after the case, he writes his beliefs about why \\"the nation continues to be fascinated with the Manson murder case. The five year anniversaries of the murders, are marked by articles, news reports, and television specials internationally.\\" He also talks about how other mass murderers and serial killers, the mention of their names does not have the profound effect that the name \\"Charles Manson\\". Even today, his crime stands out.The book is written in eight parts (I think, I can't check because Tigger has absconded with my copy, he wants to read it and couldn't wait for me to write this). It logically progresses from the murders, to the investigation, then the killers, then gives background on Charles Manson and his 'family', his 'girls' as he called them. We read about his opinion of the establishment(no surprises there), other races and women. His total control over the people who followed him, who believed he was JC(Jesus Christ) to the extent of who was their lawyers, what they did and said in court. The book has tons of pictures, drawings, maps and about 10 pictures of Manson, each different from the other, including the most famous one, the one that caused his family to say, \\"Charlie made the cover of Life!\\".Before I read this, someone told me, any fan of True Crime books should read Helter Skelter, and I agree with that statement. I recommend this book.Written 08December2008"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"My book was in exactly the same condition as was described when I ordered it. I am still appalled at how human beings can savagely butcher other human beings that were just at the wrong place at the wrong time. The Tate-LaBianca murders happened right before I turned 6 years old, and I remember when it happened. It has always made me sad for the victims and especially their families for what they have had to endure throughout the years."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This is, by far, the best true crime book I have ever read. Bugliosi writes very well and gives a very detailed account of the Manson trials. I didn't know much about these cases and now that I do, I am completely horrified and so thankful that these people are in prison!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"WARNING- This Book might trigger a long term fascination/obsession with this case.Helter Skelter is an absolutely brilliant and engrossing True Crime book that reads as smoothly as a novel while exploring the countless aspects and characters in this case in an organized easy to follow fashion.In my opinion the Manson Family phenomenom and the Tate/La Bianca murderers are the most interesting criminal case in American History.This case encompasses not only the actual crimes but the worlds of Hollywood, the music business, the counter culture youth movement of the 60's with a little apocalypse christianity and white/black relations as well.Truly amazing stuff and this book depicts it better than any before or since."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"My dad bragged to me about how good this book was when he read the original edition, and that it should even be required reading for high school or college students. It takes quite a book to reach that milestone, so I decided to take his advice and read it. As most do, I knew of the infamous Tate-LaBianca homicides and of the Manson Family, but I never took the time to truly understand every detail.It is a long book, and there is so much information in it that some never finish it, and others just can't possibly comprehend so many pieces put together of what Manson truly believed and preached. I would suggest to any reader that they consider it a challenge to finish it, because it will enlighten them about the whole Manson situation. Do not be discouraged by the high quantity of detail, visions from every aspect.There was a film created based on the book, but it is nowhere near the same caliber, not even in the same ballpark. In fact, of all the documentaries, interviews, and films about these murders one can encounter combined still do not match up with the whole picture that this book presents. There is no possible way that any screenwriter can condense this mountain of information into a two hour run time. And as Bugliosi says himself, no one would read all of these details in a book if no murders were committed. But because they were, and because of what Bugliosi pieced together, it is worth every bit of a reader's time from cover to cover.If you are willing to take the time to truly understand Helter Skelter, then by all means read this book. But if you feel you don't have the time to complete it or just can't digest endless amounts of information and detail, then attempt it when you feel you can because this book does not deserve poor reviews from readers who couldn't grasp what it offered. In the end, I have to agree with my dad. It should be required reading, somewhere. It may be too much even for high school minds to absorb, but it should certainly be seen in college."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"... polluted what was good about the peace-loving hippies and made them the scurge of the earth. The Manson Murders held the city of Los Angeles in a state of immobilizing fear whose tremors could be felt across the country and beyond. Bugliosi's descriptive depiction of this unbelievable series of true events makes this a MUST READ."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Yes, all the reviews are correct: This is an excellent writer detailing some of the most gruesome killings of all time. It is the fastest 650 pages you will ever read, I gaurantee it.One note: This book might also be called \\"Vincent Bugliosi: The Man Who Brought Down Charles Manson And Lived to Tell About It.\\" That is to say, Bugliosi is evidently proud (rightfully so) of his accomplishment as the lead prosecutor on the case. And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude. If I were Kanarek, or a Tate detective, I'd be pretty embarrassed knowing this book is an all-time bestseller.But who are we kidding, this is the definitive book on Tate-Labianca. A truly fantastic read."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I read this when I was 14 and never turned back. Bugliosi's writing is amazing. I have re-read this 3 times over the last 15 years and I never re-read books. Every time I read it I take away something new or a different thought. Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I first read this book in high school and I picked it up and read it again recently. It is a very well written true crime novel and it is written by the D.A. who worked hard to put Charlie away. He does pat himself on the back but the author was faced with trying to solve one of the most bizarre series of killings in American history. When I first read the book it was remarkable to me how young and innocent the killers (the Family members) looked in the pictures. These were practically children, completely brainwashed into following Manson like a slave.Bugliosi does a nice job unraveling the mystery and setting out the facts in the way a talented Prosecutor would. This book still gives me the creeps every time I see it and it still horrifies me to think what people will due when their minds are controlled by a sociopathic, delusional, institutionalized, hardened criminal con-man. They'll never parole those people because they keep going back to the crime scene photos-thank god!!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"One of the most chilling books I've ever read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"CBS recently ran an absolutely awful made-for-TV movie allegedly based on this book. The movie was a pale imitation of this well written and thought provoking book. Indeed, in my mind, the only thing that book and the movie had in common was the title.In the book, Vincent Bugliosi tells a tale of a bizzare murder and the extraordinary efforts of law enforcement to convict the culprits. As the reader, you &quot;witness&quot; the horrorific crimes through detailed descriptions of the crime scene. But, the violence discussed is not glorified but all too real. The reader also comes to understand the mind of a madman and his followers. And, finally, the reader can appreciate and applaud the efforts of Bugliosi to ensure that justice is served.Helter Skelter is truly one of the best true crime books ever written."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This true crime novel covers one of the most sensational American trials of the 20th century, that of Charles Manson and his \\"family\\", who were responsible for a series of gruesome murders in California at the end of the 1960's. Cannot properly call this a mystery since the outcome of the case and the identity of the killers is well known, rather this account of the Manson family written by the prosecuting attorney gives insight into the bizarre motivations for the murders. \\"Helter Skelter\\" covers the investigation of the murders and a detailed accounting of the trial, with great photo insert sections. If this story had been conceived of and written as fiction it would not be believable, here the truth is indeed stranger than fiction.Charles Manson was the product of a severely dysfunctional childhood, and a life spent more inside prison or detention than out. This individual, like a cult leader of a commune, was able to attract young people to him and have them become so devoted to him they believe he's Jesus Christ returned and are willing to [destroy] any random individual for him on command.I'm old enough to remember the Tate/Labianca murders when they were front page news, read the first edition of \\"Helter Skelter\\" way back, and really enjoyed this newer version with the added 1994 afterward by Bugliosi telling us where all the story participants are today. I had no idea that some of Manson's ideas are still around, unbelievable what attracts some human beings."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I remember last year around Halloween I read an article about the best books to read for Halloween. Even the article's author conseded that this was a strange choice (it's not fiction) but had a good point. The first 10 pages of this book are truly terrifying and I guarantee you will be affected. It is also very hard because you can't help but feel desperate for the victims because terror was a part of what these killers meant to put into their last moments of life. And as most who know about this case it was one of the most horrible crime scenes to ever be discovered."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Though this book was written decades ago, it has yet to be beaten in the crime genre. Rarely do I feel that I understand the mind of a killer and have such a vivid memory of a crime."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This is my second reading of Vincent Bugliosi's Helter Skelter this time with the new afterword. I came across a copy whilst on holiday in florida this summer. I read the book when I came home and bearing in mind I was already familiar with the story, I made a major mistake of reading it in bed one evening and suffice to say I had the most awful nightmare. I did not read the book again at night time. A horrifying true account of murder which i still cannot comprehend how a persons mind can be in such a way as to carry out the most unspeakable of atrocities. In fact I watched a recent documentary in the Uk about Ted Bundy and as bad as it was I could not even compare it to Helter Skelter. Vincent Bugliosi's account of the events made unstoppable reading for anyone who is interested in true crime. I would recommend this one for the top of your list - If you can stomach it."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"In the summer of 1969, I was enjoying the afterglow of having participated in the National Boy Scout Jamboree in Farragut, Idaho. For a couple of years, I knew next to nothing about Charles Manson and the murders he commissioned. By adulthood, I'd heard the story many times and when I read the descriptions of Manson in Helter Skelter and read the gruesome accounts of the murders, I was already grievously familiar with them.BUT, I didn't know anything about the prosecutorial genius of Vincent Bugliosi. As I read more deeply into his book, I became more and more fascinated by his imaginative, dogged pursuit. He seemed as much an artist as an investigator as he envisioned scores of possibilities for how the crimes might have happened and as he began to formulate his theory of Manson's motive. Maybe orchestra conductor would be the more apt metaphor: reading Bugliosi's account of orchestrating the investigation and conducting the State's case at trial was akin to observing a great maestro work an orchestra through a complex symphony. I thought Bugliosi was brilliant."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"One of the best true crime books ever written. Helter Skelter tells the horrific story of the Tate/LaBianca murders. In grim detail Bugliosi takes the reader on a journey to find and bring to justice lowlife maniacs who killed innocent people for no reason. &quot;The story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you&quot;, that's an understatement. I have seen Leslie Van Houten on &quot;Court TV&quot; looking like a librarian who stamps children's books and tells them to bring it back in two weeks. Yet she is nothing more then an evil woman who viciously murdered two people. You will get to know each one of the killers and be thankful you never get to meet them. And of course, you will read about Sharon Tate and how she called for her mother before she fell to her death (truly heartbreaking). Then there is the part that tells the twist of fate that had each &quot;Tate&quot; victim somewhere else if only....."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Last year I found this book and once I opened it I could not put it down.

I am now a fan of his work and will be reading everything I can of his."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"My father suggested this book to me--why I don't know, I'm only 17--but I haven't been able to put it down. I was not alive when Charles Manson was not in prison, and I've seen several specials on TV about him (&quot;Portrait of a Killer,&quot; etc, etc), but this book answers all the unasked questions I had--when did all this take place? Why? Who exactly was killed and who exactly did it? All I knew was that Sharon Tate had died in a bad way and that Charles Manson, a total wacko with a swastika on his forehead, was responsible, and that some women and a girl named &quot;Squeaky&quot; were somehow involved. With Bugliosi's brilliant book, ALL BECOMES CLEAR. If you have any questions at all lingering about the Manson case, read this book. Caution, though--the statement on the first page behind the cover is utterly accurate--it will scare the hell out of you. I salute Bugliosi for his portrayal of the whole thing and I only wish I could get in touch with him to explain how much I admire him."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I thought this book was magnificent. The way Vincent Bugliosi described everything in such depth. I found some of it to be dragging in the beginning, but am I glad I didn't give up on this one. The chilling reality is what got to me the most."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Vincent Bugliosi isn't kidding when he writes on the very first page &quot;The Story You Are About To Read Will Scare The Hell Out Of You&quot;. Bugliosi somehow finds a way into the sick and distorted mind of Charles Manson, as he was the prosecutor during Manson's trial. He remembers small details from long ago, never moving over to another topic. &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; is a great albeit terrifying book."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"No one-line summary could be more true. Such heinous crimes perpetrated by the mind of one insane drug-crazed hippy influenced by the Beatles could be nothing more but stretching beyond the realms of sanity.

Verywell written.Hippie Charles Manson is a small, troll of a man. He isugly, he stinks and he is mean as a snake. You will havea hard time understanding how this man had such controlover the young people in his group.He controlled with sex and LSD.He always asked each member if they would die for him.He also asked them to kill for him. Most did.Charlie not only had those 7 people killed on those 2nights in Aug.1969 but he killed many of his group membersand any one who dis-respected him in any way.I can say 2 good things about Charlie--he would not eat meatand he never killed an animal. But, this is also true of Hitler.His varied crimes covered many Calif. counties and it washard to solve cases involving his group because many policedepts. did not share info with each other. It is a miracle thathe was ever arrested and tried for anything.The court room scenes and Vince Bugliosi the dist. atty.arebrilliant. Vince is a master in the court room. He had Charlieright from the beginning.I have read this book over many many times. I think you willend up doing the same. I have bought many copies and giventhem to my friends. The book and crime is over 30yrs old.You will never forget it. I was a soph in college when it happened.I was scared when I heard about it. I was a thousand miles awayin Oklahoma.Charles brought an end to the generation of peace and love. Itwas a time of make love, not war and turn on, tune it and dropout. His killings ended all that. Hippies had turned into killers.Please read this book.NOTE -- I think you will also like THE SEA WILL TELL andTILL DEATH DO US PART by Vince. Good true crime stories."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. With the 30th anniversary upon us, it was exciting to finally understand the crime of the century and this madman named Manson. I had always heard things but never truely understood the depth of this man. Scary and sick. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This is the wonderfully engaging tale of how Bugliosi successfully prosecuted the Manson Family for the August 1969 murders. However, if you wish to learn a lot about the backgrounds of the &quot;family&quot; members, this is not the book for you. This book is from a law-enforcement point of view. If you pick up this book hoping to learn about Manson and his philosophy, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to know how the players were implicated and prosecuted, there's no better book."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"creepy, strange, and a good insight into the evils of man. i was 13 when i read it, and it scared me all right. good, book, buy it, NOT A BEDTIME STORY!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I wasn't alive when Sharon Tate and the six other people were killed by the Manson followers but I sure remember being scared as a kid growing up in the 1970's and seeing their images on TV. This book is a great read and very informative. It is a shame that so many lives were wasted as a result of these killings. The book is chilling and made me feel as if I was in the living room at Sharon Tate's house. See the 'Blair Witch Project'? Read this book if you want to know true human evil and the power of fear."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is the greatest book of the summer. If you haven't read it yet, do so soon. I got it from one of my friends, and it is just so cool. You can not get over the suspense of the book. It's a terrifying mystery that is interesting. Some parts to me are gross. But the rest of the book is terrific."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"bugliosi recreates the events of the manson murders and the trial in expicit detail and reiterates them nemerous times, although never becoming redundant or boring. helter skelter warrants the title of the best-selling crime book ever. bugliosi creates an incessantly fascinating timeline of the events occuring in the life of possibly the most dangerous man of our time--manson. you must read this book!!!!!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"The true story of serial killer Charles Manson andhis &quot;Family&quot;. A great look at the life, the murders,and the trials of one of the most popular serialkillers ever.."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book really had my skin crawling late at night while reading it. It scared me so much that when my cat jumped onto the bed I evacuated my bowels. But I was so scared that Charles Manson was hiding under my bed that I just had to lay there in my own filth. Once the morning sun came up and I was finally convinced that Manson wasn't hiding behind the chair in the corner of the room, I shoulder rolled out of bed and took the fastest shower I have ever taken in my life. After three weeks on the run, I ended up in a little logging town outside of Boise. I lived there for about three years, when I accidentally stumbled across the book at a local library. It brought back all of those same feelings back, and I messed my pants again something awful. If you've got a strong stomach, a strong mind, and a good clean pair of pants, I'd suggest this book to anyone who wants insight into a horrific time in American history. But if you are like me and turn your britches into brown paint every time you read it, you may want to read something a little tamer."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Very informative and interesting. Vincent did a great writing job as well as holding the readers attention. If you are interested in true crime I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Charles Manson is part of the American conscience, so I was of course aware of who he was when I began the story. My mom had told me that it was so scary when she tried to read it in college that she ran down the hall and threw the book in the bathroom trash! So I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.Bugliosi is a very good writer and exceptionally detail-oriented. The story begins with a bit of background on Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski and introducing the reader to the other people that were killed in the house that night. He also briefly covers the LaBiancas, the lesser known victims of that murderous spree. Once the crimes are committed, the story becomes more and more fascinating as the key players and their motives are introduced. It all seemed senseless before and it still seems senseless after reading Bugliosi's exhaustive account. Any true crime fan should definitely give this a read, the ultimate in true crime writing."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter motive is a little far out. Real reason for murder was a copycat of Beausoeil's murder of Gary Hinman."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"When Roman Polanski published his Mcbeth film, everyone wrote, the sombre of this film is due to the just suffered experience of the Manson massacre. That will probably be correct. He went through thus something. Not only that his highly pregnant woman was murdered and, besides, some of his friends: The gossip press in Hollywood at first assumed that the Polanski-scene necessarily had caused such an outrage, considering their drug abuse and their sexual liberality. Short-said: The victims are responsible themselves in this murder scenery. Thankfully Polanski points in his autobiography \\"ROMAN\\" to the author Vincent Bugliosi, who has investigated the things criminological correctly. Polanski complains very much, that the absolutely disoriented speculations of the press - Newsweek, Times, Life magazine - would never have experienced a regret, a reply, a taking back. He wishes heart-felt, that many people make themselves with the book of Vincent Bugliosi, finally, a correct conception of the Manson \\"Family\\" - the word \\"Family\\" Polanski (very much justified in this case) sets always in quotation marks..."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book was really good. It had all the details and stuff about how and what he used to kill these people. It tells you about what kind of person manson was. Which i still belive he was very demented. It is about the trial, which in most books i don't like but this one was very well written and very informitive. I would really recommend this book."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Bugliosi was without doubt a great prosecutor but the whole Helter Skelter theory as the motive over the years has become discredited in fact im not convinced Bugliosi if he tried the case today would use that idea again."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I received exactly what I ordered and received the book when I was told I would receive it."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I was suprised this book appealed to me since I don't typically like horror, blood and gore, or dark mystery novels. What made Helter Skelter different for me tho, was its REALITY; knowing everything shocking I was reading actually occured. The author takes the reader through a very involved history of Manson's roots, digging deep into the psyche of his groopies; those who were willing to sacrifice their bodies and minds to this cult-like lunatic leader who finally came to also request his followers to murder...horribly. If you only read one (1) thriller in your life, Helter Skelter should be the one."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"what permissive issues could ban all photos...a crock to scam full price from Kindle users. Buy a used ppb edition for 35 cents...far more gratifying. Dont let them get away with this."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I was getting really into the story, but when I hit page 304 I got an unpleasant surprise. Pages 305-336 were missing! Instead, a set of pages (298-304, which included several pages of photographs not given page numbers) was repeated. The first page 304 was followed by the repeated page 298-304, and the second page 304 was followed by page 337! I called customer service, and they are sending me a replacement, but I have no idea if the defect was isolated to one book, or an entire printing of them. Buy the book by all means - I'm finding it fascinating. But when you get the book, check to see that all the pages are there, so you catch a problem before you get into the story... cause believe me, that's no fun."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I read this book a while ago now, & the parts i remember the most is when Charles Manson went up to Sharon Tate's house on the day she was murdered & knocked on the door, & asked if this person he was looking for was still here, Sharon replied, \\"no, he doesn't live here anymore\\", Manson replied, \\"ok\\" & left, but when Sharon peeked thru the curtains, she saw manson walking, then stopping to look back at her with a spooky stare. The other part is where the groundskeeper William Garretson heard screaming, then heard someone running towards his caretaker house, & try to open the door, but she turned & ran off, how close he was in been killed. All in all a TRULY FRIGHTNING true story account of one of the most disturbing crimes in human history."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"The subtitle of this book, &quot;The True Story Of The Manson Murders&quot;, is a bit of a misnomer. This is really the true story of Vincent Bugliosi, the investigation of the Manson murders and the subsequent trial. Manson, the Family and the murders are supporting players here. There is alot of detail in this 700 page book and, again, most of it has to do with gathering evidence and boring courtroom semantics. Certainly Bugliosi should be commended on all the work he did, but I don't need to know aboout it. It was exhausting for him; it shouldn't be for me. There is some interesting interaction between Bugliosi and Manson, but it is very brief. I read this book hoping to learn more about Manson because he is strange and interesting. Bugliosi, as a subject (sorry, Vince) is just not very strange or interesting."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Mr. Bugliosi wrote the book on crime investigation in L.A. Reads better than a novel. Explores the life of Charles Mansion from his pre-Family days up to the brutal crimes, and the sick minds behind them. Some of the best non-fiction you'll ever read. Gives the victims a personality, not just bodies without a face. A great prosecuting attorney's handbook."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I remember the coverage of these awful events when they happened, but had forgotten or wasn't aware of a lot of the details and/or false reporting by the media. This book is enthralling for many reasons- it's amazing what people will do while under the influence of someone else and even more amazing how religion is usually twisted into everything, whether good or bad. Shows how easily fairly intelligent people can be brainwashed into thinking and doing things most would never consider. Fascinating, appalling, and unbelieveable all rolled into one."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. I didn't read Helter skelter until I was 22, when it first came out and learned for the first time many of the detail, and the book truly stays in your mind. That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves. Bugliosi wrote with such compassion for the victims and we can truly thank him that these people are behind bars now. Watching Charles Manson talk on television shows how unremorseful he is and will always be."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Twenty-five years after its initial publication, *Helter Skelter* remains the definitive book about the Manson family and the murders it committed in 1969. There are flaws in the book, for sure: the readers are getting a partial and biased viewpoint, that of the successful prosecuting attorney, who rarely misses a chance to congratulate himself for his triumphant strategies and victorious moments; and some of the historical/cultural interpretation regarding the significance of the Manson family and its historical role is not overly impressive. However, given that Bugliosi worked extremely hard to put together his case and then was indeed triumphant, is it not understandable that he would &quot;crow&quot; just a bit?In reading this book, I was struck by the apparent incompetence of the Los Angeles Police Department in terms of its handling of evidence, its sloppy and lazy investigative techniques, and its indifference to criminological rigor in dealing with the case generally. Apparently by the time the O.J. Simpson case emerged decades later, their basic *modus operandi* had not improved one iota.The &quot;Afterword,&quot; added in 1994, brings the case up to date, including an interesting recounting of the fates of some of the principals. What's interesting is that some of those involved in the various Manson crimes have apparently matured and demonstrated real remorse for their acts, whereas others have not. In particular, Leslie van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel certainly are not the same persons they were back in 1969-70, and in my opinion, deserve to be paroled sooner or later. On the other hand, Manson himself remains unrepentant and bizarre, and two of his most loyal followers, Squeaky Fromme and Sandra Goode, have remained under Manson's spell all these many years. Squeaky and Sandra now call themselves &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue,&quot; respectively, and cloak their bizarre, misanthropic right-wing philosophy in the rhetoric of &quot;deep ecology.&quot; This shows how what in many respects is a noble cause, that of &quot;saving the earth,&quot; can be used instead as &quot;the last refuge of scoundrels.&quot;For those interested in learning the details of this most grisly and yet fascinating of all recent U.S. murder cases, Bugliosi's book is definitely the place to start."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I began reading the paper book. I found it so amazing that it was hard for me to leave it for my daily activities. So I went to the beach with the intention to finish reading it. unfortunately, night came and I had to pick my tings up. I forgot to get my book back, so I bougth the Kindle version, which has some advantages."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I had no idea the Manson family was so much more widespread than the one murder everyone hears about. Mr. Bugliosi does a great job presenting the history and breaking down the various individuals involved. A really riveting and informative read. Would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This work about the Manson Family has to be one of the most singularly disturbing works of nonfiction I have ever read in my life."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is compelling throughout and offers insight into the investigation and prosecution of one of the most disturbing cases in United States History."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Growing up I would occasionally here Charles Manson references. What I gleaned from the usage of his name was that it was synonymous to crazy, psychotic and evil. In fact, I even made the off-the-cuff remark at times that someone was like Charles Manson although I didn't know who Manson was, what he did exactly, or even if he was still alive!After reading this book I feel thoroughly informed yet more curious about the enigma known as Charles Manson. Vince Bugliosi did a good job of penning a story that was already written. The murders, Charles Manson, The Family and Manson's pervasive aura was already there and people's interests were already piqued; they only needed someone, preferably an insider, to put the story into print. Vince, being the prosecutor on the case as well as investigator, had just the in depth knowledge needed to write a book.The first 550 pages flowed quite nicely and provided just about all of the details a reader could ask for. The book hit a bit of a snag once Bugliosi began writing about the penalty phase of the Manson trial. At this point some things became redundant and what wasn't redundant wasn't that insightful or interesting. Furthermore, it seems like Bugliosi took this opportunity to get on his soap box by quoting large portions of his closing argument. I think he saw it as his coup de grace but it was only a summation of what I'd been reading the entire book. No doubt, Vince Bugliosi was the arrogant and verbose attorney and that permeated the entire book. It was both overt and covert. A testimony to his self aggrandizement is the fact that he mentioned, at the beginning of the trial, that most of the legal community didn't believe that any of the Manson Family would be convicted due to lack of evidence. Well, due to Bugliosi's investigative skills and being able to see connections when no one else was, he was able to secure a conviction. Many times throughout the book I found him expressing in one way or another how others had missed things or hadn't done their jobs properly.Don't get me wrong, he was a \\"brilliant prosecutor\\", to quote him, I was just hoping he wouldn't break his arm patting himself on the back. In fact, just discovering the whole Helter Skelter ideology made him darned good and made this book worth reading. There was one other rumination of Vince's that I found worthwhile. It is something that I'd also wondered about myself; which is: why was/is Manson so popular? Towards the end of the book Vince posed this question and gave some of his thoughts on it which I found pretty enlightening. He did a comparative analysis of Manson to the likes of Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy as well as Jim Jones and David Koresh, none of whom have reached the popularity and notoriety of Charles Manson.Overall, the book is a must read. Manson is an indelible part of history and probably will never be forgotten. His name will be parroted for years to come as I did in my youth which makes this book a necessity, if only to know how Charles Manson and the Family came to be known."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"A very well written page turner. This book held my attention for all 700+ pages. It's a gruesome topic, but you won't be able to put it down once it sucks you in."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Whether or not you know anything about the Tate-LaBianca murders, you should read &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; an amazingly thorough account of the killings, the events leading up to and after the events, the completely deranged fantasies of Charles Manson, how he converted a legion of sheltered, middle-class kids into his lackeys and (in many cases) killers, and how they were convicted and sent to Death Row (sentences later commuted to life imprisonment). Though Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi's high-minded moralizing can get a bit annoying (but when has a prosecutor not been shrill and annoying?), one can only marvel at the sheer volume of work put into compiling the difficult-to-obtain evidence against Manson and the other killers. They should have had Bugliosi prosecute O.J. After you read the book, try to hunt down &quot;Manson,&quot; a 1972 documentary film about the Family that was nominated for an Oscar.

You will never think of the word &quot;Family&quot; or &quot;Love of Family&quot; the same way again. This is NO bedtime story. You will be checking your doors and sleeping with the lights on after the first 5 pages. This as got to be one of the best true crime books you will ever read."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have read this book several times(Helter Skelter.) I know that may sound silly, but the truth was I knew there were little things I was missing. Each time I read it, I discovered something new. It was like reading a whole new story each time. Mr. Bugliosi is one hell of a storyteller, and I feel I can rest better knowing there is someone like him who cares enough to free us from the sick, perverted, and twisted criminal while putting his own life in jeapordy. Of course, I wasn't at the trial; I wasn't even 5 years old when it ended. But the more I heard about the &quot;Manson Family&quot;, the more I struggled to get my parents to let me read about it. Once I was old enough, my mother bought me the book. I have never experienced anything like it since! I felt as if I was in the courtroom with Mr. B. during the trial. I could actually picture where I would be sitting. I only wish I could have been the judge the day of sentencing. I would have ordered the ex! ! ecution for the very same day. Mr. Bugliosi brought so many things to light about the trial so when a discussion starts about Manson, I feel as if I'm the expert. I felt as if I was sitting right in front of him(Mr. B.) and he was just telling me the story as it happened. I'd like to find other books written by Mr. B., and hear of other cases he has prosecuted. I'll tell you this much: Mr. Bugliosi would make one hell of a defense attorney! Way to be MR. B.!!! Sincerely, and millions of thanks for your dedication and drive, Jeanine"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Any California parole board member who is even THINKING about letting Charles Manson out of prison should be forced to read this book. The book should have been subtitled &quot;Diary of A Madman,&quot; for that is exactly what Manson is - nothing more, nothing less. Vincent Bugliosi, I salute you for getting - and keeping - this monster and his insane followers off of our streets, and then having the guts to write about just how deeply and perversely the human psyche can sink."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Even with the biased jury in Simpsons criminal case,I believe Vince Bugliosi could have gotten at least a hung jury.He is the best prosecuter of all time in my opinion.He is truly concerned with JUSTICE.I recommend reading all of his books"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I found this book very interesting and disturbing. It's all the details you would want to know about the Charles Manson case.To think that one man could convince people to carry out such horrendous crimes. That he had such skill in story telling and making people follow him blindly. I enjoyed reading all the details of the case and how evidence would come up and start up new leads. Bugliosi did an excellent Job of walking us through the crime, and all the way through to the Trial.I could not put the book down. It's a definite page turner, and has many photo's of the victims, the killers and the evidence. Not for the squeamish, very detailed."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Disturbing, Shocking, Creepy, Scary, yet a page-turner, and a-very-hard-to-put-down book... After reading helter, I have this paranoia feeling of double checking the doors and windows locked... Read this book alone at night with your windows open and doors unlocked, I DARE YOU!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Quoting the words of the author, \\"If this murders have never happened and someone wrote a novel with the same sets of facts and circumstances, most people would put it down after a few pages because as I understand it, to be good fiction it has to be somewhat believable and this story is just too far out.\\" but it did happen in the year 1969.This book by Vincent Bugliosi who prosecuted the Manson murders and eventually got the maximum penalty for the perpetrators (death later commuted to life imprisonment) chronicles the murders at the Tate residence to the LaBianca murders, the preliminary investigation, trial and eventual incarceration of the perpetrators.What makes this book stand on its own is that it provides a glimpse of the case from the prosecutor's point of view. Bugliosi is a master of detail as he builds the case brick by brick such as the rope used to tie Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring, the bloodwork on the victims [not as easy as they show it in CSI, mind you] and the .22 handgun used as the murder weapon. Still, he had different challenges when the case reached trial from Manson and his followers' courtroom theatrics to establishing motive which proved to be very bizarre.Aside from providing details of the case, Bugliosi also provides the history of the Manson group, speculates on other murders the group may have committed and draws the societal repercussions of the murders. Updates are also provided on the people involved in the case (Charles Manson, Sadie, Linda Kasabian, Tex etc...). All credit to the author for giving fair treatment to Manson and his cohorts despite the crime's vile nature.Indeed, the writing style and attention to detail makes this the definitive work on the Manson murders."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I'm a chronic true crime reader and have read just about any true crime i can get my hands on. And this book has has got to top the cake.. I have family who despise Charles Manson but have read the book a few times, admitting that they like it. Whether for a person who wants a good read or a true crime fanatic like myself. I've read it about 10 times and just CANNOT put it down. Vincent Bulgliosi engages the reader from page one, making you feel like you're viewing everything..making you feel like you're there and you have to try and solve the crime yourself. Gives a tonne of information about the trial, detailed conversations and confessions, character building.The book is divided into chapters. It starts with the finding of the murders by the Tate housemaid, then the search for the killers, then the investigation and then the trial.I cannot rave enough. Vince sure as hell convinced me the motive was Helter Skelter and he justifies everything he believes with examples.It's humourous, shocking, sad, and very provocative.i recommend it for anyone who likes true crime, charles manson books or anyone up for an interesting page turner of a read."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I first read this book as a teenager back in 1979, and I've lost track of how many times I re-read it, but it's got to more than a dozen times.It's fascinating, and after reading it the first time, I wanted to become an attorney, so I could put away the bad guys (then I found out how much school that requires, so I moved on to something else).This case is, unfortunately, still part of our national consciousness. My home is the general vicinity of where Spahn Ranch used to be, and whenever I have visitors from out of state, they almost always ask me to point out for them where it was.It came at a time when the turbulence of the 1960's was culminating into the jadedness of the 1970's, and I think that has something to do with why it still grabs us so much.One of the things I like so much about the book is the detail, the thoroughness, how Bugliosi tries to leave no stone unturned. The result is nothing short of a literary masterpiece in true-crime, and, in my opinion, it has never been matched in terms of good, page-turning writing, and it has stayed with me in a way that no crime story ever has before or since."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter is the #1 best selling true crime book ever because of three things: It is the story of one of the highest profile murder cases in the world's history, even 30+ years after the fact, it is still an amazing and unique story, and finally, Vincent Bugliosi is a fabulous writer. Most books written by non-writers might tell a good story but not in a dramatic way that a true author otherwise might. Bugliosi has no problem doing that with his books.I thought I had a pretty good idea of most everything that had happened during this whole ordeal that ended the era of &quot;peace and love,&quot; but I didn't know the half of it. Bugliosi needs over 700 pages to vividly recount every second of what led up to the Manson murders and every detail of what was done to bring the killers to trial and put them away. This is without question the fastest and most intense 700 page book I've ever read (and I've read a few), and that can be credited to the sheer madness of this case and the brilliance of the deep-thinking, amazingly-talented prosecutor who closed the case and then wrote this book to tell everything about it."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I highly suggest that everybody read this book. It is, without hesitation, a genuine masterpiece in real life horror.The first page on the book reads: &quot;The Story in Which You Are About to Read Will Scare the Hell Out of You&quot;. That is not an understatement. This book literally kept me up at night fearing that someone could just simply walk into my living room at any minute. It was so vividly described that it put the fear of God in me when I could literally picture the entire array of murders accurately inside my head. It is such a horrifying aspect, a sea of thoughts that will forever remain inside your subconsciousness. I guarantee that when you read the passages describing the horrendous Tate/LaBianca murders, you will gradually build the entire picture inside your brain, to the point where you will feel like you are there, looking down on an excruciating scene of human barbarity. Not ONE detail is left to the imagination.You will feel like you are inside the investigation, working with Bugliosi to pinpoint these motives, journeying with the killers step by step as they act out there darkest fantasies. You will begin to second guess &quot;The White Album&quot; and be disturbed by Manson's seemingly psychotic interpretation of it. (Make a point to listen to this album afterwards, and you will feel transported back to the Spahn Ranch where the madness soon ensued) You will feel yourself singing crazy ballads with the Family, you will become ancy inside Susan Atkins' jail cell. You will be scared alongside Linda Kasabian on the long night ride to the Tate house. All these feelings and more will incorporate your senses whilst reading this horrifying story.All I can do to recommend this book enough to you is to say that it stayed with me and disturbed me for years to come. Every time I read this novel, I become obsessed with the events, haunted when I'm lounging around &quot;in the dead of night&quot;. Trust me, reading this book is like surviving the events yourself. With its graphic detail and play by play analyzation of every possible occurence, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; is one of the best true crime novels ever written. I can't suggest a better title for you to read. Be warned, however: Only immerse yourself in this world if you have a desire to be constantly frightened and possess a strong tolerance for graphic descriptions of violence. Not a book for the kiddies!Reviewed by J.C. HoytOnly the absolute BEST pieces of art recieve the highest rating on the universal scale of stars. Hint, hint."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Let me just say that this is a great book, however buy the print edition. There is a list of illustrations in the Kindle edition, but I've yet to find an actual illustration. The FOOTNOTES are grouped together in the back.

If you had mentioned these things in the description, I could have made a better choice. Please, please make these things clear from the beginning. It's my first Kindle disappointment, so I'm not bitter, just sad."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"One night in 1969 in Los Angeles, California, there were several murders at the home of movie producer Roman Polanski who was away on a trip. One of the victims was Sharon Tate, a beautiful but talentless actress who was eight months pregnant. A short drive away there were two more murders of Rosemary and Leno LaBianca. On their refrigerator, inscribed in their blood were the misspelled words, \\"Healter [sic] Skelter.\\"Fear gripped the city while the LAPD began the manhunt for the killers. With the arrest of Charles Manson, it is up to a prosecutor named Vincent Bugliosi to prosecute one of the most difficult charges of all--conspiracy to commit murder.That is what this story is about--murder, the bungling, the luck, the disappearances and murder of lawyers, the trial and the prosecution that had to bend and adjust to ensure killers did not walk free.While this book is several years old, it is still thrilling in how it can inspire fear because it was real, and because truth is stranger than fiction.The final irony is that a number of these murderers who freely admitted to, and evenly gleefully revealed their lack of mercy during their unspeakable crimes, now blame Charles Manson for what they had done.If you can find someone else to take the responsibility, then you can avoid seeing yourself for what you are-- murderers.Gripping, taut, all too real.Thx."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"&quot;If this was not a proper case for the death penalty, no case ever would be.&quot; In that one sentence, Vincent Bugliosi sums up exactly how horrific, senseless and sadistic these murders were. This is definitely not a case study for the squeamish, and Bugliosi leaves no stone unturned in his prosecution, as well as his investigation, of the Manson murders.Co-author Curt Gentry narrates the first half of the book in the omniscient third-person, informing readers of the stark facts. On August 9, 1969, 10050 Cielo Drive went from being Sharon Tate's &quot;love house&quot; to a slaughter house where 5 victims (Tate, her friends Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, Voytek Frykowsky, and an unknown bystander, Steven Parent) were stabbed repeatedly, and in some cases, shot. The most horrifying image is the death of Sharon herself, who was nearly nine months pregnant, and in her most vulnerable state. The following night, August 10, Rosemary &amp; Leno LaBianca were the victims of the massacre. Aside from the graphic nature of the crimes, messages had been printed in blood. Among them was a mispelled one: &quot;Healter Skelter&quot;.Gentry gives details on the LAPD investigation. At times, the police come off as the Keystone Kops with their obvious mistakes (for instance, an officer presses the gate buzzer at the Tate residence, obliterating the bloody fingerprint originally left there). In other instances, some officers are shown to be thorough in their interviewing techniques and investigations (most notably Dianne Lake, a former member of the Manson family).When Gentry begins to unravel the horrors of one Charles Manson, a small-time pimp and criminal who had spent most of his life in federal prison, the narration is at its most compelling. Eventually, one of the perpetrators of the &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; murders, Susan Atkins aka Sadie Mae Glutz, blabs to her cellmates once too often, and (thankfully) gets the killers arrested. Bugliosi gets assigned to the case.Bugliosi apologizes for the abrupt change in the narration, since he picks it up in the first person singular. However, his ability to relate the details of the case, the personalities of the killers and victims, the forgotten clues, interviews with understandably frightened witnesses, and his analysis of the dynamics of the Manson Family will soon make the reader forget this change in the &quot;voice&quot;. Bugliosi is a trial lawyer who puts 150% into his work, and to read his account of why he had to prove motive, how he got the maximum amount of information from his witnesses, etc., is to read a masterpiece. It's rare to see any lawyer that dedicated to his job. Bugliosi not only has an eye for details that are seemingly unimportant at first, he also has the ability to articulate the main points of the case in a manner which is easily understood by someone unfamiliar with criminal law--a rare combination. The trial was almost as bizarre as the murder, with the defendants behaving as if they were unruly students in a classroom, and laughing at inappropriate times. The most unforgettable moment would have to be Manson's attempted attack on the judge, as his co-defendants admiringly looked on. Those 3 women, as well as the other Manson family members (including the prosecution witnesses), believed that Charlie had magic powers. Considering that he and his four co-defendants were found guilty and got the death penalty, only to have the death penalty overturned by the U. S. Supreme Court, it would seem that maybe Manson DID.In the afterword, Bugliosi goes on to name other unsolved murder cases in which the Manson family members are suspects (there are possibly about 40 victims in all, or even more). His eloquent trial arguments are a reminder of what could have happened if this case had been assigned to a lawyer who DIDN'T always have his eye on the ball. The scariest thing about these cases is that Manson could have easily walked, given the initial lack of concrete evidence. Bugliosi is probably the all-time champion prosecutor when it comes to circumstantial evidence cases. For another one of these books, check out another one of his books, &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;. His final argument is so concise and thorough in the way it covers every possible issue, it must certainly rank among one of the finest arguments in U. S. history."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"In the early months of 1976, my high school sociology teacher told us of a fascinating and horrifying book called &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; that had commanded his rapt attention for months. Published in 1974, &quot;Skelter&quot; was Vincent Bugliosi's riveting true-crime rendering of the notorious Manson family and their murderous crime spree in August 1969. Bugliosi, significantly, was the prosecuting attorney of Manson and his malignant minions and he succeeded - brilliantly - in ridding our society of these senseless savages.I was seventeen years old then, and although I was no stranger to the extremes of human aberrations, I was mute with horror at some of my teacher's revelations. (Sadie Mae Glutz's weird name - and the equally goofy name she gave her newborn son - were the least of her post-partum peculiarities.....Manson family females had to wait until the slobbering canines devoured their meals before they could nourish their own inner children......) Several months later, as a freshman newly transplanted at the University of Kansas precisely seven years after the abominable crimes, I purchased a paperback copy of &quot;Skelter&quot;.The prodigiously gifted prosecutor has created a spellbinding re-creation of the events surrounding that long-ago August weekend. Moreover, he has delved into the pathology of Manson and exposed the mass murderer for what he is: a manipulative, savvy, cold-blooded and narcissistic individual - someone who does not deserve to taste freedom - ever.If you think you know everything about what it takes to convict a criminal - especially someone who (cleverly) avoided the crime scene - &quot;Skelter&quot; reveals the protracted, painstaking and dedicated efforts put forth by Bugliosi to convict these deviants. In those pre-O.J. days in L.A., Bugliosi was fortunate to have a jury who listened - without bias - to the truth, to the overwhelming evidence, and to a talented prosecutor's stunning summation. Happily, Bugliosi was victorious, but his accomplishments didn't end with the 1971 verdicts......Read &quot;Skelter&quot; and learn about the vast research and skill employed by the prosecutor to vanquish his foes (which included a Judge Ito-like milquetoast who referred to Manson's chief assassin as &quot;poor Tex&quot; and nearly derailed the conviction of Charles Watson).Yes, &quot;Skelter&quot; is much ado about Vincent Bugliosi - and rightly so. The prosecutor will forever have my respect, loyalty and admiration for removing these vicious killers from our midst. However, there are valid sociological lessons to be derived from his narrative. Most of Manson's followers (including the would-be messiah himself) endured difficult childhoods. However, a whole lot of us endure wrenching situations. Many seductive and charming people use these traits to lure vulnerable people to their licentious lair - but that doesn't give us license to commit unspeakable crimes. In the end, neither Manson nor his &quot;family&quot; elicit sympathy - not from this reader.In March of 1978, after suffering a nervous breakdown and subsequently enrolling in an out-of-town college that fall, I was accosted on a daily basis by every Hairy Krishna, Moonie, self-professed religious zealot and would-be spiritual savoir on the campus. I couldn't speak very well back then, but I still refused these transparent ministrations - forcefully. Yes, I was disenfranchised. Yes, I was unbearably lonely. Yet I remembered something a wise priest once said, &quot;Remove yourself from the occasion of sin, lest you fall into sin.&quot;We should all, no matter what our religious preferences may or may not be, steer clear of false prophets. In the pantheon of sin, Manson was among the very worst of offenders. Not only did he lead his starry-eyed disciples into evil, he exploited them for his own aggrandizement. To be a destroyer of humanity (a transgression that can never be repaid - not in this life) must surely rank among the worst crimes of all.My eternal thanks and gratitude go to Vincent Bugliosi for providing the victims and their families a most precious gift - justice. It can never bring back their loved ones, but as Doris Tate (Sharon Tate's mother) said, &quot;After the convictions, we slept through the night for the first time since Sharons' death.&quot; The value of justice can never be adequately measured, just as the lives of those innocents lost can never be restored."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Bugliosi holds nothing back and gets as graphic as the case requires; this is not for delicate dispositions, it is a raw, brutal and monstrous example of what depravities evildoers are capable of when the right (or wrong) mix of degenerates come together.... Manson trolled the streets for the homeless, runaways and neglected disenfranchised youth and made them his own \\"family\\" to use a comforting term is a grotesque parody of what family means to all decent people. None of these people on their own would have come together and created this multi-personality Hydra Manson created; he has a special gift for gaining trust and making his worst depravities become reality by virtue of the control he wielded over these lost souls. This is evil, and the right ingredients were concocted to effect one of the worst serial killings of the twentieth century. The background was that Manson was brought up to the house on Cielo by Greg Jakobson who was involved with Manson on some dune buggy deals, and when he found out that Manson fancied himself a country singer he brought him to Cielo to meet Terry Melcher, Doris Day's son and a then record executive who listened to Charli's \\"music\\" and promised him, more facetiously than real, a recording contract. This was simply passing the time, and a fatuous, meaningless conversation that Manson took to heart, very seriously. When the contract never transpired, Manson felt betryaed by Melcher and wanted to get back at the pigs/establishment he saw as standing in the way of his success. Although he spent time trying to find Melcher, and when he contacted the Doris Day house in Beverly Hills, he was rebuffed. Melcher wisely ran up to Carmel to hide out with his mother. Manson, however, did know that there were people, Hollywood people, living there, and he made his plans from that information, to send a message. He sent his team, Susan Atkins, Tex Watkins, Leslie Van Houten et al., to kill the pigs...unfortunately, the people were the worse for wear, and Frykowski, a big tough Pole, was no match for the violence he woke up to; being stabbed multiple times he quickly lost blood and then they turned their attentions to Abigail Folger and Sharon Tate. Jay Sebring (black belt in karate) gallantly tried to protect Sharon, but he was no match for the numbers of the group and their sheer bloodlust. Up until tbat night, Manson was viewed with some wariness, as he was obviously rather disturbed, but the full extent of his madness was not discovered until that August night. I lived at the bottom of the hill where the house was, and arrived home around midnight and saw the car parked at the bottom of the steep road that led yup to the house...I thoguht it was kids making out. A Boy Scout leader a few miles away in Beverly Glen heard the screams, but the canyons have tricky acoustics and we heard nothing, right below the house. My brother had lived at the house when Melcher was there and made some offhand references to crazy Charlie, but he was nothing to be feared until that horrific night. The next morning I was awakend by many, amny cars going up the street, which was unusual, since it was a steep street, and we never got traffic; I looked out the window and counted twenty or more police cruisers and ambulances constantly traveling in a grim convoy up the street, and helicopters flying overhead...this went on all day, and after that, the circus started with tourists coming fom all over the United States to see the \\"murder house.\\" I had met Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski at a small dinner party and never forgot how stunningly beautiful she was; absolutely breathtaking in person, and so sweet. The trial and the frightening lack of remorse was haunting, and we all armed ourselves with guns, not knowing if they would be back; when they were caught in a stolen car raid at the Spahn Ranch, everyone breathed easier....a friend of mine had a cabin in the Sierras and her mother drove up by herself one time and said she saw a schoolbus with hippies in it and they stared at her and as she told me alter \\"Gave her the chills.\\" The combination of these lost souls came together and created a monster that tortured and murdered many people, inclduing Shorty Shea and the La Biancas. Th trial and the crime itself is recreated in meticulous detail and you must marvel at the tenacity and the will of Bugliosi to endure this several month long trial...and emerge victorious. The Supreme Court, in a questionable decision, rescinded the death penalty; but for that, they would more than likely have been executed by now. So they still come up for parole and they still get denied, and long may that continue, because there is no doubt whatsoever, despite claims of new found Christinaity, they would do harm to others when they could...this is a horrific glimpse into the minds and wills of people who are beyond any help or humanity; they are monsters."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"When you open the book, the first thing you come to will be a disclaimer that warns, \\"The story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you.\\" This is no exaggeration! Don't make the mistake I did and read it alone in the middle of the night! I was so terrified that I was afraid to close my eyes.Vincent Bugliosi does an effective job of putting the chilling story of the Manson murders into print. You will learn a few things about our country's criminal-law system as you read the book, so it's very educational.The greatest tragedy in this true-crime story was that Sharon Tate worked hard all her life for stardom yet would find it only in death.I cannot help but empathize with all the murder victims -- some of whose bodies will never be found -- but most especially with the Tate and LaBianca victims whose only crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I realize it is strange to say this is the &quot;best&quot; book ever and one of my all-time faves . . . the subject matter is SO disturbing and the entire tale of Charlie Manson and his family is just plain creepy. But I am a fan of true crime books, and this is the best one out there. Bugliosi does such a fabulous job giving background info, delving into the lives of the Family, describing and detailing the two summer nights when they committed the Tata and LaBianca murders . . . it is so frightening and so disturbing . . . I suggest you DO NOT read this book late at night when you are in a hotel room or apartment all by yourself. You will swear something or someone is creepy-crawling around. To this day that simple phrase &quot;creepy-crawling&quot; makes the hair on my neck stand straight up.Bugliosi does a wonderful job with this book -- I usually am not a fan of long drawn-out courtroom descriptions, but Mr. Bugliosi makes you feel as if you are right there and &quot;in on the action.&quot; Of course, perhaps these courtroom chapters are fascinating because the defendants themselves were so strange, so odd, so malicious and without remorse, that everything they did was of interest. The book is the most frightening, disturbing, realistic, well-written, bone-chilling I have ever read . . . and it is all the more frightening because it actually happened. I first read this book about 4 years ago and have re-read it about 3 times since, and I feel like I pick up on something new each time.This is one of those books you just cannot put down -- even though the descriptions are gruesome, the crimes heinous, the family's lifestyle so bizarre and disconcerting, Manson's hold on them so difficult to grasp . . . you keep turning the pages, reading faster and faster because you simply cannot wait to find out what happens next. I highly recommend this book -- as long as you do not scare too easily. This is one book that stays with you for a long long long time."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"\\"Helter Skelter\\" gives you fair warning when opening its cover. It tells you that you are about to have the hell scared out of you. And it's not kidding.Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi wrote this granddaddy of true crime back in 1974 and even after 30+ years, \\"Helter Skelter\\" remains a true crime classic. The book is a hefty one (over 700 pages)and dissects not only the crimes, but also Charles Manson's background and the Family's various travels and journeys, including run-ins with the law prior to the infamous nights in question. The trial is also covered, which could be in excruciating detail for some.Even with the glorification of violence today, \\"Helter Skelter\\" remains a true story that is so frightening because it could have happened anywhere, to anyone.Read this excellent account, but be sure that the lights are on and all the doors and windows are locked."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Have any of you not read the Manson File? It is obvious that you cannot control people with LSD, and it is obvious in the fact that Manson did not kill anyone."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"The fact of the matter is this book is total fiction, the elaborate work of Vincent Bugliosi's imagination due to due his ignorant and superstitious \\"ideology\\".He needed to give \\"evil\\" a face... and Manson was convenient.\\"Helter Skelter\\" has made Bugliosi wealthy beyond belief.I guess whatever sells a book, right? Charles Manson, a human being... was simply collateral damage."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"this book is quite possibly the biggest load of bs ive ever read in my life!.anyway,this is the guy who put away charlie manson's story of the events surrounding the killings supposedly carried out by the manson family.all im saying is ive never seen a more one sided,no win situation as his court trial.he was busted from day one and everyone knew it.not because they had a good motive and solid evidence but because they needed someone to pin all this on.ill quote now from bob dylan........\\"it makes me ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game\\".whats more they had very weak physical evidence also.the book is very biased ,very long and detailed and extremely violent.ill leave the rest up to you but a quote by napoleon might better express how i feel \\"what is history but an agreed upon past?\\"the past is written by the victor and thats painfully true here.i mean did the beatles ever make you want to kill?come on!drop acid maybe,protest is possible,having unprotected sex with people you dont even know-of course..............but murder?get real!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I realize that this is the first book a person will come to when searching on MANSON. However, you should really just skip it and watch the Made-for-TV movie which cut out all of Bugliosi's egotisical grandstanding and actually did a much better job of revealing what it was like to be in that circus of a court-room. The film also accurately depicts how much Bugliosi relied on the statements of tripped out Family members who did not participate in the killings in order to construct his &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; theory of the Crime. Do yourself a favor and buy CHARLIE'S FAMILY by Jim Vanbebber available here at Amazon.com in addition to this book. The two will show you the opposite ends of the theoretical spectrum on the Manson case."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Bugliosi's ghost writer for this one crafted a skillful tale of the heroic prosecutor deciphering the real motive of the murders, despite the incompetence of the police department. You should know that practically everyone who studies the Manson case in detail regards this book as a work of fiction, the same way they regard Bugliosi's ridiculous made-up motive of &quot;trying to start a race war&quot;. There is some info here that is hard to get elsewhere, but otherwise this is simply an attempt to sensationalize and make money. There are far better books you can read on the Manson case."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Vincent understands nothing about the intricate inner workings of the mind of Charles Manson. He totally misses the point. It would be nice if The Beatles were mystical figures from The Bible, and possesed god like powers to influence The Family towards committing any unpleasantness. Doesn't Vincent know that Charlie only listens to the music of Bing Crosby?"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"In this decade of fear, the drama of the Manson family murders is making a comeback. Unfortunately, it's still the same self-aggrandizing slasher-porn that it was in 1974. In amongst pages upon pages of case minutiae (this overlong monster weighs in at 713 pages), Bugliosi alternates between gratuitous gore and telling us what a great prosecutor he is.
