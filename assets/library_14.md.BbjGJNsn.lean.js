It is a difficult, very complicated book. In fact it is perhaps one of the most detailed and intricate books I have ever read and in many ways more dense than The Forty Days of Musa Dagh or Ulysses or Beloved. The first time through was a murky muddy read, and I must admit I almost put it away on several occasions. The second time through however, and the pieces began to fit together, and the bulkiness of Mossman's writing style was no longer a hindrance. The third time through and I must say that I think I truly understand what Mossman was trying to do, and there is no other way to put it, but this is perhaps one of the greatest works ever written. One might argue that for a work to be great it should be great from the first read, and that it shouldn't take three or four reads. Well, I guess there is some truth in that, however, I guess the best analogy would be with jazz music. How many of us who are used to listening to easy music would appreciate the abstract complexities of Ornette Coleman or John Cotraine the first time through? Some of Coltrain's runs are so abstract and are played with such speed that truly one would have to be a musician in order to appreciate what he is doing with only one listen. And I truly believe it is the same with The Stones of Summer. This book is so good that, simply put, it is beyond good. It is in the realm of pure art. It is saddening to think that many of the reviewers would only read the first twenty pages of something this bulky and awesome, and then capriciously come to the conclusion that it is only worth being a \\"doorstop.\\" The voice of Dawes Williams is such a powerful American voice, and in the first twenty pages the surface hasn't even been scratched yet. It is true you must be an advanced reader to read this book - or at least be willing to become an advanced reader. Is this elitism? Maybe a little. But it seems a little ridiculous to buy a hard book and then turn around when you realize you are out of your league to complain that it should be a \\"doorstop.\\" If you can't take the heat, stick to Michael Connelly or Stephen King, or if these are too difficult, try the next installment of Jackie Collins."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I think this book has been adequately reviewed here. Most of the time I would say that any book that generates this kind of feedback is worth reading. I am unsure whether this book is worth reading. I must admit that I was disappointed.But I think I was disappointed because of the hype. It is rare in our culture that literature gets any recognition at all in our society. I saw the Stone Reader guy on the Today show of all places. He convinced me not only to read the book, but also to look forward to reading a lost American treasure.This book is no treasure - see above and below. The only thing I'll add to the the reviews is that I never seemed to care very much about the characters, no matter what happened to them. I never got to know them. And at time overwritten? Yes, I found myself occasionally skipping paragraphs, which I never, ever do.But I think the acerbic responses here are partly due to intelligent readers feeling duped by effective marketing and one guy's enthusiasm. If I had stumbled upon this book on my own, I wouldn't have loved it but I wouldn't have thought it was worthless either. Simply put, it has the faults of many first novels.Read this book if you want. You may like it. Some readers here definitely did. But I have to admit that I was glad to see some of these sanctimonius reviewers feeling duped - they make a lot of effort here to seem superior."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Every serious reader of serious literature has personal favorites that aren't accepted in the general canon...which may even be hard to defend on conventional critical grounds. I myself love Luke Rhinehart's &quot;The Dice Man&quot; and Jean Stafford's &quot;The Catherine Wheel&quot;--novels that (among many others) have a certain cult following but otherwise haven't really gained any stature with time, or managed to stay in print.This is offered as preamble to another (mostly) negative review of Dow Mossman's long-out-of-print magnum opus (his only opus, in fact). The documentary &quot;Stone Reader&quot; created extraordinary expectations around this epic debut, because the filmmaker's enthusiasm about it and finding its creator after 30 years was so inspirationally passionate.So, it turns out &quot;Stones&quot; (which I happened to get in a first edition hardcover from a local library system--but only because all the recent reprints were checked out) is one of those garrulous, unfocused, under-structured gasps of &quot;writerly&quot; excess that were not uncommon in the 60s and early 70s. Back then those qualities were taken for evidence of unfettered creativity. When they occur now (see: David Foster Wallace), they can signify the same, or just an editor who's asleep at the wheel. (The latter is apparently an industry-wide problem at present--and the brilliant but undisciplined Foster Wallace is its worst-case-scenario.)&quot;The Stones of Summer&quot; is the sound of a youthful writer in love with the propulsion and lilt of his own words. Those qualities don't necessarily translate for a reader, however, and there's no question that the forced lyricism and digressive indulgence here overwhelm whatever small narrative force/character-psychological insight Mossman has to offer. Barely a sentence passes without the author describing something simple as &quot;like&quot; something meaninglessly fancier--&quot;the sun dying before them like the insides of a stone melon, split and watery, halving with blood,&quot; to quote from the book's very first paragraph. All this filigree comes at the cost of anything more involving. The author doesn't seem much interested in direct reader contact, anyhow. He's too busy trying to dazzle us.That said, &quot;Stones&quot; reveals a genuine writer--too bad he never got further chances to hone his craft. For all its indulgence, the bloated, barely interesting novel still suggests Mossman might've created great things had he stuck to it--and had the publishing industry stood behind him after this first critically-acclaimed, commercially-dire effort."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I'm tired of reading of people who &quot;saw the movie and couldn't WAIT to read the book...&quot; The book stands apart from the documentary and they have absolutely nothing to do with each other.To judge this novel based on what 'Stone Reader' fans think would be a crime. 'Stone Reader' is a love letter to all literature, to be shared with all people who love to read. 'Stones of Summer,' on the other hand, is not for everyone; it is a book of ideas and will be treasured by those who love ideas, and by those who will not be scared away after a mere 100 pages.Easily one of the best books I've ever read. But don't create expectations that have anything to do with the 'Stone Reader' documentary."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I loved the review that listed the 5 worst written sentences in this book. I got my own copy and underlined 5 others that are just as bad. Here they are.1. Dawes thought she was at her most attractive when she was irritated--lips pursed, cheeks flushed, and eyes flashing, though not so much like lightening flashing as like a spark of static electricity from touching a fluffy cat after shuffling across plush carpet in a cold, dark room.2. He shifted uncomfortably on his stool looking at the topless blonde bombshell on the bar, but the first thing that struck him was the pulchritude of the exotic dancer's lips, which glowed like maraschino cherries, that is, pitted cherries macerated in an almond-flavored syrup then heated to boiling in an alum-containing brine full of carcinogenic red dyes3. She lay next to him that night, regretting sleeping with another while they were broken up, knowing she had done nothing wrong but feeling vaguely unclean, like freshly washed, once-folded laundry that has been shoved off the bed onto the floor and slept on by the dog.4. Dawes lay in bed musing at the slight wrinkles in the down comforter was attracted to her like a moth to a flame - not just any moth, but one of the giant silk moths of the genus Hyalophora, perhaps Hyalophora euryalus, whose great red-brown wings with white basal and postmedian lines flap almost languorously until one ignites in the flame, fanning the conflagration to ever greater heights until burning down to the hirsute thorax and abdomen, the fat-laden contents of which provide a satisfying sizzle to end the agony.5. Which like waves in a gently wind-blown semi-calm sea heaved gently as she moved her legs under the cover and alternately wiggled her toes, causing a rogue ripple to course across the bed and die against the shore of the pillow."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Reading this novel was like swimming upside down in a vat of peanut oil. Everything seems like it's inverted and moving in slow motion. If a book were ever measured by its weight, then Stones of Summer would be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, you may want to read the book. Once you open it and try to sit down to enjoy it, you realize you are not reading a masterpiece, but instead a long-winded, boring tale about characters that you really could care less about. I really want to meet the person who has read this all the way to the end. He/she probably also competes in &quot;iron man&quot; triathalons and peruses the tax code for pleasure. The most torturous element of the book is the collection of wholly unlikeable characters. By the middle of the book I didn't care what happened to any of them - in fact I would have liked the book more if they had all died in a fiery car crash."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"The Stones of Summer was in the dollar bin at a local Borders (now closed, of course), the catchy title, the wide expanse of sky and plain caught my eye. I thumbed a few pages and those caught my attention, thinking it was a fast paced, moving coming-of-age story. The over-eager blurb on the back cover over-stating how wonderful it was to the critic should have been a bright red flashing and clanging warning bell.Usually, I can get through any book, however slow and plodding. What I didn't count on was the overflow of exposition, the long and rambling descriptions of places, the often pointless dialogue. I could only force myself to finish about 1/3 to 1/2 of the book. Never before have I stopped reading a book because it was too boring. And I've read ALOT of books.The characters are often too introspective. What teenager spends pages of inner dialogue? Especially a teenage boy? The grandparents were almost caricatures of farmers and farm wives. The hard-working, dust-covered, hard-bitten farmer, spending twenty hours a day plowing, the hard-as-nails, flour-covered, with-a-soft-heart grandmother toiling away in the kitchen from dusk to midnight, ever mindful of her husbands wants and needs.Best friends that cause only trouble for the young boy child, where parents are somewhere not to be found raising their seemingly only child. The boy just seems to do whatever he wants with his friends, in his own little world. I don't know, the book was just unnaturally written and unconvincing.I would give it a 2, only for sheer size and audacity."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I enjoyed this book and it was well written. It's a nice reflection of spirit of the time and it's well constructed. I've noticed that people either love or hate this book, but I'm wondering how much of the reaction of those who hate it is due to false expectations based on the movie Stone Reader. I think this book will appeal to those who enjoy literary writers similar to James Joyce and love reading well fashioned prose. However, if you're searching for a book that will change the way you think about the world or this piece of American history, you may be disappointed. The book is excellent for what it is: beautiful prose about a writer's experience growing up in a culturally empty place in a particular time."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"see the documentary \\"The Stone Reader\\" and then go out and buy this book!!!Dow Mossman is an American treasure and the writing in this novel is magnificent. This book follows a young man through childhood, the teenage years, and then young adulthood in such a tender and revealing manner that I winced at the very real descriptions of human struggle both within oneself and outside one's control.thank you Barnes and Noble for getting this back in print. Dow, if you read these comments from time to time, thank you for sharing your genius with avid readers."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Down to the howls of the midwest from the wind barren plains of growing up during another post war and enduring the harshness of the cold plains and the hardness of people that survive outward beyond the walls of the cities. A portrait, not just prose of words thrown in for feelings but an actual workable angst written up in the story line drawn out in the conclusion. Pictures of the people of blood lines living until the character's separation from what was what as in American life more so than others of a generation split that America offers in its freedom to move which the fifties opened up. Then came the sixties and the traumatized separation into heightened disorientation of that separation from childhood beliefs into disbelief of the standard norm outlined with Holden Caufield's vision of hypocrites; a citified vision of 50s upper class hardened by the harshness of war in angst of disbelief of the 50s society's norm that all was not well. Stones of Summer covers the next generation's angst well into experience. A well written and mind boggling craft/tomb of words constantly moving, like America has always been. An amazing long piece of work written by a youth as like his peers expressed themselves in songs he in his youth produced this masterpiece and left it all behind in a life lived otherwise than this author."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I'll keep it short, because most everything has already been said. The book absolutely dominated my attention for a week or two. The alienated Midwest upbringing, the almost violent rebellions (usually for no real reason)-- it all rang perfectly true. That's the first half of the novel.Then came Dow's person saga: his real-life descent into madness. Via the book, I felt each dip and swerve as Dow Mossman's life unraveled. This is the only chronicle of schizophrenia worth reading that I'm aware of.So why 4-star instead of 5-star on the review? Because I long for some kind of closure -- I wish I could read the book he SET OUT TO WRITE before the voices in his head became too loud to ignore."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"One of the jewels of American literature. Take your time to read and enjoy the imagery created by this in sightful author."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I was blown away by this book. I heard the buzz and leafed through it in the store and saw right off it had a wit and deepness that is rare.It is about a boy growing up, but unlike many books done that way, captures it from inside-out in a way I have never encountered. Dawes Williams and his friends are full of trouble-making romantic escapades. The book is very funny and at turns tragic. The last part finds the rebellion of youth turned into the alienation of adulthood amidst the turbulent but inward-turning '60s.The 3 parts are all distinct but all of one great mind-bending saga. The story flashes back and forward and weaves and builds and turns back on itself a generation later in a post-modern style. An incredible feat that is like Faulkner, Joyce, even Twain. The comparisons in the media don't exaggerate.I haven't read as funny and moving a book since Eggers' Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius and few Big Books of the current school even approach The Stones of Summer. No wonder it is from 1972. I am much younger than that generation but The Stones of Summer captures it better than anything else I have read. How was this book out of print and not heard of for so long? I guess I'll have to get the movie to find out, but it is so great to have a book like this NOW when so much fiction is straight linear toss-offs headed for movie options.No wonder I've turned lately to nonfiction for brilliant writing. Stones is not for everybody, I realize, but for many, many of us, this is a book, in all its character and roller-coaster excess that will live on.If you want to return to the days when books completely enveloped you in a completely expansive way and weren't just commuter diversions like I guess this last reviewer was expecting, this is a must have."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I found this book very interesting and enjoyed Mossman's prose. I can't wait for his next novel. From the reviews that have already been posted about this book, I'm reminded of how political books are rated by individuals ... there either 5-stars or 1-star ... depending on your viewpoint."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Like others who saw the film Stone Reader, I was dying to get my hands on this book. Before I was halfway through, I was dying for it to be over. The Stones of Summer is the ur-Great American Novel, a sprawling, woman hating 600 pages long. Like most Great American Novels, it's about a boy. Dawes Williams, 8 years old in 1949 as the novel begins, talks like no 8-year-old you'll ever meet. His language is foul and lyrical and polysyllabic. This is an early clue that author Dow Mossman does not particularly value realism. By the book's end, the narrative is broken up into incredibly tedious passages from Dawes' journals and long dialogues with doctors, girlfriends and alter egos. Stones tries very hard to be a literary book. Jonathan Swift, Hart Crane, Mark Twain, Herman Melville, William Shakespeare, Laurence Sterne, Jack Kerouac, Ernest Hemingway and Walt Whitman are all influences, and our hero Dawes is often reading one or another of these writers. Note the absence of any women from the list. At one point, Dawes samples Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" but throws it into the sea in disgust. Mossman's female characters - all peripheral - are either Beautiful Morons or Beautiful {women}. Older women are boringly conventional, except for Dawes' wise, mystical neighbor Abigail. Who needs more dated misogyny?"},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"{Give them an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time and eventually they'll produce the complete works of Shakespeare...} This ain't Shakespeare, but then again you wouldn't have to wait as long for it. The author could probably write some powerful poetry (I found some of the metaphorical images absolutely stunning) but the rare glimpse of brilliance in this almost random jumble of text only makes the lack of coherence even more frustrating. Unless you have an infinite amount of time to read an infinite number of books, avoid this one. On a scale of 1-5, it gets one banana."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Okay...I have not been able to finish this book. Some of the author's choices of words are somewhat suspect. In the very first paragraph, he claims that &quot;the conversations inside the car were like great wood eyes&quot;. How in the sweet Spanish Jesus can a conversation be like a great wood eye? This edition should come with a sheet of LSD, then maybe I could begin to grasp some of the concepts.

After a struggle of over ten months I finally finished the sprawling and increasingly incoherent story and must admit I'm mystified. Entire paragraphs were completely incomprehensible, with mixed metaphors and comparisons meant to paint a portrait of images and feelings that left me without even a murky idea of what was intended by them. Certainly not worth the time to read, or the $14 I paid for it (which, frankly, is the only reason I felt compelled to finish it). I dislike saying anything so negative, but I'd like to save someone else the pain of feeling invested in finishing over 500 pages of this mess."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I think the review from &quot;island girl&quot; in Concord, MA says it all. Mossman is an INCREDIBLY bad writer. If a book quickly goes out of print and is never heard from again, there's probably a REASON! I disliked his writing style so much I couldn't get past page 10. What a bizarre disappointment after that terrific movie! For heaven's sake, don't buy this book -- try to get it from the library and see if you can stand even 20 pages!"},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Applying the axiom that &quot;brevity is the soul of wit,&quot; this tome is the essence of inanity. Plodding, antediluvian prose and stultefying characters make slogging through this work a mind-numbing, pointless task. If you want a coming-of-age book, go read McCullers' &quot;A Member of the Wedding&quot; or &quot;Paper Moon&quot; by Joe David Brown.

Any mention of Mossman's nihilism must take into account the devastation of the theory of Americas's unique place in the world...and it's undoing, that to this day, has left its scars on our psyche.Dawes Williams is the antagonist of this book, and his childhood in middle America (Iowa) is depicted in intimate detail. His family discussions that take place in their car trips to his grandfather Arthur's home and dog farm do not use the words of a ten or eleven year old, but foretell the precocious nature of Dawes...precociousness eventually leading to madness.Dawes tries to break away from his family's traditional life- style and only his summer neighbor, Abigail Winas understands him. On pg. 53 he believes \\" In his coming he was left behind. In these stones lie the dreams of my waking. In these dreams lie the stones of my sleep\\"..yet his grandfather's fields were \\"his blood\\". Dawes was looking for a place \\" to stone himself off from\\" but he realizes with Abigail's help that he ..\\"won't be able to help himself\\" On pg. 529 he discovers that \\" knowledge drawn from structural learning, reason and assimilated research is mostly dangerous bunk..it is not only an illusion in progress...it is recessive in nature\\" apriori (intuitive) learning is all.As the book ebbs and flows into Mexico, into the \\"novel\\" Dawes is writing, into \\"history telling\\" from his imaginary cousin, into madness, Dawes realizes there is no point to life. It becomes...\\"another summer stone evaporated into dustless cold\\"On pg. 364 when he is in an asylum, he states, \\"there is no sense to be had in the universe.

The first part of the book is 162 pages of stunning prose poetry that transported me back to my childhood. It describes a young boy's, Dawes Williams, visit to his grandparent's house with all of the mystery I remember upon entering the world of adults apart from your parents for the first time. Every word has meaning though some my find it too dense and difficult. The second part of the book is written in a radically different style - simple storytelling similar to Stand by Me or Stop-Time - as Dawes experiences his teenage years. The third part of the book takes place during the tumultous 60s in what can only be described as a wild ride that contains one of the most amazing predictions ever to come true. Dawes takes a very 60's trip &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; as he searches for meaning.I haven't had this much pleasure from a book in 20 years. It takes some work but the rewards are worth very bit of it."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"After seeing the documentary, it was a foregone conclusion that this book must be read. The composition by someone as young as Dow Mossman is a monumental achievement in itself and worth your attention. My background is similar to that of Dawes Williams, although the ranches grew cows not dogs. The book leaves you asking why the characters act like they do, compulsive onward pushing behavior leaving destruction in their wake, never showing guilt overtly but building a powerful inner self hatred. The writing is compulsive as well and in sync with the development of the story. Like an underpainting, there is a sub story here as powerful as the main one, that of the characters' lives off the page. This is another feature of Dow Mossman's artistic achievment. The poetry of his language is just lubrication to keep your eyes sliding across the pages."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I couldn't finish this book.

Mr. Mossman replied, &quot;Because everything is lost.&quot; If this strikes you as a pearl of Zarathustrian wisdom, I suppose these 560 pages of &quot;oceanic&quot; prose, ebbing and flowing away with a charmingly disregard for such stodgy concerns as structure and narrative momentum, just might be your meat.

The last section covering Dow's slow disintegration on the beaches of Mexico (drugs, mental illness, women, writing) was a bit self-indulgent and anti-climactic after the thrilling, profanity-laced, bomb-throwing, incendiary ride of the second part. But then again, I have no idea how any author could have continued this story beyond the second part.This a sad, painful and hilarious portrayal of a group of young men living the American dream. A time in the American midwest, now vanished, of small towns and a group of comets who came searing across the sky.Best scene: It's a tie: the boys charm a girl and her mom from a neighboring town after a night of drinking AND the searing evisceration of the final joyride the boys take as a group....Hold on to your seats, make pot after pot of coffee, and prepare to give yourself up to one of the great odes to misspent youth written in the past 60 years...."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Looking at the number of 5-star reviews vs. the number of 1-star reviews, it looks like people either love it or hate it.

Note the absence of any women from the list. At one point, Dawes samples Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" but throws it into the sea in disgust. Mossman's female characters - all peripheral - are either Beautiful Morons or Beautiful Ladies of the Night. Older women are boringly conventional, except for Dawes' wise, mystical neighbor Abigail. Who needs more dated misogyny?"},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"There is no shortage of novels like this, usually on bookshelves fewer weeks than yoghurt in grocery stores before they're shifted to remainder tables. These babies are immensely long, mind numbing and suck the reader into a vortex of verbige. \\"Miss MacIntosh, My Darling,\\" which came out a few years earlier than \\"Stones,\\" comes to mind. \\"Runaway Soul,\\" \\"The Tunnel,\\" \\"Harlot's Ghost.\\" Books that are best skimmed because life's just too short to read every self indulgent sentence.You pick up \\"Stones\\" and start to read...and read...and read..and then you realize you're only on page 15. You calculate \\"Hmmm...this is going to take awhile.\\" Then you think, \\"Well, there must be more to it..\\" And indeed, some of the language is quite magical, guardedly compensating for an absence of plot and non-existent character development.And so I finally ground to a halt on page 504, convinced that the paper following page 505 was now weighing in at about 20 lbs a sheet. I felt like a character out of Beckett \\"I can't go on..I must go on..I can't.\\" And so I didn't.All in all, Mossman and his editors should have followed Fred Astaire's rule (applicable to both vaudeville and novels, and paraphrased): get your act down pat and chop it in half."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"If you like the tightly written prose and page-turning stories of books like the Da Vinci Code, this novel is probably not to your taste.Chances are good you'll form a strong opinion about \\"The Stones of Summer\\" before you finish the first page and those feelings, pro or con, will be engraved in stone before you finish the first chapter.And, if you stay the course through all 586 pages, you may well damn the book and its hype or praise the documentary and the reviews that led you into its labyrinthine universe.Yet, if you're a dreamer or a writer, your ability to consciously create and describe worlds can only be enhanced by experiencing the words and images in Dow Mossman's novel from its opening on an Iowa road in 1949 to its ending along the Mexican coast in 1968.Language forever strains against its bridle. From Hilgard Avenue to West Wood Street to Randolph Circle, the latest slang both includes and excludes while dynamically altering reality from the smile or frown on our faces out past the far horizons. Even so, many writers are content to work within a static \\"Same Words, Different Book\\" level of consciousness, forever clinging to their old safe language like a holy pacifier. Mossman, however, turns both consciousness and language inside out and I expect he knows the risks.Mossman's novel has been characterized as both epic and plotless, his protagonist as both self-absorbed juvenile delinquent and sensitive sage, and his language as both floridly hallucinatory and haunting with emotional depth.In the large universe of this compelling book, all of these statements are simultaneously true and false. Paradox itself is the motive power of this novel.Caution-Mossman's themes, stories, characters, references, and omnipresent symphony of metaphor may be hazardous to your health. Do you accept the risk?Then drop the reins of conventional reading and allow the galloping words to carry you through the dangerously beautiful landscape of stones where, at journey's end, you'll emerge transformed by the infinite potential of language and/or stunned senseless by its addictive insanity."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I am enjoying The Stones of Summer immensely. I am nearly at the end, which I am prolonging because I don't want the book and its originality to end. I'm writing this because I can't believe the reactionary tone of some of these reviews. Weird.It is actually quite an easy story to read, even in the last part where the book fragments into a beautifully written, new journalism riff, certainly ahead of its time. By the way, some of the stuff quoted for the book here are brief sections from the main character's notebooks--a wannabe thinker and poet--and meant to be satiric. The book's language works to evoke a certain sensibility and is not always direct but that seems to give it the great power that everyone who likes it talks about.The story follows Dawes Williams, a boy with the soul of an artist through childhood and teenage years. The adults are far away from the narrative, and the boy's precociousness moves him to all sorts of rebellion, against his family, his trouble-making friends, and eventually society/America as it degeneratesinto war and self-absorption during his early adulthood. But don't be misled, it is not a boy's book. It has a mature sensibility.Without a doubt, The Stones of Summer is the best look at the sixties I've ever come across in fiction, and the only one that has bridged the fifties as it morphed to the sixties. Yet, it does it in an artistic, observant fashion, with quite a bit of dialogue toward the end, a la Hemingway, a departure from the lyricism of Faulkner at the book's outset, where the boy's memories of childhood hold center stage. The grandmother and grandfather and their relationship is brilliantly conveyed and draws you in before you know it.As I said, this book may not be for everybody, but it is certainly a major work. I would have loved to have seen Faulkner's Hamlet-Town-Mansion trilogy in one volume reviewed here, or Pynchon's V when he was published, without a backbone of 50 years of critical support. What would these same readers have thought?Why do I like it so much? I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that The Stones of Summer is a wonderful departure from the current fast-as-movie novels that are so prevalent today. It is the first book I've read in a long time where I found myself stealing time to read more. And at other times putting the book aside after a few pages because it was so rich with character and place that I just wanted it to linger.As I said, it is more than diversionary fiction. This is a truly different kind of book that surprises the reader not just in its twists and turns, but in its language and humor, often Swiftian.The Stones of Summer is a very moving--not sentimental--tour-de-force, wrapping a whole generation's stories and social history into one big read. Especially at this price, don't miss it. Otherwise, you really may be missing the one outstanding book of youth that speaks to your heart today."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Barnes and Nobles is perpetrating the greatest literary hoax in years and all at the expense of a very ordinary novel that should have stayed forgotten. I tried to cut through the thicket of verbiage, but the writing was so self-indulgent and adolescent that I stopped at page 75. Previous reviewers were on target about this book's mean, anti-woman slant. All the women are hideous caricatures: saints or street-walkers and often both. The author has the insights and prejudices of an unelightened 14 year old boy."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I discovered this book on the shelf with mostly hack job bestsellers and romantic trash, and a few books on Law Enforcement at a beach house we rented this year. It was one of the all time great beach read discoveries, probably exceeding the time I found The Magus in a beach house. It is sprawling, poetic, confusing, spiritual, overwritten and magical, I am a severe literary snob, but this is an great book, and belongs in the upper echelon of twentieth century american novels."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"The Stones of Summer was first published in 1972 and garnered some remarkably favorable reviews in the New York Times, the Washington Post and elsewhere. It failed to find favor in the literary marketplace, however, and was soon out of print.Enter filmmaker Mark Moskowitz, who had been impressed by the review in the Times and bought the book when it came out, but didn't read it until years later. Whereupon he concluded it was a masterpiece and wondered what had happened to the author.His search for Mossman's whereabouts is the subject of The Stone Reader. The film inspired Steve Riggio, CEO of Barnes &amp; Noble, to buy one of the copies of the book still available and republish it under Barnes &amp; Noble's imprint.Obviously, some people think this book is great. The Times reviewer, John Seelye, is evidently fond of jazzy verbal riffs unencumbered by common logic. In the introduction he has written for this new edition of Stones, he extols the virtues of &quot; 'galactical' reviews, which [surround] the book in question with digressively spiraling nebulae.&quot; Heavens.Nothing wrong with stylistic innovation. But it should illuminate, not obfuscate. I found Mossman's particular stylistic high jinks irritating and distracting. When I finally managed to keep the language from getting in my way, I realized that the story and characters hardly rubbed elbows with reality. Arthur and his wife arguing in the farmhouse kitchen sound like the Ralph Kramdens on crack.OK. Maybe Mossman never intended to provide a realistic portrayal of life in Iowa. But neither does he provide a plausible substitute. His novel is set in his own private Iowa. Definitely not a pleasant state."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I picked up this book and couldn't put it down.

My purpose in entering the fray is not to critique the novel (which I found pretentious, unfocused and quite deadly) but to express my outrage at its publisher for planting fake reviews in this section. By comparing many of the favorable reviews listed below to the promotional literature that accompanies the book galleys, I have determined that at least four of these &quot;reviews&quot; (specifically ones from Los Angeles, Columbus and Philadelphia) contained lines lifted directly from the publicity sheets. The most glaring example is a review from a &quot;Bob Shanker&quot; in New York. An entire paragraph of his review is taken word for word from press materials I received in the mail. From my years in the publishing industry I believe that an &quot;interested party&quot; was so distressed by this book's bad word of mouth that Amazon.Com was bombarded with phony rave reviews to offset the bad ones. Rarely have I seen anything so utterly cynical!"},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"The main character of The Stones of Summer is an amiable genius who accepts and accommodates (and in turn is accepted and accommodated by) a group of decent friends of average abilities with nicknames like \\"Dunker.\\"The novel is divided into three books. The first tells the story of the main character's family going back multiple generations on his mother's side. This book has a lyrical quality and evokes a sense of loss, former grandeur, and tragedy.The second book tells the story of the main character's adolescence. A folded piece of paper pulled from the main character's back pocket turns out to be a sensitive poem that his friends ridicule without mercy. The narrator later says of the main character, \\"He would always live here, in this place, among these stones, this grass. And he would always be locked up within, the knots of dreams.\\"The third book reveals that the main character was only 12 when he was \\"insane for the first time. He never talked about it. No one knew.... He stood, not believing civilization, yet wanting to come closer, as if he had just seen the Godhead itself rise up nameless and without need of a face, as if he must run and tell us about it now, quickly, before it vanished again into wherever it goes when it isn't here.\\"The novel runs to nearly 600 pages and requires a certain amount of effort to steam through. Even so, I would put it on a par with A Confederacy of Dunces and Look Homeward, Angel. It is one of the most remarkable and most memorable first novels that I've ever read.

Before I was halfway through, I was dying for it to be over. The Stones of Summer is the ur-Great American Novel, a sprawling, woman hating 600 pages long. Like most Great American Novels and Steven Gillis' recent &quot;Walter Falls&quot;, it's about a boy. Dawes Williams, 8 years old in 1949 as the novel begins, talks like no 8-year-old you'll ever meet. His language is foul and lyrical and polysyllabic. This is an early clue that author Dow Mossman does not particularly value realism. By the book's end, the narrative is broken up into incredibly tedious passages from Dawes' journals and long dialogues with doctors, girlfriends and alter egos. Stones tries very hard to be a literary book. Jonathan Swift, Hart Crane, Mark Twain, Herman Melville, William Shakespeare, Laurence Sterne, Jack Kerouac, Ernest Hemingway and Walt Whitman are all influences, and our hero Dawes is often reading one or another of these writers. Note the absence of any women from the list. At one point, Dawes samples Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; but throws it into the sea in disgust.

Who needs more dated misogyny?"},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I came to the AOL site for The Stones of Summer in order to write a review. I have published 2 reviews on The Stones of Summer in other periodicals and wished to offer on AOL my comments at length, but having read the reviews published prior to mine on this site, I wished to respond.As a reader, a reviewer and a writer, I know well how rare the occasion that I've composed or come across a review which begins with the edict: \\"If you read nothing else this year...\\" and yet, here is such a time The Stones of Summer is a literary force of nature so rare in creation and scope that it simply should not be missed. The Stones of Summer is a brilliant find, a definitive and remarkable work of art brought back for a whole new generation to read. To suggest that this novel is \\"a graduate students exercise in excess\\" or \\"not an accurate representation of Iowa\\" is to miss the point entirely. The Stones of Summer is a work of such immense breath and depth that the read is not always easy, I admit, and it is possible to miss the full scope of its brilliance. At once lyrical and comical, phrased with a narrative that is like a postmodern Faulkner, the story unfolds like a dream.A bit of history: In 1972 Dow Mossman published The Stones of Summer, his first -and only - novel. The book met with strong early reviews, and had enough hardcover sales to warrant a paperback printing. Yet, as is often the case with literary fiction, the novel soon disappeared from the American consciousness.So, too, did Dow Mossman. At 29, three years removed from earning his MFA at the Iowa Writer's Workshop, Dow vanished, and for the next 30 years no one in the publishing world heard a word from him.In 1998 the filmmaker Mark Moskowitz revisited The Stones of Summer - first purchased when he was 18 - and captivated by the book, took it upon himself to search for Dow, and in the process wound up returning The Stones of Summer to the public eye. (Moskowitz' hunt for Dow is chronicled in the magnificent film 'Stone Reader.') The Stones of Summer is clearly a work of genius. The writing is akin to a postmodern Faulkner, at once comical and transcendent. Divided into three parts, each section has a distinct narrative and compelling tone. The first section deals with Dawes Williams as an adolescent coming of age in Rapid City, Iowa during the nineteen-fiftees. Over the course of some 600 pages, the novel follows Dawes into the turbulent sixties where he struggles to adapt to an ever changing America.Throughout the first section, we are introduced to Dawes' family - parents Leone and Simpson, grandfather Arthur, and wildman friend Ronnie Colman - and taken on a magical trip as Dawes goes with his parents to Arthur's farm, converted several years ago to the raising of greyhounds. The prose is eloquent and uncompromising. (\\"The afternoon, smooth and even, was beginning to tail into evening like a river flowing into a glass of dead light.\\") There is a dreamlike quality to the first portion of the novel, a slow poetic journey which unravels itself in the hours after first being read.The pace of the second section is much different as Dawes enters his teenage years, and along with Ronnie, revels in the wonders of his youth. There are a myriad of adventures along with a steady recognition on the part of Dawes of the future awaiting him and the changes to come, both personally and for the country as a whole.The final section of The Stones of Summer is more closely related in tone to the start of the novel; the narrative voice at once elliptical and mystical. Issues regarding the social climate at the time in America and Dawes own life as a young man offer a reflection of the 60s so insightful and staggering as to shake the very foundations of the reader's soul. There are journal entries and a mixed narrative voice which keeps the reader intrigued in a way a great work by Auden causes one to cock their head and anticipate distant voices. The Stones of Summer is a rare find, a definitive and remarkable work of art brought back for a whole new generation to read as a treat not to be missed!Steven Gillis is the author of WALTER FALLS..."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I too expected big things out of this book after seeing the movie Stoned Reader.

Stones of Summer is a mudhouse of verbiage that collapses under its own pretentious weight. By the end of the book I felt sorry for the poor author, Dow Mossman.A note on the documentary:I originally gave Stone Reader a positive review on amazon.com despite reservations about the director's dubious 'search' for Mossman and his annoying attempts to upstage the publishing people he interviews. What changed my mind was a recent newspaper story about how he sent our thousands of e-mails begging others to leave favorable reviews at amazon.com, even if they had never seen the movie. Trickery of this sort lowers my opinion of both the director and his film. Neither is worthy of our consideration."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"This is, of course, a breathtaking book.

This is a challenging novel; yes it's big, but the language is rich (curses and all - maybe Mossman used them for a reason?!*GASP*) and it's ultimately rewarding for those with the courage to stay with it.

The bad news is that it is not very good. It is the graduate thesis of a Creative Writing student at a Midwestern college. The pity is that the student is not as promising as we have been led to believe. Whoever compared Stones to Stop-Time has obviously not read Frank Conroy's memoir very closely. Stop-Time was understated and lyrical. This bag of showoffy tricks is overstated and hamfisted.

This book was passed around my college dormuntil it fell apart like in the movie. Now that it's back, I re-read it to see who changed more, me or it. It not only holds up, it's more amazing than I remembered. It is a profound work, because it takes you in and out of your own experiences and sends you back to your own memories. Mossman's world, once you get into it, can envelope you for some time. In a good way. It stays with you.When I was 22 I loved his rebellious nature, now I see that it is quite a mythical structure Mossman builds. Today, they might break a book like this up into a trilogy--that seems to be the trend. But it is one complete story start to finish with leaps of imagination. Part 3 which is still way-out there, also now seems very here-and-now, which speaks to how the book was probably ahead of its time back then.A very funny, sensitive, and almost tragic work.

Even positive reviews mention finding the main character repulsive, so I feel page 26 was a good place to stop. I still feel that Dawes has a chance, and can carry that feeling with me as I start a new book.I would have to recommend to other readers to give the book a try at a book store before spending money on it. If you are not put off by the heavy handed style you may like it. My guess though is that you will not. I'm too old to push through something that is supposedly brilliant that my senses tell me is not. Especially a book so long.

Or, bizarrely, is the very same person with nothing better to do but hoot and howl.Ask yourself why would some small-minded reviewer spent time ripping this book so vehemently? Anyway, I guess if you can hammer it without even giving it a chance I can give it a 4 by just leafing through and seeing it is clearly a major, original piece of writing that probably deserves all the hoopla. Books like this don't come along too often--the racket these days is too overloaded with failed screenplay writers trying to make a living selling thrillers. But when John Nichols, Thomas Sanchez, and other MAJOR, well-read, gritty novelists respect a book enough to have written MAJOR things about it, I have to think it is the real deal. Certainly a book worth having in print, which seems the point of the whole endeavor.Interesting to watch a few disgruntled webloggers spend so much time still slashing virtual tires and setting virtual fires.

Director /narrator, a speed reader, acted as if books are personal trophies. Most of us rush along while we read, eager to turn the page, conditioned to move in life as relentlessly as factory workers with a drone ethic. But the best readers are not stone readers. The best readers are the slowest. Speed reading, an American invention, turns out to be skimming, which is not reading at all. The book turns out to be unreadable rubbish. I give it two *s because it makes a great doorstop."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"When I found this book in the book store and read the cover it sounded like a very good read. After looking over some of the pages I was a bit taken aback by some of the prose but thought it would turn out to be a good read. I was wrong.You have to love this book to finish it. I struggled through several tedious pages trying to figure out what the heck Mossman was trying to say, finally giving up and putting it away.The characters weren't very well explained and the conversations they have are just plain boring. Mossman's descriptive style reminded this reader of the hippy-speak of the sixties. It didn't make sense then and it doesn't make any now."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Before I begin, let me dispel two misconceptions I've spotted in previous reviews of this book.1. Stones of Summer is in the tradition of James Joyce and Thomas Pynchon.I suppose if you took Stones of Summer, Ulysses, and Gravity's Rainbow, then flipped through all three very quickly while reading snippets here and there, you'd mistakenly detect cosmetic similarities. These are illusions. While the latter two masterworks are meticulously structured (check the annotations if you don't believe me), Summer has no structure at all. Rather, it is three short stories' worth of material padded out to 580 pages by a prose style that desperately aspires (and fails) to capture the music of Joyce's and Pynchon's symphonic wordplay. From the forced opening similes to the monotonous recurring imagery of stones, blood, moons, and falling timbers, reading Mossman is like listening to an orchestra rumble franticly through the notes of the lower register, only occasionally daring to attempt a high note or a chord change.2. Dow Mossman was ahead of his time.No, Mossman was all too depressingly OF his time, and is now very much behind the times. The book's third section especially exemplifies the self-indulgent noodling that was the fashion in postmodern literature of the late 60's/early 70's, when this book was written. In light of the literary shifts of the last thirty years, Stones of Summer will seem downright quaint to most readers.As for the book itself, it is packed with grad student indulgences from the get-go. The first section, for example, covers Dawes Williams' summers spent on his grandfather's farm. The chapters are rife with half-hearted Faulknerian pretensions, from Dawes's gnarled family history to the deranged chicken lady's American Gothic lifestyle. Along the way, Mossman consistently confuses repetitive verbal tics (Atttttts Dawes, Suure, Aw Criminy, etc.) with colorful characterization. Then there's precious little Ronnie Crown, an evil vindictive delinquent who'd destroy you for even the smallest slight and speaks in the dadaist swearing jags of an 80's action movie. The only reason you put up with it all is the hope that it will improve.It doesn't. By the time Dawes' adolescence rolls around, Mossman has abandoned the Faulknerisms in favor of bad Kerouac. Section Two feels like a long, hot drive across Iowa trapped in a car full of drunken imbeciles. Even worse, the author stacks the deck in their favor by giving the parents and authority figures less presence than those off-screen muted trumpets in a Peanuts cartoon. He also, in the manner of certain Adam Sandler comedies, tries to pass his moronic protagonists off as clever by making every victim of their cruel pranks stupider than they are. It's unfortunately short-sighted that Mossman never delves into the latent homoerotic nature of their friendship. When they humiliate an ugly girl in front of her parents, you wish she'd just step up and echo the heroine of Y Tu Mama Tambien, \\"All you do is talk talk talk about sex when all you really want to do is **** each other!\\" But of course, nobody is allowed to behave with any wit or intelligence, and so the boys get plastered every chapter, fight, and destroy property without a single person trying to impede them. SPOILER ALERT: When these jerks meet their end in a car crash into the Mississippi, you'll be cheering. Natural selection wins again.Ultimately, Dawes and friends are not the spirited youths Mossman paints them out to be, but self-destructive crypto-fascists who beat each other up whenever a thought more complex than \\"God, I'm drunk\\" is expressed. For a drinking game, I suggest taking a shot every time THAT particular statement is trotted out and treated as some vibrant life-affirming profundity. You'll be dead long before you reach the third section. Trust me, you'll be better off.The third section, as I've said, embraces everything that was bad about postmodern literature, most notably the self-indulgent \\"experimental\\" style and the \\"I give up\\" attitude towards one's relationship with the world. The book loses what little focus it still has and stops more than it ends.The only reason this jumble of undisciplined wanking gets two stars from me is there are occasional flashes of brilliant description and insightful human moments before they are quickly buried in pretentious doggerel. Overall, these rare pearls feel accidental, much as anyone can hit a pi&ntilde;ata if given enough swings. The author could've written three good short stories. Instead, he wrote one bad novel.Especially horrifying is that Mossman is a graduate of my own alma mater, the Iowa Writer's Workshop. Apparently he didn't get his hand slapped by Frank Conroy enough because his work lacks the three cornerstones of that writing program: Meaning, Sense, and Clarity. The book is pointless, its structure arbitrary, and its descriptive style vacillates between muddy and completely opaque (especially during the more chaotic narrative events).It's no surprise that Dow Mossman has never written anything else, since he clearly had nothing beyond a few anecdotes from his own life to begin with. What is surprising--no, mind-boggling--is why Mark Moskowitz even considered this junk worth rescuing from the ash heap of failed literature where it belonged. Instead of feeling amazed or enlightened or even exhilarated by Stones of Summer, readers and hopeful writers will be depressed by this pathetic, thinly disguised autobiography of a dull man who had nothing to say and far too much time to say it."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"LITERARY FAILURE IN EVERY SENSE? SO WHAT?My opinion is the same for Melville, Hawthorne and James. Many share my opinion and express relief when they find a fellow unbeliever in these icons; they are happy to at last be allowed to say in public, and above a whisper, the &quot;no no&quot; that all of those writers are dull dull dull. Masterpeice Theatre rescued James, and could probably manage with those mentioned above, and may have for all I know, but I defy anyone to make something worthwhile of STONES OF SUMMER with unrealistic characters (kids of eight sounding twenty eight - c'mon - this is suspension of belief to the max. And when they get to be eighteen they sound eight.) There is simply no door in this thing to some worthwhile place. A total downer. One wonders why it ever found a publisher, but then one wonders why it takes so long for some stunning books to find one, and that some don't find one at all during the writers' lifetime and we may well conclude that some never do. Perhaps the most worthwhile book ever written has never seen print and never will. Publishing is a crap shoot at best. Save your money.I am not happy with writers who would conduct a cavarly charge at a walk, send their attorneys down to the OK Corral to negotiate instead of going themselves, ride merrygorounds instead of real horses, and would have made Sherman's March to the Sea look like a retreat."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Into the gobbledeegook go slipper the whipper and the trimtrammaduhdeedo, believing the glubbledubble spewed forth by a madman. What do you think, am I a genius or what? Just send me thirty bucks and I'll send you the next 670 pages.Here are three words for Dow Mossman that he should have tried to make sense of: Ther-a-py. The guy may have had potential at one point, but he ended up a nut. And this book proves it. And also, since he was such a worshiper of Aristotle's, he should have watched out for the philosopher's famous warning: &quot;No great soul is exempt from a mixture of madness.&quot; True enough, but it is the conquest of that madness, not the surrender to it, which makes a great soul remain so. Mossman, in pitiful fashion, lost the battle, descending from a promising wordsmith to a full-blown babbling idiot.

InDesign is the one application in the Creative Suite that I have the least experience. That said, the first and third chapters of the book seems unnecessary. It first tries to convince you of the advantages of InDesign and chances are if you are reading the book, you have already purchased the application. The third chapter deals with converting from PageMaker or Quark - again a decision that has already been made.The heart of the book is really the project section. It takes real world projects and takes you step by step how to create them. The projects include developing print collateral, creating an advertisement, designing a production sheet and a business brochure. This section is enhanced by an online resource, where assets used in the projects can be downloaded - so you don't have to worry about stopping and creating content while trying to learn the program. Of course, if you want to substitute own your content, no problem.Ms. Indiano uses clear and concise language, easy to understand and follow.

The author has chosen projects that are commonly required from fairly simple business cards and letterheads to sophisticated newsletters and annual reports. As a technical trainer, I am often teaching marketing professionals, administrators and their assistants how to use InDesign. This book is perfect for this market. Many people who are not professional designers, including small business owners, are tasked with creating catalogues, order forms and more and simply do not know where to begin. Or perhaps they have tried on their own, only to find their local printer telling them that they did it all wrong. This book will guide you with simple step by step instructions for using a powerful software application. Your projects will look professional and perhaps more importantly, you will understand the printing process and how it affects your design projects. I highly recommend this book for people who need to produce business reports and company collateral, but may not use InDesign every day as a working professional.

A well developed table of contents and index also make the book one you'll go back to when you need more information on these functions in the future.In addition, Indiano's years of experience in graphic design enable her to go beyond the application itself and offer important tips for creating successful projects and working with printers and output agencies.

It does take the average cook out of his/her comfort zone at times, as I had to make a trip to my local Indian grocery to buy spices I'd never heard of...but it was well worth it! The dishes are amazing and when I've made them for friends my guests have been amazed. I guess my only criticism is that I wish the cookbook told more about where the different dishes originate (Northern India, Southern India, etc.).

Bordermen are self-appointed protectors of the region and both are very capable. They set out on the trail to determine who the renegades are that are stealing Fort Henry horses and kidnapping the women. Also, there appears to be a traitor at Fort Henry helping the renegades.

Sure it has all the excitement of your standard page turner, but it also manages to develop the characters (all of them) to a degree that goes beyond the typical pulp fare that is usually associated with westerns (unfairly so, I would add). Zane Grey manages to flesh out the hero and his love interest in a way that makes them come alive, especially through the use of colorful colloquial language that feels like it could be authentic.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a solid read that goes beyond a simple adventure story, but still delivers on excitement."},{"Title":"The Last Trail (Ohio River Trilogy (Audio))","review":"The plot of this story is simple. A Virginian and his beautiful daughter come to the western frontier of Ft. Henry, in modern West Virginia, where she falls in love with the gallant borderman Jonathan Zane.

After killing all the outlaws and the bad Indians, Jonathan forsakes his wild ways and settles down to respectable life as a farmer and father. Lots of 19th Century values are bandied about, the general superiority of white America is proven in word and deed, and the lawless frontier is beaten back to the wilds of Ohio. Residents of Cincinatti may feel at times that that's where it stayed.Grey's prose is outdated but easily read. Where he shines is in his descriptions of nature.

Turns out it was more of a historical, fictional, romance shoot 'em up. The historical context was educational and appears to have been based on real characters who inhabited Fort Henry in the late 1700s. At that time the fort was in a very remote part of the country, and even though the Revolutionary War was taking place \\"in the east\\", the Fort and its inhabitants were living lives independent of the struggle against the redcoats. The author at times lapses into an overly detailed horticultural description of the trees and bushes which gets a little tedious, but this is more than compensated for by his accurate, pulse-quickening descriptions of the bordermen and their hand-to-hand struggles with the redmen and the outlaws.

I took what I could get out of it--in inspiration and in caution--and will now move on and read the other new books out there. What continues to surprise me about the forums which surround the first books listed in Amazon is the amount of needlessly disdainful reviews which appear. The two long reviews which have appeared here for &quot;Cusp&quot; were clearly written by articulate, intelligent people--and yet after a while, given the heavy-handed dressing-down these reviews perform on the book, one begins to wonder about the reviewer and his or her state of mind. Why would anyone take a half-hour of his or her time writing a review that amounts to, at the least, a kind of road rage, and at worst a kind of hit-and-run? It's one thing to feel a great passion for poetry, to feel that every book should shine with ever-newer possibility and accomplishment, but it's another thing to focus on one book like &quot;Cusp&quot; and gleefully trash it. &quot;Cusp&quot; is part of the huge plurality of work that's being done in American poetry now; if you don't like it go on to something else."},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","review":"This is a very average book of poems--little to excite or delight. The poem about the last Castrato reminded me of that film Faranelli--a good film, an okay poem. The dog and wolf stuff reminded me of James Dickey's famous poem about the stage between dog and wolf. The language in these poems is neither dazzling nor surprising, but one can sense that the poet is dedicated to the cause of poetry. The imitations function well as tributes, if not as full-developed poems.I do wonder why the reviewer below would waste fifteen minutes writing a review of someone else's review. That to me seems ridiculous. The poet doesn't need anyone to defend her work. Any new book of poetry is a good thing. This book is fairly inoffensive if not unremarkable. I would think the poet would be delighted that people are reading her book and have any response to it at all. I wonder what will come next for this poet after she have moved beyond the \\"Cusp.\\""},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","review":"(Reading these other reviews, it occurs to me that &quot;workshop poetry&quot; is taken as a bad thing. When someone thinks the poetry is original, they write that it is &quot;not workshop&quot;, when they think it stinks, it &quot;reeks of workshop&quot;. Both have been used to described &quot;Cusp&quot;. It's interesting how much the definition of what a &quot;workshop poem&quot; is varies...)I wouldn't use the word &quot;workshopped&quot; to describe this first book because it would imply that I believe these poems were actually submitted to other people, including a seasoned and discriminating instructor, for review. I understand that at one point, sometime in her young life, Ms. Grotz was a student in the MFA program at Indiana University. I have to wonder if maybe these poems were the ones she kept taped up in a shoebox during that time, afraid to submit them lest anyone criticize them and question their sentimentality. That's what I get when I read these poems: no &quot;workshop&quot; about it.There are a few things young poets need to stay away from: Vermeer, France, losing their virginity (or not), Villanelles, getting drunk, photographs of childhood, France and Vermeer. Grotz writes cliche poems.I give the book two stars because she's young (and because I didn't see Vermeer make an appearance anywhere in this collection). I'm hoping she waits another ten years, actually lives a life original enough to write about (or just gives up and writes about someone else's life) and finds a way to share it all in such a way that isn't so darn mediocre."},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","review":"Over the past few years, I've come to really respect the decisions of judges for the Bread Loaf Writer's Coference's Bakeless Poetry Prize, usually awarded to gutsy and original first collections--the vitality and urgency in the poems of previous winners like Sam Witt, Malinda Markham, and Mary Jo Bang helped reaffirm my previously lagging faith in the kinetic energy and forward motion of contemporary American poetry.Naturally, I had been looking forward to reading CUSP--selected for the Bakeless by Yusef Komunyakaa, one of my all-time favorite poets. Well... where I'm from we always try to say something nice. The book has a beautiful cover. The poem by Bonnefoy, a good French poet, that Ms. Grotz uses for her epigraph, is beautiful and made me want to read more Bonnefoy instead of continuing on with the book in my lap. A couple of the poems in CUSP are decent--the poem &quot;Cusp&quot;'s not bad, though rather slight. And it's hard to deny the lyricism of &quot;Self-Portrait as a Drowned Man,&quot; and the beautiful crescendo at the ending of &quot;The Waves,&quot; both of which poems feel like they were written by a different poet, sommebody willing to refrain from posturing and let her guard down a bit, somebody with an innate respect for language, an ear for music, and an eye for imagery and narrative detail. I don't know why Mr. Komunyakaa chose this book.Some of Grotz's blurbers seem similarly stumped and blurt out nonsense about the collection: the usually discerning critic Edward Hirsch claims the book &quot;glows with a mysterious blue light!&quot; Fellow blurber Carl Phillips, another brilliant poet, says something about how &quot;Grotz situates us... in the now of ruin and abandon.&quot; That doesn't sound particularly pleasant... Another writer has decided to inform us that the poems are &quot;strong like night trains&quot;? Ahem. Maybe this is just what they call an apprentice volume, one that the poet later comes to regret having published. I'm prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt; it is a first book, after all: however, I feel compelled to warn inncocent readers away from this assortment of trite juvenilia.The first poem begins with the gratuitous insertion of a French phrase, as if knowing a few words French provides Ms. Grotz with the requisite pedigree to spare her the criticism of readers who will soon realize they have wasted their good money. After the bon mot, the poet hastily takes on a fairly weepy journey through her Texas childhood, a childhood that apparently embarrasses her because she can't write honestly about Texas without a high-brow gratuitous reference to reassure her readers that she has evolved from her working class (?) Texas upbringing: Ms. Grotz writes of Lubbock (which I acknowledge happens to be my hometown and a source of real pride: in short, don't mess with Lubbock), &quot;I have defined my landscape by its shapes, the family/car's four doors ajar in the driveway/like a cruel piece of farm machinery,/or my friends who listens to Mahler with long pieces of stiff paper/he folds up or down/to make a skyline for each symphony.&quot; Now how did that Mahler get in there? I'll be a good sport and not point out the pathetic fallacy of the cruel farm machinery and the grammatical incoherence of the whole sentence.The next poem is about the poet's very ordinary loss of virginity in good old Lubbock. The Lubbock cliches of tornadoes and Buddy Holly are invoked, but then out of nowhere cines another grammatically incoherent namedrop: &quot;Nights/a Thomas Hardy novel in all its naive countryside/could absolve me in a smoke all night coffee shop.&quot;One whole poem later, while recounting a trip to Corpus Christi, Grotz feels &quot;a jellyfish brush past my thighs/like a silk scarf floating through the waves.&quot; Now I've been stung by a jellyfish in my day, and there is nothing further from the actual experience of feeling a jellyfish underwater than the sensation of feeling a silk scarf. Conceptually, I see how she could have arrived at the false image. But it just doesn't ring true.More examples of egregious writing: Grotz ends thepoem &quot;Unknown&quot; with &quot;I wanted to flatten/against a wall like a moth./Two lips holding back a cry.&quot; Also, in a sudden flash of formalist urges, Grotz tries to pull off a villanelle, &quot;Try&quot; about the importance of loving a hostile world and comes up with the following forced rhymes and syntactically amateurish lines: &quot;To love the world is what you try to do/after seeing the slow old man pursue/in the parking lot a cart that gathers speed.&quot; Maybe I'm being too picky, but I just finished reading a collection of masterful villanelles by 1st book poet Julie Kane and can't believe the villanelle draft that snuck its way into CUSP. &quot;Gathers speed&quot; in Grotz's villanelle rhymes all too prosaically with &quot;fisted greed&quot; (huh?) &quot;need,&quot; &quot;succeed,&quot; and &quot;filigreed.&quot;Later in the volune, Ms. Grotz gets tired of trying to write regional Texas poetry and takes us on a whirlwind tour of France, Italy, and her aesthetic and literary tastes. Apparently, she's fond of Blake, the violinist Joshua Bell, and being an American in Paris (how nouveau of her) which she reasserts in &quot;Trying to Wake Up Francaise&quot; by mentioning Peugeots, Proust, &quot;kirs in tall glasses at the Cafe Dupon&quot; and boulangeries. Is that French for bakery? In the same poem she asserts that her disinterest in watching American movies in France is analogous to PETER'S FORSAKING OF JESUS???Perhaps Ms. Grotz is still in her very early twenties. In that case, maybe this book's pratfalls are forgivable and understandable. What's not understandable to me is how this book would be selected for a prestigious award by one of the most esteemed poets of our age and praised by a multitude of other reputable poets. Avoid this one. Go read some Yves Bonnefoy or Yusef Komunyakaa or Carl Phillips. Their poems may not glow in a mysterious blue light, but they most cetaintly provide the right ingredients for sating the perpetual hunger of the human soul, ingredients that are altogether absent from Grotz's tiresome boulangeries."},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","review":"Honestly, a very disappointing book.The promotional material on the back cover claims the collection &quot;explores the peculiar territory of middleness--neither dark nor light, not quite familiar but not fully unknown.&quot; I would relabel this territory mediocrity, unfortunately an all-too common phenomenon in the increasingly conservative contemporary environment of feel-good poetry workshops where originality, risk, honesty, and daring are viewed as dangerous and suspect; many first books appear before the would-be writer has had the opportunity to realize that sycophantic imitation of one's mentors isn't art but merely an essential first step in a beginner's path to discover a voice.These poems strike me as the worst kind of workshop poetry--slavishly imitative and derivative, afraid to push the boundaries of subject matter and language, overeager to resort to the crutches of preciousness, pretentiousness, and affected folksiness. This is a writer who tries very hard to impress and please, but all the reader feels are the contortions of Grotz's repeated failed efforts. Occasionally, the poems seem to genuinely be on the &quot;cusp&quot; of getting somewhere, but even the better ones are, at best, forgettable and inoffensive. This is a writer who has yet to master the most basic eloquence of expression.There are four types of poems here, as an earlier reviewer has correctly intimated: The &quot;I'm from Texas and my adolescence sucked&quot; poems, the &quot;I went to France and drank French beverages and wished I was a cultured European&quot; poems, the &quot;I listen to music and look at art and have epiphanies because of them&quot; poems, and the &quot;I've been in love and love has caused me pain but love isn't so bad after all&quot; poems. The third category is more promising than the first two--Grotz's attempts at the ekphrastic form are competent, if generic and mildly obvious. The fourth category--the love poems--are actually ok: reading them, I almost believe that there is a body and a soul behind them, a mind and a voice: the best lines in the book occur in the unfortunately titled &quot;Not This Raw Fluttering&quot;:&quot;I've hardly begun cataloguing/the leftover kisses on the dashboard:/west kiss, kiss of his elbow bent. climbable kiss,/kiss half kissed, lonely kiss,/holy kiss, kissless/kiss, kiss of the improbable, diamond kiss,/wandering kiss, kiss for the out-of-mind.&quot;Nothing else in the book is that breathtaking or risky or distinctive. Instead, what we tend to be assaulted by are convoluted platitudes and laughable visual imagery. The following quotes speak for themselves. &quot;To love the world is what you try to do,/describe the trash, the bombs, the fisted greed--when it does not love back, does not love you.&quot; (Huh?) &quot;I open my eyes, feverish, near laughter,/The blur of lights far off--Venice--carnival/With men in top hats,/Women dressed as harlequins or/Divas or fat fuzzy bees.&quot; (Fat, fuzzy bees?) &quot;Outside nameless cafes/crowded with canvas umbrellas, I sat holding/a cafe noir too bitter to drink.&quot; (When I was in France, I experienced enlightenment by holding and not drinking bitter cafes in cafes). &quot;That moment when/the dog has wandered all day and is tired/and the wolf has just woken to roam.&quot; (Woken? To roam?) &quot;Serious French cool cats slurp appreciations.&quot; (Slurp?) &quot;She [my grandmother] wouldn't let me/slurp with a spoon.&quot; (Slurp?) &quot;She will make of her whole body an ear.&quot; This is not exactly what I'd call accomplished verse. Good poetry is never, ever sloppy.These poems might be promising enough in places to gain admittance into a writing program, even to get an MFA degree (all of the cool cats have one nowadays), but they're not worthy of a prestigious award or a serious audience."},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","review":"One of the first things the reader will notice in this extraordinary first collection is that Ms. Grotz is not interested in neat, pithy \\"workshop\\" poems. The book opens with the speaker driving in a long, winding tunnel, unable to see either the entrance or exit. This is the emotional space Grotz is invested in: no clear way forward or back. Each one of these poems wades fully into a daring emotional urgency. And unlike many even very strong first collections, there are no disposable poems, nothing that reads like filler.Several of the poems express a consciousness of the fleeting nature of the present moment. Grotz makes us aware of how we spend most of our lives on the cusp of the future and the past, in a moment that slips away the instant we reach out to lay our hands on it. And yet rather than bemoan the possibility of an actual \\"now\\", the speaker in these poems only seems to regret not being able to give us the world in all its beauty and tragedy. Grotz urgently layers her poems with these images. In the \\"The Waves\\", she transforms what would be (in the hands of a less talented writer) a gentle, mundane meditation into,&quot;The sensation of falling, of falling through falling until it's floating,/dissipation , erosion/ The way from a car one watches the hills come forward, a slow swell/on the ribbon of road that stretches forever/Or how buildings collapse, as if to their knees, tilting slightly to the side, swallowed in smoke&quot;.Even as Cusp exists in an ephemeral \\"now\\", it is equally oriented between places. In fact much of the book is set in two places that have never seemed further apart: France and Texas. I notice that another apparently college-educated reviewer who claims to be from Texas seems to find mention of anything French automatically \\"maudlin\\" and \\"snooty\\".Nationalistic biases notwithstanding, another great strength of this collection lies in Grotz's instinct for beauty at a rodeo, a demolition derby or on a rain-slicked Parisian Boulevard. The voice in these poems finds itself between a \\"terrain [that] resists gathering you up\\" and this stunning, though humble, vision of Angers:&quot;a spotless ghetto of thin, white buildings,/no midnight, no field there, billboards/unfamiliar with the frenzy of circumflexes/and accent graves&quot;.Cusp attempts to reconcile this sense of being lost as the book progresses, but the velocity of the poems rarely diminishes. In the end, Grotz finds \\"not an end so much as an acceptance\\". Yet there is absolutely no manufactured serenity here. Grotz fiercely loves Cusp's divided world as much as she trusts and respects the reader. If this is her first collection, we should look forward to what promises to be a vital body of work."},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","review":"Grotz's first collection is a rather impressive one. Yes it has its faults. It does sag in the middle, but the first section is wonderful and the final section is quite good. But the books also has its positive points. Grotz covers a wide range of styles and subjects in her poems. And though none stick out as a truly phenomenal poem, there are many good poems in the book. I look forward to seeing more of her work as she matures."},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","review":"WOWZA! At least the cover is pretty, the margins are even, and none of the pages appear to be missing...I agree with an earlier reviewer that first book writers should generally be cut some slack. However, in this case, the poems in this first collection are so sensationally sloppy, pretentious, conceited, and over-the-top sentimental that prospective readers should be forewarned.I don't know the extent to which Ms. Grotz is connected either with Bread Loaf or the Bakeless judges, If she is a Bread Loaf employee, as a previous reviewer alleges, shame on her--she might as well be publishing with a vanity press; as far as her knowing the judge, surprise, surprise--that's the current poetry publishing world in a nutshell. However, nepotism hasn't precluded several outstanding first collections from being published every year. I'm stunned that any judge would select this collection, whether or not they were personally acquainted with its author. It's a disservice to a young writer to cast their book into the open seas before it's anywhere near ready.Grotz, time and again, on the most basic level, makes the same mistakes my undergraduate (and, sadly, some of my graduate) creative writing students make in their rough drafts. There are occasional saving graces--this certainly isn't the poetry of Jewel or Jimmy Stewart, but of someone who has tried to read and write seriously for at least a few years--still, one doesn't have the same expectations from Jewel or Stewart that one does from a Bakeless-prize winning Houghton Mifflin collection blurbed by some of the more acclaimed poets of our time.Reading Cusp, I felt I was reading a series of rough drafts by a writer who doesn't seem to have any regard for her readers. This book, frankly, gave me a migraine--you see glimmers of talent here and there, but almost every poem manages to self-destruct or, at best, stumble drunkenly for a few lines, so much so that I couldn't help but feel pity for the clearly ambitious poet's no-doubt well-intentioned exertions and contortions. I don't mean to come off as vicious, but it would be irresponsible of me not to be honest in my assessment. On the other hand, give this writer a few years. Many poets want nothing to do with their first book after they write a second and a third. Grotz is a writer-in-progress. With luck, whoever her trusted readers are will be honest and unsparing in their criticism and she'll learn to avoid the beginner's pitfalls that mar this ultimately forgettable collection."},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","review":"Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I am not a poet, nor do I want to be a poet. I just appreciate poetry that speaks to me, that opens my eyes to myself and the world in some new way. The poems in CUSP do that for me. The cool, meditative tone throughout the book allowed me to leave the outside world for a while and find a place inside myself that's like the West Texas countryside that underlies many of the poems -- a place of melancholy barrenness that is saved by the small, surprising wildflowers that survive there. For instance, the linking of the word sinner with seeing clearly for the first time in &quot;New Glasses&quot; resonated with me and my childhood experiences and then took me somewhere deeper. When Grotz described the &quot;stuttering applause / of a waterfall against clay-smelling steps&quot; I caught a whiff of similar places that I have experienced and then followed her to a new place, asking myself, as she asks of her Madonna: &quot;And will she be object, then garment, then art, be emptied?&quot; The meaning of a story or a poem is a creative partnership between the writer and the reader, and I appreciate the way Grotz has held up her side of the deal. Too bad several of the other reviewers here chose, for their part, to be jealously destructive rather than creative, but it's their loss. Buy this lovely little book, and when you read it, take the time to let its familiar elements take you by the hand to more unfamiliar places of discovery."},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","review":"In poetry, with few exceptions, courage comes late. But this book is that rare exception: a first book of poems that, whatever else one thinks of it, is courageous. A previous reviewer expressed displeasure with the literary allusions in the book. This is akin, I think, to the patron who told Mozart his new piece had \\"too many notes.\\" Or perhaps it is a call for Grotz, who does sometimes sound like the smart kid in class, to shut up and behave like the rest of the girls. Such readers would seem to value above all those books which tell them what they already know.If you are such a reader, and if you prefer poetry by young poets who do not risk being labeled pretentious because they are ignorant of their place in the tradition (and ignorant of just how high the bar has been set), then don't buy Cusp. If you would rather NOT be visited by the ghost of John Keats, then steer clear. For this is a first book that is rare for its refusal to settle, as so many deeply conservative young poets do, for a singular, unalloyed, knowing response to the world. Grotz refuses to write with blithe indifference to that which came before her, and refuses to present herself as self-created. Instead, she seems to have a burning desire to face Keats, and Yves Bonnefoy, and Adam Zagajewski head on, and the audacity to join them in praising the world's plural, impure, and ambiguous splendor.I agree that, like almost all first collections, there are poems here that are not up to the level of Grotz' best. But then again, of how many collections can we not say the same thing? This is in many ways just to say that Cusp is a first book. But what is interesting about first books of poems, to me, is the way that they introduce, if we're lucky, a new way of grappling with silence: the almost crushing anxiety of influence. The very poems that a previous reviewer disliked for their allusiveness strike me as the place where Grotz finds a way into and through this silence... finds an opening in the tradition, and through that opening enters into the conversation.Its desire to join and even challenge past masters makes Cusp interesting, but what made me love and keep the book by my bed is the language itself: the sheer beauty of poems like \\"The Last Living Castrato,\\" \\"Try,\\" \\"Kiss of Judas,\\" and the delicate homage to Keats, \\"Arrival in Rome.\\" It is audacious for any poet to write an imitation of \\"Ode to a Nightingale,\\" but something altogether more wonderful and rare to pull it off... to write the lines \\"... Now/ More than ever it seems impossible / To unthink the lover's hot breath against / The cheek, the ear, to brush / One's face up against the now...\\"A previous reviewer calls Grotz that nastiest of names, the \\"workshop\\" poet. But to me a workshop poet is precisely what Grotz shows herself not to be: a writer whose primary poetic influence is that dude in the third row, wearing sunglasses and a red sweater. The truth is that these poems do betray the poet's education, be it earned in a workshop or a coffeshop, or wherever it was that Ms. Grotz fell head-over-heels in love with the poetry of the past. But rather than indulging in the kind of name-dropping that young poets sometimes use as a pedigree, these poems record the longing, passionate voice of someone who, reading the words Keats wrote in 1819, can not help but call out in response.Many of the poems in Cusp record such moving and beautiful responses, in a music worthy of the company they keep. So buy this book. It will reward your attention for many reasons, but above all as a collection of haunting, powerful, and yes, doomed, attempts to speak with the dead, and to recover the unrecoverable."},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","review":"This is truly one of the worst books of poems I have read this year. With the exception of a handful of poems, this book was not ready for publication much less to win the Bakeless Prize. The faux intelligence, the vapid imitations, the lifeless and lackluster lines: a book in need of serious editing. I refuse to go on and on like others have done here. Basically, if Grotz hadn't studied with Komunyakaa (the judge of the contest), and if she hadn't been a Bread Loaf fixture for over five years, she would never have won this contest. Every famous poet in America can annoint this book, but it doesn't change the fact readers will not be duped.

I can believe it! Unlike some superficially similar books on drag racing, this one reveals its author's encyclopedic knowledge of his topic. I've never seen a book of this type with such a wealth of information, from the highly technical to the more aesthetic. There are many photos, mercifully a good cross-section of Mopar wheelmen famous and obscure and not just the factory-backed stars. Ultra-detailed engine specs abound, as well as histories of each engines' development. All the Max Wedges and hemis are here, along with the Chrysler engineers, mechanics and drivers who spread the Mopar gospel in the 60's. You will not go wrong with this book whether you're a Pentastar fanatic or just interested in the history of drag racing. This one merits an A+."},{"Title":"Maximum Performance: Mopar Super Stock Drag Racing 1962-1969","review":"If you lived the era of drag racing when Mopars were at the top and you are a mopar fan then this book is for you.

I bought my '62 Plymouth 413 Sport Fury from Milne Bros., trading in my '60 Chevy 348 tri-power, because I was tired of getting beat by the Mopars. My '63 426 Belvedere and '65 Plymouth Hemi also came from Milne Bros. and as Jim points out in this book, the Hemi HP was grossly understated, as mine was producing 543HP out of the box. Blueprinting it produced even more.Overal, a very good book with a lot of good background and product spec. details. I only wish it had more of what us west coast guys were doing.

It's as much a look at the ceremony itself as a portrait of a certain romanticizing interpretation of Japanese culture, written by a scholar who was straddling both worlds and sought to explain one to the other. The introduction is immensely readable, not to mention informative - many amusing turns of phrase in there which I wish I remembered for occasional use (need to reread the thing!).

I found the missing ingredient in my tea - perspective.This little book takes you through the history, the philosophy, the poetry, and the religion of tea.The chapters are as follows:-The Cup of Humanity-The Schools of Tea-Taoism and Zennism-The Tearoom-Art Appreciation-Flowers-Tea MastersThis book reads like poetry. There is a chapter called \\"Flowers\\" which gives you the perspective of a flower in the grasp of man. It challenges you to gain feeling, to become alive by admiring life.\\"Tell me, gentle flowers, teardrops of the stars, standing in the garden, nodding your heads to the bees as they sing of the dews and the sunbeams, are you aware of the fearful doom that awaits you? Dream on, sway and frolic while you may in the gentle breezes of summer. Tomorrow a ruthless hand will close around your throats. You will be wrenched, torn asunder limb by limb, and borne away from your quiet homes. The wretch, she may be passing fair. She may say how lovely you are while her fingers are still moist with your blood. Tell me, will this be kindness? It may be your fate to be imprisoned in the hair of one whom you know to be heartless or to be thrust into the buttonhole of one who would not dare to look you in the face were you a man.Like all the Shambhala classics, this book is spiritual. I hope you can read it and be forever changed.

Please note: The Book of Tea was written in ENGLISH originally. Yes, Okakura Kakuz' was fluent and decided to target the book towards Westerners. In knowing this, I have very little patience for those publishers that have editions filled with errors (Looking at you Dover). Since it's not a translated work, the original text should be what is printed. The original copyright has expired, so there is not legal reason why subsequent editions would vary with the text.So the main determining factor I used is finding a publisher that I trusted. Sadly my first purchase of this book was returned because I hit buy now and it popped the Dover edition into my cart... But click under Format and select one of the editions from a reputable publisher. If you look at the 1 star ratings, most are the Dover, Tuttle, or Kindle editions. The 5 star ratings tend to be for the Penguin or Shambhala editions.I think the acid free, high quality paper used in the Shambhala edition is nice and the pictures nice to look at.

A simple beverage creating a simple pleasure, yet holding enough signifigance to be the focal point of religious ritual."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"'The book of Tea' is a small essay written in 1906 by a Kakuzo Okakura, an early divulger of Japanese culture abroad; he lived for quite a few years in the US, and mastered his grasp of the English language, as can be seen in this volume (his English is very fluent, polished, even cultured).The book is, therefore, a very basic introduction to the philosophy behind the Japanese Tea-Ceremony, a complex and developed art by itself (Chado, the Way of Tea). Don't expect here much details or information about it. The book is a general introduction for westerners, and stays for the most in the very basics, touching more the spirit behind the art (and connecting it with Japanese and Oriental cultural and religious views of life, as opposed to 'Western' views and lifestyles) than its characteristics.This small treatise is divided, nevertheless, into 7 chapters. The first (The Cup of Humanity) gives some general background information to the importance of tea consumption East and West. The second (The schools of tea) takes a brief overview of the 3 modes of tea-consumption in China and Japan: boiled (in bricks), whipped and steeped. The three ways correspond to three moments and atittudes: T'ang China (tea was a novelty and a mere refined pastime), Sung China (tea becomes a refined art connected with philosophical Taoism) and Ming China (generalized, democratic, and with Zen Buddhism). Japan's art and tea-drinking would connect with the Sung China period of converting tea-drinking into a refined art, a process presumably interrupted in China by 'barbarian' invasions (Yuan, Q'ing). Chapter 3 (Taoism and Zennism) explores the religious connections of Chado, establishing a link with 'Southern' China forms (Zen and Tao, religions of the Yang Tze) as opposed to the 'Northern', communal and Confucian world views. Chapter 4 (The Tea-Room) dwells on the elements of Japanese and tea-house architecture (wooden, unasuming, minimalistic); Chapter 5 (Art Appreciation) dwells on the religious important of art, as a 'following of the heart' and 'feeling of the void', and as a cult and aesthetization of everyday life, as in Chado; Chapter 6 (Flowers) talks about the importance of nature and flower arrangement as an Oriental art by itself, (Ikebana) but also included (and more properly developed) in the Tea-Ceremony. Finally, chapter 7 (Tea Masters) concludes with a brief mention of the contributions of tea-masters to art in general, stopping a bit to describe Sen no Rikyu nd his refined end.To conclude: 'The book of Tea' is an interesting and well written essay that will allow you to enjoy the few hours it takes to read it, and that will lend itself graciously for re-readings. Nevertheless, it is very basic, and very obviously betrays the time it was written (in its style, criticism of the West, sentimentalism and in the odd way it translates Asian names). If you want to get acquainted with Chado you'll have to look elsewhere, but this can be a useful and entertaining, albeit very limited, introduction."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"If you are looking for a different way to boil the billy and steep a teabag, you are heading in the wrong direction.

Or maybe you've never really read or bought an edition of this philosophical, poetic, and seemingly ancient book. This one -- after you read Bruce Richardson's introduction -- would be the one you really read, and savor.It is both pleasant and penetrating to slowly read Bruce's clear and original take on Okakura. Sipping his short introduction reveals the story of how Okakura \\"came to tea\\" as the metaphor for bringing the spirit of an Eastern aesthetic thought to a growing Western materialism.What makes this edition a useful and elegant addition to your library is that you too will feel Okakura's passion for this humane world view, captured in a cup of tea, as you will also feel that same passion in Bruce's deeply thought, originally researched, retelling of this story.That alone would be enough to make any thinking tea drinker want this book. The added extraordinary photographs, art and scholarship sweeten the pot, just right.Duncan Newcomer, New Harmony, Indiana"},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"This a great compact book that deals beautifully with tea and its history and setting.

Fuji, is not about benefits of tea.The book by narrating how the tea philosophy and ceremony tradition developed in Japan, tries to take us into the beauty of Japanese minds refined by Tea traditon of Japan and the lure of Budhisim or Taoism upon which the tea philosophy is based. One particular icon representing the tea religion is Rikyu Sen the very founder of the tea phlosophy in Japan. The scene of the death of Rikyu is just brilliantly written.So for some Japanese tea is beyond health drinks. It is a way of our philosophical backbone.Verdict: Excellent work describing what Japanese should be proud ofRating: 90 out of 100 Some of the anecdotes are hard to come by unless you are highly educated.Recommended for: Anyone who loves the beauty of Japan and Bushido fans."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"I read this book in the Kindle edition and immediately decided that I wanted a printed copy to share with my friends. This book, as other reviewers have said is not so much about the actual tea ceremony itself as it is an effort by a japanese person to explain the history and philosophy behind the custom. In the process, he explains a great deal of how the japanese mind works and gives a sometimes uncomfortable look at how the oriental sees western culture. I particularly was fascinated by the account of the discomfort felt by a japanese person talking to a western man who was standing in front of his own portrait. To most western people, their would be no problem, but to the japanese, there is an overwhelming feeling that either the picture or the man is a fraud and he may have difficulty telling which fraud to believe.For a western person trying to understand the oriental attitudes to life and culture, I would place this book on the must-read list along with the Tao Te Ching of Lao Tzu and the Art of War by Sun Tzu. For the ordinary reader, it gives a fascinating glance at a different view of Art, Religion, Life, and Culture. It is not a long book, but it is well written and quite witty, so sit back, relax, and enjoy it. Possibly with a good hot cup of tea on a cold winters evening."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"I already knew what this book was about, but I was still impressed how beautiful it is written.

Everyone in Berkeley had a brick & board book case with Steal This Book, and Kahlil Gibran, and Mao, and Ferlingetti, and the Tuttle edition of this book.Tuttle bound it in hand made washi, and slid it into a special little box-cover. It had the look and the feel of a special precious gift. The book itself was art.It is still a special precious gift. It is the gift of insight into Japan, and esthetics, and Tea, and Art, and Xenophobia, and most of all into yourself. This cheap little book has the power to shine a light into a blind spot within your mind. It will change your prospective, and it will teach you that prospective is everything.In this most egocentric, self-referential, radio talk-show, don't-think-tank, time in our history,it would be well for us to read this book again. Give it to someone you love. Read it for someone you don't yet love."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"The tea ceremony is something that is uniquely Japanese, but much of the significance of the role tea plays in Japanese culture is lost on the average Westerner. Kakuzo Okakura attempted to correct that lack of knowledge in his 1906 book The Book of Tea: The Classic Work on the Japanese Tea Ceremony and the Value of Beauty. This book has become the defining text on the meanings woven into the ceremony, the setting, and everything surrounding it.It's a small book, 155 pages, and that even includes notes and explanations from those who have written the forward and afterword. Okakura himself goes into poetic detail on each part of the ceremony, such as the history of tea, the role of art and flowers, the utensils, and the teahouse itself. Since it's written from a perspective of explaining the significance to a non-Japanese audience, it's far more than just a recitation of facts and rituals. For instance, one whole chapter is about flowers. Of the 16 pages, the first 11 are odes to flowers, poetic descriptions of the blooms, and the lamenting of how the Western mind minimizes and destroys these plants without a second thought. Once you get past that, there's a brief description of how the tea-master will select and place the flower in the teahouse. This is then largely rounded out by explanations of the different schools of thought on the art of flower arrangement, not necessarily on how the flowers are further involved in the ceremony. This type of writing tends to give you a broader idea of the Japanese mindset and culture, but not necessarily anything specific on the actual tea ceremony. Of course, that's probably *my* Western mind wanting to get to concrete descriptions and steps rather than becoming immersed in significance and wonder...Given the small size of the book, it's not going to consume great amounts of time if you decide to read it. Just be prepared for more contemplation and poetry rather than a logical dissection of all that is the tea ceremony. Basically, drop your Western mind. :)"},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"Having read a few of his novels I was looking forward to another of his stories about different generations in Japan.

The problem here is that the vocabulary used here is beyond many readers. While that is fine when such words are required to convey meaning, here they seem to be used just for the sake of using them. They get in the way and obstruct the reading and meaning unnecessarily.The book also presents appreciation of small things as being superior to appreciating other things yet the argument is not backed up with any rationale.

Totally ignorant, I opened the book half expecting to find dry writing on types of tea leaves. Instead I discovered something deeply beautiful. This book does indeed teach the history of tea and its preparation, but it also provides an eloquent introduction to Teaism and other aspects of Japanese culture. Okakura wavers most delicately between prose and poetry, between the educational and the spiritual. The words linger with you long after you have finished, and tea, once an ordinary beverage, acquires a soul-- a source of peace.\\"Teaism is a cult founded on the adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence. It inculcates purity and harmony, the mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially a worship of the Imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.\\"(Chapter One, The Cup of Humanity)"},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"I loved this book.

By the end of his life he had seen the Great War and Japan's first imperialistic military adventures in Korea and Manchuria that would culminate in the tragedy of the Second World War.The scion of Japanese aristocracy, Okakura chose to spend the latter half of his life as an expatriate living in Boston, Massachusetts, where he befriended the Brahmins of that city. THE BOOK OF TEA was written in this period, sometime in the nineteen-oh-ohs. Written for an American audience, it eloquently introduced the Boston bluebloods to an idealized vision of Japan, the Japan of cherry blossoms, kakemono, and Chanoyu, the Tea Ceremony.Reading THE BOOK OF TEA, one realizes that Okakura was not \\"selling\\" Japan to the West. THE BOOK OF TEA does not engage in any lacquer-box hucksterism. Rather, THE BOOK OF TEA is his paean to and his lament for a Japan of the virtues that was all-too-rapidly being consumed by Occidentally-intoxicated militarists and industrialists. THE BOOK OF TEA was written to banish the soot-stained chrysanthemums of Okakura's deepest nightmares.Although this reviewer came to THE BOOK OF TEA expecting a manual on the Tea Ceremony, this book is nowhere so vulgar as that. Yes, a manual on the highly stylized Chanoyu has its place, but it's place is nowhere without this book which penetrates to the heart and soul of the ceremony. This reviewer can honestly say that THE BOOK OF TEA provided him with comprehension, a deeper insight, and a first true appreciation for Japanese art forms, so different than the European.In its simplicity and its elegance, the Tea Ceremony is a form of Zen practice. Every element, from the atmosphere of the tearoom (called in Japanese \\"The Abode of Fancy,\\" a world unto itself), the selection of the flowers, the artwork, the bamboo tea implements, the bright, sharp jade green macha tea, and the specially made jangling teapot and ceramic cups, speaks to an aesthetic foreign to the West. Okakura calls it \\"Teaism,\\" a play on Taoism, and its purpose is to delight the senses, touch the heart, and place the participant fully in the present moment.Shambhala Publications has presented THE BOOK OF TEA in a fine paperbound edition, the colors, typeset, and dimensions of which please the mind. Shambhala has also provided color photographs, in truth forms of abstract art, of the tea implements in use, that add a visual dimension to this already fine book."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"This book is a delightful oddity. It's about 100 years old now. It was written by a Japanese expatriate, in English, for an English-speaking audience. I mean the term \\"audience\\" in the most audible way, since this text was meant to be read aloud to the highest of the Boston Brahmins. (That attention to sound is probably a big part of why this reads so smoothly.)Kakuzo explains the Japanese tea ceremony to a non-Japanese audience. Oddly, he does not describe the ceremony. Instead, he lays out the history of tea and the history of the Zen esthetic in which cha-do (\\"the way of tea\\") makes sense. He describes the place in which the ceremony is held, and some of the tools used in that ceremony. He does not, however, spell out the mechanics of the service. Perhaps it's just as well. As Kakuzo describes, it is not the tea that matters. It is the effect that the ritual has on the people who perform it.This book is laid out simply and elegantly, as befits its topic. The primary font is a little unusual - a long-waisted serif that connotes the warm feeling of the text itself. Page layouts are airy, and have a distinctive swaying gait from as they step from chapter to chapter. The few photos that illustrate this book are atmospheric, and printed in a subdued color scheme. It doesn't equal the old slip-case edition, but it's still a pleasing and instructive sample of book design.This is a pleasant book, and a short one. The reading is over much too quickly. It is also a delightful contrast to another Japanese author writing for an English audience at very nearly the same time. Nitobe's unfortunate \\"Bushido\\" tries much too hard to explain itself in Western terms. Kakuzo, instead, expresses his home culture in its own terms, the only ones that make sense, and in much more readable language.//wiredweirdPS: This edition has a new intro by Liza Dalby, the first and possibly only American woman to complete training as a geisha."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"On the surface, this is a book about history - the history of tea, and art, and religion. But this is really a book about so much more - it compares the culture and way of thinking of the East and West, the past and the present. It makes the reader think about and reassess what is important in life, what is really beautiful, what is worth keeping or fighting for. What is dignity.This essay, which wends its way between the discovery of tea, flower arranging, architecture and Taoism along with other enticing subjects, is truly an enlightening and thrilling book, in a quiet and gentle way (is that possible?) Whether you are interested in East Asian culture, Tea, or would just like a compass to help you re-orientate your priorities, you will probably gain something from this ode to the importance and influence of Tea."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"For anyone interested in Asian, and particularly Japanese, culture, this book is a must. By following the history of tea and its role in the spiritual and cultural development of Japan, this slim volume gives the reader remarkable insight into the Japanese mind. Written with a keen sense of humor, the Book of Tea is very readable and entertaining, while at the same time illustrating the Japanese passion for the simple.

Unlike the reviewer who couldn't even leave a name who probably has no concept of the world of tea, I thought that the format also followed the ideals of tea by being contemporary and in the constantly evolving path of tea as given to us by Oiemoto (the current head of the Urasenke tea school). I enjoyed this book very much and have given several copies to my tea students and tea friends as well."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"I had expected more details on the types of tea and the tea ceremony itself. The book was mainly historical and included the philosophies that created the tea ceremony. Although this was interesting, I had wanted details of the tea ceremony itself and explanations of different types of tea. There were times that I could not tell if the author was being tongue-in-cheek or pompous. I did read the book through, but was left with wanting more."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"i read this book in preparation for participating in a japanese culture class for japanese 6th graders. i had heard of the book, but avoided it for a long time due to my assumptions about the book being just another new age-y trend that exoticizes &quot;eastern culture&quot;.however, when i actually sat down and delved into the book, i was thrilled. this little volume on tea is really a special book, for all the reasons other reviewers give and so much more.but the book has become detached from its author, which is a shame, because okakura was/is a major figure in a very important period of time.like today, the meiji period in which okakura lived was a time of extreme westernization in japan. okakura was a giant in the struggle to keep japanese culture alive, primarily through the arts. okakura was also one of the first and biggest presenters of japanese culture to the west. the book of tea is a fantastic example of the way in which cultures that are unfamiliar with one another's practices, mindsets, and histories can have meaningful exchanges without reducing the other side to exotic stereotypes. though okakura was japanese, this book was originally written in english soon after okakura joined the staff at the boston museum of art.everyone should read this book. okakura's gem is much more a philosophy book along the lines of deleuze and guattari than it is a book about &quot;tea&quot; or &quot;buddhism&quot;. this is a book that has no fear in treading into many different realms, and many of its cultural critiques of both &quot;the west&quot; and japan resonate profoundly in the today's world. it has been translated into scores of languages, including japanese. in fact, it is probably the japanese that would benefit most from reading the book of tea."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"Okakura' small distillation of 'Teaism' is really a survey of Eastern philosophy. He points to Zen and Taoism as the foundational ways of thinking that anchor this idea called Teaism. There are brilliant moments of insight in this small and curious book, with many true assessments of the West's shifting perceptions of Eastern civilization. I am reminded of the late Heidegger's philosophy (and indeed Heidegger read 'The Book of Tea), particularly in essays such as 'The Thing' which point out the significance of our everyday objects and their intimate relationship to world and culture. This book is truly a small treasure of Eastern thought."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"Okakura Kakuzo (1862-1913) was a Japanese scholar who contributed to the development of arts in Japan. Outside of Japan, he is chiefly remembered today as the author of The Book of Tea.The Book of Tea is truly a beautiful work in spite of its harsh criticism of the West, but at the time it was written, Japan was sacrificing its traditions and its culture in favor of Occidental trappings. Kakuzo's desire was not to have Japanese art remain in stasis, but mature and evolve along lines untouched (or \\"untainted\\" as Kakuzo would probably say) by Western influences.In this book, Kakuzo goes into great detail about the spiritual development of Japan and how the celebration of tea, seen at that time more as an artistic and spiritual art form, developed from a fusion of Buddhism, Taoism, and Shintoism.Alas, as important as Kakuzo's work was during his lifetime, today Japan is one of the most secular countries in the world having embraced a more materialistic worldview. The West has won.This would have saddened Kakuzo , but would not have caught him completely by surprise as the Japanese Tea Ceremony teaches all things are ephemeral and that all things, including countries, pass away.So I leave you with this quote from the book before we once again turn and submerge ourselves back into our sterile and secular world:Meanwhile, let us have a sip of tea. The afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos, the fountains are bubbling with delight, the soughing of the pines is heard in our kettle. Let us dream of evanescence, and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"I wanted to read more about the origin of tea and the different varieties and how it is made, etc. This book was written quiet awhile ago and was basically a history book.... so really didn't find it relevant (at least me). Was very boring, and I couldn't get through the book."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"At its best this book provides an interesting look at tea. On the downside, Okakura Kakuzo, gets several of his facts wrong by not proofreading. All the facts are corrected in a brilliant afterward by E. F. Bleiler. Also, Okakura, has several comparisons to the West and how Japan is different. This is to show his Japanese uniqueness and it borders on nihonjinron.However, Okakura does make a clear connection between the consumption of tea and aesthetics. He explains the background of the tea ceremony and the Zen influence. It is interesting of how he first talks about Taoism and its relationship to Zen, which I knew about but haven't really read anything on it.I like the chapter on the Tea House. It explains a lot of how the Japanese view the tea house experience. It starts with certain objects placed inside the tea house such as flowers and maybe one painting or poem. It is this simple refined use of space that the interior of the tea house is to be best appreciated and enjoyed. He also shows how the tea house is a way to experience Zen. From the walk down the path, to the washing of utensils, to putting it all together and consuming tea this reflects how a Zen monk will break from the world, as he enters the tea house, and begins meditation.If you have any interest in Japanese culture or just like a good hot cup of tea, this can be an entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"the articulation is so enchanting that prejudice aside it is hard to say that any other work of literature expresses more clearly what the east is all about. magnificent"},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"Didn't really interest me enough to read mire than first couple of pages.

It is, in fact, none of the above. Historically, Kakuzo discusses tea as a device that has fascinated, caused rebellion, and united the world in its honor. In essence, Kakuzo describes tea as the \`cup of humanity', savored and shared by the world. Within that structure, the tea ceremony is the intersection of the undisturbed, free-flowing beauty of nature with the meditative discipline of preparing and consuming tea. Therefore, the Tea Room is the vessel used in advancing the tea ceremony. It's simplicity along with its contrasting demand of careful decoration; serve to represent the simplicity of nature and purity of art as the highest means of human expression and mediation. Upon partaking in the ceremony, the Tea Room serves as a sanctuary for our soul, to free it from the mundane, superficial activities and aspirations of modern human endeavor. For a few moments, to be able to cleanse it within the serene, guileless facets of our world serve as Kakuzo's message on the nature of harmony. By mediating on nature through the ceremony of tea, we are free to cultivate our own intrinsic artistry, allowing it, with each successive drop, to warm our hearts, ease our mind, and foster a clear understanding of self. Great art is to be savored, relinquishing us to drown in its careful composition, savory fragrance, and lingering warmth, akin to a savory cuppa tea."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"This slim little book is not just an illustration of the history and preparation of tea, or a paean to a shared love of boiled leaves through the ages, although you'll find both inside. It's also a window into the culture and history of household ritual, of humble yet uplifting custom built around food that reaches back beyond a thousand years and into our own homes today. Everyone who has found solace in preparing a cup of tea will find this book speaks to them, and will find themselves touching and understanding something of the lives of people from the Victorian British to the ancient Chinese.

The Book Of Tea was in fact written in English, in order to prove accessible to English-speakers, and presents chanoyu (literally \\"the way of tea\\") as a spiritual culture and a ritual that interlaces with the \\"Art of Life\\" itself. A handful of black-and-white illustrations intersperse the methodical, philosophical, and spiritual discussions of all aspects of the tea ceremony. The Book Of Tea is very highly recommended especially for students of Japanese culture and arts."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"Around the turn of the century, Japan's closed borders were flung open and the eyes of the world were fixed upon this mysterious, hidden island nation. Authors, both Japanese and other, were quick to satisfy this new hunger for insight with a variety of metaphors on Japanese society. In his book \\"Bushido,\\" Tsunetomo Yamamoto exposed Western audiences to the \\"soul of Japan\\" as a warrior's code. Kazuko Okakura found a much more gentle metaphor in chanoyu, the Japanese tea ceremony.\\"The Book of Tea\\" does not propose to be a manual on the tea ceremony, but rather a launching point for Japanese aesthetics and values of beauty. Okakura himself is not a tea master, but is a highly-educated aristocrat, schooled in classical Chinese studies and Japanese art. He sees in chanoyu the unique elements of the Japanese eye, and juxtaposes the appeal of architecture, interior decoration, approach to art and other points with the Western view.The writing style reflects the tone of literature of the early 1900's, with an authoritative tone and elf-important turns of phrase. Like \\"Bushido,\\" \\"The Book of Tea\\" seeks to showcase the idealized Japan, that dream of an aesthetic that never-was but is always sought after. An average Japanese home has no relation to the sacred space of the tea house, and your average Japanese cup of tea is knocked back with little ceremony. But within that, there is the search for art in life, and that can be found in chanoyu.Not that it is all esoteric. There is an interesting tour through the history of tea, and its transportation from China to the world. But \\"The Book of Tea\\" is very small, and one can not expect too much from a volume of this size. Okakura's mussings are a quick and interesting read, and might be considered a launching point for a deeper investigation of the mysteries of Japanese aesthetics and tea."},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","review":"The book gave a good history of the progression of tea through the ages.

There are hidden stories behind every still photograph. This book pays homage to Iranians whose contributions to American society enriched our culture. The rich tapestry of Iran's history is made manifest by the largest Persian Library as well as the huge collection of Persian archeological tablets displayed and kept at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, which entices visitors from all over the world to do research on Iran.Hamid Akbari and Azar Khounani the authors of the book introduced the Iranian immigrants by searching for the first group of Iranians who traveled to Chicago in 1893. In 1903 Mirza Mohammad Ali Moen-ol Saltaneh, who visited Chicago to attend the Columbian Exposition, published a memoir, which describes Chicago as a city with numerous \\"gigantic factories,\\" \\"innumerable railroad tracks,\\" \\"many houses and buildings\\" on one side and the Michigan Lake on the other side. Surprisingly, in his visit to Iran's Exhibition, he encounters a number of very young French women dancers, wearing Persian dresses and posing as Iranians dancing for visitors. Moen-ol Saltaneh further writes that \\"the Iranian men were offended by this 'barbaric' act of having French women pretend to be Iranian women and were planning to protest it by stopping work and closing down the palace.\\" P16The content of the book is divided into six categories: Iranian Roots and the Columbian Exposition, Historical, Cultural, and Artistic Heritage, Immigrant Profiles and Contributions, Social and Cultural Activities and Organizations, Well-Known Visitors and The Next Generation.Throughout the book, there is an emphasis on those Iranians who made tremendous contributions in research, teaching, medicine, business, arts and public services to promote and enrich multiculturalism in American society. Iranians, according to the latest data, are considered the most educated immigrants among similar groups.The last chapter of the book focuses on the generation of Iranians who were born and raised in the United States, a young and active generation who proclaim that in spite of their love for Iran, Chicago (and, in a larger sense, the United States) is their permanent home."},{"Title":"Iranians in Chicagoland (IL) (Images of America)","review":"This is a fantastic book on the background of a wonderful cultural society.

Dr. Hamid Akbari and his wife, Azar Khounani, have written a book that is an education in the history, sociology and politics of the Iranian community in the United States. They have made a document that opens a window to the Iranian immigrants and their lives in Chicago. Iranians in Chicagoland includes many photographs from personal albums of Iranian-American families. It is full of vintage and contemporary photographs that show the faces and vitality of Iranians. This book depicts the many faces of Iranian-Americans in various facets of American life, interwoven with Iranian traditions from the homeland. However, the writers are not impartial observers; they are biased by their personal views. The book is not completely inclusive; it lacks scope and thorough research. There are some professional associations and societies, such as the Iranian American Medical Association of Illinois, which it does not mention; there are Iranian Jews in Skokie; their synagogue is called: \\"Persian (Iran) Hebrew Congregation\\", and the book does not mention them either. The name of Shabeh Jomeh, an Iranian networking organization, is spelled incorrectly. The second generations of Iranians have formed Persian or Iranian societies and clubs in their universities, but their activities are not well represented. The book does not have a bibliography.Iranians in Chicagoland captures the evolution of the Iranian community of Chicago from the early 1980s to the present day. I am sure that it has taken enormous time and energy to do such a work. Also, according to the writers all royalties received from this book will be donated to the Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh Leadership Fund at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago. I enjoyed reading this book and looking at its photos."},{"Title":"The doomsters","review":"In some ways The Doomsters is a typical Lew Archer thriller: it involves a missing suspected murderer, family strife, and mysterious deaths in the distant past. This time, Archer falls in love and self-interest actually hinders him from being the moral center of the novel. What keeps the pace of the novel flowing is the theme of a man condemned by society and Archer's efforts to prove his innocence. There is also plenty of bloodshed, betrayals, and enough plot twists to keep the conclusion a surprise. In spite of the tragic turn the story takes there is the redemption for Archer who makes up for his own dreadful mistake in the past. It explains a great deal about Archer, his motivation and his maturity which grows in later Ross Macdonald novels."},{"Title":"The doomsters","review":"I was in a St. Louis indie bookstore today and was delighted that one of the other customers was looking for anything by Ross MacDonald. MacDonald, who died in 1983, would probably be proud that his Lew Archer is being re-published and re-discovered by old and new fans alike. The man was a master storyteller and his prose is as striking as when he was writing in his prime in the 1950s.The Doomsters, originally published in 1958, is no exception. Its lyrical prose should be considered the epitome of character development and imagery. This is probably the definitive Archer book and readers learn more about Lew and what makes him the man he becomes in later novels.The novel opens with a pounding on the door at the crack of dawn--and takes off from there. An escapee from a mental institution, clad in \\"the kind of clothes they give you to wear in prison\\" has landed on Archer's doorstep on the advice of a fellow escapee, Tom Rica, whom Lew had helped years earlier. Carl Hallman wants Lew to investigate the death of his father, a powerful Senator from California. Carl is sure that the attending physician, Dr. Grantland, killed him, but he needs Lew's help to prove it.Never one to turn down a chance to be nosey, Lew drives Carl to the family estate in the little town of Purissima. There resides Carl's brother Jerry and Jerry's wife Zinnie. Met by a deputy sheriff, Carl runs away from Lew and becomes the subject of an intense manhunt. More bodies start popping up, specifically Jerry's. Then Lew learns that there are some unanswered questions about Carl's wife Mildred, the Senator's death, and the even death of Carl's mother three years before.Lew has a knack for uncovering buried secrets, and those secrets rise to the top in The Doomsters. Striking, unconventional PI prose and the ability to layer story lines make Ross MacDonald one of the greatest crime writers of the twentieth century.Armchair Interviews agrees."},{"Title":"The doomsters","review":"Most detectives in fiction are stoic people who never seem to have a past of their own, at least not one that ever gets talked about much. In this novel, Ross MacDonald changes all that. His ace private eye Lew Archer is not only delving into the pasts of the characters he's investigating, trying to get to the bottom of a murder, but before it's all over he's forced to face his own past as well. Tom Rica, a heroin addict he had tried to help a few years earlier and then dismissed when his help wasn't working, reappears in his life and tells Archer that the murder of Alicia Hallman was not committed by her daughter-in-law Mildred, but by Dr. Grantland - something Rica had tried to tell him years ago, but Archer wouldn't listen. Lew Archer doesn't track down bad guys from the point of view of a removed third party - he becomes one of them. In his own way, he contributed to the death of Hallman. Guilt is an important element in the story, some of it misapplied, and Archer is forced to share in it. It's a brilliant concept, and MacDonald develops it well. This, I believe, is the first Archer novel that deserves the appellation \\"masterpiece.\\""},{"Title":"The doomsters","review":"Ross Macdonald is a greatly underrated writer and this is a greatly underrated book. Of all his books this one is my favorite. MacDonald had a Ph.D in English and it shows in the way he pulls off an amazing technical feat. The book takes place in real time except for the last few pages when he switches to a flashback and then a flashback within the flashback. The effect is amazing and the writing is sad, poignant and incredibly moving, as Archer catalogs his regrets. It also contains one of my favorite lines, when Archer says that an emotion \\"Fell through me like a feather in a vacuum.\\" It's a shame that the book has been ghettoized as \\"genre fiction\\" as I believe that you rarely see great writing like this anywhere these days."},{"Title":"The doomsters","review":"I am a long time fan of Ross Macdonald, and especially the Lew Archer stories. I have read all the novels at least twice. I agree with the idea that these are \\"the best series of mystery novels ever written by an American,\\" and I would even drop the word \\"mystery\\" from that. They transcend the mystery genre into real literature.The early novels have the flavor of a 1940s pulp fiction hard-boiled detective yarn. But Ross Macdonald matured out of that and came into his own by the mid 1950s. The novels became more serious somehow, without being dry or preachy. Quite the contrary.All that said, I must say that this one, the Doomsters, is probably my least favorite of all the serious novels. There are too many murders. It tries too hard to be deep and reflective. It is too talky. Unlike the others, it is not a \\"page turner.\\"I certainly would not want someone to start the series with the Doomsters. What then? I suggest the Zebra Striped Hearse. Then maybe the Dalton Case, eventually leading up to the really superb ones, like Sleeping Beauty."},{"Title":"The doomsters","review":"I don't know why the heck it took me so long to discover Ross MacDonald and Lew Archer, but I'm glad I have at last. This is the first Archer novel I recall reading, and it is a good one. The characters are each well fleshed out, and while the story ends with a couple of them facing rough challenges, there remains some hope.It starts with a man's leaving a mental hospital and hiring Archer to find out who murdered his father. The man appears paranoid, accusing his brother and sister-in-law and a local doctor of railroading him into the mental hospital and being implicated in his father's murder. A somewhat dubious Archer follows up on the case, although he's been assaulted by his client. Murder occurs, apparantly by his client, and Archer pursues a convoluted trail, untangling some of the knots in the stories he's told. The alert reader will spot the true killer, but might miss many of the details. Nevertheless, it's a satisfying read."},{"Title":"The doomsters","review":"The Doomsters starts off with private eye Lew Archer being paid an early morning visit by an escaped mental patient named Carl Hallman. Archer notices that Carl is deeply troubled and confused yet surprisingly well spoken. It appears that Carl's father, a very prosperous former state senator died 6 months earlier. The death certificate says it was a heart attack. But Carl has his doubts.As Archer is drawn into the case, he gets to meet the members of Carl's very dysfunctional family. There's his beautiful, long suffering wife, Mildred. His not so brotherly brother, Jerry. And his seductive sister-in-law, Zinnie. Rounding out the cast of characters are a shady MD and a pot-bellied sheriff for whom Archer takes an immediate dislike.The Doomsters is a skillfully told story of greed and betrayal. Carl Hallman is a victim. That much is clear from the very first chapter. But the full extent of his victimization only comes out at the book's surprising conclusion.With great dialogue, vividly descriptive prose and a fast paced narrative that unfolds smoothly, this novel is a real treat. Do yourself a favor and read it."},{"Title":"The doomsters","review":"The Doomsters has one of the best beginnings of any Archer book, as the private eye is awakened by an escaped mental patient that was recommended to Archer by a former friend; Archer has to drive the man to his ancestral home, and much happens on the way there and after Archer arrives (including of course murder). Archer finds all sorts of bad things going on in this family, both past and present, and the \\"doomsters\\" keep picking off family members one by one until Archer can find out what is going on.Some of MacDonald's best subject matter (dysfunctional families, insanity and mental illness, drug abuse), and many murders, but strangely not one of the more compelling Archer mysteries. The novel is too talky, and too serious in tone as if MacDonald is writing the story as a public service against families that treat their children badly. Also, Archer does little here except for run around and find bodies and except for discovering the identity of the murderer at the end really doesn't help out much (things would have proceeded pretty much as written whether or not Archer was present in most cases).While not one of MacDonald's best (I'd rate it in the lower third of all Archer mysteries) it does have a somewhat unexpected denouement although all the clues are there for the reader to find. The cast is not very interesting IMO despite their eccentricities, but the book picks up 2/3 of the way through and has some interesting revelations at the end. Still does not rise to the high standard of the earlier stories like The Ivory Grin nor the later classics like The Chill."},{"Title":"The doomsters","review":"Ross Macdonald has a way with plots and words that keeps me coming back to his Lew Archer's series even though every book presents a very gloomy view of human nature. In \\"The Doomsters\\" there is an unrelenting grimness to the plot and character interactions that befits the title, which comes from a Thomas Hardy poem \\"To an Unborn Pauper's Child.\\" In the poem the doomsters are evil forces lurking in the background to bring down misfortune on people.In this book Macdonald once again focuses on dysfunctional families as a major cause of murder and other evil deeds. Archer gets involved with a very messed up wealthy family and also a poor woman and her alcoholic mother. His involvement begins when one of the sons in the rich family escapes from a mental hospital and looks up Archer for help, based on the advice of his fellow escapee who has a history with Archer. Archer finds himself drawn into helping the young man, i.e., his usual messianic urge asserts itself.Greed is another typical theme for Macdonald, and when greed is coupled with dysfunctional family situations in \\"The Doomsters\\" murders proliferate. It is distressing to this reader to watch the violence unfold, along with fraud, blackmail, and other crimes.In this book we learn more about Archer than in any other up to this point in the series. The reader learns how his divorce from his wife Sue affected him at the time it was taking place. We also learn how he let down a young man he was trying to mentor at that same time and the ramifications of his behavior toward the young man. Archer seems to reach new personal convictions about the shades of gray in human behavior after this case. He no longer believes all it takes to make life better is to find the evil people and lock them up--he knows there is potential evil in all of us."},{"Title":"The doomsters","review":"The Lew Archer series by Ross MacDonald have been described by The New York Times \\" the finest series of detective novels ever written by an American\\".

MacDonald writes so well about the weakness's of humans, his writing is much more than hard boiled detective fiction.There is some Archer back story in this story that I haven't encountered in the other novels in the series that I have read.This story is not as good as \\"The Chill\\" but then again nothing is, but it's a good murder mystery and a fine way to spend a Sunday on the couch."},{"Title":"Macho Marines: True Homosexual Military Stories, Volume 6","review":"I am one of the writers, Gysgt Steve Aldea, and My Experiences in the Marine Corps with Sailors have been true in all of the past three books.Marine Biology, Basic Training and Macho Marines tells it all about what goes on behind closed doors when the military is not snooping between the bed sheets of men in the Military.

They quantify the diet of the average slave (4100 calories per day), determine that his living space is greater than his white northern facory worker economic counterpart, and show convincingly that the slave life span is substantially greater than white workers in New York, Boston, or Philadelphia in 1850. The authors were likely as surprised and perplexed at some of the findings as are their readers. Nonetheless, they report their data in an intellectually honest and interesting work.

How could so much anecdotal evidence and political bias be mistaken for fact?"},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"Though Time on the Cross takes on a new approach to the subject of slavery, the authors' research is horrid. It is as though they made up their minds what they were going to find and then made sure their research (or lack there of) fit their thesis. Much of there data is inaccurate or irrelevant, such as tables that compare the occupation distribution of antebellum slaves to that of all males in 1870 to show that slaves held fewer laboring jobs (as opposed to artisan or managerial positions). 1870 is after the industrial revolution begins to take place so there are obviously more laborers than skilled workers. The book is filled with these inaccurate interpretations of data and some claims that are completely unfounded. &quot;Reckoning with Slavery&quot; by David, Gutman, Sutch, Temin, Wright and Stampp is a good book to read along with Time on The Cross, to see the many errors which the authors find in Fogel and Engerman's &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

The professor had us read it, write a paper on it and then, after we handed in our papers, demolished the book in class. He assigned it entirely as an example of sloppy historical research and how something well written can be convincing even if its based on deeply flawed information.Quite often Fogel and Engerman rely on a singal, somewhat questionable, example to support a sweeping generalization of the entire institution of slavery. Much of their work rests on a single source which they use time and time again to prop up a badly construted hypothesis. When this is coupled with a devotion to the idea of man as a rational economic actor you have something that is almost an apologia for the entire practice of slavery.My suggestion is to read this book and read it well. Use a critical eye when they present information and pay attention to their sources. Use this book as a tool to help you discover the many avenues of failure in writing history. Do not, I beg of you, use it as a guide to the truth because there is precious little in here."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"Time on the Cross is seriously flawed. While the intent behind it is honest, the outcome of this project is a gold mine for Confederate apologists. Fogel and Engerman systematically misrepresent the nature of slavery in the Old South.Their account lacks any conception of the nuances of life in the antebellum South. Their use of sources is highly selective: examining the diary of one slaveholder, Bennett Barrows, they use selective examples to conclude that he did not whip his slaves indiscriminately. Apparently they missed the pages where dear old Mr Barrows had himself a \\"whipping frolick\\" or where he beat all of his field hands as punishment for losing a shovel. By the time they assert that whipping was rare (in their words, \\".7 whippings per hand per year) I'm ready to gag.Consistent in this book is a systematic inattention to the psychological reality of the slave system. F&E; don't understand subtler forms of coercion; they don't understand fear. In their economic analyses, one senses that they stacked the deck to favor the South: one hilarious map groups (slaveholding) Missouri in the North and includes the \\"states\\" of Oklahoma, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota. None of the last four entered the Union before 1865!Fogel and Engerman should have stuck to pure econ. When they decided to write history, they came to the field projecting economic assumptions onto their subjects, forgetting the very complex and layered nature of life in the South. Having reduced slaves to eager workers with a Protestant work ethic they have inadvertently produced a book that must read very well at meetings of the daughters of the Confederacy.For a much better history of slavery, look at Kenneth Stampp's The Peculiar Institution. Herbert Gutman's Slavery and the Numbers Game is a great critique of F&E;."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"This book is useful mostly as an example of how not to approach history. Fogel and Engerman used data based on slaveholders' records to conclude that slaves were treated well in the old South. They counted, for example, the exact number of beatings that an average slave would experience in year and concluded that it was only a few, without considering the impact of witnessing beatings of one fellow slaves, many of whom were family members or close friends. They counted the calories consumed by slaves but ignored data like actual caloric expenditures of slaves (which rendered their intake barely sufficient) and infant mortality (very high). This book serves mainly to reinforce one's prejudices and should not be read without also looking at other works in the field."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"The reviews below present the findings of this book as unproblematic and uncontested.

That is all it is! It uses information from small spacific areas of the south and generalizes it for all of the south. Just because it happens in one area of the south doesn't mean that it happens every where. People that read this book may think that they are getting a new look at the south but really they are getting a bunch of numbers that makes it look like the south was not that bad of a place. This book depicts people as rational people who always think things out. This book depicts the south as though the slaves were being treated well as far as eating, sleeping quarters, and medical care. This is a good book for showing how bad clieometrics can go wrong. I just hope people will not take this book to heart for if they do they will be very misinformed as to how the south was. Fogel and Engerman only use information from specific areas, such as New Orleans. They doen't take into consideration about the human nature of people. This book, if not explaned in detail could do some harm to the view of the south. This book does use statistics very well but it doesn't give the big pitcure. The only reason I would recomend this book is if someone wants to see a different way of writing or how data could creat different aproaches about historical events, good or bad."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"Initially, the notion that chattel servitude/slavery would not have died on its own is a fascinating concept. Very quickly, however, the reader discovers that Fogel is so deeply wrapped up in his ideas that he fails to properly paint the picture of a strong southern society in which slavery was a blessing to Southern Blacks. The interest subsides as his poorly written and disorganized book turns into page after page of confusion. WARNING-- DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ THE SECOND PART OF THIS WORK WHICH IS A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF METHODS, DETAILS, AND ANALYSIS. UNLESS YOU ARE A MONSTER MATHEMATICIAN OR A PSYCHOPATH, THIS SECOND VOLUME WILL BE A WASTE OF GOOD TIME AND MONEY"},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"First, I will be forthright and say that I am an unreconstructed Southerner. If that makes my review prejudiced, so be it. But I would be willing to wager that all those reviewers who critisize this work and give it only 1 or 2 starrs, while glowingly giving indirect 5 star recommendations to Gutman's works, are just as prejudiced the other way. The fact of the matter is that 'we' rate like we think and no volume of material is going to sway our preconceived or 'brainwashed' notions.I have read most of the Slave Narratives and I've make a lifelong (I'm 56) study of like in the Antebellum and post-war South, plus I can still remember life in rural Louisiana in the 50's as a small boy and have heard many stories from grandparents born before 1900. I have also read many many works (no longer in print) written right before and right after the war.First, anyone who believes the Civil War was fought over slavery is just plain foolish and definitely has an agenda and will NEVER learn anything. With that said, and based on all I have read, I believe that the real truth lies somewhere almost in the middle of what 'Time on the Cross' proposes and what Gutman's contradictory writing show.I believe that before ANY student or academician of this subject can even begin to form an opinion, they need to read the Slave Narratives to form a foundation. Afterall, these were real intereviews, real opinions, from the real people who lived through it. How can any modern author, through the tinted glasses of time, even hope to come close to evaluating this subject without reading these essential compilations? Whether they 'fit' into today's politically correct notions or not, they cannot be ignored (even though they have been suppressed for many years as if they never existed).Slavery was a terrible thing that happened all over the world, and, I believe that had it not been for the assassination of Lincoln (who believed all blacks should be returned to Africa!), that race relations in this country would have been much different than they were up until 1970. I believe that race relations were hurt terribly by the reconstruction of the South.Do I believe the United States would be better off today if it was an all-white society? Yes, I do. I believe this not because I don't believe two races can't co-exist (although this is naturally difficult), but because we have become so sensitive today and politically correct that not even Bill Cosby and address the real problems of the black community without being attacked, so how can I expect any better.I heard tonight on TV that it is 'unknown' why the illigitimacy rate is so high among black teenagers. Well, duh! Simply put, what has happened in this country is that whites and blacks were mixed in the 60's and 70's in order to provide more opportunity to blacks and to raise their standards. Well, this would have been difficult enough to do in the first place since it defies the laws of nature and physics. But, when political correctness and 'race sensitivity' is added to the equation, there was only one outcome.That outcome is a lowering of standards for blacks and whites alike - not only academically, but socially and morally as well. I know for a fact that in the first half of the 20th century, the moral level of blacks was much higher than it is overall today. Why?I believe that an environment was created (probably on purpose) where instead of the lower elements (blacks) being elevated to higher levels of morality and academics and socio-economics by whites, that the reverse happened. The standards were pulled down and now today (as evidenced by our high schools) the overall levels of both blacks and whites are lower than either were before integration was even started. It will continue to go lower, I guess, until the US is at the bottom of the list in educational level compared to other countries. Will we ever learn? If we care about all our children, both black and white, are we to sacrifice them on the altar of 'race relations'? Are they to become 3rd rate when compared to countries like China, India, Russia, Japan, and most of Europe on educational levels? Probably so. But, the government and the race panderers will have what they want."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"This book is offensive and you can tweak and make up numbers all you want. African-Americans have a strong tradition of passing on oral history to their children. We know the truth and our truth does not have to be validated by anyone. Further, de facto slavery continued well after the civil war through the use of Jim Crow, where black women were still forced to work like slaves and were sexually exploited. We know this because our grandmothers told us stories about being maids and nurses for white folks. We have an up close and personal view of white folks and your revisionist theories are not going to wipe these memories away. If you want evidence of exploitation, just look at our skin color. We didn't get so many mulattos and quadroons through artificial insemination. A lot of &quot;white folks&quot; are mixed and they don't even know it. The ignorance in this country is simply astounding. One can only hope that this ignorance is not passed on to young children. I would assume that this author also believes that that the holocaust didn't exist; the jewish survivors are just making up a bunch of stuff. I guess being in a gas chamber and providing slave labor was good for Germany's economy, so hey that makes it o.k., right?"},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"Fogel and Engerman's work turns to primary sources to figure out exactly what the economics of slavery in the American South were like. It turns out that the predominant views are wrong: slavery wasn't unprofitable, slaves were well-nourished and lived almost as long as free laborers, slave families were rarely split up, resistance to slave-owners was rare, and on and on. Farms worked by slaves were 1/3 more efficient that farms worked by free laborers, and slaves received on average more of that higher income than free laborers did. A small proportion of slaves worked as skilled workers in management, engineering, or various crafts. Some of these earned higher incomes than their free counterparts.Since this is only a book on the economics of slavery (as the book's subtitle says), it cannot examine the psychological or ethical damage that slavery caused, as the authors acknowledge. They do acknowledge that while slaves received a higher proportion of the pecuniary income they produced as wages, food, clothing, housing, and medical care than free laborers did, they also acknowledge that the non-pecuniary costs of slavery to the slaves themselves was enormous. The higher productivity of slave-worked farms was made possible, obviously enough, by forcing the slaves to do what free laborers could not be paid to do: work longer hours in a more regulated, larger farm. Interestingly enough, the gain in productivity this resulted in, while conveyed in small part to the slaves themselves in the form of higher income, did not accrue entirely or even in the most part to the planters. Rather, about half of it accrued to the consumers of cotton. Since most of cotton was exported (primarily to Britain, where most of the cotton was made into clothing), the primary beneficiaries of American slavery were people who bought cotton goods. This is because producing and selling cotton was a competitive industry, where real profits tend toward zero. Thus, while the planters exploited the slaves in reality by whipping them and forcing them to work in ways free laborers would not, the resultant pecuniary exploitation of slaves was accomplished by capitalism.But perhaps the most interesting thing the book discusses is how the myth of unproductive slaves has contributed to contemporary racism. According to the contemporary racist view, blacks are lazy, morally degenerate, and immature. Fogel and Engerman show that, under slavery, blacks were none of these things. In fact, the evidence shows that they were harder working and more sexually circumspect on average than their free white counterparts.What the authors point out as a reason there were not more slave revolts is that, given the fact that both Northerners and Southerners were racists, free blacks had little economic, social, or political opportunity. Free blacks in the North were not permitted to do all kinds of things. It would seem that many blacks rationally decided they were better off as slaves. The slave artisans and engineers, however, who commanded the highest wages, were the ones best able to make a living in the economy of the free North and were therefore those most likely to escape.The book's last chapter deals with the implications of the findings for contemporary race relations. The book shows, of course, that blacks are not biologically inferior to whites. And, in economic terms, blacks were worse off in 1890 than they were in 1860. This isn't because slavery is always economically better than being free, but because the U.S. abolished slavery without abolishing racism. Blacks remained second-class citizens without the power to better their lot economically or politically. At least under slavery their racist owners had an economic interest in their economic well-being. That is the one thing the book drives home in a thoroughly researched and completely convincing way."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"One of the all-time classics in the genre of economic history, there have been very few more controversial books in the past half-century. There are still those today who call Fogel a racist or (as one other commentator did) an apologist for slavery. These people more than miss the point of this work. The profitability of slavery has nothing to do with the morality of it, as the authors point out. This is a survey and analysis of previously unresearched data. Fogel and Engerman take the first systematic look at data on slave movement, working conditions, life expectancy, and the economies of scale in both free labor and slave labor in the South.Fogel and Engerman attack the thesis that slavery was impeding the economic progress of the South and would ultimately collapse under its own inefficiencies. Instead, they show investment in slaves was even more profitable than investments in free labor, and that owners had developed a wide system of incentives to induce quality labor from their slaves. Some claim that this means that Fogel and Engerman support slavery or that somehow this makes slavery palateable; to the contrary, their conclusion lends weight to the idea that only a Civil War would be able to end the evil practice, contrary to the hopes of many abolitionists who claimed slavery would fall apart due to its inherent weaknesses.This work was originally shunned, but the force of its evidence and arguments has led it to become the mainstream interpretation in economic discussions of the Civil War period. Fogel recieved the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1993 (not solely for this work of course) and his most famous book is still the standard for excellence in his field."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"Fogel and Engerman challenge the traditional conception of slavery has being a non-productive system but a highly competitive system of human labor. The authors challenged the traditional notion that the Southern aristocracy engaged in sexual conduct with Slaves but according to their research based on Southern Brothels that most whites engaged in illicit sexual activity with other white women. The notion of sexual liberalism in 18th and 19th Century South is contradicted by their body of research. The idea of white aristocracy having sexual relations with the slaves is contradicted by the fact that very few statistics show this relationship through Southern demography. The second fallacy of slavery is that the immigrant community in the north had a higher standard of living than the slaves of the South. This is contradicted by several indicators researched by the authors. A very stimulating book that can be classifed in the Davies slavery genre."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"The problems with this book are not about it being \\"racist\\" or \\"apologist\\" for slavery.

Gutman undoes virtually all of Fogel and Engerman's data and claims regarding the social (and yes, psychological) aspects of slavery (violence, punishments, family separation, etc.). Fogel & Engerman's data, in many cases, was extremely thin, as was their logic in interpreting much of the data, as Gutman demonstrates. None of Fogel and Engerman's social (and, again, psychological) claims (minimal punishments, minimal separations) stand up, though many of their economic claims (profitability, flexibility) still do. Fogel revised some of their work inWithout Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery. Time on the Cross should be read as a first draft attempt at a quantitative history of slavery, not the final word."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"It explodes every myth, and there are scores, about slavery. Using the raw data lying dormant and too cumbersome prior to the appearance of high speed computers the Nobel Laureate Economist from the University of Chicago applied the then new technology to census,plantation, and other records with results no one could have anticipated. Among the myths dismantled by this scholarly but readable book; sexual exploitation was rare, familys were rarely broken up by sale and &quot;breeding&quot; plantations simply did not exist. This book,if made mandatory reading at all universities could even restore some sanity to discussions on race, something that has been missing in ths country for 30 years."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"A few other reviewers have given a very fair-minded and detailed description of the content of the book. Instead of trying to supplement those excellent reviews, and in light of the many vicious, angry and generally uninformed comments that I have seen on this site, perhaps I should mention a few facts about the circumstances with which the book was written that should clarify things for both readers and potential readers.Robert Fogel, one of the authors of the book, was one of the extremely few white men at the time - and even today - to marry an African-American wife. At the time, having a mixed marriage was enough of a stigma to bar you from \\"civilized\\" circles. This was a major reason why, in spite of his obvious talent at a young age, Fogel only managed to find a job at the young and relatively untested economics department at the University of Rochester, and later on at the University of Chicago, another department that was considered well out of the mainstream.It did not help that Fogel was not just sympathetic to communism in his early years (like many intellectuals at the time) but worked as a full time communist organizer for years, which again led to difficulties in his future career. Although his views changed, his concern with inequality never did; the vast majority of Fogel's academic work focuses on historical developments of institutions and how they relate to inequality and economic growth. Unlike other economists more preoccupied with abstract and fancy models of economic exchange, Fogel made it his life's work to study the experiences and lives of common men in history. In fact, he spent the last few decades meticulously studying the evolution and prevalence of diseases like smallpox in history.Thus, it was extremely bizarre to see accusations of \\"racism\\", \\"political bias\\" or even \\"slavery apologism\\" leveled at Fogel and his co-author. Even more bizarre was the (relatively few) racists and conservatives who seem to believe that Fogel has justified their views.Sometimes, social scientists reach conclusions after meticulous research that do not entirely conform to our personal prejudices. This is especially common in history where it's easy to have idealistic interpretations of how history has progressed which contradict reality. A common reaction is to denounce scholars or researchers who try to point out the opposite - attributing to them sinister motives and ridiculing their work (often without reading it). This is something I find silly and juvenile, because in most cases the theses of these researchers are not really inconsistent with our worldview. As Fogel has said - in this book as well as in other writings - he found slavery to be morally indefensible even if economically efficient. Why then are offended crowd - including not just laymen but professional historians in renowned institutions - seemingly so afraid of the book's thesis that they are so eager to denounce and viciously attack the author with labels that many of them know are not true?The ability to do and publicize scholarly research even if it does not conform to your or society's prejudices is the mark of a great social scientist. Fogel, in his attempt to show that previous historical consensus on the inefficiency of slavery was incorrect, and more generally to show the importance of using quantitative evidence in history, was the perfect embodiment of this spirit. Although the work is a bit dated, its central place in the development of the modern field of economic history will likely stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"This book is a must read for any students of Economic History. Rather than using a traditional approach to history, the book uses a particularly mathematical approach to the economics of slavery. Its conclusions are based collected data. Some of the books conclusions may bother people. Such as the implications that explotation of slaves can be mitigated by the money they receive during the course of their life. It also offers evidence that certain henious practices such as breeding, and sexual relationships between master and slave, were not as wide-spread as is commonly believed. It also attacks the notion that any modern family problems, specifically the commonality single parent homes, can be attributed to the purposeful degredation of the family unit by slave holders. This book does not try to convince people that slavery was an acceptable economic system. I believe its intent was to make the readers better informed about slavery. I would hope that the reader realizes the true evil of slavery was not the conditions associated with it, but rather depriving others of their freedom for economic gain."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"This is an excellent study of the economics of chattel slavery, and shatters a number of cherished liberal myths.While I'm on the subject, I'd like to ask Brad Fuller a question:If the author's methodolgy is so flawed, why is he a Nobel laureate in economics, principally for his work on this book?"},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman's Time on the Cross is an extensive thorough examination of slavery in the antebellum era of the United States using the tools of cliometrics and economics to rethink previous interpretations of the slavery system. Fogel and Engerman took on the monumental task of proving ten points they believed to be true in light of new data compiled and analyzed by cliometric research. The book set out to prove that slavery was profitable and just as profitable as manufacturing operations in the North. The system of slavery was not on death's door and was still economically sound by the beginning of the Civil War. Slave owners had a positive outlook on the future of their slave economy. Slave agriculture was efficient when compared to free agriculture. Slaves were more hard-working and efficient than white agricultural workers and compared evenly to white workers in industry. The demand for slaves was increasing not only in agriculture but industry as well. Most slaves lived in close family units and slave owners mostly kept the family unit together in sales of slaves because it was in their best economic interest to do so. The standard of living in the material form was comparable to free workers of the time period. Slaves were able to keep ninety percent of their income they generated. Lastly, The South's economic growth was increasing and the South had a high level of per capita income compared to not only the rest of United States but also the rest of the world during the time period. The authors mainly used mathematics and statistics which they referred to as systematic data to analyze the records from the time period to prove these ten points they proposed as correct. The authors admittedly attempted to stay away from what they called fragmentary evidence which they defined as \\"is based on unverifiable impressions of individuals whose primary aim was the defense of an ideological position.\\" (p. 10) However they did acknowledge that sometimes they used this fragmentary evidence when as they stated, \\"to illustrate and make more vivid results that have been established by more precise methods, and to fill in gaps in evidence where it has not been possible thus far to obtain systematic data.\\" (p. 11) This book was published in 1974 so both authors were approximately in a decade of their professional academic careers when the book came out and apparently they succeeded in achieving through this book a \\"wide-ranging and radical reinterpretation of American slavery.\\" (p. 8) Both authors have the academic background and experience to write a book about this subject, but never the less it was a bold to attempt to reshape the entire previous thought and interpretations of the subject of slavery.Fogel and Engerman both have had successful careers in the academic world. As Robert Fogel stated in his autobiography, \\"My professional training began at Cornell University (BA 1948) and continued at Columbia University where I obtained my MA (1960), and at Johns Hopkins University, where I obtained my Ph.D. (1963). It was at Cornell that my scientific interests shifted from physics and chemistry to economics and history. The switch in focus was precipitated by the widespread pessimism about the future of the economy during the second half of the 1940s, when forecasts about the imminent return to the massive unemployment of the Great Depression were rife.\\" Engerman graduated from John Hopkins University as well and has been a professor at Rochester University since 1963. Both authors have collaborated on many other works together in addition to Time on the Cross.Time on the Cross does a superb job in analyzing the data for the reader although at some points in the book it starts reading like a math book, but for the most part the authors were successful in not inundating the reader with technical math formulas. Time on the Cross calculatedly focused on issues of economics and did not delve into the moral ramifications of slavery. According to Fogel and Engerman some people in the academic community were outraged or at least very confused by the lack of treatment by the book on the moral implications of slavery. Fogel and Engerman noted that when they went to conferences some of their colleagues would come up to them afterward and ask, \\"What are you guys trying to do? Sell Slavery?\\" (p.258) They answered no to that question because that was the truth, however, the authors themselves seemed to have felt a tad guilty about not addressing the issue of the morality of slavery in the book. They stated, \\"Perhaps the most serious deficiencies in Time on the Cross is its failure to provide a new moral indictment of slavery that is more consistent with the new empirical knowledge on the actual operation of the slave system, as we understood it in 1973.\\" (p.273) From the perspective of this reader, the best course was to stay away from the moral issues surrounding slavery as Time on the Cross did because moral issues are emotionally charged. The emotional nature of the morality of slavery would have detracted from and clouded the strength of the book that used non-emotional mathematics and statistics to prove the ten points. Time on the Cross was about the economics of slavery and analyzing the relevant data with regards to illuminating the economic picture of that time and place and it accomplished this task very well."},{"Title":"Time on the Cross","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read on American negro slavery. What makes it a valuable edition to the academic literature is that the authors did not go into this with any ideological axes to grind. Indeed, both are political liberals who thoroughly deprecate the institution of slavery as a social and moral evil. They simply wanted to attain a better understanding of the actual economics of slavery in the Old South by analyzing the Plantation Books (i.e. the financial logs of Southern planters) and other relevant statistical resources so as to be able to accurately assess what slavery was like and how it affected the slave, the master and Southern society as a whole.Much to their surprise, the authors concluded that slavery, as it was, bore little resemblance to the fictional, fever-swamp, nonsense that is peddled by the NAACP, the liberal media, Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and left-wing academics. They found that slaves had a better diet and better housing conditions than their wage-slave, immigrant counterparts in the North. They also found that slave families were rarely broken up and that miscagenation between masters and slaves was exceeedingly rare -- indeed, almost nonexistant. They also found that many slaves earned substantial incomes - a fact that surprises many people who believe that slaves did not earn money for their labour. I could go on and on but that would give away the book and ruin the joy of reading a text that absolutely blows away virtually all the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; you've ever heard repeated about slavery in the Old South.Anyone who really wants to learn the truth about slavery owes it to themselves to buy and read this book."},{"Title":"Gnosis and Faith in Early Christianity: An Introduction to Gnosticism","review":"If I were currently teaching a course on the very complex religious phenomenon of gnosticism in the ancient world to an audience unfamiliar with the subject, this would undoubtedly be on the required reading list. There are at least six reasons for my enthusiasm about this book.First, the book is simply organized. This perhaps may not be such a feat in and of itself, but with a topic as difficult to pin down as gnosticism, this is done very well. Anyone can follow the author's layout.Second, Roukema's parlance is not for the scholar, but for the beginner. His syntax is not characterized by multiple subordinate clauses and the fifty-cent words of academia, but is simple and straight-forward. I imagine a high schooler could read this book with as much ease as anyone.Third, the author simplifies the subject, but does not over simplify -- at least, not too much. When he does, however, he lets you know.Fourth, although he finally disagrees with the gnostic perspective, his evaluation of it is practically undetectable until the end. That is, it reads very impartially. He is even sympathetic with the gnostic ideology at times.Fifth, the reader comes away with some interaction with primary sources. While there are no lengthy quotations here (after all, it's just an introductory book), Roukema offers commentary on specific texts he feels are representative of certain communities.Sixth, there are recommendations for further reading, which puts the icing on this lovely cupcake of a book."},{"Title":"Kevin Garnett (Sports Heroes)","review":"In Minnesota Kevin Garnett is respected not because he is a first-team All-NBA player or because he makes more money than anybody else in basketball. K.G. is respected because he is still here. Stephon Marbury bailed on the Twin Cities for the Nets to be closer to his home in NYC (of course, he plays in Phoenix now, so there is some justice in this world), and he is not the only way to get out of town for greener pastures. But K.G. has committed to the team, the city and the fans, and that speaks big time in today's sports world.Arlene Bourgeois Molzahn tells the story of how Garnett made the jump from high school to the NBA, covering his career through his first five seasons, through the 1999-2000 season. That was the year K.G. was named first team All-NBA, made first team All-NBA defensive as well, and finished second in the MVP voting to Shaqueille O'Neal. However, she keeps the focus not only on his accomplishments but on the hard work he puts into getting the most out of his talents and the community work he does to give something back.There are plenty of basketball superstars who do not know how to play the game or how to be a decent human being, but K.G. is certainly not one of them, as young readers will discover in this excellent juvenile biography. This is why if you look at the other titles in the Sports Heroes series you only find the special people in sports, like Brett Favre, Derek Jeter, Miam Hamm, Sheryl Swoopes and Tiger Woods."},{"Title":"Together Alone: Personal Relationships in Public Places","review":"Although a ordered a book from this seller at a fairly low price, the seller failed to send the product on time AND failed to reply to my messages and cancellation request.

They are evenly divided between historical photos of life in London during Orwell's lifetime and ones taken in 1984, when the book was published. The photos are grouped chronologically according to the different phases of Orwell's life and are accompanied by brief biographical sketches that lend context. The final chapter, \\"No enemy to pleasure\\", shows restaurants Orwell frequented.The most useful feature of the book is the addresses given for every place photographed. This is very handy for anyone visiting London who would like to see places where Orwell worked or lived. I made that trip myself in 1999 and can vouch for the accuracy of the references. Of particular interest are the offices of Victor Gollancz, 14 Henrietta St., WC2 (only shown from the inside in this book), Booklover's Corner, South End Green, NW3 (now a pizza shop with an Orwell plaque near the door), and the Senate House, Malet St., WC1 (rumored to be the model for the Ministry of Truth in \\"1984\\").All in all worthwhile, snap this one up if you can find it."},{"Title":"SHREWBETTINA'S BIRTHDAY","review":"My sister and I both fell in love with all of John Goodall's little books as children. This, as well as most of his others, feature beautiful Victorian illusrations (though not at all fussy) of animals getting into mischief and interesting situations. The best part of these is that every other page is cut in half, so when you flip it over it forms a new illustration (hard to describe, but the effect is wonderful). Also these books are wordless, so my three-year old as well as his eight-year old cousin both enjoy these. This book tends to be a bit more feminine, as is Naughty Nancy. For boys and girls both I highly recommend the Creepy Castle, or any of the Paddy books (all by this author)."},{"Title":"SHREWBETTINA'S BIRTHDAY","review":"I had this book as a child and it was my absolute favorite.

I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was an assignment for my English class, I put it off till the weekend before the research paper was due to read it. When I finally made a commitment to read it... I could not put it down! This book made my laugh, cry and angry. I loved every page of it, and I was always anxious to find out what happened next. I have definitely learned a lot about mankind and the human spirit by reading this book. Now my goal is to read all of Steinbeck's novels. It is such a powerful story, if a person in their whole lifetime were to read one book and one book only, I would highly recommend them to read this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck leaves no character here unscathed, if not by a current malfeasance, then at least by a tormented past. One thing he does well by elaborating the good and evil theme from the Cain and Abel story, is to show how typically people think they need something to be happy, but then are less content than someone with far less. But it's not that easy, because someone who looks relatively content, is actually just better at making peace with their own demons. Sam Hamilton and the Chinese guy, for instance, seem to be coping much better than any of the newcomers from Connecticut with the way-better land, but still they suffer.Pounding on the theme of a love deficit as an explanation for evil is also well done, in that Steinbeck shows that some forms of evil are outside this explanation, as well--for instance the unfathomable genesis of Kate's badness. Dr. Dobson would say that some kids are just plain bad.Timshel is a very touching way to end this, but not surprisingly, the Hebrew scholar I checked this with (who is on the board of directors of her temple), tells me there is more than one interpretation, and that it is not necessarily &quot;thou mayest.&quot; But I have no reason not to like the interpretation discerned by the Chinaman, in consultation with the rest of his Chinese friends-cum-Hebrew scholars.Roy the Model T mechanic (&quot;Jus call Me Joe&quot;) is also an appropriate character type who would fit right in to our network administrator culture of computer geniuses.This book is disturbing, and so is Cain and Abel. I doubt Cain was pleased with the result of his successful attack on Abel, which he must have thought he wanted, as well."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was required to read this book as summer reading for my 11th grade Honors English class.Like my fellow classmates, I thought &quot;Great, a book that's over 600 pages long written so I'll never be able to understand it.&quot;Fortunately, I was wrong. East of Eden is intriguing and written so that even teenagers can understand it. If you can get past all the family/character introductions which occupy the first few chapters, you've got it made. The rest of the book is well written with its use of symbolism, themes of good and evil, colorful character and other elements that make it a classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck captures so many complexities of human character as well as human relationships.

I already knew that I liked John Steinbeck, but this book really drew me into its meaning.

Steinbeck's clear yet descriptive writing definately deserves more attention than it is given."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read East of Eden while living in Santa Cruz Ca.

I feel so fortunate to have read it when I did."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Well, it is the dead of winter here in Minnesota, and good books are good friends. East of Eden has been a long-time favorite of mine--the best book I have ever read. But rather than try to explain why I feel this way, I would instead point readers to Part I, Chapter 3, where Adam Trask and his father Cyrus are out walking, discussing Adam's future in the military.You know, there are parts of books where authors develop the story, develop the characters, and so on. Then there are the more important parts where the author bares his soul and really tries to get his message or deepest beliefs out to the reader. Steinbeck is Cyrus in this part of the book, and a more profound understanding of the human situation (and of the differences among us) I have yet to encounter. It is a passage like this that will keep me reading Steinbeck again and again. Timshel!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I'd just like to put in my words of agreement with the previous Vermont reviewer, who was basically telling two juniors in our high school to stop bashing Steinbeck to annoy their English teacher. Their sole purpose in writing the review was to irritate an English teacher; they made up the drek about the novel. East of Eden is a fine novel with a strong message about personal choice and the nature of good and evil. Steinbeck's writing is not laborious, and his theme is not inaccessible. Sometimes his writing is more complex than some wish to delve into, but for the most part, careful reading tells you what you need to know. Read it. And don't pay attention to the reviewers who love to tease their English teacher (as we all do); they don't mean it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I greatly question the unfounded review of East of Eden that was posted on this site by a Vermont address. East of Eden is generally held to be a literary classic, wonderfully crafted as it is. That is not to say that a reader should resign him/herself to public opinion, unquestioningly. But reviewers loudly stating their opinions without providing evidence has no more credence than the former. There was no reasoning behind the thoughtless bashing of this novel. If any basis for such accusations exist, I would like to hear what they are so the argument can be considered rationally. At the moment, no foundation is present for a meaningful exchange of information. The author incorporates a vivid palette, using multiple brushstrokes. Though some of the smaller strokes seem disconnected, the larger strokes bring the painting together into a cohesive whole. That is not to say that Steinbeck is inaccessible. Rather, it is the analyzation of the minute without a look at the bigger picture which can cause confusion. It is understandable that some readers may see the novel solely as beautiful, individual images. Yet this is not the fault of the author, rather the inclination of the reader to examine parts of the whole without ever observing the final masterpiece. A reader could be easily seduced into zooming in on the aesthetics of the descriptions. Nevertheless, the novel discourses upon this very temptation in the characterization of Kate by her son, Aron. Aron falls into this limiting trap, through which he can only see desirable aspects of his mother. This inability to view the entirety of the situation is, in the end, the cause of his demise. We are lucky, indeed, insofar as authors such as Steinbeck exist, holding up a mirror in which we can see the truths within our own souls."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is an unforgettable book because of its brilliant plot and characters. Steinbeck sets the story in Salinas Valley, his hometown, and focuses on two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The story passes fairly quickly from one generation to the next in the three sections of the novel.Its plot is filled with Biblical allusions, specifically the stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel. Steinbeck explores brother rivalry in two generations as the father favors a son, causing the other to experience overwhelming jealously and anger. The novel is profound as it explores this and other deep emotions, such as guilt. In the end, timshel emphasizes that forgiveness is necessary to allow one to move on in life.The characters are entertaining with their contrasting personalities. Cathy especially interested me as I questioned if she was completely evil or not.Also, Steinbeck's style is enjoyable because it is easy to understand.Even though the novel is long, the reader will love every page as they watch the amazing story unfold in front of their eyes. This book is a must read as it teaches many things and entertains at the same time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden, with over 600 pages of text, may seem daunting at first, but throughout the entire length of the book, Steinbeck keeps the reader focused and on track with his masterful story telling. Set against the backdrop of the biblical tale of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel, this modern account is a must read for many.Beginning his tale with the parents of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck follows this family for three generations, describing their lives and thoughts as they sadly reenact the lives of their Biblical counterparts. The only downside to this book is the introduction. Though it is fair from boring the first few chapters are slow. They are not as powerful as the rest of the book but it does create the proper context for the rest of the story. These few chapters bring us deep within the plot of the novel before flaring up and continuing full force for the rest of the book.While East of Eden can be read for its plot and storyline, Steinbeck's writing allows it to be much more. One of the most intriguing aspects of this book is the characters. Each character behaves in a dynamic way, they change and grow and most importantly, live. Steinbeck so flawlessly portrays his characters that they seem real and alive. Their actions and thoughts mimic our thoughts as we read. The development and maturing of these characters are a joy to read. We are eager see as Cal struggles to live up to his brother's ability and talents while we watch as he weeps in his shadow. Cathy is another powerful character. Her chilling ability to destroy and ruin those that love her is uncanny. I have found it hard to comprehend the actions of her twisted mind as she slowly devastates those around her. Yet, this added another level to the story by introducing a wild and unpredictable character. It is exciting to read about her exploits and the evil she can unleash.Though a story book by nature, East of Eden is able to incorporate deeper meaning with its complex characters. Cal's and the other character's experiences become our own as we read and learn from their mistakes as they struggle through their version of Adam and Even and eventually, Cain and Abel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In Steinbeck's masterful retelling of the biblical story of Cain and Abel, he explores the meaning behind the idea behind the meaning of his interpretation of timshel and the passing of the original sin through the experiences of the Trask and Hamilton family.Writing as the descendant of the third generation descendant of the Hamiltons, Steinbeck weaves the two families together that are drawn towards the rich and fertile farmlands in California. Steinbeck's book is divided into a series of four parts, each focusing on the different characters in the book. The first part tells of Adam and Charles Trask growing up under the care of their father Cyrus, a swindler and a liar who at his death wills a large sum of money to be divided into half to each of his sons. The money, gained from shady dealings, would represent the passing of sin from father to son, much like that of the biblical Adam to his offspring, Cain and Abel. Furthermore, much like how God favors Abel over Cain in the biblical story, Steinbeck applies the same parallels and character traits to Adam and Charles.Steinbeck's most prevailing focus would be on Adam's children, Aron, who is basically a happy-go-lucky kind of person and Cal, who is dark, brooding, and manipulative, much like his mother... and this you will need to read out for yourself! As the story progresses, it is Cal, who the story centers on the most and it is revealed that he has a sensitive and intimate side and wishes to be more like his brother. It is through him, that Steinbeck is able to convey his interpretation of his prevalent theme, timshel that thou mayest, that people have the will to choose their life. Although at the story's conclusion, the same chain of events occur as in the biblical story, Steinbeck offers deeper insight with his story as it is in fact the characters of the story that changed, which made this one wholesome ending.Don't get intimidated by the book's hefty size, although it starts off rather slow and may at times be quite boring due to Steinbeck's sometimes rather simplistic details in his prose, but if one has the will to toil on, he or she can find himself in a position where it his two hours past midnight and still want to read more because of the interesting character development and come to admire Steinbeck's simple, yet powerful use of language.Though initially I thought that this book would be long and tedious and only read the book because of it was an assignment, I finished the book with a sense of contentment and satisfaction that had long been extinct from previous experiences with some of the \\"required\\" literature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book twice and intend to read it again. The first time was when I was 10. It, along with Tobacco Road (Erskine Caldwell) was forbidden me as unfit literature for children (my mother was an avid reader, but she protected my childhood as long as she dared) so naturally, it became my goal to find where she had hidden them, and read both, which I did, having wasted nearly all of one summer looking for them. Finding them buried deep beneath some old clothes in her large Cedar chest, I curled up on the old sofa beneath the sunny kitchen window where the yellow June blooming roses were alive and vocal with the buzzing of bees, eagerly opened the pages and began to read........This book, obviously, parallels the story of Caine and Abel in many mortal ways. It's an incredible tale of betrayal, that I understand had roots in truth, woven around the totally depraved character of one woman, who, though amply endowed with charm, intelligence and ambition, it's but an outward veneer, and she is without the things that make such a person whole - conscience, loyalty, mother love, or any other human emotion that separates us from the primitive - and gets what she wants by using others. Killing someone is not something she worries much about.This woman, taken in by the Trask brothers after being found nearly beaten to death on their doorstep, marries one, beds the other and bears two boys who are by the brother not married to - twins - just before she leaves the good man who thinks he is their father - from her childbed, without a backward look. The story gets better and more incredulous with each passing page. You are given insight into any number of human conditions, characters, motivations, and finally, betrayal of yet another trust between brothers.It's one of Steinbeck's best works. He is a master of the written word - one who can pull you into the story even if you come from a different world than the one you are in as his fascinated reader - and ask you to feel it move you all the way there and back. There are these others by Steinbeck that number among my favorite reads and grace my personal library:\\"Grapes of Wrath\\"\\"Cannery Row\\"\\"The Red Pony\\" which is an unusual story about a young boy and his horse - of a love lost, but with responsibility and maturity painfully gained - book from my youth, but which is much more than a child's story."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is a 600 page masterpiece. This book grabbed my attention from start to finish. I read it in 1 week. It did get a little slow during the middle of the book. But I feel Steinbeck wrote that in as a plateau for such a mountain of a book. He is a true artist with every word & sentence. He draw's the scene out with a paint brush with fine brush strokes. Then when the scene is finished. He let's the great character's speak. They speak with true life meanings and lessons. I stopped reading for many years and this book is going to inspire me to keep reading for the rest of my life. But I don't think any book will live up to the masterpiece of this book. I will probally compare the rest of my readings to this book and find nothing will compare to it. I will surely read everything he has wrote and find joy in each one."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"nearly everything steinbeck wrote is worth reading.this story is worth devouring.it's far from a \\"happy\\" story, but the writing is too good to be true, and after completing it, it's nearly impossible to find another author to chase it down with.it'll make you jump into more steinbeck if you haven't yet."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck can go either way. \\"The Pearl\\" was a disgusting waste of time and paper, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" a fabulous, emotional read, and \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" a fascinating book that totally engaged the reader. Where does \\"East of Eden\\" fit on the Steinbeck-o-meter? At the top.Many readers don't like \\"East of Eden\\" because of its length, its higher level of rambling, and just the overall overload. Then again, this is part of the book. \\"East of Eden\\" IS long. Steinbeck DOES ramble quite often here. But then there's the story, the emotion (and occasionally lack of), and the way hundreds of pages flew by that just bring this book up so high.\\"East of Eden\\" starts out with very difference characters than it ends with, and over time we notice the subtle shift. Granted, most of the book revolves around the same few characters, but they're so interesting and have so much personality that it fits well.There are many biblical themes here (Eden, for starters), but it's not exactly the whole story. Mostly, this is almost like a retelling of classic, ancient stories. There's the tale of brother versus brother, a devil (also known as the deceiving woman), and the miracle. But overall, Eden is an incredible read, a wonderful book, and written in an excellent way. Steinbeck has come a long way since \\"The Pearl\\".This is the ultimate Steinbeck. It's the heaviest, the most intense, and probably (in my opinion) the best. There is so much to it, and it's such a rewarding feeling to read it.An excellent book for any reader! I definitely urge you to read it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I had the realization earlier in the year that I missed out on reading a lot of great books while at school. I can't remember the exact reason why I picked up this book but had read that it was John Steinbeck's greatest personal accomplishment. I also saw that it was part of the Oprah's Book Club. [...] all of her books but was curious on why she picked it. I had tried to read Grapes of Wrath several years before but never got through it. I just finished the book this morning and can see why it has such an impact on American Literature.The story begins with the description of the surrounding areas of the Salinas Valley in California and then moves east to start the saga of a young family in Connecticut. It follows the story of a father motivated by the military and the rearing of his two sons. The Sons grow to learn that there father was not what they expected and they have different ideas on how to live their lives. Mixed with the stories of the brothers are the tales of the Wright family. We watch the brothers grow up, move apart and one becomes a father to two more boys and the problems that faced the preceding family are recycled and repeated.As you can tell from the title biblical themes run through the story. Steinbeck takes the story of Cain and Abel and applies it to an American family plagued by sacrifices and the struggles between good and evil. The thought that history and human nature does not predestine us as good or bad seems to be the prevailing thought in this book. There is choice inside of us that we can use to make decisions."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a marvelous opus into which you can really sink your teeth! Of course, I had seen the famous James Dean film version, but had no previous idea of what an expansive, sweeping epic it had been based on--- the book far surpasses the wonderful film. The incredible gift Steinbeck has for storytelling, the classic yet complex characters and the dramatic, original storylines will sweep you up page after page after page.It's especially satisfying to find a juicy read that lasts so long (this edition @ 600 pages) to bring you a fulfilling reading experience you can savor. The author's many pearls of wisdom and insightful spin on the Cain & Abel story will stay with you long after you finish. It's also a fascinating look at the foibles and fortunes of early 20th Century Americans. It's a book to enjoy and to share.I can't believe it took me so long to discover this literary treasure, which quickly leapt to the Top 10 List of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck either writes short, tight novels or long, intense sagas. At over 600 pages, \\"East of Eden\\" is the latter.\\"East of Eden\\" is my new favorite Steinbeck novel. It is the story of two brothers, Adam and Caleb (the Cain and Abel allegory is strong here), their parents and Cathy Ames-one of the most manipulative, unfeeling, unscrupolous, complicated villains I have ever encountered in literature.The novel is long and dense and much of it is \\"the set up\\" for how the rest of the novel plays out. It is such a pleasure to read. There is no author (except perhaps Buck in The Good Earth) who weaves character growth, morality, allegory and geophraphy together so beautifully.Read this book!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If Grapes of Wrath were a song, this would be a tome - much more heavy hearted and densely wraught.

To start, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone must say that this \\"novella\\" is nothing but disgusting bit of nonsense. Joseph Steinbeck should be ashamed of what is perhaps his worst and only attempt at litarature! First off, he's not even Colonial, so his attempt to pass off this offensive story as \\"American Literature\\" offends and harms all in that noble field. Firstly, Joseph \\"One-Eye\\" Steinbeck cheats most horribly at croquet! Secondly, the whole story was nothing but the disgusting sharing of the nuptial bed betwixt two (or, dear reader, sometimes more. I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, kid not!) lusty pimple-faced youths who have not been sanctified in the eyes of Our Maker! This is pornography of the worst kind! Yes Yes. Far worse even than the illegal set of French lithographs that I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, once mistakenly saw in my youth. But I digress.

All of the characters are either male, or perjoratively female with the exception of Abra Bacon, the final female character who's role in the novel is minimal. Although Steinbeck's intent is to reveal the true meaning of life in his modern world by analyzing the biblical tale of Cain and Able, he effectively ends up giving an Episcopal sermon endorsing the male dominant themes of the Bible itself. Too bad he had no knowledge of or respect for women."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It's sad to celebrate the 100th year of Steinbeck, and realize he wasnt that great of a writer. He is a story teller, but not a beautiful writer. East of Eden seems hurredly written, and I kept looking for a beautiful paragraph, a sentence that might make me read it several times. East of Eden was a real disappointment to me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One way to separate a great book from a book that falls far short is to think about whether the characters are realistic and fleshed out. Read War and Peace. Read Brothers Karamazov. Read Remembrance of Things Past. East of Eden has cardboard characters meant to display good and evil for you. I'll give you an example, so you can see where I'm coming from. It doesn't convey my whole feeling that the characters are cardboard but it points you in the right direction.&quot;Abra came in with shining eyes and a red nose from the frosty wind, and she brought such pleasure that Lee giggled softly when he saw her.&quot;Do you mind being manipulated by an author's cliches? I do. The shining eyes of a good child, the red nose of a good child on a frosty morning, you can take your shining eyes and red nose and frosty wind and stick them, along with Lee's delighted giggle.I don't mean to condemn Steinbeck for that one paragraph, which an eighth grader could have written. I mean to bring out that paragraph as an illustration of an overall weakness in the writing. The characters represent good or evil, and they are annoying. All the characters who begin with A (Abra, Adam, Aron) represent Abel, and all the characters who begin with C (Cal, Cathy, Charles) represent Cain. Gee, duh, thank you, that's heavy.It's not that I enjoy trashing well thought of books. It's something else. I resent that the great books are diminished when something like this is complimented. True quality deserves to be separated above stuff like this.Try this one on. One of the characters makes a lot of money in an investment, and ends up burning all the money he has made. Tell me something - how the hell is he going to raise enough money to pay taxes on that realized gain? IRS won't care that he burned the money. They will be coming for their taxes. The author wanted his character to make that annoying, stupid sacrifice, burning lots of money. Well, if the character doesn't care, neither do I. I hope IRS nails him good.I'll tell you where Steinbeck really started to lose me. He played one of those stupid &quot;I know something you don't know&quot; teases on us readers. He had one of the Trask brothers enlist in the army. We expected Cal to do it, but he threw us a clue that it was probably Aron. Then he left us there and changed the subject. Nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa. Steinbeck knows which brother enlisted and we don't, and he's going to make us wait to find out. Isn't that great, brilliant writing. Dust off that old annoying trick. And the reason we don't know is because he didn't tell us what happened in chronological order. He lets us know later that something happened earlier. So our ignorance is his fault, and he's teasing us with it.Thank you, Clifton Fadiman, for not including this book in your Lifetime Reading Plan of the great books. East of Eden is more or less on the level of Sidney Sheldon.

Stieinbeck is the debil!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Actually, I give this powerful book *itself* a four-1/2 star rating. I was captivated by the movie (starring James Dean and Raymond Massey) as a teenager, and quickly thereafter read the book, which is excellent.But -- and this is a big but, almost as big as the caboose of the media-savvy atipose-laden \\"diva\\" hawking this recycled volume -- for the Schlockmistress of all schlockmistresses, Oprah Winfrey, to appropriate this great literary classic and to debase it by affixing her name and its attendant bad taste is beyond the pale.To lump Steinbeck in with the mediocre subliterary pabulum and chick-lit fluff she usually shills for lowers the Nobel-prize winning author to the level of Frau Winfrey's touchy-feely, brain-dead, trash-TV audience.What's next? \\"Dr. Phil's Great Books Series,\\" featuring Carl Jung's \\"The Undiscovered Self\\" as the premiere volume???Please, dear readers, buy *some other* edition, one that doesn't insult the intelligence of readers who didn't need a cheesy gimmick like \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" to get them to pick up a tome."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I felt no empathy for any of the characters and the long, tedious descriptions of the scene were enough to put me to sleep. I found the characters to be unmotivated and I was indifferent to the three families that are the focus of the book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is, in my eyes, Steinbeck's great American saga."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden by John Steinbeck is a classic. Though its plot might be predictable after understanding reading the bible, its style and character development truly merit its great recognition. Every character and its foil are unique in their own way. Most of these characters are exaggerated, therefore they are unrealistic. It is because of this overstatement and overemphasis of the character's specific detail and idiosyncrasy that truly makes this book special. Overall, this book is a great read if you have time on your hands to slowly analyze it.As I read East of Eden, I easily spotted many allusions to the book of Genesis for I had already became familiar with the stories of Cain and Abel when I had read the Bible, thereby enhancing my overall understanding of Steinbeck's allusions. At first, I thought reading the book of Genesis was going to be a hassle, just another book to read; however, it added to my reading comprehension. The book incorporated many references to the story of Cain and Abel, and reading the book of Genesis basically supplied me with enough contexts to understand the essential theme of the book. So, anyone who is planning to read this book should skim over the book of Genesis just for a background and reference.The plot might be rudimentary, but the ideas are thought provoking. After Samuel reads about the story of Cain and Abel, Lee brings light into the situation, establishing the importance of timshel, which is the ability to change one's fate, and in Cal's situation, to either continue wrongdoing or change for the better. The characters literally incorporate the story of Cain and Abel in their discussion to utilize the story as a reference, because of its recurring nature in humanity. As Lee unveils many aspects of the story of Cain and Abel, he concludes many similarities between the bible and the familial relationships. Therefore, Steinbeck incorporates allusions to the story of Cain and Abel to depict its recurring nature and its importance as a reference.As reference to the East of Eden, the story of Cain and Abel becomes essential to the understanding of the recurring theme; however, both characters are not similar, and of the two, Abel undertakes the persona of the wanderer. Like Abel, Adam and Aron both resemble the less volatile of their brothers. However, it is they, who are often sent off to places literally, and involved in intricate conflicts. As Adam marries Cathy, who alludes to the devil, and travels, while trying to deal with his sons, who are hostile to each other. Like Adam, Aron is literally sent off to the military and discovers much, but only to die as a result of Cal's lies.John Steinbeck effectively uses characters to further bring objectivity. In this case, he employs Lee's objective nature to bring in outside information. Lee serves as an objective person, who sheds light to the convoluted and intricate tensions that exist between the characters. His being a Chinese servant further parts him from all the complex tensions. Lee literally talks about the story of Cain and Abel, drawing conclusions to the similar conflicts between the characters, alluding to those of Cain and Abel. He becomes concerned with the ability to change fate, according to timshell, where Cal can actually choose to be good.So go read it, because these books are rare nowadays!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"...in the Salinas River Valley in California. Steinbeck is a master at developing characters so well that you think you actually know them personally half-way through the story. This is the tale of multiple families, from all over the country, who end up in the Salinas Valley. Their reasons for settling there vary from honorable to despicable. Steinbeck's storyline mimics the one of Cain and Abel throught he lives of brothers in the book on the Trask side. There are other families and characters that add a richness to the environment as well, such as the Hamiltons, Abra, and Lee the faithful servant. As you follow the lives of the Hamiltons and Trasks, you can't help but wonder if any of this kind of thing really took place back then. I learned alot about farming and days when automobiles weren't around. It was a great read, and an unexpected surprise."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a classic, but one younger generations of readers might easily overlook.

Even the evilest of characters such as Cathy, can be identified with more then the more moral characters, such as Adam, and, without a doubt, make for a more interesting read. Still, despite issues with characterization, the book pulls you into its world of interweaving stories and one quickly gets lost in trying to sort out the intricacies of relationships and human traits.

It plays on the juxtaposition of naivety and wisdom, truth and faith, struggle and redemption, and most importantly, good and evil. Within the given boundaries of 600 pages, Steinbeck explores the psychological and mental desires of everybody, while also enlightening the readers with a theory on the purpose of life and its attributes.The main storyline follows the vicious cycle of two generations of siblings in the Trask family, while also playing on the biblical reference to the stories of Cain and Abel, and Caleb and Aron. The two set of brothers, who set the stage for the novel, are always in conflict with one another in their desire to gain the love of their fathers. In its exploration of their interaction with the people around them and with their fathers, Steinbeck uses the brothers in order to explain life as the Bible does. He directly calls upon the stories in the vastly popular book in order to expound on God's meaning of life as it pertains to society and how people should view their lives in respect to others. He creates a whole commonalty of characters that help extenuate and expose the interactions of people and their effects. Cathy, another important figure in the book, is Steinbeck's way of placing evil in a light that takes a tangible form. Cathy is one character alone that while she amazes and builds suspense for the reader, she also disgusts and shocks the reader with her cunning ability to manipulate people at the lift of a finger. Her evil genius is solely a product of her desires: to get out of work in dismissing responsibility, to subjugate blame, and gain an enormous control over people. Steinbeck also delves into the meaning of life and how it is defined completely on the ability of choice. He acquaints the readers with the word \\"timshel.\\" Etymologically speaking, the Hebrew word directly translates to \\"thou mayest,\\" which Steinbeck uses to express his viewpoint on choice. He tells the reader that only he has the ability to choose the path of his life, and it is he who can conquer sin and break from past trends.Ultimately, the book brings out the true battle of good and evil as the Bible interprets it, and reveals the true definition of life. As Steinbeck explores the issues that surround life in terms of faith, trust, and love, he creates an unbelievable book, despite its licentiousness, that leaps out of the boundaries delineated by society. The characters, the themes, the story itself, all of it comes together, creating a momentous book by all standards."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden has so much potential to be a book which has more of a satisfactory impact. This book, was at times poorly written, contradictory, confusing, and unfortunately boring. I say the book was poorly written at times because John Steinbeck spent so much time writing this book (several years I believe) and he could not manage to create many characters which interested me. Also, he included too many characters which were not important to the novel and even makes it unclear who the narrator is in the novel. I think the book is somewhat hypocritical because the novel's emphasis on freewill as one of its themes is not expressed through all the characters. Cathy Ames for instance, is condemmned as a devil during the entire course of the novel. How can you claim that freewill exists, and then permanently condemn one of your characters to a satanic status? I think that makes the book boring because it causes the plot to be too predictable, and at some points dry and corny. I am not saying that this book was completely awful though. The three stars I gave were for, the decent character development of Charles, and the insightful amorphisms provided by Lee, the Chinese servant of Adam. Also, Steinbeck's development of Cathy also had its strong points, but overall, I was disappointed at the way many character's dealt with their dilemmas. At times I was left feeling jipped at the outcome, or craving for more than what was provided. Overall, the book has strong themes, and a sufficient plot, but is hindered by its poor organization and mild character development."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This story is excellent despite what other people may say. This novel allowed him to write freely. He didn't have to teach a lesson in this book. This book was mainly for him to let go of his torn past and set a new look on life. He is an amazing story teller. Better than any I have read in my lifetime. Steinbeck uses a lot imagery. He wants the reader to see his home as he saw it. He wanted the common person to be able to understand. This book is EXCELLENT. You have to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have been a Steinbeck fan since last year when I first read, &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot; I have yet to be let down by a Steinbeck novel or short story and I doubt I ever will. East of Eden, was an adventure in sight and a catharsis of character and wisdom."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden is an exemplary story of the battle of humans struggling to make choices. What I liked most about the book was Steinbeck's ability to characterize without favoritism or bias. I enjoyed each character not because s/he was \\"good\\" but because Steinbeck (with the exception of Cathy), made every character a real human, with emotions, good and bad. The balance Steinbeck created amazed me and made the plot exciting and unpredictable. Steinbeck's honesty and frankness helped recreate a story that was real and enjoyable. The lines of humor spread through the book made me smile: I could not put the book down. Furthermore, there were many parts where I noticed Steinbeck's skill as a storyteller, and as I flipped back to previous places in the book, I saw how all the parts were intertwined and weaved together. This is an amazing book; even if you've never liked Steinbeck before, the spiritual and intellectual value will capture and win you."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck truly captures the human innermost desire to choose the path of righteousness and darkness. In this novel, Steinbeck gently parallels the old Biblical story of Cain and Abel while inplicating and imposing his own underlying theme. This theme of humaninty, the choice of good and evil, will cause one to re-evaluate one's own opportunities to choose between the two. This book definately has real-life applications as well as present day relavence. It causes one to reflect on one's own life and perhaps elevate one to a new level of understanding of the world around oneself. Although events in this book may seem unorganized and somewhat random, Steinbeck tactfully organizes and arranges events so that the overall message of the book is still accomplished. The characters in this book are well developed which further adds to the greater effect of the novel. This book is one of the more substantial books that you will ever read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This unique novel places the Old Testament in Salinas Valley in the early 20th century. The book's apeal lies in the combination of alluring characters and pictorial descriptions of the California setting. Powerful displays of human emotions--ranging from unconditional love to hatred--are hallmarks of the characters and key to the insightful value of the book. This wisdom is as compelling as the characters that reveal it--or fail to see it. The characters are a great highlight of the book--Steinbeck leads the reader to feel the same emotions as his characters. This Nobel Prize winning novel promises and entertaining and enlightening read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Yet another powerful classic, East of Eden by John Steinbeck traces the history of the Trask and Hamilton families to their origins in California. Three generations of their stories are told through wonderful prose and imagery from the beginning until the very end.Essentially, East of Eden retells the story of Cain and Abel - a biblical story. But, reader beware, you don't have to be religious to enjoy such an exquisite book. Morals lurk in every corner as Charles faces the arduous task of gaining his father's love, which his brother Adam already has. Relative to our very own lives, you'll find yourself flinching at the destruction caused by Cyrus's unwillingness to accept Charles as his son. His eager acceptance of his other son empowers the book with themes of jealousy and the struggle between good and evil. Steinbeck then manages to push his cyclical themes through into another generation of people - Adam, Aron, and Cal - who seem to share the same problem. However, the plot and evil thicken. A brothel manager named Kate seems to get caught up in the mess as well - her evil; a vice of destruction. Supplemental to the main theme of good vs. evil are hints of other themes such as timshel, and knowledge which will become self evident as the book is read. Steinbecks fascinating ability to animate characters will mesmorize you until the very end. And, surprisingly, there is even room to spare for brilliant quotes and memorable lines.East of Eden is a magnificent story that'll leave you turning the pages until the end, keeping you east of eden, ---- and wishing there was more."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden provides a interesting reading experience and never fails to suprise. The characters are all very complex and change throughout the story. It is about two families, the Trask's and the Hamilton's whose path meet in the Salinas Valley of California. East of Eden also parallels the biblical story of Cain and Abel. The rivalry between Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb directly parallels this story, the only difference being that Aron and Caleb (Adam's children) manage to resolve thier rivalry with each other. Cathy represents the evil character while Adam is the Ultimate good. Adam starts off very naive and gets taken advantage of by Cathy; and not until later does he finally become more aware and sees what Cathy really is. A theme in this novel is the need to be loved. Charles and Caleb, both feel that thier father's do not love them and this creates an extreme jealousy of Adam and Aron respectively."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden is a complex work of art. Through only 600 pages of writing, Steinbeck is able to fully develop each of his few dozen characters. Each person, whether he plays a major or a minor role, fits in the novel perfectly. The most interesting character is undoubtedly, Lee, a Chinese cook. Through Lee and the other characters in this novel, Steinbeck explores the important themes of love, family, trust, identity, and jealousy.Although it is a little lengthy, East of Eden is far from boring. In every chapter, something significant happens and encourages you to read on to learn more. The only drawback is that this novel is entirely based on the Bible and it may be difficult for non-Christians to fully appreciate Steinbeck's allusions to the Book of Genesis."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden, set in the rural areas of America during the early twentieth century, is a captivating novel exploring a person's struggle between what is good and evil. Steinbeck uses biblical references to enhance his ideas about basic human nature. With a foundation based on the story Cain and Abel, Steinbeck goes above and beyond and produces a variety of fully developed characters through his analysis of their outer and inner turmoil. Steinbeck establishes a moral spectrum of good and evil through his characters, and he effectively portrays how a balance good and evil is necessary to maintain order in a society.I found it mesmerizing as the plot would thicken, which it continuously did, and was impressed by Steinbeck's thorough exploration of the mind and heart of an individual. I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is a masterpiece that richly interweaves mesmerizing characters, enduring themes, and human impulses. Steinbeck's style and tone as a writer was what made the book magnificent from the beginning. He is a true storyteller, in his exposition of characters' natures, lacks, and desires. He portrays characters with exploratory truth. Samuel Hamilton is the wise, philosophical idealist who only wants to get a rich drink of life. Cathy, on the other hand, is a being that is not human, and has consequential evil tendencies. Brothers, such as Adam and Charles, and Aron and Cal, go through the endless tales of jealousy, love, and hurt.Steinbeck eloquently explores many themes-perhaps they are the eternal themes of life. He explores the struggle between good and evil, the fight for parental love, and the question of identity. Rather than keeping the scope of the novel narrow, he connects it to the history of the world.I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes being moved by literature. It will stir emotions and stimulate the mind."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Although the novel is full of imagery and situations mimicking the Bible, the book itself does not revolve around these themes. Instead, the story delves deep into the realm of love, death, and relationships between human beings. The distinct characteristics that Steinbeck provides in each person set the stage for an excellent novel. Not only do the characters (such as the moral but foolish Adam Trask, and the evil, sly Cathy Ames) invoke emotion in readers, they also stir the audience to action. After reading the novel, I wanted to personally do something about the unfortunate situations presented.The story starts off describing two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons, across the nation, who later come together via unlikely events. The great friendships between families last forever, until the manipulative Cathy Ames steps into the mix. The friendly looking lady seems cheery on the outside, but what is she really like on the inside? These inner features are what make her a dangerous character, and you need to read the novel to find out what I mean. In addition, sibling rivalry is represented like the scenes from Cain and Abel, and can be seen through Charles and Adam, and Cal and Aron. Although both Charles and Cal are inherently evil, Cal is able to use advice from the family servant, Lee, to fend off his immoral ways.I recommend this book not for a quick skim, but for a lengthy, indulgent read. Paying attention to the subtle details that Steinbeck includes calls for increased enjoyment. East of Eden is a highly entertaining book, while discussing topics that provide stimulation for the mind."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a philosophical investigation into the human mental condition, emphasizing greatly the struggle between good and evil. It explores the complexities of such varied themes as depression, lonesomeness, hate (from Cain and Abel), and of course, love. But one should read this novel with a proverbial &iexcl;grain of salt&iexcl;. Steinbeck will sometimes replace character development with his own analysis, much as a historian would look upon past events. For example, he begins a paragraph with &iexcl;When I said Cathy was a monster&iexcl;.&iexcl; To the reader, this may be an emotional anticlimax to the plot; it gives the tales a feeling of redundancy. Why not let the stories speak for themselves? It may be that Steinbeck is teaching us something with this novel, something important, something life changing C Timshel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It has been twenty or, sadly, maybe thirty years ago since I've read a Steinbeck. A couple of books that I passed on at that time were 'East of Eden' and 'The Grapes of Wrath'. In 'East of Eden' Steinbeck still amazes me with the depth of his characters, and the intricasies of their relationships with each other. If an award was given for 'best supporting character', I would vote for Samuel Hamilton! His simple joy of life and home-spun wisdom are an interesting contrast with the chronically, evil Kate. This book will stay with anyone who reads it for a long time. 'The Grapes of Wrath' will be next for me - I know that I will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a wonderful story. I could not put this book down. It is so hard to rate books for me because so many I have been reading are so great. But I recommend this one.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; years ago. Loved it and watch the movie every chance I get, but for some reason I never read any more Steinbeck. &quot;Cannery Row&quot; is a favorite movie of mine also and when a friend suggested that I read &quot;East of Eden&quot;..I thought, &quot;why not?&quot; Of course, I had seen the movie and always felt that it was a downer (I don't partucularly like James Dean). Well, I read East of Eden..and loved it and will be reading the other works by Steinbeck. Upon reflection, I now feel that James Dean was the perfect actor for the part. I was sad to finish the book, because it will be a while before I have such a friend to pick up and escape into again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Not being a Steinbeck fan, I expected to be bored with the novel, but the language which Steinbeck utilizes along with the stunning portrayl of the characters enthralled me. There are so many stunning elements to the novel; the classic struggle between good and evil, the realization that no one's fate is predetermined and that every one has to decide what path to take in life. I thought it particularly interesting to see the use of allusion with the Cain and Abel story and the Alice in Wonderland story. This is a must read for everyone. I can't imagine anyone not loving this novel as much as I do."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one of the best books ever!! It tackles questions and problems that are immortal-- love of family, fate and free will, and the general path of growing older. &quot;...the word timshel--'Thou mayest'--that gives a choice.

I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who has the time to read it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read &quot;Of Mice &amp; Men&quot; while in school. It was one of the first books I was 'forced' to read in school that I blew through! I have been a Steinbeck fan ever since. While I enjoyed his most famous work, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, I feel it pales in comparison to &quot;East of Eden&quot;. I recently found out that it is a very autobiographical story, which perhaps is why is comes across so powerfully. Simply one damned amazing book!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the only book that I can finish reading and immediately start again at the beginning without being bored. The story of Cain and Abel is completely engaging told first as a rivalry between Adam and Charles and then between Cal and Aron; and the Hamilton family is a fascinating fictionalization of Steinbeck's own family history."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is an exquisite book which masterfully tackles the difficult topics of love and loyalty in the family, while also embodying the spirit of American adventure and independence. Steinbeck brilliantly utilizes the biblical Cain and Able story to metephorically elaborate on the complex relationship between the brothers depicted in the novel. It is definately worth the time put into completing it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Stienbeck creates an American masterpiece unparelled before or since. This cinematically written book uses several Biblical references, while presenting an exciting and in depth saga of an pioneering American family. Members of the family are based on Old Testament characters and their lives read like parables for contemporary America. Many of these characters have become the archetypes for a new generation of storytellers. Don't see the movie (except for James Dean) or the TV mini-series -- both of which are painfully abridged -- until you read this contemporary American classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When it comes to deep and inspirational, John Steinbeck has competitors beat. His motivational piece East of Eden is thought provoking and very rousing. Exceptional in both its meaning, purpose, and its writing, East of Eden should be on everyone's reading list.Basing his story on the biblical story of Cain and Abel, John Steinbeck provides a deep, insightful view into the argument of fate versus free will. With many insights, Steinbeck introduces a notion that motivates people to take control of their fate. This novel showed me that we are not restrained or confined to the limits our predecessors have left behind. People are in control of their own lives and can choose to change and become successful. Steinbeck's theme is broad, but works for many aspects in life. This book is essentially John Steinbeck's view on human society. Each character in the story represents some facet of humanity. Whether it be good and evil, or jealousy and love, Steinbeck provides an interesting plot to surmise the interactions and battles of these varying characteristics.With heavy influences from the bible, one drawback is that the reader should be very familiar with biblical stories; otherwise many themes can be overlooked. By just looking at the title, East of Eden is a sort of epilogue of Genesis. East of Eden's themes and storyline can be confusing if not even understandable if the reader has no information background on the bible. I highly recommend reading or at like skimming the bible before reading this book.His writing is entertaining, not hard to read or understand. The plot has its share of twists and turns, making this story not too boring. Diction is not elevated so there is no worry in misunderstanding the text. Overall, this is a great book that can teach important life lessons. Highly motivational and a great read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden is truly a work of art, blending history and Biblical allusions into a masterpiece. The story is set in Salinas Valley, California, and follows the journey of the Trasks and the Hamiltons, two families whose fates intermingle in a beautiful and devastating relationship. The characters each find his or her own path in life and inevitably meet one another, impacting each character's life in the most profound and unique way. Throughout the novel, Steinbeck touches on powerful themes, including fate versus freewill and the search for one's true identity as well as the complications and consequences of both requited and unrequited love.The novel is separated into three sections, each an interesting story that reveals a part of the characters' lives. The stories overlap, as characters grow older or pass away between sections. Relationships are renewed, broken, or newly established. As the plot progresses, the characters become involved in more than one story, creating a complicated yet beautifully woven story.Each character on his or her own contributes part of his or her life to the ever-growing plot. From the secretive Cal and the lovable Aron to the murderous and vengeful Cathy, each character presents a different personality, either fitting or contrasting with other characters. The reader can sympathize with Cal, who is jealous of his good-natured brother Aron and wishes to be accepted as much as his sibling. The reader can relate to the boys' experiences, innocent young children who grow up and commit sins and lose their childish naivet&eacute;. Referring to the story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck elevates the story of these two brothers to Biblical proportions, setting the foundation of behavior and emotions that every person goes through. The effect of Steinbeck's allusions is that the reader applies the story to his or her own life, making chilling discoveries on how similar people are, no matter the difference in character. The relationships between these unique individuals of the novel have such a powerful impact on their lives that the reader is forced to stop and wonder at the ways people are affected and altered, regardless of the size of the change.Steinbeck's masterpiece reveals to the reader the way people touch each other's lives and the impact of these changes through the intricate relationships between his characters. East of Eden is at once both powerful and mesmerizing, a literary journey that captures the audience's heart and leaves the reader deep in thought long after completing the book. East of Eden is highly recommended, not only as a beautiful work of art to cherish but also as a guide to self-discovery."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is an epic, powerful book of hope, despair, suffering and permission for humanity to fulfill it's potential. This may sound dramatic but East of Eden is one of the most thoughtful books I have ever read. The level of depth that is so subtly put into the book has a profound impact on the reader: the idiosyncraties of life, which we so often take for being individual to ourselves are really vividly shown to be universal. The book isn't so much a novel but a treatise on human nature and a philosophy for life. This is a big claim so I'll try and justify it. But really, this is a book that needs to be experienced rather than read so any review is only a shallow representation.It takes a novelist of Steinbeck's skill to pull the deep philosophising off in a non-condensending or patronising manner. Yet, he handles the book beautifully, the philosophy comes from two very strong and intriging characters, Samuel and Lee, both outsiders beloved by those close to them who are able to advise the other characters and, by proxy, the reader too. Through these characters' strong voices, the other actors are guided through their lives, the stregth of hope that they give out is the difference between life and death for some characters. The ideas of the book are obvious when read but stay with the reader and offer a simple approach to a lives beset by complications - put simply, you may do what you want in life, you learn for yourself and although help and strength may be offered by other people, ultimately you are responsible for your own life. And for whether you are satisfied when death takes you.The book is strong in many areas, such as the depth of knowledge gained about American history and the American psyche, the deep love shown to its people and the strong, interesting characters, shown extra love in their crafting because many are based on Steinbeck's own family. However the level of detail in the book slows down the narrative tremendously: this isn't a novel that can be rushed through without missing the crux of the book; the contemplative tone means that it will always be a slow read. The plot is also quite simplistic and easily predictable. It could be reduced to a few lines but in doing so the fine details and love that is so apparent in the book would be lost. The plot is secondary to the environment, characters and, above all, to the ideas of the book.If this type of book sounds intriging to you, please buy or borrow it quickly, as it will be a book that you won't forget for a long time and offers the reader a lot. Despite the heaviness of the topics and some of the vindictiveness shown by some characters, the book leaves the reader in hope rather than despair by the end. Even if it doesn't sound appealing and the size of the book puts you off you should try this book. It is a rare masterpiece and one which will be as relevant in 100 years as it is now with much wisdom on offer to any reader, regardless of their world experiences."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The main thing that makes Steinbeck great to read is that he's actually wise, he has genuine insights to impart to his readers. In this book, he often \\"tells\\" instead of \\"shows,\\" which is supposed to be bad writing technique, but it works for Steinbeck because what he has to tell is so interesting and thought provoking, and because he tells it so well. His characters are beautifully and lovingly sculpted, even his \\"monster\\".Before I read it, I had reservations. I was worried it would be too long. This was not a problem, because Steinbeck's writing is so good, and I was sucked in quite early in the book. I've read much shorter books which were much more laborious to read.I was also worried it would be too dreary--after all, a \\"modern re-telling of Cain and Abel\\" is clearly going to be tragic. I had also heard that the book is humorless. And, it is true, a lot of his other work displays a lightness of touch, a subtle sense of humor, even when dealing with big, harrowing stories. (After all, there were even passages in the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" that made me laugh out loud.) This book mostly lacks that light touch. What he does still display here is a humane-ness, he seems to me to be non-judgemental in his treatment of most of his characters, even as he shows them being \\"sneaky\\" or \\"mean\\". And I suppose that may be the thing I liked best about the book, the humane way he treats his characters, while putting them through the choreography of a compelling, moving story. This is not one of those epics about which you say to yourself, \\"Wow, I'm so proud that I was able to slog through that enormous, diffficult thing.\\" Even though it's not a pretty story, this is a big, easy read, with all the \\"epic\\" characteristics the other reviewers talk about. Good stuff."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book describes suffering fleshed out. This book tears apart the meaning of humanity, and leaves the meaning of the world to rest on individual shoulders of toliling men and women. This book slaps you in the face and ignores social behaviors that say, \\"privacy, please!\\" This book is, very possibly, THE BEST.Only in darkness does mankind duel with their bare toughness. Only in darkness does manking face reality - one that says, \\"who is with you? Look into heaven! Who do you see there?\\" The soul squirms. \\"Tell me the truth!!!\\" screeches nothingness, and suddenly man looks into the blank twinking of the heavens, and sees NOTHING.Light depends on love. The love of God allowed man to be able to come back to \\"live with him\\" happily for all eternity. We are to sacrifice ourselves to him; no questions asked. He loves us - why should we not love him? The weight of pleasant, painless joy depends on existence of something compassionate in heaven. But, strip it all away. Feel the blows of the cautious parental hand, the constraints of truth, the pressures of life. Feel the pains in happiness, the perverseness in striving for perfection. Look at the dark side to find a truth that will kill you, for in blackness there is no such thing as heaven or hell.

I am usually a slower reader, but completed the 600 pages in less than a week. Steinbeck's prose is enchanting. The characters, particularly Sam Hamilton and Lee are entirely believable.The message of \\"thou mayest\\" is timeless and profound. For Steinbeck to find this essential truth buried in one of the oldest and most commonly known stories in the western world is remarkable. Steinbeck's insight that is so valuable because it names an essential mindset that provides enormous leverage in the battle to find your voice. You will be better off for reading this book.I aspire to teach this novel in class someday."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I had this book sitting on my shelf for a year before I finally could give the book the attention that it deserved. Once I started, I became engrossed. When I finished, I finished in a flurry, devouring the last 400 pages in about four days.The themes are universal. The storylines are familiar to most Westerners. The story unfolds patiently and deliberately. The characters are mostly set in opposition (traitwise) of each other for purposes of showing contrasting approaches to life.I did find a dry humor occasionally in the book. I did find the book to be universal not only in human conflict but also its timeless in its observations, especially about how the 'now' different from the 'good old days' or in its comments of how generalists have little future.I did enjoy some subtleties in the writing at times. For instance when writing Joe's (a minor character who worked for Kate), Steinbeck used very simple words and short sentences to illustrate the unsophisticated nature of the thoughts. This made the sentences read quickly and served to highlight how shallow the internal monologue really was. After all, if deep thoughts require complex sentences and expert word usage, how does one convey simple thoughts?This is one of the best novels that I have read, perhaps the best (not necessarily my favorite) novel that I have read from an American author."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the colorful three-generation saga of an American family (the Trasks) embroiled in their emotional, ever-so-human contest with the moral forces of good and evil. Set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the story follows Cyrus Trask, his sons Adam and Charles, and Adam's sons Aron and Caleb, through their eventful, changing, sometimes violent lives, sweeping from a farm in Connecticut to Steinbeck's home in the Salinas Valley of California. As the novel unfolds, we meet personifications of \\"good\\" in the character of Samuel Hamilton, Adam's kind-hearted neighbor whose nine children help fill out the story, and \\"evil\\" as represented particularly by Kate, Adam's malicious wife who fittingly comes to run a local whorehouse.Steinbeck provides us with what is presumably his own interpretation of the Bible's Cain and Abel story through the guiding, balanced commentary of an unexpectedly erudite Mr. Lee, Adam's American-born Chinese servant. In the Bible, Cain, angered by God's rejection, kills his brother, Abel, and suffers lifelong guilt from his misplaced revenge. For Steinbeck, man (we are all Cain's descendants) is neither predestined (thou shalt) nor commanded (do thou) to rise above sin; rather, the individual has freedom of choice (thou mayest). Importantly, through individual choice, each person is free to direct his own life to attain true glory and the triumph of the human spirit. Ultimately, when a person dies, he is judged not by his wealth, influence and power, but by the answer to a simple question: Was he good or evil, loved or hated?In my opinion, the noticeable flaw in this otherwise exceptional work is Steinbeck's deliberate placement of his characters into a Cain and Abel framework, with Charles and Caleb being troubled Cain, and Adam and Aron the fairer Abel. The book reads as if Steinbeck first decided on the philosophical theme for the work and then applied his adroit literary hand to build interesting, absorbing characters to fit the mold. I believe that the novel could have become an even grander work of literature if Steinbeck had more naturally allowed his striking talent for rich character development to enjoy a still larger role, while relegating the Cain and Abel theme to a more subtle, purely motivational position."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is easily one of Steinbeck's best novels (and that's saying something considering how many great books he's wrote). The novel itself is an allegory following the Biblical accounts about the fall of man in the garden of Eden and Cain and Abel set in rural California. Although the book is quite long, its a fast and easy read. The only problem I had with the book is that Steinbeck, at times, tends to make the themes (free will vs. destiny) and the allegory a bit overly-obvious. But this is a minor point and its a great book (Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize shortly after this novel). I would highly recommend it and am glad that Oprah has brought this book out of the required reading lists for high school english and back into the public eye."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have become dismayed at the popular books out today. The writing is predictable, shallow, and not very challenging. I've decided to go back to the classics and East of Eden was first on my list, thanks to Oprah. I found Steinbeck's writing style intriguing....specifically how he uses time/action lapses where everything isn't spelled out in black and white....you have to think, recall, use your imagination to fill in the gaps. I do have a question for someone: What was the significance of the word Timshel? I remember it mentioned in the story but haven't been able to locate it to refresh my memory.

I personally prefer Steinbeck's earlier works, such as \\"Cannery Row,\\" \\"Sweet Thursday,\\" and \\"Tortilla Flat,\\" but found that \\"East of Eden\\" was worth the time to become reacquainted with this masterful author.But this novel is lengthy at 600 pages. It's also complicated, multi-faceted, and requires patience and understanding to get through. You can read a lot into the story as an analysis of dysfunctional family life, or enjoy it for the incredible, intelligent piece of fiction that it is. Either way, it is well worth the journey."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Most people will never read \\"East of Eden\\". If they want to find out why John Steinbeck is celebrated as an American icon of the literary world they'll usually pick up something a little less daunting like \\"The Pearl\\", \\"Tortilla Flat\\" or one of his other smaller books. Even if they are willing to spend time on one of his more epic works, they usually turn to \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". That is a shame, not because his other works are great; they certainly are that, but because \\"East of Eden\\" is a masterpiece that tackles the age old issue of the dual nature of man in a manner that we can all related to.Where books like \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" and \\"Crime and Punishment\\", tackling the same issue, are weighty and hard to navigate (Don't get me wrong, they are worth the effort), \\"East of Eden\\" is engrossing and captivating. Using the story of Cain and Abel in Genesis not only as part of the story but as the basis for his characters Aaron and Caleb (Their father's name is Adam), Steinbeck explores the balance between wanting to do good and doing evil as well as the motivations behind them redefining them to make us look at both in a new light.Cain, in the Bible, takes on a new life and I found myself able to understand better why he did what he did and oddly enough, relating to him. While I've never killed my brother (There are certainly times I wanted to!), I can understand the feelings of rejection he had that brought him to that place and, after all, I think that this is part of the reason it's in the Bible, not so that we can set ourselves above him but rather understand that the nature of Cain is in all of us and that God loves us in spite of it (Cain, after all, was protected by God. The \\"mark of Cain\\" wasn't to brand him a killer but rather to mark him as a man protected by God).Steinbeck does, at times, ramble; the book is, granted, a daunting one but it is also a classic for a reason. Someone once said \\"We read to know that we are not alone\\" and I couldn't agree more. There is a quote that I had stenciled on the wall of my study where my 3,000 volumes (and growing)reside which reads \\"The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them.\\" It is attributed to Mark Twain but it's questionable whether it came from him or not. Either way, it's true. If you are not illiterate (you wouldn't be able to read this if you were) than count yourself one of the blessed and fortunate, then, go one step further and pick up \\"East of Eden\\" and read a book that is not only a \\"good book\\" but a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have to admit, when I felt the length of the novel weighing in my hands as i picked it up from the bookstore, I was a bit intimidated by what I could expect. I knew that East of Eden is probably one of the most renowned and famous piece of American literature of all time, but nevertheless, I was pessimistic when I began reading. However, that soon changed when I began to realize the brilliancy of the novel and recognized the masterpiece that it really is. This novel is truly one in a million.The story is set in Salinas, California, where Steinbeck himself grew up, and follows two generations of the Trask family, the main one with Adam and his sons, Aron and Cal. The characters of Aron and Cal are purposeful allusions to the biblical story of Cain and Abel, and Steinbeck parallels them with great success. Not only does he follow the storyline, but Steinbeck is one of the few authors that is able to dig deep into the human soul and come out with something truly revolutionary: their inner-most vulnerability. His brilliant portrayal of these characters make them almost life-like, and in some ways, by spilling out their souls for me to see, I felt somewhat connected to them, and was able to share in their triumphs and falters, joys and miseries. Steinbeck so expertly integrates the story of Cain and Abel, a son crying out for a father's love, and the sibling rivalry that reins over it. This book has what every reader wants, wit, humor, perspective, and insight, all brilliantly tied together by the classic tale of two brothers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is truly a novel of unfound proportions. It plays on the juxtaposition of naivety and wisdom, truth and faith, struggle and redemption, and most importantly, good and evil. Within the given boundaries of 600 pages, Steinbeck explores the psychological and mental desires of everybody, while also enlightening the readers with a theory on the purpose of life and its attributes.The main storyline follows the vicious cycle of two generations of siblings in the Trask family, while also playing on the biblical reference to the stories of Cain and Abel, and Caleb and Aron. The two set of brothers, who set the stage for the novel, are always in conflict with one another in their desire to gain the love of their fathers. In its exploration of their interaction with the people around them and with their fathers, Steinbeck uses the brothers in order to explain life as the Bible does. He directly calls upon the stories in the vastly popular book in order to expound on God's meaning of life as it pertains to society and how people should view their lives in respect to others. He creates a whole commonalty of characters that help extenuate and expose the interactions of people and their effects. Cathy, another important figure in the book, is Steinbeck's way of placing evil in a light that takes a tangible form. Cathy is one character alone that while she amazes and builds suspense for the reader, she also disgusts and shocks the reader with her cunning ability to manipulate people at the lift of a finger. Her evil genius is solely a product of her desires: to get out of work in dismissing responsibility, to subjugate blame, and gain an enormous control over people. Steinbeck also delves into the meaning of life and how it is defined completely on the ability of choice. He acquaints the readers with the word \\"timshel.\\" Etymologically speaking, the Hebrew word directly translates to \\"thou mayest,\\" which Steinbeck uses to express his viewpoint on choice. He tells the reader that only he has the ability to choose the path of his life, and it is he who can conquer sin and break from past trends.Ultimately, the book brings out the true battle of good and evil as the Bible interprets it, and reveals the true definition of life. As Steinbeck explores the issues that surround life in terms of faith, trust, and love, he creates an unbelievable book, despite its licentiousness, that leaps out of the boundaries delineated by society. The characters, the themes, the story itself, all of it comes together, creating a momentous book by all standards."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"After the slaying of his brother, the biblical Cain dwelt in the land \\"east of Eden,\\" protected from the wrath of men by the divine mark placed upon him but vulnerable to his own sense of guilt and its consequence, a forlorn and hateful existence. Does Cain still have the choice of salvation through self-determination or is he foredoomed to damnation?The answer to this question is crucial to the characters in Steinbeck's novel, where parallels to Cain and his brother, Abel, are abundant. Predestination or self-determination? Both philosophies come to bear on the characters in this story. We see the unrelenting descent into sin and depravity by the child Catherine as her cold and calculating acts become ever more heinous and she devolves from the girl Cathy into the woman Kate, the madam of a house of sadism. At the end, Kate frightens herself into suicide, which, by the way, is one of Steinbeck's powerful ironies inasmuch as the person whom Kate fears is, unbeknownst to her, already dead.Of all the persons whom we meet in this novel, Kate alone seems to have no hope of salvation, and this hardly seems fair for she alone seems to have had no choice. She alone appears predestined to damnation. She alone feels no remorse, no guilt, indeed nothing at all. She alone is utterly cold and empty of human emotion. She is preternaturally evil, and she seems to have been born thus. Is she, then, the counterpart of the biblical Eve, whose act of disobedience was so unforgivably heinous that not only she but all of her progeny were driven from the Garden of Eden into a dark, painful world and made to suffer for her Original Sin for as long as mankind shall exist? (We must accept Christian mythology here for sake of discussion.)As the biblical Eve was the consort of the biblical Adam, and the dam of Cain and Abel, so Kate begets Caleb and Aron, who are raised as the sons of her husband, Adam Trask. The fact that Adam's brother Charles was the biological father adds even more to the ponderous weight of sin that courses through the novel. Can the generations ever be freed of spiritual darkness? The answer lies in Timshel, the Hebrew verb meaning, according to the Oriental servant and philosopher Lee, \\"thou mayest,\\" a translation different from that commonly accepted in the King James Version of the Bible.Lee suggests that God continues to give man a choice, free will to work toward repentance and salvation or toward sin and damnation. \\"Thou mayest\\" follow the course that thou will. Caleb, even though he feels that he is mean and ugly and that his actions led to Aron's death, hence making him a murderer as surely as Cain was a murderer, may nevertheless prove to be the turning point and achieve salvation. If he manages this, it will be through the influence and aid of Abra, and her presence in the story saves Steinbeck from being labeled a misogynist, to which his portrayal of Kate would surely have led. Still, the turning point lies in the future beyond the end of the novel, and Steinbeck does not tell us whether or not Cal succeeds. Abra's name inevitably reminds me of that of Abraham, too; are she and Cal destined to be the founders of future \\"saved\\" generations?These are only a few of the major themes that weave through this work. We could also explore the fatal flaw shared by Adam and his son Aron, their failure to see reality and their insistence of living in a world that is as insubstantial as their nave dreams. Thus do they contribute to their own destruction. We could examine more of the ironies of life that permeate this novel, as they do all of Steinbeck's creations. Suffice it to say that EAST OF EDEN is full of both interest and meaning, for it speaks to the essential question of mankind's spiritual salvation, a question that has resulted in tremendous schisms among theologians, and it speaks to this question through a constantly evolving plot that captures the reader's interest immediately and pulls him through the novel without pity!This book probably belongs on the \\"must-read\\" list of American novels, and I commend it and its message to every literate adult (and precocious teenager) who possesses the will and the courage to examine the most basic of human choices and who is willing to decide for himself how to translate \\"Timshel.\\" However, there is a prerequisite reading assignment. Before starting EAST OF EDEN, do read at least Chapters 3 and 4 from the Book of Genesis. They're short, but without some knowledge of them, the reader will miss the point that Steinbeck so intriguingly makes."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I've always wanted to read more classical literature but I just didn't know where to begin. Bad memories of high school English class haunted me into my adulthood and limited my reading. Therefore I was very enthusiastic when Oprah's announced the idea of her new book club focusing on the classics. I thank her for giving me a means to read books that have stood the test of time. I believe EAST OF EDEN was a wonderful first selection as its plot is great in depth and scope. Primarily set in the early 20th century (beginning during The Civil War and ending with World War I), this book follows the life of Adam Trask as he finds his own Eden in the Salinas Valley of California. The characters are three-dimensional and believable. The most comprehensive is Cathy, Adam's wife with a very dark soul and is full of evil and hate. I have certainly never met a character like her before. Also unforgettable is Lee, Adam's Chinese-American servant who always managed to add much great philosophical insights into the events unfolding in the Trask household. In addition to the excellent character development Steinbeck included social commentaries on the founding of the West. I believe he did a very good job of balancing the good and the bad of Western expansion, particularly in regards to racial issues. I also appreciated Steinbeck's method of writing himself into the story as the narrator and even using his real name that is indeed rare. I didn't rush through this book as I would normally do but rather savored each chapter, however small or big. It has been a long time since I have read a book that has captured me like EAST OF EDEN has. This book will reside in a special place on my bookcase further enabling me to enjoy it for year to come. Bravo!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" is a truly wonderful story in which explores the meaning behind evil and good and contains incredible character psychology. The main storyline of this book follows the inevitable cycle of two generations of brothers in the Trask family to live out the classic Cain and Abel story. Two brothers live in conflict as one receives love from a father figure while the other does not. It is interesting alone to watch how each brother progresses in his character so that the generation flaws will be repeated. The story alone is well written, but it is the characters that truly drive the storyline. Throughout the whole novel, I find myself trying to find out why a certain character does the things they do, pondering upon their psychology. The character of Cathy is definitely one that will keep you on your seat. Cathy is a character in which has no sense of goodness within her and has the power to manipulate people to her will. Throughout the story, I find myself completely attached to the book just to find out more about Cathy so that I could analyze her behavior. When I thought I understood her character, she would do something that would change my whole view of her. Her character becomes even more complex as it is intertwined with Biblical references as well. The characters all are complex and as deep as Cathy. I do have to admit that the characters initially seemed odd in the first third of the book. Cathy uses her \\"body\\" to get her way and Adam, Cathy's husband, is completely oblivious to everything around him, but the characters eventually grown on the reader. Each of the characters explores the different parts of human psychology. One characteristic that becomes familiar is the damage of broken families on children. One character develops a fake imaginary world in order to cope with the fact that his mother was no longer with him. The depth of characters is so great that you will find yourself reading on just to find out more information on the characters.The characters are great but also the theme of good and evil also plays a major part in the story's greatness. This story questions the actual what good and evil are. It truly makes the readers think about the good and evil in their lives, whether the book is right or not. With the good and evil theme, the option of choice comes into play. The reader will grow familiar with the word \\"timshel\\". This is the Jewish word relating to the choice of mankind. \\"East of Eden\\" specifically refers to the Biblical wording of the Adam and Eve story. In the original manuscripts of the Bible, God actually said mankind \\"mayest\\" conquer over sin rather than the common belief that mankind will conquer sin. It puts the choice of man to whether or not conquer sin. In the story, the character of Cal has to choose whether he will follow the path of his mother sin or to live his own life. Cal believes that the sins of his mother have passed on to him. All this and more are contained in the book \\"East of Eden\\". The philosophy will keep you thinking about not only the story's characters, but also your own life.\\"East of Eden\\" is an entertaining story about the story of Cain of Abel being repeated through generations of brothers. However, its main strength is the fact that it makes the reader think. Whether it be about the character psychology or the philosophy of the book, the reader will be captivated by the complexity of the book. Though the concepts may be complex, the characters are used in a way in which they will embody such concepts. In this way, the concepts become as clear as daylight to any reader. Overall, this book is great for those who like to be intrigued and to follow growth of individual characters."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The greatest novel which I have ever had the priveledge and delight to read. God bless John Steinbeck, or better yet, John Steinbeck bless himself for having the capacity (and choice) to choose such a frotuitous career, which yielded the most sophisticated and human epics penned by any American authors hitherto.East of Eden is the finest of Steinbeck's novels, and the way that Eden and the Fall have been oriented into the story of the Trask and Hamilton families puts a whole new light on existence itself. What is man? Is man a species who is predestined by original sin to carry a guilt within them, and upon every meditation to yield that guilt into their disposition? Or is man a self-governing being who can make the choice to tear the mask of guilt off of his face and conquer his own destiny?To attempt to throw you headlong into a preview/summary of the novel is not my intent in this review, but to forebode a mission into the heart of American literatures finest accomplishment.This is the type of book which you close and stare at for 20 minutes upon finishing, and then procede to take a majestic walk through a park, or better yet a bad part of the neighbourhood, and brood over the lessons you have just learned about man, the universe, and the meaning of life itself.In sum; read the book.Thou mayest."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Read the other reviews for plot synopsis and lit crit. The reason for the three-star review: Oprah's Book Club edition (and this probably applies to the Centennial edition as well) of Steinbeck's epic masterpiece has been bespoiled by sloppy proofreading. Riddled with typos and spelling mistakes galore, this edition is frustrating to read. I typically don't buy anything with Oprah's name on it, but this tome was available used for only three bucks on Amazon, so what the heck. Penguin is one of the premier publishers of classic literature, and I am heartbroken that Penguin chose to print something so rife with errors. What disrespect to Steinbeck's genius."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck is one of the greatest North American writers ever. With his work he was to create a huge portrait of the life in the first half of the 20th Century in United States of America. &#65533;East of Eden&#65533; is among his masterpieces, in which he is capable of bringing to life real and vivid characters, influenced by their habitat.The novel follows the life of a family, concentrating on its two offspring since before their birth. Steinbeck also inserted his own family and himself in the book as minor characters and this device sort of gives him authority to talk about the events and people.Not many writers were able to draw such a convincing portrait of such people. By choosing the right words and building the right sentences, the author gave depth and beauty to his novel, so filled with descriptions.&#65533;East of Eden&#65533; has survived for decades and praised as one of the most perfect North American novels ever. All this due to Steinbeck geniality. Despite his labored prose this book is not difficult to read and understand. Its reading flows easily and from the beginning the story captures one&#65533;s attention.Nevertheless &#65533;East of Eden&#65533; is not for everyone. Many readers may not connect with the prose and the story. People who usually read contemporary fiction with dubious quality should stay away from any Steinbeck&#65533;s novel, and not to &#65533;read&#65533; it only to appear to be highbrow."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A classic in ever sense of the word. A bit biography and a bit cathartic release, this novel is fantastic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden goes back in time to describe what life was like in the early 20th century for people in the U.S., more specifically California's Salinas Valley. Steinbecks' novel however goes a lot farther than just describing life for a specific group of people; his novel is an absorbing yet often times disturbing telling of life itself. The novel is loaded with numerous significant themes including love, good vs. evil, and jealousy. In his book, Steinbeck makes several allusions to the biblical story of Cain and Abel (hence where the title comes from) and even models their tale in his own character's actions. In two different situations in the novel, two brothers find themselves fighting each other for the approval of their father. Ironically however, both times, their father end up loving the son whom does not really desire nor covet their father's approval. In both instances, jealousy plays a major role in their actions that followed. The classic battle between good vs. evil finds itself time and time again in Steinbeck's characters. Steinbeck however, chooses to emphasize his belief that good and evil are both inherent parts of society, and that the main battle is the character's CHOICE of good or evil. Steinbeck's last and probably most enduring theme are the effects of love and the consequences of its absence. Every significant conflict in the story finds itself in the middle of a struggle between characters for the love or appreciation of another. Whenever love is absent from a specific situation, the results become disastrous. In East of Eden, Steinbeck emphasizes the importance of the presence of love in the lives of all people and its powerful role in every outcome. Perhaps my main problem with this book is its organization. Steinbeck seems to jump from one story to another, losing the reader through confusion. Many stories seem to be brought up out of nowhere and end up having no real weight in the novel's \\"big picture.\\" In the end however, the book is an excellent read as well as an intriguing look into life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's heart-fulfilling allegory to the biblical story of Cain and Abel demonstrates the qualities and emotions of what it is to be human. The tension, jealousy, and agony are portrayed through characters who make up the entire spectrum of human characteristics. It is a tale of the emotional drama that persists within a family will leave readers engaged. East of Eden will take the reader on an emotional journey because it provokes thought and opinion, making it a piece hard to put down. The language of the novel is like an art which gives literal subjects an unique meaning and interpretation. Each character shows a part of human nature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden provides a interesting reading experience and never fails to suprise. The characters are all very complex and change throughout the story. It is about two families, the Trask's and the Hamilton's whose path meet in the Salinas Valley of California. East of Eden also parallels the biblical story of Cain and Abel. The rivalry between Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb directly parallels this story, the only difference being that Aron and Caleb (Adam's children) manage to resolve thier rivalry with each other. Cathy represents the evil character while Adam is the Ultimate good. Adam starts off very naive and gets taken advantage of by Cathy; and not until later does he finally become more aware and sees what Cathy really is. A theme in this novel is the need to be loved. Charles and Caleb, both feel that thier father's do not love them and this creates an extreme jealousy of Adam and Aron respectively."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden is a captivating novel that uses many interesting devices that make it one of the classics of literature. The text is sophisticated and descriptive without being overburdened by wordiness. The author's tone, message, and intent are clearly conveyed through the simple, easy-to-understand words so there is less room for misinterpretation. The plot continues to evolve throughout the book as interesting characters are intertwined in this story of love vs. hate, good vs. evil, and reality vs. dreams. Even though he uses such common cliches as his main themes, Steinbeck effectively depicts each point through two generations of two different families--the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The characters are so diverse that every reader can feel a common relation or similarity. Set in California at the time period between the Civil War and WWII, Steinbeck depicted the American's typical values or beliefs pertaining to home and to war at the time. This book is also known for its biblical parallel of Cain and Abel to the Trask brothers in the age-old story of sibling rivalry. Neither an unrealistic fantasy where all goes well nor a depressing account on the bleakness of life, the East of Eden offers a balance which tries to the depict the many sides of life without giving it a false generalization."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden, written by John Steinbeck, takes the reader back to the early 1900's, when horses were being replaced by automobiles and California still had open, fertile land for beans. The competitive relationship between twin brothers follows the story of \\"Cain and Abel\\", but is easily followed by a reader who is not Christian.I recomend this book for the teenage readers. Although filled with numerous chapters, the book reads easily. With an intricate plot and characters whose secrets are slowly unraveled, Steinbeck creates a novel full of characters with complex emotions, motives and relationships. Although rarely a dull moment exists for the Trask family and their companions, the book encompasses so many characters that it takes some getting used to Steinbeck's ever-changing focus in the chapters. The book often introduces an under-developed character who dies, unfortunately, directly after the reader has formed an attachment to him.I would not say that this book should become a part of your permanent library, but it deserves consideration. John Steinbeck is a creative writer and easily displays this in East of Eden."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"While I did find this novel enticing, enjoyable, and a fulfilling read, I did at times find East of Eden by John Steinbeck somewhat unorganized and hard to understand. For a majority of this novel, I couldn't put it down. Themes of good vs. evil as well as love become apparent to the reader. Characters are well developed and liked by the audience. Unfortunately, it was difficult to keep track of what or who you were reading about. Steinbeck would go for a chapter on one character in one setting and then completely jump to another family or character in another city. It was in the hope of the reader that these two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks, would one day cross paths. In many ways I found this novel much like a soap opera you would find on television. There is Cathy, a whore of a mother to the sons of Adams children, Caleb and Aron. However, it is unknown to the audience if they children are even Adams, possibly being his brother Charles who Cathy slept with at one point in the novel. I found myself getting so in depth into one part of the novel and just when it got good or revealed a fact about a character, Steinbeck would go and change everything all around. If you are looking for a quick read, this isn't your novel. If you are ready to maybe read sections over a few times to understand what is going on then this is your novel. Steinbeck is an amazing author however maybe this isn't his best work."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I had always thought John Steinbeck was the author of boring books and more boring books. After reading The Pearl, which I found quite annoying, I chose to stay away from all of Steinbeck's books. So I was a bit hesitant in reading East of Eden at first, but after having read it I have no regrets. John Steinbeck captures human nature like no other in his characters. He portrays the struggles of good and evil and ignorance versus truth. His writing contains topics the reader will ponder over for days after reading it. My math teacher told me that Cathy Ames, the antagonist of his novel, has been said to be one of the most evil villains in all of literature history. But don't just read this book for its colorful character developments, read it if you like to think about life. Steinbeck has some worthwhile observations about human nature in this book. Don't be bored this summer! Read a book! Read East of Eden!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is probably the best Steinbeck novel I have read so far. I personally love the way he describes the setting. He makes you feel like you are there with the characters. This is an excellent story and provides deeper understanding of the story of Cain and Abel. It has somewhat of an elusive climax but that's alright because it is good throughout the entire novel. It is the longest book I have read but I certainly don't regret reading it and will probably read it again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This was an excellent novel, mainly because John Steinbeck made a clever, astute, and contemporary version of a modern Adam and Even/Cain and Abel story. The most exemplary attribute of East of Eden is how one can coherently see how the story of Cain and Abel is no different from the story of everyday people. Somehow I had a better understanding of Cain and Abel and the idea of \\"original sin\\" from reading this novel, which is something that's definitely worth acknowledging on Steinbeck's credit. However, there's also a major flaw to East of Eden. At times it felt a bit bombastic and pretentious. The characters were very interesting, however they felt more like biblical symbols than real characters. Obviously that was Steinbeck's purpose, but it made them appear VERY one dimensional (for instance: Why is Cathy all bad? Why is Cal the least loved? Why is Aron the most loved? Why is Cal the least liked because he has brown hair, and Aron the most loved because he has blonde hair and blue eyes?). So therefore, it made me a bit detached from the characters, and it felt a bit unrealistic and predictable. However, despite that, there are still many scenes in the novel that felt inspiring, so much that I nearly clapped for the character (Adam) when he finally confronted his fears. It doesn't really touch on new ground about the concept of good and evil, but East of Eden is a novel worth reading at least once."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was required to read this for an English course, and was not looking forward to it because I had not enjoyed other Steinbeck books... after the first 10 or so pages I couldn't put it down.

Although lengthy, the story never ceases to draw one in. For instance, during the last part of the book, I stayed up all night to finish it. The story is loaded with detail, rich, and very entertaining. The only problem, for me, lies in the ending. I felt I would have liked to know more about a certain relationship that takes place at the end. Also, if you read the book slowly, the ending may confuse you due to the fact that you may forget the meaning of a conversation that took place in the beginning. Even with that said, I still recomend this book to anyone who enjoys Steinbeck. Try reading Travels with Charley in Search of America by Steinbeck, as well. That I give 5 stars."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a beautiful work that is multi-thematic, complex, and yet very personal. In the saga of the Trask and Hamilton families, Steinbeck weaves a story that explores, above all, people. Siblings, parents, births, deaths, sorrows, joys, truths, lies, and the perceptions in between, this novel has it all. Headed by Sam Hamilton, the Hamilton family is trying their best to live with dignity on the poorest land in their area. They are the kind of people who are so decent and joyful in each other that it's hard to remember that they are struggling to get by. Adam Trask, emerging from what we would now call a dysfunctional family, buys up the best land in the area with money that he inherited, somewhat mysteriously, from his father. While he wants desperately to make his new bride happy and be the father/patriarch he never had, Adam has the misfortune to have picked a wife that is not interested in settling down and becoming a mother. Immediately after the birth of her twins, Adam's wife disappears, turning up later as the madame of a whorehouse reputed for \\"providing the sort of services that shouldn't be available\\".The story is large, somewhat complex, but never tedious. Unlike most novels of this length (600 pages), there is never one place where the story becomes bogged down. Steinbeck does such a good job with his beautiful prose, true characters, and honest emotion, that the reader floats through the 600 pages effortlessly. I loved this novel and have every intention of reading every other piece of Steinbeck I can get my hands on."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"i love this book. it a advanturous book.one of best piece of litterature. in the begaining you might not be interested but if you go along you will love the book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in quite some time.

If you're ready to devote a few days to reading, this is the book to choose!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The ability of John Steinbeck, to place 'you' the reader psychologically into the story is the true power of his artistic gift. You 'feel' the characters. You 'see' the unfolding and changing landscape. You are emotionally pulled into the unfolding drama. You laugh at outrageous hilarity. You cry over intense sadness. You literally feel the rain on your face when he alerts you to a storm blowing in.For the most part, the characters spanning several generations are biographical depictions of his real relatives; mostly on his mothers side. The only weakness in the novel that I feel worth mentioning is that the character Kate appears too mean, inhuman, and damaged to seem real.John, in a paragraph or two using real nonfictional characters, actually puts himself into the story by name at two different times. The first is when he and his sister Mary at around age 10 or 11 discuss a very funny situation with their Uncle Tom at a Thanksgiving dinner. The second time he appears in the story is again with his sister Mary where they are depicted as peeking out of a second story window down upon a visitor walking up to their house in Salinas.The existential theme of &quot;individual choice&quot; being more fundamental than &quot;Heavenly Mandates&quot; is a topic he repeats often causing one to believe that John himself must have believed this to be an important idea. But he also demonstrates that choice itself is often not powerful or useful enough to provide solutions to complex tragic situations.This novel is a must read. But then again, I believe that any of his novels will not disappoint."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is going to be a book that lasts for centuries. It's one of the most modern, classic novels. John Steinbeck pains my heart with his characters, but I think that's his intention; there's a sprinkling of all his characters inside all of us, and I think that's the beauty of his writing. There are few books I've read where the character is the one talking, not the author. I love his writing, his deep insights, and a true look inside human nature and inside the human heart."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"this is one of the best books i have ever read. a complete masterpiece. i think this book truly goes deep into what humans are really like. there are monstrous things out there, although some people choose to not see it or accept it. but life can truly be the way this book depicts it. there is definitely good and evil, and i dont believe the character cathy seems fake at all. whoever felt that way must have a very naive outlook of this world. although this book was great it was also very sad. i still love it though."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck uses the story of Cain of Abel to tell us a story about two families, how their paths cross and everyone they meet along the way.There something amazing about this book. Every time I reread it, I read it slower and read more parts aloud and let the story decide the pace of its telling. I've most recenty listened to the audiobook, while not perfect, having someone speak aloud at a controlled pace has allowed me to picture each detail more completely. And the more detail I could hold in together, the richer the experience becomes.The number of and the amount of time Steinbeck spends on non-central characters was something I used to find that tiresome at first, having to get to know a new character just when I stopped thinking he was going to put in another one. It was a long time before I reread it, but after that, it became easier to see that Steinbeck wanted to use these characters to more clearly lay down the chain of consequences. I have a feeling that Steinbeck wanted Salinas to be as much a character in the book as the Trasks and the Hamiltons and how, through its citizens coped with the changes from the post civil war era to the early 20th century. Steinbeck grew up in Salinas after all and parts of the story have to do with tracing his lineage and his childhood, and perhaps he wanted the readers to know the town as well as he did (and I by now think it's a perfectly reasonable, respectable decision).Whether or not you dislike the antagonist of the book depends on what you're willing to accept but John does make an explanation for why she does what she does. This can make it harder what to think about her as a person, if at all. The ideas I had about all the characters at the start of the story weren't exactly the same in the end. In fact, by the end, all I could do was just take the info in and suspend my judgement until I don't know when. Perhaps that's the whole point.

I guess that's how I know that Steinbeck accomplished his mission."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" is a magnificent novel with a great story line. The main themes in the story are redemption, inheritance and most important of all, free will. Please read my full review at my blog: mehdijamei . wordpress . com"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's American epic, East of Eden, is a complex analysis of good and evil in society. The book follows two families over three generations (from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of World War I) as their lives intertwine and the characters are faced with a series of tough moral decisions. Reading this book is like being caught in a giant moral dilemma; Steinbeck provides the reader with enough information to form opinions on the morality of the characters in the book. This forces the reader to make tough decisions about who is good and who is evil, while Steinbeck never ceases to shock the reader with the actions of his characters.Steinbeck's novel is held together by the complex and highly developed characters he features as the focus of the book. There are several important characters that can all be defined by a very distinct set of qualities. There is the extremely wise Samuel Hamilton, the intelligent, but naive Adam Trask, and the notoriously evil Cathy Ames. Steinbeck spends a great deal of time developing these characters and the reward is a satisfying representation of America in a period of dishevelment as industrialization and west ward expansion are the focus of society. The plethora of characters created by Steinbeck creates a complex and intricate balance in the novel; the actions of one character will undoubtedly affect all of the characters in either a positive or adverse way. These characters are what truly makes this novel an American classic; Steinbeck's ability to create a memorable cast drive the rest of the story.One of these characters, Cathy Ames, may be the most evil, twisted character ever created in all of American literature. The reader is introduced to Ames as she murders her parents by lighting their house on fire. From this point on, it is clear that Ames is the embodiment of evil in the novel. As Ames becomes ingratiated into the main plot, more evil actions ensue, including the attempted murder of her husband and the murder of a madam in charge of a brothel. These actions occur before Ames becomes truly evil by the end of the novel. Another of the more memorable characters in East of Eden is Lee, the Trask family's loyal Asian servant. Lee is meant to play the stereotypical Asian role in the novel, but Steinbeck attempts to break race barriers by incorporating Lee into the main plot of the novel. Lee is extremely intelligent and very wise. He puts up a facade of a stereotypical Asian servant around ignorant and arrogant Americans. However, around people he trusts, such as Samuel Hamilton and Adam Trask, he reveals his intelligence. Lee is very complex and Steinbeck ensures that he plays an important role in the novel.The novel lacks a clearly defined plot; it follows two families over several generations as they struggle to establish themselves in the Salinas Valley in California. However, the novel does act as an allegory to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. There are several obvious references to the book of Genesis throughout the novel (East of Eden, Adam Trask, and the twins Caleb and Aaron, meant to represent Cain and Abel), creating an interesting outlet for Steinbeck to analyze religious and social issues prominent in society during this era of American history. There are times when Steinbeck's commentary is somewhat subtle and there are times when his commentary is blatantly obvious as the narrator provides insight into the state of society during this time. However, unlike other fictitious novels that attempt to tackle heavy topics such as religion, Steinbeck is able to provide this commentary without sounding too pretentious; he doesn't claim to know the answers to some of the more controversial issues regarding religion. This adds depth to Steinbeck's already complex and layered novel, contributing to the intricacy of this intelligently written novel.East of Eden, like all of Steinbeck's novels, is full of descriptive passages that are essential in establishing the setting for the novel. The novel also takes place in the Salinas Valley of California, the same place that Steinbeck grew up in as a child. Steinbeck's knowledge of the region enables him to provide deep, descriptive details of the setting for the story. The setting is almost as important as the characters, as the distinct environment of the Salinas Valley shapes their behavior throughout the novel. In fact, the Salinas Valley is a metaphor for the lives of the Hamiltons and the Trasks. The valley appears to be heavenly and fertile, but as one digs into the soil unexpected layers of clay, dirt, and rock are revealed. The Hamiltons and the Trasks also appear to have it all together, but as the reader is familiarized with these characters, it becomes clear that they struggle with a great deal of internal conflict. Steinbeck's emphasis on setting also adds to the complexity of the novel, creating a memorable multilayered epic that has become an American classic.In writing this novel, Steinbeck took on a nearly impossible challenge; he attempted to write a novel that would encompass ideas about morality, religion, and politics, while remaining intelligible to his audience. Steinbeck deserves to be commended for accomplishing this feat. Reading this book should be a requirement for everyone as it successfully touches the reader emotionally, logically, and ethically. The highly complex, but relatable characters will surely find a way to sneak into one's heart and become a conscious reminder of ethical behavior. This novel will truly change lives and this is what has kept it moderately relevant in today's society. Reading this novel will not disappoint."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"New book arrived with markedly creased front cover. Less than perfect. When advertized as brand new, I am one to expect that the item will really appear as brand new. My \\"new\\" book did not."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It's a big, masterful book written in commanding prose and it overflows with big issues. The big psychological and moral ones as they occurred to me were: 1.) Acceptance and rejection by God and father, 2) nature-versus-nurture and \\"Timshel,\\" and 3.) the contrast of the self-imposed suffering from living a lie (Trask) versus the natural suffering experienced by an open and loving family (Hamilton). These are good big themes; everybody suffers about in equal measure and the West is opened. To explore the established major themes in East of Eden, you can borrow your kid's Cliffs Notes and see charts of the parallels to the Bible.Keep in mind that this was written in the era when the relatively new concept of \\"psychology\\" was emerging into the American consciousness. Before this time we just worked and, if the mule didn't go lame, we ate- all angst was real and there wasn't the luxury of pondering psychology.The real meat and potatoes of this huge 20-year story lie in the expertly crafted telling of daily life at the opening of The American Century. The dramatic unraveling of the Trasks and the decent but painful lives of the Hamiltons are deeply driven by the yielding of the fathers' horse-and-buggy era values to the relentless societal pressures at the onset of the 20th century. Steinbeck creates a beautifully detailed log of the period, a movie for the mind shown in the sharpest contrast and brilliant color. The delightful character of Lee, the Trasks' Chinese-American servant, forms a perfect fulcrum. Through his enduring wit and insight as an outsider we see the Trasks in perspective, not just a family in crisis but as symbols of the crash of the polite balance of the 19th century as World War I looms and global thinking arises. I can think of no other character that better fulfills this role except perhaps Tyrone Slothrop in Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. Both of these great novels tell of a transformation in American values in a period of rapid change (relative to their era). Both are the masterworks of their respective times and authors.It seems clear at the end of the tale that Caleb Trask sets forth from his troubled Eden with the beautiful Abra, after shattering his brother and father's dream world resulting in their destruction. This escape troubles me and is made only a little more tolerable through the allusion to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. Cal is left to deal with his evil side and bear the burden of his sins as was Cain. He hasn't departed his father's home with any clear moral lesson, so where is the mark on this latter-day Cain that he should receive from his father that will protect him from the \\"curse that is too strong?\\" The film is killer; Elia Kazan nailed it casting James Dean as Cal, masters of unresolved tensions but he rather blurred the ending."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Our book club loved this book.

A little long-winded at times, though, I can't help but feel that Steinbeck got carried away because he didn't know where exactly he was headed, leaving us with a bit of a flat ending. Nonetheless, a great read -- although lacking in the poetic brevity ofThe Grapes of Wrath (Penguin Classics)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Just a fantastic read. The novel triumphs on many levels. It is a compelling story, epic in scope (multi-generational) with complex 3-dimensional characters you can love, hate, pity and wonder at. It is a history study of the emerging culture of California from it's agricultural beginnings to it's industrial age. And it's a moving portrayal of the human animal, delving deep into what motivates us, what constrains us, what inspires us and answers the question, \\"Does our past, our genes, our parents and our experiences, doom us to a predictable future?\\" And the answer is \\"Timshel\\".

Of all the books I have read, this one has touched me the most. Read it, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My daughter sent this one to me, appalled that I'd never read it. I send her Evanovich, she sends me Steinbeck. If I were an astute kind of person, that might explain some things. Good thing I'm not astute.I've been putting off writing something about this. I think I'm a little intimidated because it's A Classic.What the heck. The point is just to say if I liked the book and why or why not. Zillions of people have reviewed and analyzed and dissected this book, and there's really no reason for me to do that. Whew.So, on the off chance that I'm not the only cultural illiterate out there, East of Eden is the story of the Salinas Valley of California, and about two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks.I had a little trouble following the connections between people at first, but it became clear later on. The Hamiltons are Steinbeck's family--in fact, he's in the second part of the story himself as a child, and my guess is they're there to make the story personal, and to contrast with the Trasks and provide a nudge to them once in a while.Mostly, it's the story of two generations of brothers: Charles and Adam Trask, and Caleb and Aron Trask. Adam was his father's favorite, which caused a lot of problems between the brothers. He later marries and his wife gives birth to twins: Caleb and Aron, and the pattern threatens to repeat itself.There's a bit of heavy-handed Cain and Abel imagery there, even down to the names, but the characters are so convincingly realistic that it never interfered with the story, and indeed was only apparent when I put the book down for a while. What I really enjoyed was the struggle between Caleb and Aron, trying not to repeat the pattern, and the realization that everything wasn't exactly as it seemed from the outside or on the surface."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I read East of Eden. I certainly wasn't expecting to be swept away in Steinbeck's eloquent prose or on the edge of my seat, barely able to wait for the ending and yet not really wanting the book to end. At times this was difficult to read--Steinbeck is a master of showing the depravity of humanity--and at other moments you're blown away by his understanding of the good in all of us as well. He shows us that life is about the choices that we make, and not about the blood in us. Genetics have nothing to do with what our life can become, and Steinbeck works this into the novel beautifully. This book grips you and doesn't let you go even after you finish it. It tears away at your pre-conceived notions about life--and takes your breath away with the truth of humanity and what we are capable of--both for good and for evil.Hauntingly, painfully beautiful in places, and just plain painful to read in spots, East of Eden is truly a masterpiece. It's not always easy to read, but even when you're disturbed beyond reason at what is happening, you can't stop reading. It's hypnotizing. Definitely one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck is recognized as a literary genius and he won the nobel prize for literature and rightly so.

After having read Steinbeck's other work, The Pearl, I thought that East of Eden might end up being a long, overly drawn-out description of some vines running along a white wall. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this masterpiece, a great retelling of two classic biblical tales. The characters, if anything else, make this a fantastic read.Like a good 90% or more of Steinbeck works, East of Eden takes place primarily in the Salinas Valley of northern California. It details the lives of the Trask and Hamilton families, particularly of Adam and Charles Trask--the first generation, and Aron and Cal Trask--the second. Between each set of brothers stands the unequal love of a father, a darkness within a man's heart, and the recurring scar which comes to mark those who are \\"darker.\\" From Adam and Charles to Aron and Cal, both sets of brothers face trials in their relationships, between the dichotomy of love and hate. This varying dynamic, polar in its nature, is touching in its realism. The depth of the characters, from their good sides to their bad, their joys and sorrows and triumphs and jealousies, make each pitiable and sympathetic in their own way. Cal, who is somewhat of a protagonist in the second half, strives to find a balance between the good he wants to see in himself and the bad he knows is there. This battle, in his soul, is easily relatable to--a young boy who wants to be loved, doesn't know who he is, and wants to be more.Aside from the male figures, one of the other main characters, Cathy Ames, is considered the Eve of the story. While conventionally seen as a figure of pure evil, the bringer of sin into the world and upon men, I find her the most intriguing--and the most inspiring, of all. While she is depicted to commit evil after evil, senselessly drawing men into their dooms, feeling no remorse whatsoever, there lies the greatest hope in Cathy, who like Cal, seems aligned to the dark side in her nature. But for all of her evil, for every terrible act she makes, the hope of something good within her stirred more hope than any other element of the story. Cal, while inspiring in his struggles, is different from the tragically alone Cathy, whose seeming fall into the darkness draws me in more than anyone else. For her, I truly hoped some light would shed.All in all, I am delighted to have been able to read this novel. Though it was a rather long read, and for academic purposes, it was so enthralling that it drew me in from the get-go. A good two days into it and I was possessed, unable to put it down until I had finished. I would truly have to recommend this novel to anyone who has the time to sit down and plow through 600 pages--it's well worth it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When it comes to human's struggle against evil, John Steinbeck has it all. Through the coexistence of Cathy and Sam Hamilton, the two main opposite forces in East of Eden, Steinbeck immediately foreshadows that a moral fight would be the essence of the novel. The book centers on two brothers' struggle to please their father, who then favors one and scorns the other by accepting the gift of only one son. Sounds familiar? Yes, it is the famous story of Cain and Abel. (Reading the fourth chapter of the book of Genesis would greatly help in understanding the plot and its foreshadowing.)One might wonder: so why base a book on such story? The answer is straight and simple: it is part of us and we tend to deny it. The story of Cain and Abel is the second story accounted in the Bible after that of the Creation, therefore making it one of the most important, original ones. Although being one of the primitive stories, the account of Cain and Abel holds numerous themes found in quotidian life. The opposing characters of Cain and Abel represent the forces of evil and good, respectively, in human nature. While Abel represents the love and innocence in our nature, Cain represents the jealousy and hatred. Abel, as described in Genesis, is a young, innocent shepherd who offered to God \\"the firstborn of his flock and of their fat,\\" which demonstrates his unfailing love for his Creator (NKJV, Gen. 4.4). Because God chose Abel's gift over Cain's, the latter became jealous of his brother and a feeling of hatred started to foment inside of him, resulting in the tragic death of Abel and the unbearable punishment of Cain.One of the highlights of this novel centers on the discussion of knowledgeable Lee about the meaning of timshel. According to the original Hebrew translation, the word means \\"thou mayest,\\" a translation that illustrates a human being's ability to choose between Good and Evil. In order to make such a decision, one must first know the difference between each choice. The character of Adam evolves from an obscure, ignorant follower of Cathy's evilness and cajolery, to a potent, dependent man, able to overcome his trepidations and Cathy's temptations. Adam succeeds only after realizing Cathy's genuine persona. Adam's evolution parallels Genesis, which says, \\"Then the Lord God said, \`Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil'\\" (NKJV, Gen. 3.22).The struggle that Adam faces and finally overcomes is a reflection of humanity's ability to overcome any trepidation that it might face daily. In a sense, it gives hope to the hopeless, happiness to the sad, destination to the adventurer, goal to the living, life to all."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I started reading East of Eden as part of an intention to read modern classics and was overwhelmed by Steinbeck's love of words.

I would put this novel up there as one of the first, best - revisionist, anti American novels that inspired so many movies of this genre. Basically, there are no heroes in this novel - the sympathetic characters are poor, honest (Chinese) servants, failed farmers - business and social success comes only through deception. The father of the Cain and Abel sons was a decorated Civil War hero, military experts who lost his leg in something not associated with Civil War battle, yet he promotes himself all the way up to the Secratary of War's office in Washington. Organized religion is mocked, depicted as a fraud - true spiritualism comes from the suffering of regular folks. The female character of Cathy is one of the most negative, destructive characters in American literature - a manipulative whore, prostitute, madam, tries to abort her 9 month old twins and yet she can act and succeed in an American world that is fallen, always fallen as man is failed after Adam and Eve fell out of grace and were kicked out of the garden of Eden.I feel about this great novel the same way I feel about the Revisionist Western movie - High Noon. High Noon isn't a patriotic American movie - as virtually all the characters of this small Western town are depicted as cowards, hypocrites and the whole America they represent is depicted as a lie. Yes, Communists in Hollywood wrote and directed High Noon - John Wayne hated this movie, being a patriotic America, I should also hate High Noon. But I don't - the movie is just to good, great.I give the same grudging respect to East of Eden - think it is Steinbeck's best.High Noon (Collector's Edition)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The true measure of a great novel is whether one can open it up again after 6 months or 6 years and still find it absorbing.

I can think of only two books which have created a world which has affected my soul as much as the real people in my life. One is Anna Karenina. The other is East of Eden. Steinbeck from the first page casts a spell. It is as if he is really telling his story of his ancestors, the Hamiltons. We are taken back to a post Civil War pastoral world with grassy scents and golden light. The prose is beautifully simple, rich, Mozartian. It is the most economical 700 page book I can think of. The &quot;joy of creation&quot; Steinbeck felt when writing it is evident. That joy makes up for its artistic flaws. I envy the readers who will be reading this novel for the first time. You're in for a treat."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It would be trite to call this the greatest English-language book ever written. That would be too car salesmanish. The back of the book tells you it's about the struggle between two brothers. I feel that's oversimplifying it. It's about the struggle about a group of people from prostitutes to farmers to soldiers to children to geniuses to simpletons to millionaires to hobos. It blends Western and Eastern philosophies and makes you realize that at the core, most beliefs are the same because most people are the same. And infinitely different.But this isn't only a philosophical romp for over 700 pages. The prose is some of the most beautiful I've ever read. A passage about a rabbit getting shot with an arrow moved me so much I read it about 10 times when I first encountered it. The book took a long time to read not because it was difficult, but because I kept going back over and over. The problem I've found with novels this long is the author's seeming inability to finish it gracefully if at all. But here, the final scene couldn't be held together better and be more satisfying.Yes, you do need to get through the first 50-100 pages, but after that, you'll realize it was a labor of love"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a great book to read if you're looking for plot, style, story and structure. John Steinbeck is obviously the best in all three categories. After all, the man did win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962. I was in the navy way back then, and we were right in the middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis, so literature was the farthest thing from my mind. But, after all these years, I've finally gotten around to reading this masterpiece and, I assure you, it is well worth the six hundred pages. Plus, the Penguin book format is so easy to manage.East of Eden is all about a man named Adam Trask who, after being discharged from the army and inheriting a small fortune from his deceased father, settled in rural Salinas Valley, California around the turn of the century. He bought a farm and, over the course of his life he survived a fatal love attraction, a horrid marriage, reared two sons, met some life-long friends and wonderfully colorful characters, and even tried his had at business. For the most part, heartache and sorrow were his rewards. Such is life. But that's just the storyline. To me, this book was more about style than story. The way Steinbeck constructed his story, developed his characters, twisted his plot, and the beautiful descriptions he used made this book a joy to read, as well as an enlightening literary experience. I thought it was great.I recommend East of Eden to anybody who is interested in reading his or her way through the American classics."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Is is possible that Netflix may boost literacy? I just did a Netflix mini-retrospective look at James Dean's films: \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" \\"Giant\\" and \\"East of Eden.\\" Watching the complex story of \\"East of Eden,\\" reminded me that I had never read the Steinbeck novel from which the film was adapted. This came as a surprise to me, since I am a huge fan of Steinbeck's writings and have long considered \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" among my favorite novels. So, I embarked on reading the novel. I was expecting it to be good; I was unprepared for the depth of the writing and the brilliant insight into human nature that marked Steinbeck's writing at this stage of his career. In my opinion, if he had never written another novel besides \\"East of Eden,\\" he would have been worthy of the Nobel Prize that he won in 1962.The story is a complex and very moving modern setting of the Cain and Abel story told at multiple levels through several generations of the Trask family. Adam and Charles Trask lay the groundwork for the narrative by vying for the affection of their father, an ersatz Civil War hero who carved out a reputation and a fortune by misrepresenting the role that he played in key battles of the War Between the States. The saga continues into its main section with Adam's two sons - Cal and Aron - struggling to please him. Adam is raising them as a single father - with the not inconsiderable help from Lee, the live-in Chinese cook - after his wife abandoned the family shortly after giving birth to the twins.The most profound musings that stand as the intellectual and spiritual center of the novel are found exactly halfway through the narrative. The setting is that Lee, the Chinese cook, is having a theological discussion with a neighbor, Samuel. The crux of the discussion bears on varying translations of Genesis 4:7, in which God addresses Cain and implores him to overcome the temptation to sin. Lee describes the result of two years' of study by elders in the Chinese community who had undertaken to understand the issue in all of its subtleties:\\"After two years we felt we could approach your sixteen verses of the fourth chapter of Genesis. My old gentlemen felt that these words were very important too - 'Thou shalt not' and 'Do thou.' And this was the gold from our mining: 'Thou mayest.' 'Thou mayest rule over sin.' The old gentlemen smiled and nodded and felt the years were well spent. It brought them out of their Chinese shells, too, and right now they are studying Greek.Samuel said: 'It is a fantastic story. And I've tried to follow and maybe I've missed somewhere. Why is this word so important?'Lee's hand shook as he filled the delicate cups. He drank his down in one gulp. 'Don't you see?' he cried. 'The American Standard translation orders men to triumph over sin, and you can call sin ignorance. The King James translation makes a promise in \\"Thou shalt not.\\" meaning that men will surely triumph over sin. But the Hebrew word, the word timshel -\\"Thou mayest\\" - that gives a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open. That throws it right back on a man. For if \\"Thou mayest\\" it is also true that \\"Thou mayest not.\\"\\"Yes, I see. I do see. But you do not believe this is divine law. Why do you feel its importance?\\"\\"Ah!\\" said Lee. \\"I've wanted to tell you this for a long time. I even anticipated your questions and am well prepared. Any writing which has influenced the thinking and the lives of innumerable people is important. Now, there are many millions in their sects and churches who feel the order 'Do thou,' and throw their weight into obedience. And there are millions more who feel predestination in 'Thou shalt.' Nothing they may do can interfere with what will be. But 'Thou mayest'! Why, that makes a man great, then gives him stature with the gods, for in his weakness and his filth and his murder of his brother he still has the great choice. He can choose his course and fight it through and win.\\" Lee's voice was a chant of triumph.Adam said, \\"Do you believe that, Lee?\\"\\"Yes, I do. Yes, I do. It is easy out of laziness, out of weakness, to throw oneself into the lap of deity, saying, 'I couldn't help it; the way was set.' But think of the glory of the choice! That makes a man a man. A cat has no choice, a bee must make honey. There's no godliness there. And do you know, those old gentlemen who were sliding gently down to death are too interested to die now?\\" (Pages 301-2)Steinbeck's argument reminded me of the exquisite Grand Inquisitor passage in Dostoevsky's magnum opus, \\"The Brothers Karamazov.\\" The Inquisitor confronts a Christ who has returned to earth during the Spanish Inquisition and excoriates him for having condemned mankind to freedom of choice. Both Steinbeck and Dostoevsky are delving into levels that represent the quantum physics of the soul. This is great literature - writing that combines story telling as an art form with profound examination of the human condition.Even in the age of Netflix and Grand Theft Auto IV, there is still room for great writing - and great reading.Enjoy!Al"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" is a beautifully written, sprawling, three generation saga of the men and women who settled the Salinas Valley in California. The story begins far away in the East, on the farm of the unscrupulous Cyrus Trask and his two sons, Adam and Charles. Adam is an upright, honest young man who naturally draws people to him, while Charles has an angry, violent spirit.Charles tries in vain to earn the love of his father, and takes his anger at his failure out on Adam. Adam is sent by his father into the army as a sign of his love, but Cyrus keeps Charles close to home, knowing that war would release something dangerous and violent in his other son.Adam wanders for many years across the country after his service, and some of the most lyrical passages in the book describe his life as a tramp, closely mirroring Steinbeck's own experiences during the Depression. Finally he returns to the farm and exists in uneasy partnership with Charles until the mysterious Cathy arrives. The more astute Charles quickly realizes her true nature, but innocent Adam marries her and they move to California.Adam expects Cathy to pursue his dream of life on a ranch, but Cathy is a vicious, evil character with no redeeming qualities, and after the birth of twin sons she escapes only to re-emerge much later when her sons are grown. Adam hibernates for many years on the ranch, broken-hearted over Cathy's desertion, and convinced he must hide the secret from his sons forever, which become an impossible task. Repeating the pattern of their father's life, the twins Aron and Caleb vie for their father's love, with Aron effortlessly winning it while Caleb comes to believe there is something evil lurking in his spirit. But this time around, Caleb is redeemed in a way Charles never was.Steinbeck's prose is masterful, and his descriptions of the Salinas Valley, lush with the rains, brutal with the drought, capture exactly why men were drawn to the west. His portrayals of character and motives--sadly lacking in the movie--are totally convincing, and his Adam is a flawed but admirable character.Steinbeck has been a bit out of favor--at least until this was chosen as an Oprah book. As an English-as-a-second-language teacher I recently taught \\"The Pearl,\\" and that book too surprised me with its gorgeous writing and subtle imagery. (We all read it in high school but I now realize it went right over my head.) Try Steinbeck again--you won't be disappointed--my book club wasn't!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I just finished this novel. And I am totally speechless and in awe of Steinbeck's writing. I am also wondering why I have never read it before! This book would make Shakespeare proud! As most English Lit majors in college would know ~~ that Shakespeare is the world's most acclaimed playwright ~~ he writes about every emotion under the sun known to man and he makes the audience see and feel the stories that is very familiar to mankind. Steinbeck's East of Eden should be regarded in the same category. This may be a drama, but it is a reflection on humankind ~~ men who seeks to find the gold in their dreams and experience everything that is known to mankind. These men, Charles Trask, Adam Trask, Cal Trask, Aron Trask, Samuel Hamilton, Lee have sought happiness at their whim and some succeeded and others didn't. They reacted to whatever life throws their way ~~ either with strength and courage or with cowardice. No man is alike in this book and yet they are. Even the women handled things differently in this book. There is Cathy/Kate, the eternal whore and there is Abra Bacon, the eternal mother-figure.Please don't be discouraged by the long descriptive pages that Steinbeck employed to introduce his characters. They only serve to enrich the novel and make these people come alive between these pages and in your imagination. This is a classic book and it flows easily between the pages. It is also one of the most lyrical writing I have yet to read. Steinbeck's talent is that he makes people come alive and tell their stories of their struggles with guilt, sin and love. It is a book that will touch you immensely and you will not forget these people.It's a definite must-read for any serious reader.9-5-03"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A friend suggested that if I didn't like this book, it was a mark against me, and not the book itself. After reading it, I must concur. I didn't think I'd like a book set around the turn of the last century in the states... don't know why... but this story is truly timeless. It was just swell. The characters are a bit extreme (extremeley good, or bad), and that compromises believability, but I am willing to suspend cynnicism for the rest of the story. If you don't read this book, you are not a good human being."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Best Steinbeck novel and best novel I have ever read (several times)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book has all the M's that count: Mystery, Mischief and Mayhem. I've read it twice and plan to read it again soon because it never fails to amaze me. The characters are full of mystery; I doubt I will ever discover everything there is to learn about them, they are among the most intrigueing and complex characters in any Steinbeck novel, or any novel for that matter. This novel looks deeply into the story of Cain and Abel and theology in general, but not in the boring listen-to-what-I-think-of-this manner, it is creative, mischievous, harsh, and true. In addition to being a well-thought-out novel with a captivating, complex plot, it is also an insightful study of human nature and religion."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What more can I say; this is the type of novel I wich I could read again for the first time to completely take in all it has to offer"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Powerful, Compelling, TimelessJohn Steinbeck's East of Eden is a powerful novel that takes an in-depth look at the inward struggle of good vs. evil that goes on within all people. Set in the 1930s, East of Eden is a vivid and realistic portrayal of life in the southwest during that time. This novel deserves as much praise as its predecessor Grapes of Wrath.The characters that Steinbeck created in his novel are strong and intriguing. While the plotline lagged at times, the characters compelled me to continue reading. Three of the best drawn and most important characters in the story are Adam, Cal, and Cathy. Adam is an army veteran. He has a good heart, and an innocent outlook which leads him to marry a woman who not only doesn't love him, but eventually shoots him and leaves him for dead. His son Cal also has a good heart, but he often struggles with it and finds himself praying to be more like his brother Aron, who never experiences any kinds of inner turmoil. Cathy is Adam's wife, and from her first appearance in the book is described as a cold hearted monster. On pg.95 Steinbeck writes while introducing her character, \\"I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents. Some you can see misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies... And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born? The face and body may be perfect but if a twisted gene or a malformed egg can produce physical monsters, may not the same process produce a malformed soul?\\" While Cathy is well developed, her character is never totally understood. For example, what drives her and where her unremorseful cruelty comes from is never revealed, it is only suggested that these were characteristics that she was born with, not characteristics that developed over time. Steinbeck writes of her on pg.96 \\"It is my belief that Cathy Ames was born with the tendencies, or lack of them, which drove and forced her all her life.\\"One of the most interesting things about East of Eden, is its new spin on two of the words most ancient biblical stories; Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel. Adam and Eve is about the first two humans and their banishment from the garden of Eden after disobeying God. In East of Eden, Adam and Cathy's relationship parallels that of Adam and Eve. In the book Adam moves a pregnant Cathy to Salinas Valley, California, where he buys a huge plot of land and begins to create a gigantic garden on it. But when Cathy decides that she can no longer stand her life with Adam, she leaves him, which subsequently results in the deterioration of the garden that Adam was trying to make. Adam loses his Eve, (Cathy) and because of it, his garden and life turn from heavenly to hellish.Cain and Abel is about two brothers who both make an offering to God, but only one of the offerings, Abel's, is accepted, while Cain is told to do better. Feeling that he's been rejected by God, Cain becomes angry and kills Abel. In East of Eden, the relationships of both Adam and Charles, and Cal and Aron, parallel that of Cain and Abel. Charles becomes jealous and attempts, (though does not succeed,) to kill his brother Adam with a hatchet because their father loves him more. Cal becomes jealous of Aron for the same reason, only in this case Cal's actions towards his brother are indirectly responsible for his death. In both situations the breaking point occurred when the fathers either preferred one of their son's gifts over the other's, or rejected one of their son's gifts while accepting the other son's. Taking these two stories, (Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel) which some people can't connect with, and weaving them into a plot with characters which the reader can't help but connect with, was very captivating.A main theme in this novel is relationships, mainly those between fathers and sons, and brothers. Steinbeck did a wonderful job writing an honest account of the jealousy that can arise between siblings as a result of having a parent who favors one of them over the other. The various emotions and driving factors that were touched on while exploring these relationships were true to form and something that anyone who has brothers or sisters can personally understand.East of Eden was moving and left a solid imprint in my mind. Steinbeck succeeded in writing an unforgettable novel. It is truly worthy of a second read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The initial response to East of Eden reminds me of the reviews of Tchaikovski's violin concerto which was excoriated at its debut as &quot;an assault on the violin.&quot; It's clear that those who initially evaluated the novel clearly failed to appreciate the scope of Steinbeck's ambition and the extent to which he succeeded. I've read this novel 5 times now, each time more slowly. I always come away astonished at the depth of his understanding of the human condition, particularly his understanding that the feeling of being unloved has caused most of the misery in history."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is definitely not short on Biblical themes and references, but as someone who is - at best - agnostic, I wasn't put off at all by this. East of Eden is an obvious Steinbeck work, in that it does have a lot of the darker side of human-kind along with the turn-of-the-century California setting. The grandiose tale spans two families and three generations, with apt ties between all. It is a story of morality and brings up some questions about the soul and inner workings of us all. To me, it ultimately boils down to a story of hope, highlighted by the repeated mention of a single word, timshel, which equates to \\"thou mayest.\\" It is this theme of choosing and controlling your own destiny that most captivated me, as well as the thoughts on acceptance and forgiveness."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have no earthly notion why Oprah selected a Steinbeck work of this magnitude and scope to resurrect her book club. However, maybe without Oprah's generous promotional efforts, this particular work by John Steinbeck (1902-68) might have remained the obscure and enigmatic masterpiece that it is. Keen movie buffs will recall the attempt some thirty-odd years ago (or more?) to convert this novel into a movie [executed appropriately in funereal black and white, instead of in dazzling color ... despite the sunny brilliance of California's Salinas Valley]. The brooding actor James Dean had the role of brother Caleb, who vies for the affection and approval of his father, played imperially by Anthony Quinn. The movie version was not at all a box-office success mainly because, in my view, the story was so amazingly intricate and overwhelming with its ponderously convoluted psychological elements. The same is true with the novel: multi-layered in approach, tone, and structure, resulting in constant nervous tension and anguish. But then who would dare argue with a giant of such innovative literary artistry as Nobel Prize (1962) winning writer John Steinbeck? At some point shortly after the initial publication of this novel (1952) Steinbeck himself alluded to the \\"difficulty\\" (e.i.,complexity) of this powerfully dramatic work. He was extremely pleased. And difficult it most certainly is. I know I'm dating myself, but so what? Does anyone remember those essential Cliff Notes that regularly accompanied literary Master Works? Well, there was one for EAST OF EDEN. Believe me, this handy little yellow booklet proved indispensable to many readers 'back in the day.' A Masterful Read!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's novel East of Eden is like Christmas. It shows humanity in both it's extremes; the cruel underside like christmas shoppers, but more frequently the good will to all men (and women) which makes the world a wonderful place. Most importantly Steinbeck stresses the fact that we are the ones who decide whether we are good or evil, however he is not moralistic and the bad people do not always come to a sticky end. Ultimatly East of Eden shows the rewards of 'being good' in terms of personal satisfaction rather than material gain. While not as overtly socialist as 'The Grapes of Wrath' Steinbeck still includes some left-wing views such as his approach to explaning racism by means of subhumanising the victim. East of Eden is more than an 'important' piece of 20th century American fiction which should be read for dinner party conversation, it is an stunning piece of work that once again reinforces Steinbecks position of a great novelist with a excellent and hopefully justifiable knowlegde of human nature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"For about the first 200 pages, I was in the firm belief that this book would trump Grapes of Wrath. It is hard to review this book, because I would not want to turn someone away from reading it. Reading is more about the journey itself than what you get at the end most times. However, I really felt like he was going after too much with this book. It started off very bold and very focused, but after the half way mark and until the end there was so much unnecessary stuff that any other author not named John Steinbeck would never have gotten published. It's like he wanted to add a lot of autobiographical stuff in there, but he wanted to have his story about Adam and his family. When I put it down, I was left feeling that this could have been an amazing book at 300 pages. The theme was difficult to grasp, and this was not the case with Grapes and some of his other books. I am not sorry I read it. It has given me some things to think about. The language, as always, was beautifully written. But I just didn't connect with this and felt too much artistic license was given because he had done so well with Grapes. I'm a hater! Worth three stars though because the parts of this book that are good are better than any novel written in the past 50 years."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is by far John Steinbeck's most ambitious novel, and though his reach may have exceeded his grasp, it still extended farther than he ever had before. Through a modern retelling of the story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck examines the nature of good and evil. Though his idea of what constitutes the good and the evil isn't too clear---what determines one's moral worth for Steinbeck seems to lie not even just in his relationship to others, but merely in how others *feel* about him---but this doesn't detract too much from the novel, because he is focused mainly on one aspect of the issue, namely the question of whether we are born guilty or are some how guilty by nature.And Steinbeck largely rejects this notion. East of Eden is, at its core, a repudiation of the doctrine of original sin.But what makes it such a good novel is that these themes are explored through a cast of engaging characters and an engrossing story. Kate is one of the greatest villains in literature, and by far Steinbeck's best...the chapters about her are absolutely blood-chilling. Adam Trask and their sons Cal and Aron are fascinating, complex characters. And the supporting cast is great, particularly Steinbeck's grandfather Samuel Hamilton and the Trask's philosophical Chinese cook, Lee.The story of Adam's blind love of Kate and her heartless manipulation of him and everyone around her for her own ends and the consequences of both, and of their sons' rivalry for the love of their father and its resolution, is a powerfully moving one. Steinbeck considered this his greatest achievement, saying, \\"It has everything in it I have been able to learn about my craft or profession in all these years,\\" and, \\"I think everything else I have written has been, in a sense, practice for this.\\" He was right.Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It's always difficult for me to write a review about a book I absolutely loved. I can't believe I waited this long to read this epic masterpiece. The writing is beautiful, the story and characters memorable; it's one of those stories you will never forget, but you will want to reread even though you know what will happen.--just one of my favorite passages---\\"In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love. When a man comes to die, no matter what his talents and influence and genius, if he dies unloved his life must be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror. It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world\\".We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never ending contests in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\"The book is 600 pages and the audio book was read by Richard Poe, a favorite reader. I loved the audio, but needed to reread sections, just because the writing was so wonderful. The story is somewhat autobiographical and it also reminds the reader of the biblical story of Cain and Abel from the Book of Genesis. It is a story which spans a period covering the Civil War and World War 1, but yet, it is not a story about our country at war.It's a story of three generations and two families. The family of Samuel and Liza Hamilton, Irish immigrants. Samuel was a wise and loving man, and a wonderful husband and father to nine children. The other family is Cyrus and Alice Trask, and their two sons Charles and Adam. Cyrus is a tough on his boys as well as his wife.Adam and Charles Trask are brothers with personalities as different as day and night, from an early age they vie for their father's love and approval. Adam is gentle, Charles is mean. After their mother passes away and later their powerful father, Cyrus, the brothers are left a large sum of money. Adam marries a woman named Cathy, who he knows very little about. Not only is she conniving, she has a sordid past and is pure evil. She's a woman who will do whatever it takes to get what she wants. Shortly after they move away to Salinas Valley, California, Cathy gives birth to twin sons, who she wants nothing to do with. Not only doesn't she want to be a mother, she has no interest in being a wife either. She does what she must to escape her situation.Lee, is a Chinese cook and servant for the Trasks who basically raises the young boys, after Cathy leaves. Adam is devastated after his wife has left and unable to deal with the young twins. It is only after she is gone that the twins are even given names after Lee insists on it. They are named Caleb (Cal) and Aron, after Cain and Abel.Lee was an amazing character, a gentle and smart man who shares his bits of wisdom though out the story. The boys, like their father and his brother Charles, are opposites, and each compete for their father's love and affection as well. As the boys grow up Cal learn bits and pieces about the mother they knew. Eventually they meet her, and one son fears he shares some of his mother's evil traits.While the first half of the book tells mostly the story of the Hamilton's, Cyrus and Alice Trask and their son's Charles and Adam. The second half's focus is on the sons of Adam and Cathy, Caleb (Cal) and Abel.The entire story held my interest, and the 600 pages and numerous audio discs came to an end all too quickly. I want to read it again already. So happy I read this book. This is sure to be a new top 5 books of all time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. For me, John Steinbeck is the VERY BEST WRITER EVER! His common sense and philosophical combination in print is better than any college course. A must read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"BAD, TERRIBLE TYPOS AWAIT YOU! I'm currently reading this \\"Centennial Edition\\", and while I love Steinbeck, the publishers and editors should be ashamed of this edition. I expect a typo or two in a book, but this edition is rife with them to the point of distraction. Some are so glaring that it's almost unbelievable that someone missed them. This is a great novel. Look for a more fitting edition."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden by John Steinbeck is just about as good as it gets. This story features the classic battle of good vs. evil.Adam Trask represents the good while the woman he falls in love with is the epitome of evil. Now this should not ruin the story for you, nor provide any hidden insight, as Mr. Steinbeck tells a truly remarkable story; leaving little to the imagination. From the birth of one character, and her intitial label as a monster, to the evocative descriptions of a barren landscape; Mr. Steinbeck is at the peak of writing prowess.This book is well-worth the time investment necessary to read it. Once done, however, the end result is well worth it. The characters in this book will stay with you."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck, despite past controversy, is one of America's finest novelists, fully deserving the resurgence in interest caused by The Oprah Phenomenon. It reflects the current cultural mania for 'names' that it takes such publicity to attract readers to someone who should be read anyway. Steinbeck is so much better than so many highly touted writers of today that the 'name' mania seems bizarre, inexplicable.East of Eden is beautifully written in every sense--story, plot and characters. It draws the reader in from the start and demands to be read, to savor the magnificent prose and wonder at the skills of observation and exposition Steinbeck demonstrates. Some critics have suggested, over the decades since the book was first published, that the author pushed his biblical allegories too far, that Kathy was outrageous and improbable in her behavior, that the depictions of time and place were harsh and unrealistic. Those critics had clearly led simple lives and had never been exposed to actual people who behaved far worse--yes, they truly exist--or actual places where the cultural landscape was equally complex and often agony to experience.It is perhaps difficult for a modern reader to adopt the attitude that would permit the comfortable assimilation of East of Eden. It is not a modern book, but this novel proves that great writing transcends time and fad, that Steinbeck was a hugely talented, powerful and fearless writer who could tackle difficult material and convey it with searing intensity.I have re-read this book many times and remain in awe at how powerful and memorable it is. Having read, perhaps, 25,000 or more books in my life, I rate this among the top 10 and find it magnificent in every way."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I cannot believe I haven't read this book sooner. I was taken in immediately by the sheer language of the author. The prose was so wonderfully descriptive that I could visualize every place, every item, every character- it was as if a movie was playing in my head as I read each word. It was a classic \\"good vs. evil\\" theme that was realistic in that the good don't always prosper and the evil don't always get what (we feel) they deserve. The character development was great. Some characters were more complex while some characters were really one-dimensional, however, I believe that was the intent of the author because it made the story work. The author made me have an opinion about each character, and whether I liked the character or not, I understood his/her actions and cared about what happened to them. I am now looking forward to reading and re-reading more Steinbeck novels and other classics.You're probably wondering why I only gave this book a 3 star rating after all of this raving. I deducted a star because of one word - EDITING! I ran across mispellings, grammatical errors and punctuation errors. That is unacceptable for a published piece of writing. Especially for a classic work such as this. I am shocked that the editor and publisher did not pay closer attention to this. Otherwise, this book is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I'm amazed that it took, of all people, Oprah to encourage me to re-read this Steinbeck novel. But, after 35 years, I bought and read the new Oprah-recommended book, and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it, particularly because of the vivid descriptions of early 20th Century-era Salinas, California, which is close to where I live. Steinbeck is a very talented writer. Because he was born in the early 1900s, he had a good feel for that era, and even gives an interesting insight into 19th century America with his descriptions of the childhoods Adam and Charles Trask, and their father. If you are ever in Salinas, be sure to check out the Steinbeck Museum on Main Street. Also, after reading this book, you might want to also read Steinbeck's depression-era masterpiece, \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and check out the 1939 John Ford movie starring Henry Fonda. Steinbeck did a lot of screenwriting in Hollywood, and had a hand in the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" script, as well."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book for the first time many years ago because I am a John Steinbeck fan. I thought that Grapes of Wrath was wonderful, but this book is even more mesmorizing. You can picture the characters and actually feel the good and evil and confusion in each of them. I read both Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden at least five times. Both are lengthy, but both tell a story that will keep you up all night reading. If anyone has seen the old movie, it no way compares to the book. What did compare to the book was a television mini-series way back in the 80's which starred Jane Seymour as Kathy. It was wonderful and so portrayed this book and I am desperately trying to find it on DVD. You will be so disturbed by this book and you won't be able to put it down. I was thrilled that Oprah finally read it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Where do you begin with EAST OF EDEN, for it offers the reader a bounty of pleasures and ideas to contemplate? The beautiful tone of the prose flows along like a gentle breeze, while increasing the intensity of dramatic moments. Steinbeck's characters, as they always do, capture you, but even more so in this magnum opus, in particular Samuel Hamilton, the polymath progenitor from whom Olive and then John Steinbeck descended (the novel contains autobiographical elements), a man you wish you could spend an hour or two with; Lee, the highly educated, very wise, completely unassuming Trask housekeeper and companion, who gives rise to the central, hopeful theme of the novel, summed up in the Hebrew word timshel (thou mayest, Steinbeck's translation in support of the theme of choosing between good and evil); and Cal Trask, self-aware of the potential for evil and good within him, probably the most dimensional character in the vast cast. Steinbeck renders the epic, sequential story arcs of good versus evil, with permutations, on the most personal level of family, in a way we can feel and identify with. Yes, EAST OF EDEN is his greatest novelistic achievement, among the greatest family sagas of any century, and one of the best American novels by any American writer, and the best because, put plainly, it is a pleasure and inspiration to read. If you haven't read it, please do yourself a favor and do so now.You'll also find the novel timeless. After all, don't we all still struggle with good and evil; don't we all yet make choices that lead us down paths we wish we did not find ourselves treading; don't we all yearn to turn our lives around at some point but wonder how to do so? If only we had a Samuel or Lee to nudge and guide us; if only we could grasp our plight and wrestle our nature into obedience as Cal will. Well, at least you'll know you are not alone; you'll know you're just human.As you read the novel, and perhaps critiques of it as well, you'll find the central theme to be that a person has it in his or her power to choose between good and evil. Adam and his son Aron are the symbols, the suffering symbols, of good. Charles, Adam's brother, and Cathy, Adam's wife, are evil, and choose to be such. Cal, who possesses evil tendencies, recognizes his predilection to evil. He strives mightily to choose to be good. But I 'd add that Steinbeck might be also telling us that with each generation we trend more to the good, making the individual struggle more hopeful. You'll see this vividly illustrated in Cal, who appears to have descended from Cathy and Charles.Finally, should you explore information on the novel, you'll discover that readers have pulled many quotes from EAST OF EDEN. It's that kind of novel, a place to find any number of thoughts meaningful to you and your life. This passage, which I haven't seen quoted, struck me the moment I read it. It demonstrates Steinbeck's keen understanding of the American character, a summation well worth keeping in mind today. Lee addresses Cal after a devastating turn in the story (page 568, Penguin Centennial Edition):\\"We all have that heritage, no matter what old land our fathers left. All colors and blends of Americans have somewhat the same tendencies. It's a breed--selected out by accident. And so we're overbrave and overfearful--we're kind and cruel as children. We're overfriendly and at the same time frightened of strangers. We boast and are impressed. We're oversentimental and realistic. We are mundane and materialistic--and do you know of any other nation that acts for ideals? We eat too much. We have no taste, no sense of proportion. We throw our energy about like waste. In the old lands they say of us that we go from barbarism to decadence without an intervening culture. Can it be that our critics have not the key or the language of our culture?\\"Highly recommended as a vital, brilliant masterwork that will never lose it relevancy, as well as for its superb style."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book twice and intend to read it again. The first time was when I was 10. It, along with Tobacco Road (Erskine Caldwell) was forbidden me as unfit literature for children (my mother was an avid reader, but she protected my childhood as long as she dared) so naturally, it became my goal to find where she had hidden them, and read both, which I did, having wasted nearly all of one summer looking for them. Finding them buried deep beneath some old clothes in her large Cedar chest, I curled up on the old sofa beneath the sunny kitchen window where the yellow June blooming roses were alive and vocal with the buzzing of bees, eagerly opened the pages and began to read........This book, obviously, parallels the story of Caine and Abel in many mortal ways. It's an incredible tale of betrayal, that I understand had roots in truth, woven around the totally depraved character of one woman, who, though amply endowed with charm, intelligence and ambition, it's but an outward veneer, and she is without the things that make such a person whole - conscience, loyalty, mother love, or any other human emotion that separates us from the primitive - and gets what she wants by using others. Killing someone is not something she worries much about.This woman, taken in by the Trask brothers after being found nearly beaten to death on their doorstep, marries one, beds the other and bears two boys who are by the brother not married to - twins - just before she leaves the good man who thinks he is their father - from her childbed, without a backward look. The story gets better and more incredulous with each passing page. You are given insight into any number of human conditions, characters, motivations, and finally, betrayal of yet another trust between brothers.It's one of Steinbeck's best works. He is a master of the written word - one who can pull you into the story even if you come from a different world than the one you are in as his fascinated reader - and ask you to feel it move you all the way there and back. There are these others by Steinbeck that number among my favorite reads and grace my personal library:\\"Grapes of Wrath\\"\\"Cannery Row\\"\\"The Red Pony\\" which is an unusual story about a young boy and his horse - of a love lost, but with responsibility and maturity painfully gained - book from my youth, but which is much more than a child's story."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Standing in front of monsterous shelves at Border's, staring at my summer reading list with 600 pages of Steinbeck in my hands, I think: \\"My teacher is trying to kill me.\\" That was two years ago.If I could pin down any one reason or instance that transformed me from the proverbial couch potato to avid reader, this epic novel would be it.Steinbeck's East of Eden is absolutely spacktastuler (yes, so good, I just had to fabricate a word for it). The novel, set in the early 20th century, follows the story of the Trask family. A parallel to the biblical story of Cain and Abel, the conflicts between members of the family in two generations serve to explore the nature of good and evil and mankind's tendencies toward each. Steinbeck is able to envoke deep-seeded, universal questions while stunning the reader with a playful subtleness.Perhaps most defined is the developement of character. The reader cannot help but fall in love (or undying disgust)with each of Steinbeck's masterfully crafted personas.The book is long - 600 pages in four parts - but every bit the worth and more. The ending, not to be spoiled, even served to leave a beading tear in the eye of this hopeless \\"tough guy.\\"Truly a masterpiece of modern times."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"How does one write a review about \\"The East of Eden?\\"It is so full of beauty that the words are still absorbinginside of me--Steinbeck is a master storyteller--and this book follows three generations of families and the choices they make in life, how each choice affects the next choice.I adore how Steinbeck will throw universal messages in for the reader--deep directives about religion, racism, and most of all---how the choices we make in life NOW can be our down-fall in the end.\\"East of Eden\\" is perfection--with its language, images, universality, humour, and profound intellegence.I will not go into the characters--because one must read the enire book to get the entire essence--and you will not be the same afterwards. (But I will say \\"The Chinese Servant\\") is used by Steinbeck as a sort of wisdom, guru, conscience. He is superb.\\"East of Eden\\" would not be the book it is without \\"Redemption\\"and wouldn't you know it-- Steinbeck throws that in too!*****This book will live forever***** Perfection."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In \\"East of Eden,\\" Steinbeck catches the subtlety of life that consistently eludes us. Steinbeck constructs unique and brittle characters out of thread--each with its own particular color--and seamlessly weaves them into a beautiful fabric of experience and life. The exhibits of fear and joy draw the reader in simply because the reader is reading about himself. The character Lee--commenting on Genesis--says that a reader only enjoys a story in as much as they see themselves in it, and the ultimate story is one that everyone experiences as their own. Steinbeck strived to create such a story, and \\"East of Eden\\" is the result.The parallels to Genesis are not as blatant as one would suspect. The 600-page novel breezes by and a majority of it can be spent forgetting its metaphorical nature. Steinbeck masterly navigates the storyline through straits of drama, introspective commentary, philosophy, theology, and simple beauty. Many of the conclusions are figurative and implied, and much of the meaning is in what is not said rather than what is. It is only when Steinbeck has let you forget the story he mimics, that he will quickly remind you, giving you an entire new context to contemplate.The novel is dark at times. Every character is severely flawed, and Steinbeck is relentless in his portrayal of weakness, vulnerability, and sorrow. Yet, every character is dripping with realism and humanity; the result is a depth and beauty to the characters that is rarely experienced. Every character is so real it feels as if you could get up, walk next door, and talk to them as an old acquaintence.The novel imitates the Genesis story in an American setting, but \\"East of Eden\\" is simultaneously a commentary and reinterpretation of the same story. It ignores the plot specifics, morals, and instead grasps the essence, the heart, that makes the myth timeless and applicable to anyone with a beating heart. \\"East of Eden\\" is more than a biblical metaphor, more than good and evil; it's the story of the birth of man: the marriage of good and evil, and their residual struggle within man. Ultimately, it's the celabration of the free will that makes us human, and the simple joy of existence.This is a beautiful peace of literature. The writing is simplistic and a pleasure to read. Steinbeck's narration is well-crafted, and the plot trods along at a lofty and steady pace. Definitely the best piece of fiction I have read in a long, long time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's EAST OF EDEN was not well received by critics when it debuted in the 1950s, and although passing years have seen several re-evaluations it is still reguarded as secondary to the likes of GRAPES OF WRATH and OF MICE AND MEN. It is true that the novel is flawed: it is a great big rambling thing crammed with obvious allegory, metaphor, and allusion, loosely structured to say the least. And yet, in a odd sort of way, the very rambling, the looseness, the obviousness of the work gives it a tremendous grandeur that Steinbeck's more tightly structured work lacks. The novel is as broad and vulgar and lively and provocative as the America it describes--and it is my favorite of Steinbeck's fiction.Any one who comes to the novel from the famous film adaptation starring James Dean will be surprized, for the roots of the novel run much deeper than the film, which is based only on perhaps a third of the novel. This is not so much the story of brothers Aaron and Caleb Trask as it is the story of their parents, Adam Trask and Catherine Ames. And in \\"Cathy\\" Ames, Steinbeck creates one of the darkest characters in all of 20th Century American Literature, a creature devoid of virtually anything recognizable as human emotion. Fleeing from a past that includes murder, perversion, blackmail, and prostitution, Cathy assumes an angelic demeanor and lures the emotionally needy Adam Trask into love and marriage. And when she no longer requires his protection... she destroys him.It is the stuff of classic melodrama, but in Steinbeck's hands it becomes more than melodrama; it becomes a novel that alternately reads at leisurely pace and then suddenly reads with the speed of a whirlwind, a tale that forces us to consider the nature of good and evil and the legacies we may leave for later generations. For Adam and Cathy have two sons, and in the wake of their tragedy they will be left to fight out issues of moral choices, right and wrong, and love and hate in the sun-drenched Salinas Valley of California, the \\"golden west\\" of the \\"new world\\" as it rushes headlong into the modern age. It is a novel epic in history, geography, and morality.Some will find the novel's constant reference to the story of Cain and Able more than a little obvious; others will find it too meandering, filled with too many side-issues and minor subplots. Still others may be put off by the very slow way in which the novel gathers itself during its first hundred or so pages. But once the pieces are in place, Steinbeck suddenly pulls the threads together to create one of the most remarkable tapestries in American letters--a tapestry that has no clearcut boundaries and that, for all its simplistic tone, offers little in the way of simplistic answers to the issues it raises. Flawed, yes, but a great novel by a master of the form, so great that its flaws become intrinsic to its virtues. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It's always difficult reading a book that has been praised to the skies without expecting too much, and that's why it usually fails to deliver. Those who read it after this book became an Oprah Book Club selection seem to have come to it with just such expectations.Try, however, to always approach a book or movie, however much it has been praised, as any other. Simply pick it up and read it without any expectations. This is how I read it, and gosh, was I pleasantly surprised.The characters are people I wish I could know personally--especially Samuel, I wished I could be one of his many children just to have him as a father; Lee, so taciturn yet wise and always there, such a comfort to have and know such a person; and Caleb, whom we tend to identify with in so many ways.True, the story might have extremes, and be predictable if you were able to keep yourself so uninvolved in the story. Those who commented on the 'plot', perhaps such a book is not what you ought to read. Pick up a Grisham or some other fast-paced 'plotty' book.East of Eden is for those who think, who care about who they are and who they want to be or ought to have been. People have talked of its being depressing. It's not. I hate depressing books myself. At least it's not a meaningless depression in which you can't identify with the story at all, but it simply sucks you down. This book made me cry at many points--from empathy or sympathy for the characters, from the beauty of the language, and from appreciating the wisdom in it.I admire passages, descriptions, dialogues so much in this book that I re-read them, and re-read the entire novel already, and may do so again. I'm not the kind who likes to re-read books either. There's simply so much wisdom and simplicity and reassurance in here that it's a treasure--for me, at least. I think I'm lucky to have a book that means so much to me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck is at his best in this classic tale of sibling rivalry as he examines what we become vs. what we *may* become. The Biblical tale of Cain and Abel sets the tone as we are introduced to two sets of brothers. Each tries to win the love of his father in different ways. The story of why one brother succeeds while another feels unloved is beautifully told.Adam Trask, from the first set of brothers, repeats his own story with his sons, the twins Aron and Caleb. The enduring themes of light vs. dark, good vs. evil, hatred vs. love, and always the free will, the ability to choose one's own destiny are paramount to this rich and multi-layered tale.Above all, it is the characters you will long remember from this riveting saga. Cathy, the whore with a heart of stone, has to be one of the most evil characters in all literature. She kills her parents, beds her husband's brother on her wedding night, shoots her husband and desserts her infant sons. And, all this before she turns really bad! Truly a character to be analyzed for decades to come. On the other hand there are the wonderful characters of Samuel and Lee, men you will long remember for their wisdom, caring, and sheer goodness. And there is Adam, a zombie of a man until his great re-birth and spectacular failure finds him caught in a web of good and evil that he will long struggle with.John Steinbeck puts himself into the novel, as Samuel Hamilton is based on his own maternal grandfather. The entire Hamilton clan is one that represents the true \\"salt of the earth\\" and elevates this to \\"great American novel\\" stature.The story is complex and involving, the characters unforgettable. Kudos to Oprah for reviving interest in this wonderful story."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This one's dark folks. I have to say I didn't expect Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden,\\" to catch me the way it did. The themes Steinbeck struggles with are epic--the relationship of men within the family, good and evil, human nature. Critics derided the novel when it came out and it may have left Steinbeck struggling to write in his waning years, but the Nobel prize he received shortly after \\"East of Eden's\\" release was truly deserving. Truly deserving because of the work of \\"East of Eden,\\" and not despite it.I read the wonderful and incomparable biography \\"John Steinbeck, Writer,\\" by Jackson J. Benson before tackling \\"East of Eden,\\" and it tainted my expectations. Some criticisms of the novel I found initially true. Steinbeck seems to be more straightforward and writes more of what's on his mind instead of letting the story and characters breathe these things naturally. At some point in the novel that approach strikes me as breaking the novelist dictum of, \\"show don't tell.\\" Steinbeck does a lot of telling. Surprisingly enough, in the end, this slight misstep strengthens the overall story. It puts you in the mind of Steinbeck and allows the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the dark dark nature of some of \\"East of Eden's\\" characters.Steinbeck always tended to have a dark side, but \\"East of Eden,\\" is a stark look at the underbelly of humanity. However, while we are looking at the underbelly of a seemingly upright community of Salinas, we also see that humanity is redeeming. Some of the very incomprehensible evil within a person is matching by a boundless capacity for good. How can that be? This is why Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden,\\" surpasses the better known and wider read, \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" Steinbeck seems to accept human nature and not sugar coat. He tells it like it is.Steinbeck struggled and struggled to write and finish \\"East of Eden.\\" The scope of what he was trying to attempt was extremely daunting...almost debilitatingly so. Steinbeck tried to retell the story of \\"Genesis,\\" set in his hometown of Salinas...drawing from his own life, the town's life, the times between the Civil War and World War I. He pulls it off with quite some characters...Adam Trask and his twin sons Caleb and Aron, their mother--the completely evil Cathy/Cat/Kate, Adam's evenly evil and good brother Charles, the sage Chinese Lee, and the beautiful of mind, body, and spirit love interest of no less than Caleb, Aron, and Lee...Abra. I think to call, \\"East of Eden,\\" lacking in story and characters is severely missing the mark. Another criticism of the book is that the Chinese character of Lee is a racial stereotype. I didn't find this to be the case. Lee seems to be a multi-dimensional character that if anything deepens the understanding that his ethnicity takes a back seat to his humanity. Another criticism is that the character Kate is too evil...to the point of dehumanization. Steinbeck's portrayal of Kate may have roots in his failed relationships but it does not come across as misogynistic. He balances this out with other female characters, such as Abra, that have capacity for the gamut of human characteristics. Kate's portrayal of evil makes the character more real...more frightening...and indicative of human evil that, regardless of philosophy, tends to surface from time to time.In my mind, Steinbeck's \\"Cannery Row,\\" still stands out as his best (at least among his works I've read so far), but \\"East of Eden,\\" solidifies his place among a very short list of greatest American authors. It is a work deserving of a Nobel Prize for literature...damn the critics to say what they will.--MMW"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden, which was a late, great masterpiece in the author's career, is also one of the greatest American novels of all-time. The book is unique in many ways, with many idiosyncrasies, some of them quite out of Steinbeck's usual style. To start with, many of Steinbeck's works are overtly political; among these are some of his best and best-known works. East of Eden is not among them. As the title suggests, and almost every mention of the book points out, the book is a modern retelling of the Biblical Cain and Abel story. Contrary to what such proclamations -- not to mention Oprah -- might lead one to think, however, this is not a theological, a religious, or a Christian book: the Cain and Abel allegory is the bare bones that Steinbeck uses to prop up his own visionary, allegorical masterpiece. Aside from its non-political nature, Eden is also distinctive in the Steinbeck canon for other reasons. For one, it features almost no dialect, unlike most of his other famous works; Steinbeck's deceptively simple prose is at its best here, clear and yet philosophical. It also has a much different structure than, say, The Grapes of Wrath: though it tells the parallel and intersecting stories of two families, it does not feature alternating chapters; it also tends to be quite discursive. It also proves to be quite distinctive for other reasons: as an allegory, this is not a psychological novel. The actions of the characters in the novel are presented, more or less, per se, without their actions being unduly analyzed and without their inner thoughts being much probed. Their actions are not explained: they simply ARE. In the case of the perpetually evil Cathy, this can be somewhat frustrating; much of the novel's criticism has focused upon her believability as a character. On that note, it is worthwhile to remember that, in keeping with the book's Biblical bent, she symbolizes Satan. Cathy sees only the bad in people and exploits it for her own purposes. Her downfall comes because she fails to ever see the other side of the coin.And the fact that there are two sides of the coin is the point of the book. The novel is Steinbeck's wake-up call to everyone drifting toward a determinist future. Yes, we have evil coursing through our veins -- but we also have good. Which one we choose to make use of is our own choice -- and no one's but our own. No matter whom our parents are, no matter what our circumstances may be, no matter what others may think of us -- the choice, in the end, resides with us, and us alone. Steinbeck also explores some of his other favorite themes in this monumental work. One of these is the inexplicability of love, symbolized both for Adam's apparently-unfounded yet mysterious love for Cathy and by Cyrus and Adam's preference for one son over another. Another is the consequences of not being loved -- of rejection. Charles and Cal believe that their respective fathers do not love them; they use this thought to justify much of their sometimes questionable behavior. This would seem to be the message of the book for many: that parents must love their children equally, that rejection and favoritism have, sometimes quite literally, murderous consequences and can lead to cruelty and hatred. With such an interpretation, the doctrine of original sin has its origins not in the Fall of Adam and Eve, but in God's rejection of Cain's gift. Such is the reading on the novel's glossy surface. However, it is well to remember that Cathy IS loved; and yet, not only does she does not love back, she carries out her evil deeds all the more -- not IN SPITE of her being loved, but perhaps even BECAUSE of it. This relates back to Steinbeck's true message: it the end the choice between good and evil, right and wrong, love and hate -- regardless of rejection, regardless of whether or not we are loved -- is ours, and ours alone.Timshel!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck proposed four potential titles before he settled upon East of Eden. I looked up the phrase in the Bible and found that it appears twice in Genesis (3:24 and 4:16); both accounts denoting an instance where man experienced a separation from the blessings that God had intended for him. I think this is very significant as we consider what Steinbeck was writing about in his allegorical novel. He says in Chapter 34, &quot;We have only one story. All novels, all poetry are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal.&quot;The contest is in ourselves! Surely this is what East Of Eden teaches us while we enjoy the sweeping story, so well told. It is deadly realistic, as beautiful and revolting as is the actual human potentiality for good and evil. With brilliance, Steinbeck contrasts a sea of temperaments in these characters, and shows us all the while that life is much more than the choices we make, but it is never any less. Adam Trask is the representative of good intentions, of a conscience which responds to the good as the eye responds to the light. Samuel Hamilton also represents a similar (perhaps even more well-honed) goodness. But Adam is the one who has been deceived, by a force every bit as essentially evil as Eden's serpent in the tree. This is Cathy, a character so reprobate that evil isn't something she does, it's something she IS that INFECTS everything she does! After abandoning her twin boys Caleb and Aron to the care of their father (Adam) she returns to her life of debauchery. The boys grow up unaware that their mother is a serial murderer and owner of a whorehouse. Because Adam never fully recovers from his shame, his loss and disillusionment, he is not able to convey the appropriate unconditional (equally distributed) love to his sons. This leads to jealousy and rivalry in his boys, and is a generational replica of his own childhood.How can one summarize such a vast epic story? But for me, one of the most powerful scenes and a turning point (perhaps the denouement?) is when Caleb finally sees his mother in all her non-glory, and says to her... &quot;I don't have to be you.&quot; The reader can notice that really no-one is the same from this point on, there is a real unravelling here. For Cathy (now &quot;Kate&quot;), this marks the beginning of her own self-destruction, the awakening of her own conscience. She's been defied!One of the tendencies of the modern age is to deny radically the absolute nature of conscience, reducing it to a matter of temperament, or to a product of history or social environment. But East of Eden plows right through a tangle of sociological, psychological, and historical half-truths to the elementray fact: CONSCIENCE EXISTS."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"How wonderful that, through Oprah's discovery of it, so many readers will immerse themselves in this rich novel! I've loved it since my freshman year of college (I spent a weekend devouring it after seeing the James Dean film.) I live in Northern California now, and Steinbeck's description of the Salinas Valley in spring rings true to me each year. EAST OF EDEN is the Cain and Abel story (note how the names of Cathy, Abra and the Trasks start with C or A), but it's also the realization that through that story, we have been granted freedom of choice, for good or ill. And it is Steinbeck's own story; the Hamiltons were his mother's family, and how I loved getting acquainted with them. I very much appreciate Lee, who subtly represents the multifaceted history of the Chinese people in this area. There is US history, from the Civil War to WWI, and the settling of California. And there is, ultimately, the triumph of love over the evil of shame and doubt. The defining moment falls in the exact center of the book: Steinbeck was a master storyteller, and I am ever grateful he shared this one with us."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book has it all--sweeping themes which are common to all people, fascinating and flawed characters, and an interesting interweaving of people's choices and the impact this has on those around them. The novel is based on the Biblical account of Cain and Abel in the book of Genesis. Steinbeck dwells on the sibling rivalry which pits one brother against another for their father's love. This occurs in two generations with Charlie and Adam in the first generation and Adam's twin sons Cal and Aron in the second. There are fascinating characters, such as the wicked Cathy who finds men's weaknesses and preys on them for her own gain, the wise and philosophical Chinese servant Lee, and the wonderful dreamer named Samuel Hamilton. The Hamilton family is patterned after Steinbeck's maternal family and he sometimes takes side-trips to the plot in order to tell some family tale which has been passed on to him by oral tradition. Another interesting theme has to do with dreamers, like Adam and Aron, who only see what they want to see, and realists, such as Samuel's wife, whose view is likewise narrowed by her practical nature. Abra starts out as a dreamer, but grows into a woman who sees the greys in life and learns to accept them without letting them detroy her. A favorite theme seems to deal with paternal expectations and how these can overpower and sometimes detroy a son. Steinbeck delves into the question of inherited predisposition towards sin and resoundingly concludes that we all have choices and we are not driven totally by our genetic disposition. This is a fascinating study of human nature and of good vs. evil and is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is not as famous or as widely recognised as The Grapes of Wrath or Of Mice and Men, but it is interesting that the author considered all previous books as 'practice' for the great novel of his life, which is East of Eden. (Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters)This novel, together with Burning Bright, is my favourite of Steinbeck books.It runs in two parallel story lines - one of the Trasks where the Cain and Abel fable is replicated in two generations; and that of the Hamiltons, Steinbeck's own maternal family - the telling is fun and full of affection and great tenderness, especially the portrayal of Samuel, Steinbeck's grandfather. The effect of the parallel stories, which cross only very tenuously gives the effect of a very great scope of the novel, a full sweep of history, and place and time immortal.I could give a very bland description of what happens - but I won't because it is a poor copy of what Steinbeck does a thousand times better. What I can write about is that reading this story (and I have read it many times) always gives me a full, satisfied feeling. I think it is because it covers the great extremes of many themes, and all in between. Great good, and monstrous evil; love and hate ... all mixed up in a complex soup, which is perhaps as simple as any experience of life.Ironically, my favourite characters are the very very good Samuel, and the very very bad Cathy."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you want to read an author who can almost effortlessly draw you into the tapestry of his characters, in 600 pages and yet without frittering away a single word, then you have to love Steinbeck! What makes this 1952 novel the timeless opus that I believe it is (now fortunately in new paperback version thanks to Oprah,) is that ANY reader can relate to it on so many levels.You may find the story winding and complicated at the outset, peopled by characters that are often virtuous in some ways and flawed in others. But soon you'll realize how real these people are, and you'll be reading on if only to figure out what happens to each of them. The plot and the author's beautiful descriptive passages pull you along at a refreshing pace once you are into it.Although the main character's name is Adam, it's the Biblical story of Cain and Abel that is played out over and over with characters whose names begin with \\"C\\" and \\"A\\". Adam's father, Cyrus, is quite the wild man. Adam's brother, Charles, tries to kill him. Adam's wife, Cathy, abandons him and their newborn twins to pursue the lifestyle of evil she cannot escape. Their children Aron and Caleb continue as opponents trying to vie for their father's attention until the bitter end.And when you finish trudging through the entire thing, you'll feel like having actually lived and breathed the philosophies and lessons of a lifetime. Steinbeck's acute awareness of the interplay of his themes despite his lingusitic economy is an absolute joy to behold. His characters are specific and alive, mirroring real people and their foibles.I highly recommend this classic piece of literature but be prepared to read. It's not your average pulp."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\", although a bit long, is a truely worthwhile read. John Steinbeck paints a magnificent portrait of the Salinas Valley, his hometown, and encompasses The Hamilton family and the Trasks in a unique fashion. Though spanning several generations and jumping around a bit, Mr. Steinbeck composes a compelling epic tale which revolves around the fall of Adam and Eve, and the famous rivalry betwixt Cain and Abel.Steinbeck sections the novel into four parts. The theme of Part I [impulses] leads directly into what man desires most in life [glory], the theme of Part II. The greatest glory man can achieve for himself and for God, is to overcome sin through being gven a choice (which is discussed in reference to the Cain and Abel aspect). The theme of Part III is the choice that God gave to Cain [timshel] which means \\"thou mayest\\"...indicating that although he has sinned, he will overcome in the end. The theme of Part IV ties in all of the prior focuses: Man is likely to fall into sin as a result of the 'rejection cycle'. [Desire to achieve Glory] - [Rejection] - [Anger] - [Crime] - [Guilt]. Steinbeck's characters discuss this idea, and if applied to almost any character in the novel, one is able to see how the cycle works in each life.The Elia Kazan-directed film starring James Dean is very well made, however in correlation to the novel itself, does not do it justice as it only covers Part IV. The fact is that you simply cannot cover the time and experiences of a 600+ page novel in a concise manner. To capture the true essence of Steinbeck's message. Don't be intimidated by the size...once you pick it up, you will find that the intimate relationship you develop with the characters forbids you to lay it down."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was at first reluctant to read such a long novel. I did not want to read it but my fellow students encouraged me so. However, they gave me no certain reason as to why I should. Naturally, I was driven by the sheer curiosity to read it.Now, having read the novel, I must encourage others to read it. The story unwinds in the Salinas Valley with the Hamiltons living peacefully. The gazing mountains and river valleys depict the scene. On the other hand, there is the Trask family led by Cyrus. Therefore, this novel is an interplay between two separate plots. Samuel Hamilton, an immigrant, leads a busy and honest life. However, Cyrus resorts to dishonesty and earns a gracious amount of money. The main plot revolves around the Trask Family for even the title, East of Eden reflects the generations of the Trasks.Cyrus Trask has two sons by the name of Charles and Adam. It is as if Charles is inherently evil and Adam, good. They draw comparisons to the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Furthermore, Adam bores and names two twin sons in Caleb and Aron with the knowledge of the story of Cain and Abel. Therefore, Caleb suffers as he is forced to be inherently bad. However, Caleb's life changes when Lee, the family mentor, discovers the true meaning of Timshel- \`Thou mayest.' This Hebrew meaning breaks the misconceptions of the past in that people are predetermined to triumph over evil or not. The bitter irony in this is that Caleb actually is blessed by Adam even after a rueful past and chooses to start anew, a new life.I strongly suggest you reading this novel even if you were intimidated by the length of it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Various people have described East of Eden as a novel about various things and with various themes. The resemblance to the biblical tale of Cain and Abel, enduring conflict between good and evil, and choice of will ... all are mentioned. The book's back cover contributes also: \\"mystery of identity; inexplicability of love; and the murderous consequences of love's absence.\\" Precisely what makes East of Eden such a great book is this proliferation of ideas and themes, which can quickly draw the reader into a profound and enlightened state of mind.However, this depth isn't the only reason for you to buy this book. Though this book could easily be the subject of a college thesis, at the same time it can be read merely for the joy of casual reading. The book includes numerous interesting and colorful characters. The reader meets Lee, the Chinese cook-philosopher whose role changes from that of servant to companion...Adam, Kate's wife (only legally) the sometimes painfully honest farmer around whose life much of the book evolves.However, even the best books can have minor flaws. For one who is less-than-interested in reading, this 602 page novel (minus the introduction, which is worth reading, but not before finishing the book) could turn into a reading marathon. Also, the book is written in a unique alternating format: one chapter will focus on the Trask family, and the next on the Hamiltons.

After I moved to California and visited Salinas and Monterey, I became excited about the idea of rereading all Steinbeck's novels and I began with this one. Time and intent has definitely changed this work for me. I was compelled to follow the interactions between the various characters almost as though I were on a drug. The parallel relationships that exist between the two different sets of brothers was, for me, the most profound aspect of this book. I felt at first, that the character of Charles Trask was completely underdeveloped until I realised that in fact, his character was continued through that of his nephew (son) Cal. I was extremely interested in the way that Steinbeck dealt with prejudice and how he chose to make Lee - the character that most of the other characters at first disregard - the most insightful character. I have added this book to my permanent collection and there are passages in it that I will reread again and again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"So we all know that this book has many parallels to the story of Cain and Abel. What I really liked is that Steinbeck took this seemingly simple story of sibling rivalry, jelousy and murder and applied it to the human condition as a whole. Was Cain evil? Why? How evil do you have to be to be evil? Think evil thoughts, do evil deeds, feel malice in your heart? Ultimately, this story explains the struggles we all have with our dark sides. Some characters recognize their faults and shortcomings and try to overcome them. Other characters accept the bad and either exploit it, learn from it, or learn to live with it. Steinbeck takes these simple ideas/questions and applies them to a variety of characters of different ethnic and social backgrounds. Steinbeck did a wonderful job with character development. There is even good to be found in Cathy, although you have to dig. I would definitely reccomend this novel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have read all of Steinbeck's books and have taught most of them in my classes. East of Eden is, in my opinion, his best work and possibly one of the best American novels, if not the best, of the 20th century. I highly recommend it to all lovers of great literature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read East of Eden when I was 20, and in the Army in Europe. I found myself in the story, finding similarities in the life of the character James Dean played in the movie to what happened in my life.It seemed the story took all those pages to unfold until the moment that the brother in the Cain and Abel tale was told that in life, it was not about what you should do or not do but that &quot;thou mayest.&quot;Brought up by parents who had picked fruit in the Depression and lived tough times, I pondered on elements of East of Eden for a long time.It simply is a story that reads and needs to be read. It is so insightful. It's brilliance is hard to measure. And it is a classic that stands the tests of time. You could read it at any time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"How does Steinbeck gain entrance into the souls of people, to view what they are really like? I am a man of forty, and I literally wept at the wonder of this novel. To see that others have the same thoughts, feelings, yearnings as myself even from a half century ago is stunning. I didn't want this book to end because I had become part of the family, and you never want the family to end. It amazes me how Steinbeck can write deeply, but his writing is readable. He really just sucks you into his world, you feel as though you are there around the table, discussing the Hebrew word, looking out the house into the valley, or staring at the house where the &quot;circus&quot; is going on. I enjoy many other authors, but I can't think of any that can draw you into their world as completely as John Steinbeck, and East of Eden, to me, is the apex of his work."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"the first book i read by steinbeck was \\"the grapes of wrath\\" which was quite a feat at the time. while i enjoyed the book i wasn't sure i wan't to read more steinbeck. then i picked up \\"of mice and men\\" and knew i had to read more books by this author who had left me in tears at the end of a mere 150 pages. (by the way, i highly recommend both of those books)when i picked up east of eden i had no idea what i would be beginning, besides a whopping 650 pages. the book started off a little slowly, but was intriguing becuase i live in california and have spent some time in salinas valley. then the story started to pick up, and i was into it. steinbeck put together a web of stories that introduced characters and wove together to from a massive literary net. i found each character to be as alive as my best friend; they were all developed to the fullest. every character spends their time as the main character of the book, and while it sounds confusing it is amazingly effective and paints a rich picture of each person. this makes the whole experience of the general story unique and more detailed than most authors could hope to achieve.my favorite character in this book is lee, the chinese man who started off as a minor and creepy character but devolped into a person i could swear could visit me in the flesh and start an intriguing conversation. i recommend the book just for the experience of getting to know lee.about halfway through there is a hefty discussion about the bible, and for an atheist like myself it was a bit of a turn off at first. but then i saw how steinbeck was using the moral of the story, and not examining the actual fictional or factual (whatever your belief) events of the story of eden.i cannot comprehend how steinbeck turned out this monster of a novel. it is moving, exciting, somethines disturbing, and enriching, and is a feat of the human mind and spirit. i think steinbeck often is underappreciated as agreat american novelist, but after reading \\"east of eden\\" you will never be able to stop raving."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I love John Steinbeck and have never know another author I've enjoyed so much. He gets a little carried away at times with descriptions of his homeland, but this is by far the greatest novel ever written. If you truely want a review of this book just start by reading the dedication. I believe he says it all there."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck showed me once again his amazing storytelling abilities in East of Eden. The character of Lee is one of the greatest characters in an American novel, but, unfortunately, the rest of Eden's characters are rather 2-dimensional. Although the lessons directed towards the reader are important, Steinbeck went a little bit too heavy on the analogies. It had some flaws, but Steinbeck's storytelling is able to pull it up."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I love Steinbeck and was excited to read this novel. Well, it wasn't his best. It is a very long book and I think there were less insights in the 600+ pages than in the 90 pages of &quot;The Pearl.&quot; The major insight can be summed up as &quot;timshel&quot; meaning thou mayest. Mostly, the novel is about the Trask family... two brother, hmm, Caleb and Arron (?) anyway, Cain and Able. It's also a history of sorts of the Steinbeck family. One part I didn't like was the extreme sexism. Both in lack of female characters but also in the main female character (Kathy) being a cold-blooded... Sure, some women are mean..., but there are sweeping generalities about all women being teases, cold, etc etc. The parts about the Chinese man (Lee) are very good. Overall, I like other Steinbecks better... try Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men, The Wayward Bus, or Cannery Row. Just my opinion."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. The characters were vivid and memorable, almost larger than life but still retaining a realness to them to make them believable. The tale of seeking to understand oneself and the ways of the world were inspiring to me. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one of the best books ever! I enjoyed it from cover to cover. It was amazing. I really loved the plot and I identified with the characters. The whole theme of forgiveness really touched me and it really made me think about everything. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one book that I picked up to read over my vacation at the beach. I finished it before we even got to the beach. I knew I liked Steinbeck, but I had never heard of this one before (unlike The Grapes Of Wrath, Of Mice And Men, etc.) Boy, am I glad I picked it up! At the part where Adam Trask goes to his wife's whorehouse to finally face her, and comes out triumphant, I had to stop reading and let out a shout of victory. This book also made me cry, laugh, get angry and sad. It's one of the few books I have read that has made me feel so many different emotions. To any of you who have read the book already, Timshel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"this book made me feel higher than ever. Grapes of wrath isn't half as good as this and I want to mention my appreciation for you, John."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is okay, but extremely disappointing after reading several other Steinbeck novels and stories. The book's characters all got lumped into stereotypes and became two dimensional leaving a great story and plot empty of anything real. As a whole the book was average, but subpar for Steinbeck."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck expressed everything in a clear, vivid way and he dared to include \\"whore\\" as one of the character. Though I'm not a Christian, this story touches me for weeks... and I truly enjoy reading every page."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A Christian Critiqueon John Steinbeck's East of EdenEditorial #28 by Joseph Yosuk LeeJohn Steinbeck has an interesting view that man is more loving than God Himself. Despite Steinbeck's incorrect view of God, East of Eden is actually based on the book of Genesis from the Bible. The Bible says that God is just and hates sin, but He also values our obedience. This is why Abel obeyed God by offering an appropriate sacrifice. On the other hand, Cain disobeyed God by offering a sacrifice tainted by his depravity, and by murdering his brother Abel. Cain was jealous of God's blessings to Abel, and he was hurt when God rejected him. Steinbeck believes that it seems unfair from his perspective that God blessed Abel for his obedience and rejected Cain for his disobedience.In East of Eden, John Steinbeck portrays Adam Trask as a type of God and Cal and Aron (Adam Trask's sons) as a type of Cain and Abel, respectively. Adam Trask acknowledged Aron, the character representing Abel, because Aron obeyed his father by going to Stanford even though Aron wanted to drop out of college. Later, Cal, the jealous brother, indirectly murdered Aron although Aron was actually killed in World War I. Adam Trask forgave Cal, while God did not forgive Cain. For this reason, John Steinbeck believes that God is far less loving than man.John Steinbeck failed to see that Cain had no remorse for his sin against his brother, while Cal did. Cain never asked God to forgive him, while Cal asked his father to forgive him. Last of all, John Steinbeck failed to see that Adam Trask was a finite and sinful man. Adam Trask did not possess the infinite and eternal characteristics of our holy God. Even if Adam Trask were a perfect and sinless angel from heaven, Adam Trask did not have the infinite power to pay the penalty for Cal's sin. Only Jesus Christ can do that"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I reread this book and realized that it is one of my all time favorites. His use of the language, characters and crises brings together the most powerful personalities and emotions described as only Steinbeck could do it. Treat yourself to a revisit and you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read this book 38 years ago and the characters in this book remain as vivid as the California landscape that Steinbeck masterfully details. Who can forget Cathy's innocent-faced evil, Adam Trask's flawed goodness, Lee's dual identity as undeucated coolie in public and intellectual in private, Cal's pain at being rejected by his father, Kate's murderous duplicity or Samuel's strength in friendship? The dry foothills of California's Salinas Valley, the rough side of Salinas (the town where Steinbeck grew up), Monterey, even San Francisco's Chinatown are lovingly detailed in this portrait of the California of Steinbeck's early years. Members of the Steinbeck family including John make cameo appearances in the book, although a reader would need to have that fact pointed out. Curiously Steinbeck allows no motivation for Cathy's (Kate's) evil- she appears to be simply bad seed, whereas Caleb's greatest sins are seen as understandable reaction to Adam's failings as a father. But is Caleb doomed to evil? As Adam says on his dathbed, \\"Timshel\\", \\"Thou mayest\\" triumph over evil."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The length of the book is long, but I didn't mind AT ALL. When I finished reading it, I hadn't wanted it to end. I wanted to keep along with the Trasks, and the Hamiltons. I wanted to see what became of Caleb and Abra and Lee. The Characters were great, and did not want to leave them. This book has some of the most dynamic characters. Each character had a very important part in the book. I believe that character and symbolism were the most dominant elements to this book. Steinbeck's imagination created a group of great 3-dimensional characters that you didn't want to leave. I liked diging down into the characters, and analyzing their symbolism... Sam Hamilton got me the most by far... and Cathy. The surprises kept me reading, and there were times when I couldn't put it down. Great Great book"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a very good book, but not my favorite from Steinbeck. (Unfortunately any book by John Steinbeck automatically gets compared to other books by......John Steinbeck. That's pretty tough competition.)The main drawback for me was the characters - they weren't as &quot;real&quot; as others he's created. In the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;, for instance, I could easily imagine any of the characters as actual people I could meet (if I lived in the 30's). I didn't feel that way about anyone in this book. I realize he made everyone more extreme to help show the contrast of good vs evil, but a 5-star novel should be able to make a strong point about human nature without resorting to characters that are often more symbolic than real.Having said that, this is still a wonderful book to read. One aspect I loved (that I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews) is how Steinbeck wove the story of a region &quot;growing up&quot; with the stories of his characters. Too often, the history of an area talks in great detail about how it was first discovered and settled - and then jumps all the way to the present. But sometimes the most interesting stories are how an area got to the present - How did all the land get taken? How did people react to the first cars? What were the early cities like? This book has all those little tidbits and more - telling us how the Salinas Valley grew up.And, like so many other reviewers, I found the philisophical journeys amazing. The story of &quot;timshel&quot; (&quot;thou mayest&quot;, versus &quot;thou shalt&quot; or &quot;do thou&quot;) was great, and chapter 34 distilled good versus evil down to its essence - I got chills reading it. Another reviewer called Steinbeck a genius, and I agree. Still, I don't think East of Eden compares to some of his other greater works."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I am amazed by critics here ripping apart Steinbeck's writing ability. my only previous exposure was &quot;The Pearl&quot; and &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; in high school years ago. I read this book on a friend's recommendation and was moved by Steinbeck's powerful use of language. The Chinese cook Lee and his commentary on the Cain and Abel story helped me understand the importance of man's free will in ways I never had before. What more can we ask of great literature beyond a new understanding?"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It was a great read, perfect for vacation"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Reading this book is not like reading a book; it is like living several lives at once. It is like listening to a beautiful piece of music and feeling your soul awaken so that tears of joy fill your eyes. East of Eden is long, detailed, and very slow. Don't try to read it all at once. Savor it as you would life itself. Pray that it never ends even though you know it will. It is a shame that this book never got the acclaim it deserves. The conversations between Lee, Adam, and Samuel are so amazing and full of truth. I am constantly fascinated by John Steinbeck's innate knowledge of people. It was his greatest gift and he used it as well as anyone could."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read this book when I was in junior high.Soon afterwards we took a family vacation toNorthern California, where we visited John Steinbeck'shouse. As I stood in the foyer of his home, my thoughtswere, approximately: &quot;OH MY GOD. JOHN STEINBECK STOODHERE. EAST OF EDEN. RIGHT HERE.&quot; In high school, afriend of mine become so absorbed in the tale that she readit as she walked home from school. Uphill.This novel is full of passion, ecstacy and heartache.It follows three generations of one family in theSalinas Valley, modernizing the Biblical tale ofCain and Abel. The prose is beautiful and unusuallydescriptive, even for Steinbeck. Read it and laugh,smile and weep."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Evaluation: I first heard about this book from Oprah's book club. It made me interested in the book because of the high praise she was giving it, which persuaded me to read it. The beginning of the book starts off talking about several different families, jumping from one family to the next in each chapter. It made it a little difficult to tell what was going on and where the heck the story was leading. After I got an understanding of where the book was going, I wasn't able to put the book down because I wanted to see what was going to happen next. The book is very versatile, having action, laughs, drama, and that always exciting anticipation. It's a book unlike one that I have ever read. It doesn't focus on one idea in which the book revolves. The book is told through generations, giving the novel many ideas to revolve around, keeping the reader interested at all times in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I feel almost guilty for not liking this book more.I was excited to read East of Eden. I think it is fabulous that Oprah decided to reinstate her book club with a focus on the classics. In addition, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" were highpoints in my junior and high school English classes. Even the themes, Cain versus Abel, good versus evil, destiny versus free will, seemed so potentially powerful, juicy and deep.Yet I found myself only mildly immersed in the novel. The symbolism seemed overdone, the dialogue unnatural, the character development lacking. A very masculine read, most of the female characters, with the exception of Abra, were either extremely unlikable or underdeveloped. If Cathy's role as the evil temptress is a nod to Eve in the Bible, it seemed a bit extreme.To be honest, the story does weave the themes throughout the story in an interesting way. Steinbeck's descriptive narrative can be beautiful, but can also be a bit long winded. Sam Hamilton, the wise, bumbling lover of words and dreams, and Lee, the Trask family servant and subtle family advisor, were interesting characters.At times, I felt that Steinbeck was looking for opportunities to brag about his ancestry and these side bars were not always of much value in the long saga.In a nutshell, I felt reading this book was an accomplishment, one that brought relief when it was over."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I LOVE this book!

A great balance of good, evil, and everything in between."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was looking for a cheap copy of this book so that I could mark it up and write a term paper on it without messing up my good copy. What else can I say except that it's an excellent story and the book held up in spite of my violent underlining?"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is, in my opinion, Steinbeck's opus. I will spare you the praise that everyone has so readily offered and focus on the Centennial Edition itself. I love it. I love the look, I love the binding and the cover, and I love how the pages are sort of roughed and uneven along the edges. It gives the book a unique feel, a character, something that says \\"classic\\" which is what a book should say for this story.Get the Centennial Edition if you can over the Oprah's Book club edition, which has a big red banner and obtrusive font on it which, I feel, mars the quality of the story that the book holds. I borrowed the original from the library ages ago, and only recently bought two copies for two friends who loved it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Calling East of Eden \\"Steinbeck's masterpiece\\" is a bit misleading, like saying JFK was Joe's \\"best kid.\\" It depends on your criteria, for starters. If I could only save one Steinbeck novel from a fire, it would be Grapes of Wrath, not East of Eden. East of Eden begins with a few hundred pages of sentences you can savor one after the other. Once Caleb and Aron come along, things bog down a bit, and that sense that you are spending every minute with something delicious and fine wavers a bit. But Steinbeck pulls it all together in the final pages, and it's worth the wait.This is not a novel for the impatient. If you are looking for sex and violence, chances are your tastes are too jaded to appreciate what you will find here. Steinbeck doesn't tell you in gynecological detail what she does with the cigarette, for example, or devote a dozen pages to Cathy's beating. It's not a novel for the flippantly cynical; I don't share Steinbeck's opinion, but his fundamental belief in the goodness of humankind is touching and admirable, because it is not just polyester sentiment.Mercifully for the reading illiterate, Elia Kazan's film is brilliant and reasonably close to the novel, so you can \\"know\\" East of Eden without the bother of reading it. But if you have an interest in the writer's craft, you will be missing something special. The almost mystic lyricism of Grapes of Wrath is modulated here into an elegaic prose, and Steinbeck's politics are not on the forestage. But Sam Hamilton and Lee are American types no one captured more accurately and completely, and Lee's insistence, that the story of Cain is THE story, the only story, turns out, as things come to a close, to make more sense than one might wish."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The quintessential story of good vs. evil. Steinbeck was at his best in his \\"Big Book.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is one of my favorite books. Most of the book takes place in the farmland of the Salinas Valley in northern California. It's a big book and has lots of characters but the main characters are Adam Trask and his twin sons Aaron and Caleb. Adam is a good man but sometimes very simpleminded. He sees things black and white and can be stubborn. His two sons are complete opposites. Since Aaron does what his father wants, he's Adam's favorite. Caleb, or Cal, can't do anything right in his father's eyes and so tries hard to win his love.My favorite part of this book is how personal Steinbeck makes it. He doesn't just talk about the Trask family; he also spends a lot of time telling about his mother's family. It makes it seem like the story he's telling could be real, or at least it's rooted in his family history. The first time I read it made me wonder what my neighbors were up to and what type of stories they were hiding.As much as I like the book, I wish there was more about the Chinese servant Lee. Lee would go into Chinatown in San Francisco and it made me want to know what happened there.I would recommend this book to people who like well told stories about the problems families create for themselves."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a masterpiece second to Grapes of Wrath among Steinbecks works. The novel is heavily allegorical so if you dont like allegory even if well done you wont like this novel. However the allegory works for me and I enjoy welldone allegory. The novel is quite philosophical at times but it is compelling throughout.I enjoy a more philosophical novel so this really works for me. This is a masterpiece and is thought provoking on the nature of good and evil and how initial perceptions can dominate a person that even reality cannot break it down completely as Adams misjudgement of Catherine leads him to favor the son that strongly resembles her with bad results a great novel"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A beautiful and moving family saga based on Steinbeck's own family history and the story of Cain and Abel from the book of Genesis in the Bible. It's always nice when you read a classic and realize it's a classic because it's wonderfully written, evocative, and resonates with your own understanding of the human condition. The Hamilton family, dreamers and farmers without financial success, interact with the Trasks, a successful but troubled family. Lee, Trask's Chinese cook, is an especially attractive, nuanced, and non-stereotypical character, while Cathy Ames, Trask's faithless sociopathic wife, is one of the most fearful villains in literature. Especially moving are the theological debates about freedom and destiny between Hamilton, Trask, and Lee. A must-read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was really impressed by the characters and themes that Steinbeck drew and tackled in this novel. I was blown away especially by the character of Lee since he plays such an important role in the novel and he's Chinese. At the time of the novel and its publication, I could not think of characters in novels or in film where minorities were not caricatures or stereotypically portrayed, so I was really surprised to find Lee so well drawn out. He was such a significant moral force in the story.I've read Steinbeck's other work and this is his masterpiece. For 600 pages, you get to live with these characters and it's sad when the book ends. The only thing to do is to reread and it's definitely one of those books worth rereading."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was beyond excited to be reading this book. I had never read Steinbeck before, and I was itching to start. Well, let me say, it was a difficult thing to do. Steinbeck's style is interesting. He's not so much verbose as he is long-winded. You won't find the abundance of adjectives that characterize Fitzgerald's works, but you're going to find a lot of sentences. As such, the story moves at a plodding pace. Now, considering that the story also spans roughly three generations, well... It makes for quite a long read.But if you can get over the pacing and the style, it makes for a very good read. There's no apparent plot in this book; it simply follows the the life of a family over the years. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it gives the story a lack of direction at times. More or less, the story exists not in and of itself, but rather as a vehicle for the theme: choice. Some might call it good vs. evil, but that's not it at all. It's rather the choice between the two, or to be somewhere in between. There are a lot of religious allusions made in this book, and they might go over the heads of some.Characters here are interesting to say the least. At the surface, some are unequivocally evil, others pure as snow. And yet, at the end of the book, you're left wondering if that was so. There's an illusion of flatness with many of the characters, especially Adam and Cathy, when in fact each one is incredibly deep. The other characters are all interesting, realistic in the most part, and people you can deeply feel for.Overall, the book is deserving of being called a classic, if only for it's deep theme. Everything else is really peripheral to that it seems, though not lacking. Steinbeck's style might put some off, but if you can overcome it, then a great ride awaits."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I'm not going to summarize the book, just give my opinion. East of Eden is great, which is something to be said by me because I am not a John Steinbeck fan. It was brilliantly written and truly enchanting. I recommend this book to any kind of reader, young or old. Some parts were slow, but definitely worth it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"For years I've wanted to tackle Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden.\\" I knew going in that it was a retelling of sorts of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, and the sin that \\"crouches on your doorstep, waiting to devour.\\" I suspected Steinbeck would make it his own, setting in his beloved Salinas, California. What I did not expect was this sprawling, gritty, wise, and sometimes beautiful classic.Adam and Charles Trask are the first set of protagonists, two brothers at odds. They are only precursors for Adam's own sons, Cal and Aron, who will be even more at odds, a division rooted in part in their mother's cold-hearted choices and philandering. Cathy/Kate, their mom, is one of the most vivid and three-dimensional portrayals of evil I've ever read in fiction. Adding some moral balance to the cast is Lee, the loyal and long-suffering Chinaman. His studies lead to life-changing decisions for Adam and his sons, based on the differences between a fatalistic approach to life or one born from the freedom to choose.While the story reads at times like an exploration of the early to mid-1900s, Steinbeck parallels this earthy tale with the slow unfolding of biblical events in Genesis. He follows that script without being predictable or bound by it, instead showing its immediacy in the human soul and mind. These characters could've lived thousands of years ago, or they could live next door today. That's the brilliance of this novel. Yes, it can be stodgy in parts, even pedantic, but Steinbeck's willingness to let his characters wrestle with life's ugliness and its unknowns make the lessons feel worthwhile and well earned.I loved this book, after trudging through the first thirty pages or so, and realize why it's a classic. Where Hemingway stripped down language and reshaped American literature, Steinbeck took that same gritty, manly writing and gave it back its heart."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I loved this book. It was long and at times just a tiny bit tedious, but the way in which Steinbeck wove the stories, characters, places and time-lines was sheer genius. He is definitely a master at his craft. He is one of my favorite story-tellers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is my favourite book. Many an author dreams of achieving what Steinbeck achieves in this novel. It is a family saga that captures the essence of living within its pages and focuses on the individuality of lives - and the absolute power that those lives have to shape others.It is the most spiritually alive and aware book I have ever read. It encompasses the best and the worst of what it means to be human. It always moves me to tears because it makes me realise that we all hold failure in our hearts - and yet it inspires me to believe in the greatness of the individual. None of us are beyond loving.Focusing on two families with very different upbringings and influences, it studies the often harmful effect of relationships on ego and the desire of every child to be loved - every child but one.Cathy is a woman who looks only to herself and seems to feel no guilt or remorse for her actions. She is born entirely selfish.In complete contrast to Cathy is Samuel, an inspirational and charismatic figure who loves all. The underlying message of the novel is that despite the surrounding environment we all have a certain potential, and we all &quot;Mayest&quot; achieve it. If some of us fail to reach our potential it makes us no less valid. Just by living we have made our mark. The message is that we &quot;May&quot; , not we &quot;Should&quot; or we &quot;Must&quot;.I read a lot - and this is the most human novel that I have ever read - and the most forgiving. It is that forgiveness that inspires me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"THIS BOOK TOOK ME A WHILE TO READ, BUT I'M GLAD IT DID. IT GAVE ME A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT, AND I WAS NEVER DISAPPOINTED. SAD YES, LOT'S OF TEARS DID FORM. IT HAS AWESOME THEMES, AND CHARACTERS. EVEN THE CHARACTERS YOU THOUGH YOU HATED TO BEGIN WITH, YOUR IDEAS OF THEM CHANGE, BECAUSE THEY CHANGED. THEY REALIZE THINGS THAT DIDN'T REALIZE BEFORE. THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN TELL A GREAT BOOK FROM A GOOD BOOK. THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL THREE DEMSIONAL FULLY FORMED PEOPLE, THAT YOU FEEL YOU KNOW. SAMUEL, HAD INSIGHT, BELIEFS AND HOPES. HE HAD CHILDREN THAT HE WISHED THE WORLD FOR, AND FRIENDS THAT HE INFLUENCED. THIS STORY DEMOSTRATES THE RELATION BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN, AND HUMAN, AND HOW LOVE CAN BE AS, CRIPPLING AS IT IS PLEASURABLE, THIS IS BOOK IS A DEFINITE READ."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck parallels this story with the biblical &quot;fall of man.&quot; This story comes from the murderous rivalry of Cain and Abel and the banishment of the Garden of Eden. The novel is described as the collapse of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. I, however, see it differently. Although both families certainly experience bitter tragedies in this novel I do not see the story ending with those tragedies. The only presence of biblical texts is in the analysis of the murder of Abel. The discovery revealed is that &quot;thall shall&quot; (must) or &quot;thall will&quot; (it is inevitable), but that &quot;thou mayest,&quot; that the only constraint laid upon us it that of permissability - no restraint at all. In essence this leaves the end result up to man. Without debating the inherent goodness of man one need only see the beauty in which characters of this novel exist. The end result is not unknown, only the circumstances.Although a long read it is a great one. Partially because of the length of the book and partially because of its depth this novel can be a very weary read. I suggest reading it a bit at a time, and allowing time in between reads to let the content filter into you.Have patience; you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I LOVED this book.

It was wonderful-John Steinbeck sure knew how to tell a great story."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck captures the simple truths about humanity in a compelling and intriguing story. I hadn't read any of his other books, and now I look forward to them all."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"After reading Of Mice and Men I chose to read East of Eden because I liked the style of Steinbeck. I knew that Steinbeck knew how to tell a good story and with this book he did not fail. However, the story was a long one. It took exactly 601 pages. But, other than the length the story of East of Eden is that of a family and the struggles of marriage and life in an unknown land. It illustrates very well the hardships of growing up with a single father or mother. It is also riddled with biblical allusions. The main biblical allusion is what encompasses the whole story is the story of Cain and Abel. This appears with the many conflicts that occur between the brothers in this story. It also encompasses a frame device where Steinbeck through flashbacks tells a story of family heritage playing a role in the future. Overall East of Eden is a great book that I would recommend to anyone who has the time to read this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a book that I have santed to read for a long time but kept putting it off. I am so glad I purchased and read it recently. The sibling rivalary goes from generation to genertion just like Cain and Abel in the book of Genesis in the Bible. I certainly enjoyed the vivid iscriptions of the characters and landscapes in this book. The text is excellent."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Hold on if it is boring at first. It's an old book and just like an old car takes a while to get started. Once into the book the lives of the individuals becomes quite comforting and enjoyable"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Spectacularly developed characters to go with the gorgeous writing one expects. The story is one that takes place from the nineteenth century until the late nineteen teen years. It evolves from a family in the east, the Trasks, a girl from near them, and the families, primarily the Hamiltons, who develop the Salinas Valley in California. The characters vary from some impeccably honest and good souls to perhaps the most evil character this reader has ever encountered. She's introduced in chapter 8, which ranks high on the list of creepiest things I've ever read. The counterparts are terrific, for this reader Sam Hamilton's life and outlook and the wisdom, loyalty, patience, and goodness of Chinese man Lee, who begins in the story as a servant in the family that descends from the Trasks mentioned above. Almost all the characters lean to one side or the other of the good/evil line, with some having very human elements of both, and with nearly all having internal demons they address by either choice or necessity. In a way, ahead of his time, Steinbeck raises some interesting nature/nurture musings in his reader. A fine, fine read, particularly if you enjoy novels of families over time. This was my fourth Steinbeck, and I hugely look forward to more. It's great."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Upon reaching the age of 50, it occurred to me that there were vast gaps in my reading history; renowned works of literature that I had somehow avoided during my high school, college and post graduate academic careers and then in the long period of largely pleasure reading since. Such authors as Hemingway, Dickens and Steinbeck had been almost completely ignored. This book was the latest in my effort to remedy this sad state of affairs and upgrade my reading list.Having recently read Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, I was familiar with the historical period and geographical setting for this Steinbeck work. The story is essentially one of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons, their histories and the relationship between them. It becomes clear midway through the novel that it is largely autobiographical, as one of the Hamilton daughters marries a Steinbeck.Having read other Steinbeck works and several by Dickens during the last six months, I'm struck by the similarity in character development between the two writers. Despite vastly different writing styles and subjects, both authors' works are marked in the extent to which their novels are character driven. Many times there is no \\"story\\" or progression of events, as much as simply following characters through the course of daily existence. It is the richness of the characters that has elevated the works of these renowned writers and this novel is a perfect example of this.Two families co-exist in the Salinas Valley during the early years of the 20th century. The family members and those that they interact with are some of the most vivid and vibrant characters I've ever encountered in my four decades of reading a wide variety of works. At its heart, the story revolves around a multi-generational, modern day adaptation of the Old Testament parable of Cain and Abel (brother named Charles and Adam, Caleb and Aron). At one point, when asked his brother whereabouts, Caleb responds, \\"I don't know. Is it my job to look after him?\\" Sound familiar? The analogy extends to the title of the work itself, whereas Cain is banished to the land of Nod, lying East of Eden.This is a magnificent work of literature and one I highly recommend."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I do not usually like long books, or books that include insanely long descriptions of settings, towns, and people. However, this book was different. It is so long for a reason. You get to know GENERATIONS of a family. You meet the parents when they're young and their children when born. You leave the book feeling like you know the history of this family... like you KNOW them... not just know how they acted in one or 2 different situations. Like you know them inside and out. I loved this book and put it right up there with The Catcher in the Rye as books that have made a difference in how I live & view my life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Upon finishing this book, I was in awe. At his sharpest, Steinbeck weaves an intricate web of characters, all of whom encompass both good and evil, yet enable us to fall in love with each one of them, even the worse ones. Through the despair, cruelty, and pain, there lies hope and pure honesty of human emotions that force you do to your own introspection, leaving you begging for more and speechless once you've finished."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I just finished this novel a few hours ago after 3 days of continuous reading. This will probably be one of my favorite books i've ever read. One who reads the book will grow with adam, cal, aron and lee. I don't read much but i cannot give this book enough stars. So descriptive, one will get lost in the dusty west."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the reincarnation of Genesis 4. With a thrilling plot, Steinbeck retells the story of three generations and the constant struggle between good and evil, bringing his allusions to a more modern example that easily relates to the reader. Even though the novel begins with a brief and confusing introduction of characters, Steinbeck's unique and clever recipe fortifies the escalading moral of timshel, or \\"thou mayest\\". By describing the backgrounds of the character, Steinbeck asserts that each character had the choice to become whoever they became by the end of the novel.The novel's powerful biblical allusions, discerned between its thrilling lines, engage the reader subconsciously in a battle between good and evil. From phrases like \\"Am I my brother's keeper\\" to Cal's desperate want to please his father, one can predict the fate of these characters based on the story of Cain and Abel and the original sin. Steinbeck, however, ends his novel with the word \\"timshel\\" to add a moral sense to the novel: one's choice of becoming good or evil.According to the story of Cain and Abel, God chose Abel's gift over Cain's, causing jealousy to foment inside of Cain, resulting in the death of Abel and Cain's unbearable punishment. Steinbeck, however, ends his novel on a note that his reader does not expect. Instead of being punished for his jealousy and selfish motives, Cal is granted another chance when Adams, lying on his deathbed, blessed him, like Jacob blessed Esau, and he told him \\"timshel\\".Steinbeck's unique characterization is a testimony to the brilliance of the novel. Cathy and Samuel Hamilton are polar opposites. Cathy, who makes others stumble, commits suicide with an overdose of morphine. Sam Hamilton, on the other hand, dies a peaceful death after raising nine successful children. Adam, who was first tormented by Cathy's betrayal, overcomes evil with the help of Sam Hamilton. With his last encounter with his former lover, Cathy is desperate to retain power over him. She even offers to have sex with him to prove that he is not better than she is. Adam, however, refuses and leaves with a serene smile. He has triumphed over evil.Steinbeck's incorporation of Lee's speech about the varying Hebrew translations of \\"timshel\\", cleverly manifests the moral of his novel. The theme of Good overcoming Evil is a constant reminder of the individual's choice. Steinbeck's theme gives hope to the hopeless, peace to the restless, and light to the darkness, because fate does not apply in this novel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If the phrase \\"Great American Novel\\" implies a work of scope and substance, dealing with what is unique in American life, rooted in a deep knowledge of time and place, filled with characters who might well be our own forefathers, and infused with a strong moral purpose, EAST OF EDEN certainly fills the bill. At 600 pages, it is a much longer book thanOF MICE AND MEN(103 pages) or evenTHE GRAPES OF WRATH(416), but it is filled with all kinds of light: the bright simplicity of Steinbeck's language, the spark of his humor, his shining song of the land, and the rich glow that comes from his deep understanding of human beings, especially imperfect ones.Steinbeck himself appears in the novel as a young boy, and one of the threads in the story is the tale of his maternal grandfather, Samuel Hamilton, who emigrated from Northern Ireland in the middle of the 19th century and came to the Salinas Valley in California. There he raised a large family more on the proceeds of his work as a well-driller and handyman than through much success on his hardscrabble farm. The stories of Steinbeck's older relatives are scattered through the book as a touchstone of basic American values of faith, hard work, and the capacity to dream. One becomes rich when the automobile comes to Salinas, another dies in poverty, but most simply marry and raise families of their own.But the central character in the book is a New Englander, Adam Trask. We see him as a boy, in a complex relationship with his half-brother Charles. Sent by his father, a Civil War veteran, into the army, he knocks around the country for years before unexpectedly coming into some money and settling in the Salinas Valley. The main part of the book follows the growth of Adam's sons Caleb and Aron to young adulthood, and it is clear that some of the old history of Charles and Adam is being repeated. Or of Cain and Abel. For that oldest of all stories about colonists in a new land -- farmer, hunter, man of action, man of dreams -- obviously has great resonance for Steinbeck. It becomes a symbol for American aspiration and American violence, a paradox of how two members of a family can be so alike and yet so different, and a challenge that goes to the heart of individual morality.Steinbeck had used such resonances before, most notably in the final scene of THE GRAPES OF WRATH, but here he is constructing an entire novel around the exegesis of a biblical text. Some of his scaffolding is a little obvious, notably the prevalence of names beginning with A or C, and the numerous philosophical discussions. There is a serpent in this Eden, Cathy Ames, one of the great female psychopaths in literature, whom Steinbeck announces as a monster even before her birth. Goodness is represented first by Samuel Hamilton, and later by Adam's Chinese servant, Lee. But for all this polarization, Steinbeck's writing is so grounded in realism, and his treatment of good and evil so nuanced, that it is no longer a matter of how the old story repeats itself, but of how flawed human beings may claw back from the brink and be the masters of their own souls. This is a book to make you think -- but also one to make you laugh and cry, and above all to glory in this wondrous country and its people."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a sheer delight.

I love, inhale and am treasuring every page. Has stirrings of Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I always wait at least a week to write about a book that I finish. This window of time provides the necessary distance that a mind and imagination need to realize that a world no longer exists. That world and every small detail of it lasted 600 pages, but no more and no longer. I take this time to reassess reality and draw that arbitrary line between what is real and what is fantasy. The best fiction transports you and may even take a person longer to come back to center.Critics consider East of Eden one of Steinbeck's most ambitious novels. Admittedly, when I first picked it up, this critic called Steinbeck a little pretentious for scribing the 600 pages set before me. I stand corrected. I have yet to read a novel that was so closely connected to the psychology of humanity and aware of good and evil in such a deep and comprehensive way. This was not revealed through the storyline that was forced onto the characters, but through the descriptions of the characters and their careful dialogue.I was most fascinated by two characters in this novel: Catherine and Cal. Catherine, also went by Cathy or Kate in parts of the novel. Catherine was evil incarnate. As her name changed and she established a new identity, her evil changed shape as well. Catherine's soulless demeanor is best described by the narrator, \\"Her self was an island\\" (157). While some critics consider her the most fascinating Steinbeck character, I find Cal far more complex. Cal thinks he is evil; he struggles with his desires and believes he has no good in him. He discovers he is the offspring of a despicable woman and finds confirmation in what he's always known by instinct: he's got bad blood. What I find most fascinating is the way he hurts his brother, Aron. He hurts his brother by telling him the truth. I champion honesty in all circumstances and find this quality in a person or a character to be one of the highest possible virtues. This is not what is considered valuable to the Trask family nor the author. After the truth is revealed, death follows on multiple fronts. The cause and effect of the plot suggests that physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual deaths are a consequence of truth. This is deeply unsettling insight into a culture that is more concerned with the appearance of good than the reality of evil."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck is one of the greatest American novelists of the past century. All of his work is outstanding and East of Eden is a remarkable example. The characters are larger than life so that they stand out against the human condition. Samuel Hamilton is the essence of goodness, Cathy Trask is evil personified, even to the mark of Cain on her forehead. The book covers three generations in the lives of two families in the Salinis Valley of California. The first part deals with Samuel, then the plot shifts to Adam and Cathy Trask and finally to their two sons. As the title indicates a biblical theme runs through the book. The Chinese servant Lee, uses the word \\"Timshel\\" meaning \\"thou mayest\\" to indicate that man has free will to do good or evil. The characters struggle with good and evil for some 600 pages. Finally, the end comes but it is really not an ending, just a continuation. I rarely give five stars to a book, but East of Eden deserves it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"So why should anyone bother posting, or on the other end reading, a review of a novel that has already been established as a classic and also already been reviewed to oblivion. My late arrival to the reading game is no real excuse. Neither is my reluctance to read Steinbeck for so long due to the submission I have allowed on my part to the passing opinions of holiday readers that Steinbeck is simply a dry read. When I turned twenty four, I went on a reading tear of four hundred and fifty books in five years in what I see now as a subconscious attempt to recover an early stage of Proustian academic and social development after not having cracked open one book prior to that time. During that stretch, I had never had the desire to read anything written by Steinbeck. This changed toward the end of the last school year when I saw a copy of East of Eden by John Steinbeck on a student's desk. As a high school English teacher, I find elation in inspiring students to read books beyond what is assigned in the classroom. Last year, I found a new book on the desk of one of my students every week. When I asked for what reason she is reading all these books, she responded by saying that she wanted to break my record. I grabbed the copy of East of Eden from her desk and asked if the reading wasn't too dry and slow. Her reply was simply that \\"The writing is so beautiful.\\" To see a high school student in a regular English class read on his or her own is a welcomed surprise; to hear the student say that such writing is beautiful warrants investigation.Once breaking open the cover of the novel, I discovered that all of my previous prejudices about the author's writing content and style were grossly misappropriated. I had committed the worst sin anyone hoping to become a scholar could commit through judgment based on the opinions of others without ever having read or understood a single word in the novel. The best way I could describe my experience with the novel is this. While reading East of Eden, my friend would tell me \\"the best part is coming up.\\" For me, the best part was the very first page of the novel. Then, the best part was page two so on and so forth until I finished the novel.The only flaw I could see in the novel is that the description of how Lee is presented seemed pointless and a little racist. Otherwise, the novel was an absolutely perfect one in my mind. Steinbeck is able to burrow into the soul of the major characters in the novel of which there are many. I found myself rooting for characters only to swiftly turning against them and vice-versa. Small characters become big and people who I thought were going to have a big impact never undergo any real change. To say that a book is engrossing is a fine compliment, but to have the heart broken and the spirit inspired multiple times throughout the novel is rare. After having read this book, I felt like I had lived. The characters became the types of friends one considers part of one's extended family.If you ask a common acquaintance in scholarship or academic environment, very few would raise an eyebrow over the enthusiasm over this novel. East of Eden's absence is in the desired book lists of the every-reader. The most common opinion I hear about the books that people read are what is new and what is different. For this reason and perhaps also the apprehension of being bored to death by something that is out of date, these classics are avoided. I like the new and the different as much as the next person, but I also like what is good. Steinbeck not only brings life to his characters by being able to draw the reader into participating in the events and decisions of the characters' lives, but he is also a master craftsman of language. If the reader cannot find himself or herself lost in the lives, thoughts, and actions of the characters, he can find a paradise in the beauty of the descriptive language, the precise word choice, and the fine weaving of the well crafted sentence."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"simply one of the best books i have ever read.

The characters are so life-like and you are sure to be able to relate with them, and even know people like them (especially Cathy).

Eden's characters are simply amazing; each possessing subconscious energies guiding them toward the turmoil and passions which ultimately shape their lives. The character of Lee affected me beyond my own realization, until I reached the very last chapter. I read this book, believing I had figured each character's fate, but found instead a continuous and renewed bewilderment as the tale unfolded.You won't be able to put it down!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's reflection on the story of Genesis in the Bible is both intricate and reflective. The story serves to illustrate common themes and issues embedded within the family structure and society as well. He is also able to make a point about the existence of free will in each individual's destiny.One of the aspects that make this book quintessentially American is the diversity of the characters' qualities, both good and bad. Lee is perhaps the most uniquely complex figure in the story-he is not only a role model and parental-type figure for both the Trask boys and Abra, but deeply philosophical about man's existence in life, and the struggles he faces. Lee really is the force that keeps the Trask family afloat when the strains of life hit several members, namely Adam. He is able to single-handedly pull Adam out of his disillusionment with Cathy. Lee is so poignant to the novel because he reaches others at a level that most fail to reach, and he helps Adam begin life anew with his two sons. Cathy represents one of the darkest and malicious characters in literature, and is seemingly at the opposite spectrum of Lee-she represents destructiveness, cruelty, thoughtlessness, and cynicism. Cathy (later Kate) is not only hurtful to others around her, but there are times when she literally shuns goodness when it is in close proximity to her. Even her physical condition, in which she hates to be around light, is representative of her sinister mentality about the world and her rejection of benevolence. Samuel Hamilton is depicted as a great man, a go-getter who captures the attention of his listeners because of his stories and his great vision for invention. Samuel is seemingly underappreciated by most in the novel with the exception of Lee and Adam, who cherish his knowledge. Samuel's impact on both Lee and Adam come much later in the story and after much reflection on their part.Another compelling aspect of Steinbeck's work is the definition and reflection on the idea of wealth. In many instances, \\"physical\\" wealth means very little. Will Hamilton is a character who believes in the principle of attaining wealth, but is very one-dimensional. Cal first sees wealth as an access to gain favor with his father, but then winds up rejecting this idea, and literally burning the money he had acquired. Kate gains a good deal of money from her brothel business, but it is money that brings neither happiness nor goodness to others. In direct contrast to these characters, Samuel Hamilton and Lee embody a \\"spiritual\\" wealth in the novel. Samuel, for instance, works hard, invents many things, and collect very few material rewards, yet his friendship is the most significant to others. Lee, similarly, is not wealthy, and comes to terms with his role as a giver rather than one who needs to acquire monetary gains. He seems to accept this role, and even rejects the one chance he does have to go to San Francisco and begin a business adventure. Steinbeck's larger message could be that the notion of \\"wealth\\" is more symbolic than physical.Perhaps the most consequential issue explored is that of free will-that we are all in charge of our own destinies despite our blood or our stations in life. This is revealed in Lee's explanation of the phrase \\"thou mayest\\", and the idea of choosing our own destination-good or evil-is illustrated most significantly in the character of Cal Trask-who wavers between choosing good and evil for much of the novel.This is a thoroughly powerful book, perhaps one of the forgotten treasures in literature. Steinbeck is able to draw you in, and although this novel is quite lengthy (over six hundred pages in length), it is a captivating story with complex ideas, characters and symbols."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the saga of a family and their search for love and acceptance. The themes in this classic John Steinbeck novel are timeless and presented in such a gifted manner that time and place are transcended. The reader is drawn into a story of siblings spanning the generations, fighting to define who they are and what their lives are about. The harm that is done to them in their quest feels staggering and the fathers draw your ire for their failure to just love their sons. The repetition of mistakes on the next generation of sons is heartbreaking.The characters are full and rich as befits a classic novel. There are strong and weak aspects to each of them. In some, the evil pervades their soul, if they have one,and one can understand the question, \\"Are there some people that are just born soulless.......??\\"This is a novel to be reread many times. It is complex, and to reach into it's depths could be daunting if you only read it once. What appears to be the central thought at one age will be completely overtaken by a different reflection after a subsequent reading."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Recently I reviewed on Amazon.com the film East of Eden with James Dean and Jo Van Fleet, mentioning that the movie was little more than a few chapters at the end of John Steinbeck's great novel. The performances by Dean and Van Fleet, who won the academy award for her work, were superb, but the book is much much better than the film for several reasons.One of these reasons is a great story. Some readers may shy away from the classics thinking they may be long on art and short on an entertaining plot. In the case of East of Eden, these readers would be wrong. From the opening pages we are drawn into the lives of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. Steinbeck's mother was a Hamilton and Steinbeck enters the story toward the end to give his account of his family and their relationship with the Trasks in Salinas, California. We follow the lives of three generations of Hamiltons and Trasks as they struggle to find meaning and purpose for living. The biblical story of Cain and Abel is the foundation on which the novel is built and the rivalry of Cal and Aron Trask (the Cain and Abel of the Bible) for their father Adam's love is one lynchpin of the novel. Unlike the Bible, Cal does not kill Aron directly, but may be said to be responsible for his death. Anytime Cal, the James Dean character in the film, is involved with the plot, the story moves quickly forward and is genuinely entertaining.The same can be said of Cathy Trask, Adam's estranged wife, who becomes Kate, the madam of a whorehouse. Cathy is a perfect example of the bad seed. From her childhood where she kills her parents in a fire to her suicide at the end of the story, she does no good thing and evil follows here wherever she goes. Like Satan in Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost, she is the most interesting character in the novel, even though her portrayal is, for the most part, one dimensional. We wait impatiently for each of her entrances in the story to see what bad business she will initiate. Her encounters with her son Cal, both in the book and in the film, are highlights for the reader and viewer.One more character worth noting is Lee, the Chinese servant of the Trask family. Lee is always the voice of reason and goodness. He is at the center of the discussions that form the heart of the novel; that is, that we are allowed by God to choose the direction and purpose of our life. The novel ends with Adam saying from his death bed, \\"Timshel,\\" that is, \\"thou mayest.\\" The glory of being human is freedom of choice. We are neither predestined nor commanded, but allowed to decide our own way.East of Eden is a great American novel, not perfect by any means, but ambitious in its size and scope and incomparably better than almost all the best sellers that sit on top of the New York Times top ten list, at least in my opinion. Readers who are interested in a story of families trying to find some meaning and purpose in life are sure to be genuinely entertained by the Hamiltons and Trasks as they struggle to survive in the land East of Eden."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Of all his novels, Steinbeck seems to pour the power of his immense skills into this one. It's as if he needs to prove to himself that he is worthy of all the accolades heaped upon him. Yet there is an ingredient that seems to be missing in this work when laid beside his many other achievements. In Grapes Of Wrath and Of Mice And Men, Steinbeck never labored, never faltered as the characters and story lines developed into crescendoes of drama and excitement. In East Of Eden, the characters are developed slowly, deliberately; the pace is tempered to accomodate the author's labored struggle to go beyond his talent and yet, the reader is treated to a third demension, beyond character, beyond story, to that of the author who seems to be saying...&quot;I will not rest until I have given you my best.&quot; Steinbeck proves to us he is afterall, only human; but only after he gives us this super human effort. While East Of Eden may not have been his best novel, it was by far his best work."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I enjoyed East of Eden immensely. Not only was it a very entertaining read, it was also very enriching. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, it is beneficial for the reader to be knowledgeable about the Bible (specifically the book of Genesis) prior to reading this book. It is the type of book that, after finishing it, will make you just sit and reflect. It offers a lot of insight on human nature, focusing on the potential for good and evil in everyone.The struggle between good and evil is the dominant theme in this book. Steinbeck talks of the choice that everyone has to be either good (represented by the character Adam) or evil (represented by Cathy). The cast of characters is one of the best developed and most interesting I have ever encountered in a novel. All the characters have a purpose and bring the story to life. I highly recommend this book. You will not regret reading it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"i've been trying to figure out why i liked this book so much. i was expecting to find it long and dull.When the first chapter was entirely narration, without a single peice of dialouge or plot, i almost put the book down then and there (actually, there isnt any dialouge until the bottom of page 24). However, i actually found myself enjoying even the long discriptions of scenery that i usually skim or skip entirely.The plot was fast, but somehow the book kept the feeling that it was slowly plodding along. It almost has the feeling of reading a history textbook. for some reason, however, i was completely intrigued, and had trouble putting it down for long.Actually, to talk about the book's \\"plot\\" is a bit of a stretch, because the focus of the book is entirely off of action. Many key events happen \\"offstage\\" (to use theater terms), and some are only implied. Steinbeck focuses on motivations, and the characters thoughts and emotions, rather than the actions themselves.everything i usually i love about a novel, this novel didnt have, and this novel had alot i usually hate in a novel, and yet i still found myself enjoying it immensely. i guess thats y its a classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is amazing. I never tire of the plot or characters, but while the story is extremely enjoyable, it is the compelling characters that Steinbeck created that truly give the book its merit.As the excerpts on the book covers suggest, East of Eden is a loose epic retelling of the Biblical stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel. Set in the Salinas Valley in the early 20th century, the novel involves the Trasks and the Hamiltons, telling of three generations of these families. The introduction to East of Eden is, while not as intriguing and momentous as the rest of the book, still successful in drawing in the reader. It is easy to understand both the story and the characters because of Steinbeck's simply composed sentences, though the characters introduced in the beginning have less depth than later characters. Because Steinbeck weaves over three separate stories in one novel, his plot may seem disarrayed and confusing at times. Ultimately, however, this contributes to the wonderful reading experience, as the reader is able to experience multiple stories involving contrasting characters and different paces. The book never gets sluggish or monotonous, because of the overlapping plotlines.East of Eden is such an incredible book because the depth of the characters causes the reader to feel a wide array of emotions. Cal, for instance, is possibly the most appealing and intriguing character in the entire novel, despite Steinbeck's continual assertion that nobody likes the dark, secretive boy. Everyone can relate to Cal and his struggle to overcome the evil quality inside himself, and emerge \\"good\\" like his twin brother Aron. Everyone can understand Cal's desire to be accepted, his desire to be loved and appreciated. Everyone knows what Cal is going through when he tries to vindicate himself by trying to get revenge on those who favor his brother. He is jealous and he is vengeful, but he is also loving and sensitive. Cal's complexity makes the second half of the novel so wonderful to read- his progress from a dark little boy to a mature, caring young man is amazing. Steinbeck's characterization is excellent, but he also writes scenes in which Cal and Aron are simply innocent, curious boys, rather than profound, universal characters part of an epic tale. East of Eden is so easy to relate to, but it is also a fantastic ambitious saga.One of the most common criticisms of the book is that the main antagonist, Cathy, is an unrealistic one-dimensional character, but she is, in fact, a complex character, as she embodies several types of evil, rather than just cruelty or insanity. She is written very sophisticatedly; if her severe lack of humanity and warmth seems unrealistic, it is because, in comparison with the other characters, Cathy is blatantly evil. There is no other character as depraved as Cathy in the story; even Charles desires love and displays fondness for his Adam, and Cal ultimately chooses goodness. Besides, Cathy does show brief episodes of weakness, which obviously show that she is somewhat human and not just an antagonist who opposes the protagonists and then suddenly disappears. The book begins to move at a faster pace when she is introduced, and as her mind disintegrates, the reader is left to wonder what her true level of humanity is, and whether she should be pitied. Cathy is one of the most fascinating characters in the book, because the nature of her wickedness is so intense that it easily heightens the suspense of the story.Though I only touched on the more prominent aspects of East of Eden, the entire book is worth reading multiple times. Every single character is unique, realistic, and wonderful in some way. The plot is extensive, but there are so many different facets to explore, especially because Steinbeck elaborates on universal themes such as light versus dark, good versus evil, jealousy versus love. It is not be the simple plot that gives this book its wonderful quality, but the actual experience of reading through the history of the families and experiencing the multiple feelings this book incites that will make you fall in love with it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My book club recently picked this as a selection (for a two-month gap!) and I was delighted. I don't remember the last time I read a book that had such great character development and a lovely story to follow. It hasn't been predictable. I think it'll lead to great discussion."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the story of three generations of the Trask family who live, love and farm in the Salinas valley in Northern California. What is amazing about this book is that the plot sequences progress like a daytime soap opera. It's got affairs, shootings, family betrayal and more. The writing is of such high quality the story never feel melodramtic. The weight and implications of people's actions will pull at your every emotion without ever felling over the top. The characters are complex in the sense that they grow over the course of the book and are surprisingly unpredictable if you are able to experience this book without much prior knowledge. This is one of those rare \\"classics\\" that could actually be considered a \\"beach book\\" as it can be a serious page turner.East of Eden really shows off the range of Steinbeck's abilities as an author. Usually various works by any \\"classic\\" have a similar feel, theme and writing style. While this may be somewhat true for Steinbeck, East of Eden is really of a different nature than the social commentaries Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath. Because of this, the book has a wider appeal and this is one that anyone looking to read some great literature should pick up.Bottom Line: A must read by anyone in who is looking for an engrossing and well written book. It is long so its not for those who shy away from \\"projects\\"."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I bought this book and read the first chapter. I put it down for six months. I found the beginning to be almost painful. Where's the story? I had heard that this was a classic, so, determined to get through this book, I dove back in.I am thankful that I stuck with it. After the first 40 pages, the story really launched into an interesting tale of good an evil. This story will help to change the way you see yourself. The book can be summarized by Steinbeck's monologue on page 413 (Chapter 34):\\"It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world.\\"\\"We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The characters, the scenes, the descriptions- - all so natural- - are brilliantly brought to life in this American literature classic that seems to recreate a true-life documentary about Central California at the turn-of-the century.With a straightforward story populated by a variety of characters, this book tells the saga of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The style somewhat resembles James Michener's in terms of his talent also to quickly acquaint you with locations and characters and put you on a first-name basis with them. The saga brings you into the lives of the characters and stirs your emotions like a mixer running on high-speed. Have you uncontrollably screamed out loud when reading a book? Well, I did at this one because of Kate (Cathy), who makes your blood boil with rage.Although Kate doesn't take honors as the main character, she does steal the show in my eyes. She is the essence of e-v-i-l, a four-letter word in her case. Kate is the most memorable character because of her cunning, lying, scheming, and wicked personality, which is not easily forgotten. Steinbeck first talks of monsters as a way of introducing Kate. Monsters, he says, can be born through no fault of their own from human parents and defined through deformities such as huge heads, tiny bodies, no arms, no legs, etc. But then he asks, \\"... just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born?\\" This didn't fully click in my mind at the time I read it because I hadn't witnessed Kate in action. It's after she starts her series of sinister deeds that you come to realize the significance of what Steinbeck meant by \\"psychic monster\\". You'll love to hate her.Among the characters, the two with the best heads on their shoulders were Abra and Lee who added a touch of class by stating common-sense facts in such matter-of-fact fashion. They showed unfaltering determination to deal with life's hard knocks by taking them by the horns, seeking practical solutions in the same down-to-earth way that would grab a sack of potatoes and start peeling.I know some people have criticized the book, saying the two brothers, Cal and Aron, parallel and trivialize the biblical Cain and Abel. They commented that the story is too trite, pat, and overly simplistic in symbolizing \\"good versus evil\\". Maybe I am at fault since I try not to construe too much symbolism into every book I read, as in this instance. I took this story at face value and for that reason the \\"good versus evil premise\\" and the \\"Cain and Abel Story\\" never crossed my mind. In the end I was rewarded with a thoroughly entertaining story that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was one of the most passionate books I have ever read. John Steinbeck tells a moving tale of two brothers and how their lives are changed by the people around them. Initially sounding like the biblical story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck puts a new twist on the traditional story, compelling you to see the characters and your own life from a different perspective. It's amazing to witness your emotions and sympathies shift as the story progresses and it's thought provoking to see Steinbeck's distinction between good and evil. After you finish this book, you will find yourself going over and over the symbolism in the story, how the plots twists, and the insight into the sources of good and evil. This book ranks at the top of \\"My Most Favorite Books of All Time\\" list and will spend little time on my bookshelf as I re-read and re-read this book, gaining something new each time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Love is a powerful thing that can work both ways. Never before has this been so plausibly demonstrated as is the novel, East of Eden, by John Steinbeck. This individual work won the Nobel Prize for Literature, and not without due cause. The story takes place in the beautiful but mysterious Salinas Valley of Northern California. The book runs from the later 1800's up until the First World War, etching in the details of people from all walks of life. Rather than choosing the young hero or heroine to gladly steal the plot away, Steinbeck chose to tell his story through the more humanistic people of the Old West. Samuel Hamilton, a main character, is an inventive man from Ireland that chose to settle on a dusty and barren stretch of land in the Valley. He has his hardships through his life and his creativity gives him losses rather than gains, but still he is a happy man with many children. This is because love was present in his life. The other main character, Adam Trask, leads a rather different life. He is given no love that he can truly appreciate and grows in fear of his own stepbrother. With little love in childhood, he leapt to find it in the outside world. This novel is such a masterpiece because it combines all human elements without enchancing them to make them more heroic or even more humane. Where we often want to shy from the truth of our past because it is not always gloriuos or rightous, I believe that this book opens your eyes to the world and the murderous consequences of love's absence. This book is compelling beyond belief and certainly earns the title of being the best of John Steinbeck's later career."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you love California and literature, this book is for you! \\"Samuel rode lightly on top of a book and he balanced happily among ideas the way a man rides white rapids in a canoe. But Tom got into a book, crawled and groveled between the covers, tunneled like a mole among the thoughts, and came up with the book all over his face and hands.\\" This is a book that will get all over your face and hands and you will love it.Steinbeck has innovative, articulate and beautiful ways of describing his family - their strength of character as well as his love for them.\\"Her faith is a mountain, and you, my son, haven't even got a shovel yet.\\"\\"She had no love of places. A place was only a resting stage on the way to heaven.\\"\\"I believe a strong woman may be stronger than a man, particularly if she happens to have love in her heart. I guess a loving woman is almost indestructible.\\"\\"Dessie was not beautiful. Perhaps she wasn't even pretty, but she had the glow that makes men follow a woman in the hope of reflecting a little of it.\\"John makes you think, internalize and reflect on who we are and what we stand for.\\"You can boast about anything if it's all you have. Maybe the less you have, the more you are required to boast.\\"\\"It would be absurd if we did not undertsnad both angels and devils, since we invented them.\\"\\"There are no ugly questions except those clothed in condescension.\\"\\"Perhaps the best conversationalist in the world is the man who helps others to talk.\\"Read this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I hadn't read John Steinbeck since high school but returned to him about a year ago when our book group read his novel, \\"The Winter of our Discontent.\\" Following that, I read several other Steinbeck novels and recently had the good luck to read \\"East of Eden\\". It is admirable that Oprah Winfrey used this large, complex novel to present to her audience.Steinbeck wrote \\"East of Eden\\" in a burst of energy over several months in 1951. He loved this book among all his works and, literally, put himself into it. The first-person narrator of the story is, indeed, Steinbeck himself speaking in his own voice as a a grandson of Samuel Hamilton, born in Ireland and a hero of this novel.Steinbeck said that he wrote \\"East of Eden\\" to tell \\"the story of my country and the story of me\\" to his two young sons in order to demonstrate \\"the greatest story of all-- the story of good and evil, of strength and weakness, of love and hate, of beauty and ugliness, how these doubles are inseparable.\\" (Quotation is from the chronology in the Library of America edition of Steinbeck's novels, 1942-1952 at 963.) For all its melodrama, length, sometimes black-and-white characterizations, and preachiness, the novel achieves its goals. I was transfixed by the book, couldn't put it down, and read it in a short time.The story includes the \\"doubles\\" to which Steinbeck refers as well as some others. The book is the story of two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks. It is the story of two Trask brothers, Adam and Charles, and of the two twin sons of Adam Trask and his wife Cathy -- Aron and Caleb. Both Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb replicate in their own ways the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck gives this story a full, biblical style exegisis as the reader sees the story of the conflict between good and evil play out in double over the course of the book.The Trask family and the Hamilton family are settlers in the Salinas Valley in California. \\"East of Eden\\" develops a fine sense of place and when I finished the book I felt I knew an area and its history that I have only in the most superficial manner seen myself. Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck's grandfather, figures prominently in this book for his wisdom, his stoicism, his inventiveness, and his other-wordliness. His wife, Lisa, is also portrayed with a great deal of love.Perhaps the most memorable character of the book is Cathy Trask who becomes \\"Kate\\" after she leaves Adam Trask and returns to the profession of prostitution in which she was engaged before her marriage. Steinbeck calls her a \\"monster\\" and well he might. The portrayal is striking and even nuanced at the end for all the starkness.Lee, a Chinese servant, is also well portrayed for his subtelty, wisdoms love of learing, and ultimately, devotion to the Trasks and understanding of himself.This is a sweeping, dramatically told story which captures the land, the good and evil of which people are capable, and the importance of what in the Cain and Abel story is described by the Hebrew word \\"Timshel\\" with which Steinbeck concludes his novel. People have the capacity for both good and evil and the power for choice -- to understand the good and reject the evil. The story is told in a humanistic rather than a theological way.\\"East of Eden\\" is a memorable work of American literature that deserves the attention it has recently received."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Normally, I'm not a fan of John Steinbeck, and I wasn't sure how far I would get into this book before my normal put-it-down-and-forget-I-ever-picked-it-up reaction kicked in. But I was very pleasantly surprised when I literally could not put this book down. He brought the Salinas Valley and the characters to life in such vivid detail and evoked in me such strong emotions toward these characters. I was really wowed by the biblical Garden of Eden parallels, and I really enjoyed that he didn't just start right in talking about one family. He started out with backgrounds about Adam's and Cathy's families so I felt like I really knew them by the time they started acting out their places in the story. I also liked how skillfully he interwove the Hamilton family into the story and how he brought in the big issues of the day--i.e. WWI--and somehow brought it down to the level of the story to make it relevant. I felt like I was right there watching it all unfold around me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I was in middle school, I read Steinbeck voraciously. I cried at the end of Of Mice And Men to the point of total embarrasement. I blinked hard at The Pearl and wanted a Red Pony. Little did I know, that ten years later I would pick up East of Eden and discover (to my shock!) that Steibeck, though a good story teller, was a terrible writer. Lord knows intelligent people will disagree with me on this one, but I found East of Eden to be trite, oversimplified, and downright silly at about every turn.

The characters are either very, very bad or very, very good; everyone talks portentiously; readers are given to understand that Steinbeck means to teach us Important Lessons. But there's really nothing to be learned from Steinbeck's black-and-white world; his novel has no connection to reality as we know it. &quot;East of Eden&quot; belongs in the &quot;must to avoid&quot; category; do yourself a favor and, if you insist on having a basic understanding of this book, wait until your children are reading it in high school and get yourself the Cliff Notes. I promise you won't miss a thing."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"With this calamitous effort, John Steinbeck makes an effort to create an epic masterpiece. Unfortunately, his brushstrokes grow too large, and the panorama that results has too broad a scope. The book loses its focus in its ramblings, and, consequently, its significance. In the early pages you'll meet some characters who are possibly the most irritating, two dimensional elements in any work of fiction since The Scarlet Letter. However, this doesn't matter because Stienbeck will dump most of these characters in no time. Most of the characters live on farms except for the whores and the others. I personally don't live on a farm and am feeling somewhat depressed about it. Now look at that last section(From In the early pages to depressed about it.). It went absolutely nowhere. If you can find some way to stretch that little bit to the length of East of Eden then you'll have your very own masterpiece."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was surprised that this book was written by Steinbeck. For high school, I had to read this book during the summer and I had to put it down in the first few chapters. It didn't seem real and Cathy (the main women character) is so cold and evil.

It's a miracle that he won any literary awards, let alone the Nobel Prize for Literature. The fact that Steinbeck's work so easily lends itself to animation (see the Warner Bros. cartoons inspired by &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;), gives you a hint of the complexity of Steinbeck's characterizations.

Although maybe that's because I was FORCED to read the others back in high school! I loved the biblical references throughout this piece of art. It takes place between the Civil War & World War I, & features 2 sets of brothers.

I could identify with his feelings as a young person who desperately wants his father's love and approval, but is not the favorite child, and can never please his father. The role of the stern father is played by Raymond Massey.

Steinbeck's writing is genuine and simple, uniting plot and philosophy seamlessly throughout the book. I draw so much inspiration from the character of Lee: eloquently honest and observant with others and himself. With a little help from Oprah, East of Eden is no longer such a secret....it would be selfish of me to keep it one."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What a fun book. Steinbeck creates memorable characters in a sweeping soap opera. If Oprah gets more people to read this one then more power to her. Don't even think about watching the movie instead of reading the novel. The movie leaves out all of the juicy stuff."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck can be a bit heavy-handed at times with metaphor and moral, but this book is a wonderful read. I discovered it as an adolescent 30 years ago, and it still ranks as one of my all-time favorites. I'm delighted that Oprah has introduced it to a new generation! You are going to love this book. It's a can't-put-down page turner."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck surely created a masterpiece here as he explored themes such as love, hate, and knowledge. He wove an intricate web of characters and plots into a beautiful tapestry of american writing.The story follows the interaction of 3 families: the Trasks, Hamitons, and the whorehouse owned by \\"Cathy Trask\\". The Trask family is bound to horribly repeat the story of Cain and Abel over and over again. It teaches us of our most devestating flaws and our most vital goods. This is a must read for any lover of great literature!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A friend once asked me, \\"Hey do you know any books that I can read over the summer?\\". I said, \\"Well, what kind of book are you looking for?\\".\\"Umm... A book that is very thought provoking. A book that has an exciting storyline. A book with multiple themes. A book that would want you to never stop reading until you finished it. Oh and one more thing. How about a book with a lot of biblical allusions. Biblical allusions always intrigue me.\\"\\"Well my friend,\\" I said to him, \\"I have just the right book for you. Have you heard of the author John Steinbeck?\\"\\"Yes I have. Isn't that the dude who wrote the book The Grapes of Wrath?\\"\\"Yes he is. Well the book I am about to suggest is written by the same author. The book is called East Of Eden. Say...there is a biblical allusion in the title itself.\\"This book indeed is full of biblical allusion such as the story of Cain and Abel. Some of the themes in the book include love, good vs. evil, and morality. Yes, I know this book sounds like a whole bunch of comentary and not much of a plot. But infact, one of the things that makes this book great is the great storyline. I recomend everyone to read this book. Its really fun and educational too."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"->While it is often said that quality is much more important than quantity, there are times in which you can slap the two together to get a surprisingly good result. Such is the case with John Steinbeck's immense novel, East Of Eden. Although famous for his earlier novel Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck considered East of Eden his more important, life-long work for him. \\"I've been practicing for a book for 35 years, and this is it. There is only one book to a man,\\" he said to his publisher when he completed the novel in 1952. Indeed, this novel is a truly a culminative work of Steinbeck's->The story is tragedy, with rays of hope strewn throughout it and a moral lesson behind it. It is about the intertwining destinies of two sets of people in the Salinas Valley: the gregarious and emotionally diverse Hamilton family and the passionate, moody Trask clan. The book centers many of its themes around biblical references, such as the fall of Adam and Eve, and the deadly rivalry between Cain and Able. The importance of individual identity, and the consequences of blind love are also discussed.->The book is a example of great story telling. Steinbeck had a natural flow of language that the reader can relate to and uses practical, to-the-point diction to easily communicate his story. The progress of the Trask family's development from zealous and impulsive into contemplative and vigilant is fascinating to watch. Steinbeck makes you either love his characters or loathe them, depending on whom he's talking about. There's something about his writing that compels you to read on to the next chapter to learn what new tragedy or jubilance will afflict the character next. It is simply a book that you won't put down; that is, until you realize how much time has gone by.->As with many long novels, the vastness of the plot is sometimes too much to handle, and is the book's main weakness. The plot is inherently hard to follow at times, because switching back and forth between the two families proves to be challenge. And with the huge number of characters involved over the span of three generations, keeping track of who's who is no easy task. The book often goes into tangent-like sub stories from time to time about non-significant characters, and the author's purpose of doing so is not always apparent.->Technicalities of length aside, Steinbeck here has truly written a classic with undying themes and a compelling, tragic story. If you ever have a fair chunk of time you can dedicate to serious reading, pick up a copy of East of Eden."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK! At first I thought it would be boring because it was for school and it is hugh. But once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I'm only 15 and anything but a reader, but after this novel, I wanted to learn more about Steinbeck. This is a book for anyone from a romantic to a pervert. You won't regret getting this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A classic, yes. A great story, yes. A philosophic treatise, perhaps. Above all, a well written novel in the tradition of great literature.This is a book that I had to read over and over, and that still made me think with the tenth reading. Some of the book is biographical, the story of Steinbeck's Irish Presbyterian family especially his grandfather's move into the Valley around Salinas and his struggle to raise a family on the marginal land available when he arrived.The fictional characters are the story, and the land is the story, and they are done masterfully. Is he trying to tell a story, yes of course he is. Is there an underlying theme, there is, and it is obvious. Does he have a moral viewpoint? he sure does, and this book is trying to sell it. Is there a compelling, well written story around them to tie it all together, you bet!Adam Trask, his brother Charles, Adam's son Aron, and his brother Cal. As everyone points out, the A's and C's. The story 'as old as man', the story of Cain and Able, of competition, rejection and revenge, first through Abel's eyes, then through Cain's. And there's enough explicit dialog to insure that you see that.That story is impossible to tell without support, and an outsider. Support through Lee, the Chinese-American cook/philosopher looking for his own history. The outsider, Sam Hamilton (Steinbeck's grandfather), poor where Adam is rich, rich in 'soul' where Adam is poor.All this brought together by a strong narrative written by a man attempting to write his masterpiece. He accomplished his goal. And when the world wouldn't see it, he quit writing fiction. It's a shame."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one book that I picked up to read over my vacation at the beach. I finished it before we even got to the beach. I knew I liked Steinbeck, but I had never heard of this one before (unlike The Grapes Of Wrath, Of Mice And Men, etc.) Boy, am I glad I picked it up! At the part where Adam Trask goes to his wife's whorehouse to finally face her, and comes out triumphant, I had to stop reading and let out a shout of victory. This book also made me cry, laugh, get angry and sad. It's one of the few books I have read that has made me feel so many different emotions. To any of you who have read the book already, Timshel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book contains the most lyrical descriptions of the equisite agony of youth I have ever read. Steinbeck expresses the overabundance of emotions perfectly -- both the wonderous feelings (strawberries would never taste as sweet again and the thighs of women would lose their clutch) and the overwhelming anxiety that would cause a young man to lie on the ground and scream, &quot;Christ!&quot;"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Though it was a bit long, East of Eden was a fabulous book. It is by far the best Steinbeck book I have read. Deeply enthralling, it could be read on many levels. I particularly enjoyed the challenging perspectives on Original Sin that the book presented through the character of Adam Trask and his sons. I strongly encourage you to read this timeless novel!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I just finished East of Eden and felt as if I lost my best friend. What a truly wonderful book. From the minute I started reading it, I had a hard time putting it down. Steinbeck manages to keep you hanging throughout the entire book. The characters are so incredibly real.

This soul-gripping heart-holding novel brings truth and shows that all stories may not have a happy or unhappy ending."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I really loved this book. I have gotten &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; twice, but never seemed to be able to finish it. And although &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was thought provoking, it was certaintly not an epic novel. But this book kept me by it's side till it was finished."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The prose sparkles and the characters mesmerize in John Steinbeck's masterpiece \\"East of Eden.\\" The main character's name is Adam Trask. He has several conflicts with his brother and his life is quite rough. The book also brings in the author's family, and features much wisdom about life. The only reason not to read this book would be the fact that prostitution does play a major role in it, so younger children might not be able to handle it. Still, all in all, an excellent book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I enjoyed reading the book but I after reading it I felt as though the book had no point. There was no story or direction in the book. After finishing it, I didn't have any thoughts on life or feel as though I was entertained. There was so much action in the beginning but the storyline seemed to stall in the middle and come to no real conclusion. The book is missing something."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I must say that I'm truly in awe of John Steinbeck's uncanny ability to write such a masterful novel with so many intracies and fill six hundred pages with an engaging story without wasted words.I know that the story is not supposed to be completely realistic, and it should have some mythical quality to it; however, the huge flaw with this book is the long and abundant philosophical dialogue. The characters bring up abstract ideas by the dozens, and sometimes it is way too much for one novel.One minor flaw is the exaggeration of a few personalities, such as Sam Hamilton. He is exalted by the narrator in such a way that I grew tired of reading about his endless quirks and subtleties page after page.The rest of the book makes up for these flaws, but not entirely. Many of the relationships are gripping and interesting, especially between Charles and Adam, and Cal and Aron, two pairs of brothers from different generations.Kate is the mythical character, acting like a serpent in the garden of Eden - she is probably the best and most interesting part of this book.Characters Lee and Sam Hamilton should have been played down. In the later pages of the book, John Steinbeck seems more concerned about surprising the reader with annoyingly unexpected philosophies on life instead of subtly driving in the themes of the story.I also wish that the story of Cain and Able were not directly mentioned and stated by the characters. We the readers should be allowed to discover or see the metaphors ourselves. East of Eden became a less interesting metaphor as soon as Lee and Sam suggested naming two twin boys Cain and Abel.Best line of the book: \\"Am I supposed to look after my brother?\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It is surprising that so many people seem to love this book. I found it drifted from place to place and ended up feeling like a bad soap opera. The layers of analogy and metaphor wash over you as you go through it. Probably a good beach book but if you have other things you are interested in they will likely be more satisfying."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I am only 1/4 through the book and have already noticed a very obvious misspelling and periods where there should be commas, etc. I think the editor should've done a little more homework. I know it shouldn't bother me, but it does.

I appreciated it only at the end because the story is well thought out and written, but the story itself depressed me."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Just finished reading this book. I think it would have been much better if Steinbeck kept to one story-line of Adam and Cathy and their sons. Chapters were written about the Hamilton and Steinbeck families which I felt had no relation to the story at all (you could skip those chapters and still understand the book). Also, I felt the dialogue between the characters during the last third of the book to have been trite and wooden, and was just filling the pages rather than saying anything really meaningful.If Steinbeck had kept this to one main story-line rather than digressing with stories of other families, he would have written a faster-paced, SHORTER, and more interesting novel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is by far my favorite Steinbeck novel. This is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of American literature. I enjoyed every word. I read it over and over again to enjoy Steinbeck's world."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Simply put, this book is a masterpiece and is my all-time favorite book. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My first Steinbeck upon recommendation by my girlfriend I read this had fears of a soap opera type book... oh lord dead wrong there this book will move you to tears illict a hearty smile on occasion and make you reach deep into your mind and heart In an adulthood of reading great material this book is easily one of the five best I've ever had the pleasure of reading..... Enjoy!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Human nature at its finest and worst, this novel peeks into the human heart, showing prejudice, emotional blindness, evil vs. good, and the tie that binds us all together through a life span. Sometimes Steinbeck's pace is so slow that it is difficult to chew through the pages, and yet at the same time it's rich and worth the wait."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is certainly a great book to read. Very well written. The reader should know going in that it is very consuming, that it takes more than one afternoon to read. If willing to invest a little bit more time in one book, it is well worth it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was very, very good from beginning to end. I especially liked John Steinbeck's conflictedness over whether human nature is good or evil. I won't go into the resolution and conclusion that Steinbeck comes to throughout the course of the book because it would ruin the climax for future readers. My advice to readers would be to approach this book with a mind ready to decode profound meanings. This way, the reader and the work will have the relationship that both deserve."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Long before Oprah and her book club, I was a kid in school and ran out of books to read. My Mom had the whole collection and I grumbled at the plain dictionary-type covers. Little did I know that I was about to read a collection of the most magical author I've ever known. East of Eden is something that you can only experience yourself. It's my favourite out of all Steinbeck's novels (and there isn't one bad Steinbeck book that's not good). I recommend this to you, your family, your friends, your children. I think everyone should read this book once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's work deserves the attention it receives. In the masterpiece \\"East of Eden\\", the reader looks deep into the human soul to see tragedy over two generations of a family. With a story that parallels Cain and Abel from the Bible, readers may have familiarity with the general theme. However, the final story takes a more modern twist.Even in his childhood, Adam Trask is simple. He is dominated by a military minded father and an intimidating brother. Motherless since his birth, he learns many of life's lessons the hard way. After returning from a tour of duty in the military forced by his father, destiny literally comes to Adam's front door. After being badly beaten by a client, Katherine crawls to his front porch for help. Having inherited money from his father, Adam takes in Katherine and cares for her despite his brother Charles's objection. Katherine and Adam eventually marry and move to California. When they arrive, Katherine becomes pregnant. After giving birth, she leaves her husband and newborns to start a brothel. This leaves Adam alone and devestated again.The twins are a reflection of their father and his brother. Cal is rough around the edges much like Charles. Aron is soft much like his father. With their mother absent physically and their father emotionally vacant, the boys are raised by their father's Asian housekeeper Lee. As they grow, the boys are unaware of their mother's career. Cal learns first. When he tells Aron who has returned from college, Aron is so devestated that he joins the military to fight in World War II. In effect, Aron loses his will to live. When Aron is killed in action, the boys' father has a stroke. Cal takes the burden of his brother's death and his father's stroke on himself in much the same way his brother and father accepted various burdens. Had he not told Aron about their mother, Cal feels that Aron would have never joined the military. As a result, the burden of guilt and sin lives in another generation.While the book runs off track at times, the story and its human interactions are fascinating. I remain undisappointed by any work by John Steinbeck. Certainly, this is among his best works."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Desire is at the threshhold but you can master it. When the cards have been stacked against you can still manage to sweep the pot. Steinbeck's craftsmanship is only exceeded by his ability to find the nut of the issue and crack it wide open for all of us to partake of it's nutty fruit. His best."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This wonderful book by Steinbeck gives a panoramic history of the Salinas Valley which the author uses as a microcosm of America as a whole. The story outlines the lives of two families in the valley. They are The Trask and Hamilton families. This book would probably fit in the genre of historical romance, but it's much more than that. Steinbeck delves into the differences between good and evil. The plot and storyline are much more sweeping than some of Steinbeck's other books. The timeline of the book is from the American Civil War to World War I, and it covers the entire United States. Steinbeck does a pretty good job with his characterizations. His best character in the book is Cathy Ames (Adam Trask's wife). She appears so innocent to people that she encounters, but this faade hides true evil. The book is fairly long, but quite readable."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck, John. East of Eden. Canada: Viking, 1952. 602 pages.East of Eden is one of Steinbeck's greatest works of literature. It is a book about the good and evil of the world and how the human race has the freedom of choice between the two. The story takes place from the end of the civil war to the end of World War 1. The setting ranges from a small Connecticut town to the Salinas valley in California. One of the most interesting things about this book is the author incorporates his on family history into the story line and characters. East of Eden has a straight forward theme on the fact that \\" All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me (the author) that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\" This is one of my most favorite books to date, and I highly recommend it too anyone who enjoys Steinbeck books or is new to him."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Hard to get in to but then it get's interesting and then get's slow.I read it becouse it was Oprah's book club pick was I dissapointed no.Overall the novel is emotional and a epic a masterpiece.You'll never read another book like this.It's hard to read but trust me it's fullfilling in the end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I've always wondered why Grapes of Wrath got the Pulitzer Prize and more general acclaim, because East of Eden moved me more. Sure, they both bear many trademarks of great literature--timeless themes, universal characters yet detailed descriptions, intellectually challenging yet emotionally resonant, and so forth--but really, is the story of a family that migrates any grander than the story of a family that mostly stays in the same place?To summarize this tome is beyond my skill, and I believe its relevance is so widespread that I'll only point out a few types of readers for whom East of Eden would NOT apply: anyone who's always gotten along perfectly with their parents and siblings; anyone who's always had perfect romantic relationships; anyone who's always understood perfectly what they want to do with their lives. But unless you fit those criteria, buy it, and buy it now."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend because she thought I would enjoy the California scenery and history. This book totally exceeded my expectations. Steinbeck is an amazing story-teller. This novel is woven in such a complex, precise manner, with no excess details, that I marvel at his writing prowess. There is a reason it is a classic. I was bummed to come to the end of the book and I will definitely read more by this author. Why don't more modern writers write books of this quality? After reading this book, I feel like a lot of the more modern fiction I have read kind of sucks. In other words, this book is incredible and others should read it, especially people who intend to become professional fiction writers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is among Steinbeck's best novels, and it is usually ranked among his top three or four, but not quite as good as \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" I have read most of his works including the present, which is a must read for Steinbeck fans. It has excellent prose and good drama but the story becomes a bit predictable for the last 100 pages of the 600 pages. That is the primary difference in terms of literary merit or being a good read. It is a pre-World war I novel set in northern California, and it is set partly in a small town and partly in a rural settings. The story is about family interactions, especially parent child relations, and uses three generations of characters from two families. There is less politics than in some of his other novels.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" has over ten million copies in print.Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the quality of his work - especially his short stories and short novels. The present work is a longer novel, 600 pages, which covers three generations of two families split between Connecticut and the Salinas area of northern California. It is a long and descriptive story but not as descriptive or as intricate as \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" That Pulitzer novel tends to spiral down emotionally. Here in \\"East of Eden\\" we have a few peaks and valleys and a number of emotional hooks. Steinbeck manages to work in some clever literary ideas and names by using references to biblical passages. The characters are interesting. However, because of the similarity in the families, generation to generation, the story becomes a bit predictable towards the end, more predictable than his other works, and many readers will be able to guess the end by page 500 or 530.This is a good book and it has good characters including the mother Cathy, and it has a number of interesting secondary characters. Also, the subplots, the overall structure, and the prose are good.It is not a heavy read and takes a few evenings to read. The middle part of the book is very compelling, almost a page turner. I liked the book and recommend it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This one slowed me down on reading Steinbeck. It was long and slow moving. It was overly philosophical. All the characters in this novel are philosophers. The movie was better than the book - the good actors covered the difficult plot. But there is no one to cover the poor reader. I finished it because I like Steinbeck. He lost it on this one in my opinion. He tried to say too much and consequently he made me sleepy. It was somewhat reminiscent of Gun Smoke - big tall character who are very wise and very deep. Hard to swallow.Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I found this book to be fairly enjoyable and full of beautiful gems. I wrote down pages of quotes that I thought were worthy of being remembered. I reveled in many of Steinbeck's descriptions and elaborations. However, I do understand how many people could find this book obvious and simple.To me it was an inspirational read much in the same way that the Bible can be moving. I took much value away from reading this novel because I began to look at it as an example of good and evil. A simplistic illustration that allowed the writer to voice his thoughts about life. This did not necessarily create a great turning point in literature, but I believe it did what it was intended to do; make the reader reflect.I was not left with an overpowering thirst to run out and add this book to my collection but neither did I regret the time I had spent reading it. I would definitely recommend this book because I believe it is worth pushing through the boring parts to have the entire work to look back at and ponder. After all, over 100 of us had comments to share about it.\\"Perhaps the best conversationalist in the world is the man who helps others to talk.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is my favorite book. Steinbeck brilliantly combines the biblical myth of genesis 4 and a story of two boys from the not so distant past to recreate the story of cain and abel in much more detail, depicting their struggles and fears, temptations and realizations, and seamlessly integrating them into the greatest book i have ever read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"requires your full attention! some oarts are a little dry but it's a must read before you die."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book about 25 years ago, and remembered loving it.

I gleaned more from it now that I am 50, but I still enjoyed it at 25!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Any book 600 pages long is going to be with you for a while. I have found that long after I finished reading the book, I was thinking about the statements made in this novel. I love the description of the town of Salinas' reaction to WWI (Part 4 of the novel)...so eerily mirrors our sentiments to the War on Terror. There is so much material to discuss in this novel particularly on inheritance both monitarily and in our genes...what traits are inherited from our families. I wish I had a Steinbeck in my family that could write a memoir of our ancestors. Awesome book!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a great book for anyone who has time to spare. I could not put it down. I highly recommend it for anyone. (It is thick though so be sure that you have some time set aside.)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"After a long long time I got to read something so fulfilling. Something that one can identify with instantly and it does not take much effort as well. The theme of Brother Vs. Brother is universal and appealing to all. Maybe because as children of Cain, we are all the same - A blend of Good and Bad. Wow!!East of Eden was heavy for me!!Steinbeck is so good at descriptions - love the style of writing, the dry subtle humor- the very fact that he does not justify his character's actions - the struggle of mankind, the inner conflict,is so beautifully portrayed.The Theme: Brother vs. BrotherThe Plot: Two Families in Salinas, California. The Trasks and the Hamiltons. Adam Trask who faces a life-long complex from his brother Charles Trask heads towards a new life - with his brand-new wife. The birth of his twins is a joyous moment only to result in a sad one - with Kathy (his wife) walking out onhim.He raises the kids with his manservant Lee - the ever symbolical of what is right - Chinese - who is a great human character in ages to come.The twins - Aron and Cal are poles apart and the rest is as they say \\"History\\".The Hamiltons are a different breed altogether. Nine children and Samuel Hamilton is a man who never feels the need to have more money.I guess the Biblical influence is immense in the book - but obvious it had to be!!Overall, a great great awesome read!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One of the most familiar stories from the Old Testament is thatof Cain and Abel. Because God was more pleased with Abel's gift,Cain murdered his brother and was exiled for the rest of hislife.Cain may have been the first murderer, but unfortunately he wasnot the last. His question, \\"Am I my brother's keeper\\" is ascrucial today as it was then. This crime is famous preciselybecause it is so universal.It is no wonder that novelists have used this story in their own work. One of the most famous of these modern parables is \\"East ofEden\\" by John Steinbeck. In fact, he uses the story at least twotimes.The first part of the novel focuses on two brothers, Charles andAdam Trask. As young boys their conflict began when their fathershows favoritism for Adam and continues throughout their adultlife, culminating on Adam's wedding night when Charles gets himdrunk and sleeps with his new wife.Nine months later Cathy's children (Steinbeck never tells us whothe father is) are born. Their very names, Cal and Aaron, tellsus quickly that the Cain and Abel story is going to be continuedin the new generation, and sure enough, it is. Adam, like hisfather before him, accepts a gift that Aaron gives him andrejects Cal's offering.The result is tragedy, and the search for redemption beginsagain. When Cal asks if he can overcome the evil he finds withinhim, he realizes that the answer is that he may, showing that hehas the power to choose good or evil for himself, a choice thatmakes him great.But the power of this book lies not just within the story itself;the characters Steinbeck draws for us are among the most vivid inmodern literature. In addition to the two sets of brothers isCathy, one of the most corrupt women I have ever encountered.From the time she burns her own parents alive to the way shemanipulates all of the men she encounters, she finds delight inevil.Balanced against her is Samuel Hamilton, a good man who findshappiness in the land on which he lives and his many inventions.When he first meets the Trasks, Adam is devastated because Cathyhas deserted her family to become a prostitute in nearby Salinas.Sam helps him to recover.But my favorite character is Lee, the Chinese sage who plays therole of the typical subservient Chinaman, but who in privateguides Adam and his boys. It is Lee who reveals the meaning ofthe Old Testament verb timshel as \\"thou mayest,\\" giving the giftof freedom to Cain and to us today. And it is Lee who must, atthe end, try to keep this family from destroying itselfcompletely.Steinbeck is a powerful writer, and this is one of his mostpowerful novels. I envy you if this is your first time readingit."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I literally could not put this down. Loose biblical parables have been around forever in literature, but what makes this so great is that it never just cops out by reducing down to one. Maybe the characters are fated or whatever, but they're also among the strongest characters he's written. Who wouldn't want to sit down for a beer with someone like Sam Hamilton or Lee? Who wouldn't want to claw out Cathy Ames's eyes? Who wouldn't want to offer some kind of reassurance to someone like Caleb Trask? A lot of sprawling, multi-generational family novels tend to collapse under their own weight, but Steinbeck is able to ground his so thoroughly in the regional sensibilities and culture of turn of the century California that you never loose a sense of what's happening or why it matters. Forget the Joads and forget George and Lennie, this is the Steinbeck book everyone should read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"First, I must confess my bias as a reviewer ofEast of Eden. This was one of the three most influential books in my life. I first read it as a teen and then reread it 13 years later. I believe John Steinbeck is one of truly great American writers. Readers would do well to look for an unabridged version as many bookstores carry the many edited versions which leave out some of the most poetic descriptions of setting in the literary canon.The entire work metaphor for Genesis, specifically the story of Cain and Abel. If Cain and Abel are unfamiliar, reading the first few chapters of the Hebrew Bible would increase the appreciation for what Steinbeck accomplished. The story works fine independently, but the meaning is that much richer when the biblical inspiration is understood.The first third of the book cover the early life of Adam and Charles Trask, half brothers controlled by an obsessively militaristic father. The one-legged former private trains them with drills, marches, shooting, and discipline from the time they are boys. Charles, the younger brother, is stronger and more fearless than Adam. Adam despises his father's rigidity. In an irony that rings true, it is the latter who ends up doing two tours in the army and the former who embraces the sedentary life of a farmer.The relationship between the brothers is forever altered by the introduction of an injured visitor named Cathy. She wins over one of the brothers. The other loathes her. Cathy is the most important character in the book, though she is very far from a protagonist.The bulk of the narrative takes place in the Salinas Valley, an area deeply imprinted in the early American West. The finest writing of the 20th century may very well lie with Steinbeck's pages of description of the Salinas Valley.Not everyone will like this book. There is no real hero, as in many classic works in the English language. It runs over 700 pages. The pace is closer to an 18th century novel than anything contemporary. Still, the characters are richly drawn and incorporate facets of all mankind. The story is timeless. The prose unrivaled by anything since.The Grapes of Wrathand \\"Of Mice and Men\\" are more popular by far, but East of Eden best demonstrates the author's skill. Few works merit the overused term 'masterpiece'. This is one."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the neverending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\" John Steinbeck, East of EdenThe preceding quote appears about halfway through Steinbeck's magnum opus, but it could just have easily have served as the epigraph. The powerful novel exhaustively explores the themes of good and evil in the lives and intertwining stories of two Salinas Valley, California families.I recently re-read Of Mice & Men, and the enjoyment it brought finally stripped my hesitation to tackle Steinbeck's 600 page East of Eden. It took a few weeks, but I was rewarded by a good story, well told.As the title suggests, Biblical themes reverberate throughout the book. The most prominent is that of Cain and Able that plays out first with Adam Trask and his brother, Charles, and then in Adam's two sons, Caleb and Aaron. The title was chosen by Steinbeck from Genesis 4:16: \\"And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden\\" (King James Version).Caleb (Cal) constantly wrestles with his sinful nature, evoking the Apostle Paul's words in Romans 7:19: \\"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do (KJV).\\" But that wrestling leaves him more in touch with his real identity and that of those around him. By contrast, his brother, Aaron had constructed a story of his life that reality intrudes upon with devastating consequences.The book also shows the generational impacts of fathers choosing favorites among their offspring, recalling the Biblical figures of Adam and Jacob. It shows true service in the character of the household servant, Lee. And while the allegories are ever present, they don't suffocate the tale. The characters and the landscape come to life in this timeless story that I wholeheartedly recommend."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The riches fill up fast and frequently in East of Eden, so much so that you're almost certain to call it one of the best books you've ever read long before you approach the end (which won't take long either). I feared how I'd react to a book so venerated - now, at 29, I'm long past the ability to read a book I'm \\"supposed\\" to read and appreciate the dimensions of. Besides a love of great writing, what makes East of Eden so easy to read is a nimble grasp - if not an embarrassing ease - Steinbeck seems to have on the fundamental understandings of life. I can't remember the last time I read a book like this that truly made me think, \\"Holy crap, the secrets of life are in here!\\"Here's what it does right, I think, right off the bat. It's not Adam Trask, the conflicted, haunted protagonist at its center, it's his brother, Charles. In the early pages of the novel, Adam and Charles get in a fight for which Charles is to blame. Yet as you get to know the two of them, something about Charles' rage and loneliness is compelling even as he sits in the background of the novel. East of Eden moves in and around their relationship, then moves away, as Adam falls in love with Cathy, which does not go well. Yet with each movement through Adam's life, the book cuts a little closer to the nature of what makes each person tick. Not just tick, but feel, think, and keep moving.There are themes in East of Eden that are important, that I want to talk and talk to anyone who has read the book about, but I think it best you read them for yourself. What I will say is that ultimately what makes East of Eden the most humane, insightful, perhaps best book I've read is that every truth is grasped through a character, specifically conceived, always presented as an individual, never spared the difficulties of life, and never responding as any other character would. East of Eden is beautiful, brisk, orchestrated like a magnificent concert, but what it is above all is the human experience, in all is breathtaking complexity. The book had won me over long before it follows Adam's son Cal into the deep ambivalence of his own thoughts of good and evil, a man who, as one character puts it is \\"packed to the brim of every good and evil instinct a man's ever had.\\" That it becomes Cal's story is the coup de gras - a statement that life is never more vital and beautiful than when it's full of contradiction and uneasy answers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have no problem admitting that I picked this book up for the author. I have had great success with the other books Steinbeck has written and this one is a masterpiece as well. What I liked about this one, however, is all of the lessons and hidden meanings that go along with the novel and the different interpretations that each reader has.It is important to remember that Steinbeck considers \\"East of Eden\\" his masterpiece. \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" had already become a classic in its own right but he was proud of this book in particular. Though I have to disagree to \\"East of Eden\\" being a better novel than \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", I can understand and respect all of the pride that is felt within the book.Like his other books, \\"East of Eden\\" starts out very slow and very descriptive. Steinbeck takes us into the lives of two different families; the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The two families both have farms in Salinas Valley, but one family has wealth and the other does not. Just before I wanted to throw the book across the room from being fed up with imagery, Steinbeck once again grabbed my attention with the introduction of Cathy Ames.By the time Cathy (Kate later in the novel) is introduced, the reader realizes that they are hooked to the novel. The reader has enough background on all the characters to feel like they are in the barn right next to the Hamiltons milking cows. This brings a tremendous amount of appreciation for each character.Throughout the book a series of life changing events are constantly introduced to the reader and each scene is crucial to the novel. Each and every character is essential to the novel and by the end the reader can fully accept and appreciate each one. Some people will go into all the symbolism of this book with the story of Cain and Abel, or the obvious link to the garden of Eden and praise the book for how well the story adapted to the time period it was written. Though this was very apparent and is an excellent story analyze, I chose to focus on all the goodness found in the book.Not to spoil the book, but many horribly sad and heart wrenching events take place. What I took away from the book was to look at the Hamiltons and the Trasks and see how different characters coped. It's truly amazing how good triumphed evil and really teaches a valid lesson of forgiveness. Martha Washington once said \\"I am still determined to be cheerful and happy, in whatever situation I may be; for I have also learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon our disposions, and not upon our circumstances\\". The Hamiltons especially lived by this quote. It was really an eye opener and lovely book.This book deserves to be a classic and John Steinbeck deserves to go down in history of one of the greatest authors of American Literature."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"As the title implies, East of Eden is a tale loosely based on the Bible's Book of Genesis, the story of the first human beings. The Salinas Valley of the early 20th century becomes the setting for the Garden of Eden. The descriptive imagery remains to be one of the most alluring features that holds underlying meanings as well. John Steinbeck artistically weaves universal themes of contrasting forces, especially in his portrayals of the surrounding environment. In East of Eden, one becomes conscious of the interconnections between the universe and between three generations of people.Despite the dullness of the first few chapters, the ending is one that slams into the reader and leaves a sense of satisfaction at the way things played out. The plot moves faster and faster and builds quicker and quicker until the climax. Similarly, the early characters are not yet as complex as the later ones, ones that readers become more attached to.The same characters of Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel are reincarnated in his characters of Adam, Cathy, Charles, Cal, and Aron. Their connection to the Bible makes the tale both predictable and whimsical. Although their actions reflect actions those of their Biblical counterparts in some way or sort, there is often a twist that renders the action theirs and theirs only. Each of the Trasks and Hamiltons are complex individual characters that readily exercise their own power of choice. Coincidentally, timshel, the power of choice, is one of Steinbeck's major themes, among themes of good versus evil and light versus dark. While Cal realizes his power and aims to change himself for good, other characters are less aware of their own part. One of the most enticing aspects of the story is his fight to free himself from the restraints that the Bible puts on him. Sure, he resembles Cain, but that does not mean that he is destined to be evil. It is this understanding that makes him the most interesting and perhaps the most dynamic player in the drama. Cathy, on the other hand, is simply bad and does nothing to prove otherwise. All she knows is evil, so that evil is her form of good. There is, however, a mystery to her that makes her passages of the book passages worth reading into and interpreting if only to discover her motives. Because even though we all know her evil, she elicits different levels of evil that both lures and disgusts others to dive deeper into her character.Written from different perspectives, East of Eden gives a patchwork account that can be interpreted as both helpful and tiring to read. It gives power to the reader as readers experience the omniscient viewpoint of knowing all while the characters themselves are still oblivious. But even when the story is so accessible to readers, there are still questions that the story proposes but never answers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's epic novel, \`East of Eden' is a depiction of his family's history in the Salinas Valley in California. Often the backdrop of many of his novels, \`...Eden' is certainly more autobiographical than most of his works. The story branches off just like a family tree, and organically the characters blossom into full life.Beginning with Cyrus Trask during the late 1800's, we develop a Jacob and Esau rivalry between his boys Charles and Adam. Cyrus is a martinet, so overbearingly so, that Adam joins the army just to get out of his sight. Later, when he returns, the boys have become men and continue their conflict, except Cyrus has died and left a small fortune to both of them. Much of the novel focuses on the transition each one takes to acquire land and place their wealth in the right direction.From there Adam is the central focus of the story. He falls in love with a woman named Catherine (also Cathy or Kate) who is a local prostitute. Through him she bears a pair of twins, Caleb and Aron, who are destined to be as different as Adam and Charles were. Adam truly adores Kate despite her livelihood, but the relationship turns tempestuous. While he finds it easy to forgive her transgressions, he can't seem to tame her wily nature.The remainder of the novel follows the aspirations of Adam's family, including Kate, whose conniving ways provide a colorful backdrop as Adam attempts to keep their mother's identity a secret until they are old enough to process her place in their lives. Many subplots intertwine with Aron being an aspiring college bound preacher who falls in love with Abra, a preacher's daughter, while Caleb tries to win his father\`s affection as an entrepreneur at home. As a heartwarming touch, Lee, an Asian-American housekeeper, adds much to the drama as a second surrogate parent of sorts.Reading Steinbeck's classic is delightful. I found the 601 pages to be a trademark page-turner from one of my favorite American authors. While I'll always revere 'The Grapes of Wrath (Penguin Classics)' as his most powerful classic, I now understand why \`East of Eden' is considered among the upper echelon of his great works. 'The Winter of Our Discontent' and \`Of Mice and Men' have an emotional immediacy that are his trademark, but his expertise is no less apparent in this novel with his ability to weave such an intricate and absorbing tale from beginning to end.As poetic prose, Steinbeck's timeless work has been reaffirmed by becoming one of Oprah's prized \\"Book of the Month\\" selections.(On a personal note, I'd like to add that 'The Red Pony' was the only Steinbeck novel I ever read in school. Apparently my educators saw the wisdom of leaving his legacy to my free time when I could savor his novels because I wanted to--and not because I had to. I read \`Of Mice and Men' during summer break during college, but I read the bulk of his famous works during the early nineties. Enjoy.)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I first found myself assigned the task of reading East Of Eden, I was intimidated by its length and wondering about its significance and how impressive would be. When I finished the entire novel, there were no doubts in my mind about its ability to apply to all humanity and meld the Bible into the lives of ordinary people. I was absolutely entranced by this book. It is a masterfully crafted work of literature that deserves to be read and digested by all people, and is rightfully placed as a classic.What makes East of Eden such a masterpiece is that author John Steinbeck melds the theme to fit all humans, no matter what their background is. Steinbeck brings the Biblical tale of brothers Cain and Abel to prominence in the novel, focusing on this Biblical allusion above the many others also used. The feuding brothers Charles and Adam Trask represent one generation of the Biblical duo, and Adam's sons Cal and Aron carry on the symbolism. Although readers are inclined to sympathize with the slain brother Abel the two characters that represent him in the novel (Adam and Aron), Steinbeck skillfully blends good and evil to give readers a sense of empathy for Charles and Cal, who do not receive the same degree of attention and devotion from their fathers that their brothers possess. Cal is the person who constantly feels the need to change his environment, which in effect leads to harm, yet he is genuinely searching for love and recognition from his father Adam Trask. Using this situation as a major conflict in the novel, Steinbeck emphasizes the importance of love to all human beings and the need for love, and the dangers resulting from deprived love.At certain chapters, Steinbeck diverts from the story and delves into philosophical discussions about human nature and the themes circulating in the novel. It is in these chapters that he explicitly mentions the ideas and motifs placed throughout the book, and the chapters further enhance the uniqueness of East of Eden. A wide variety of other Biblical events and characters are represented in the story as well, including Jesus, Jacob, Adam and Eve, the garden of Eden, and many more. The entire story is not a stale Biblical parable like one would think it is, but is actually an intriguing tale with a number of different storylines crossing together that succeeds in keeping the attention of readers. The major element that keeps East of Eden exciting and enjoyable to read is the constant conflict between good and evil, involving characters such as the thoroughly villainous Cathy, the sagacious Samuel Hamilton, and the wise, soothing Lee. Steinbeck uses these contrasting characters to depict the neverending struggle between good and evil that pervades the story. It is this battle that makes East of Eden such a constantly appealing book that all people can relate to. Steinbeck's skillful treatment of characters, conflicts and the themes of struggling for love and avoiding extreme actions succeed in making any reader interested and feeling relation to the characters. The message of the novel is best embodied through the character of Lee, the intellectual servant who introduces the word \\"Timshel\\", meaning \\"thou mayest\\", indicating that people are able to have control over personal futures, and carrying the story's idea that all people can choose their own paths in life. The strength of the book comes from its ability to apply to all people, which is what, according to Lee, the best stories are able to do.The writing styles used by John Steinbeck in East of Eden are truly remarkable and something to admire. Steinbeck's skill in describing a scene or object in fresh and exciting methods and his ability to narrate in a dry voice that still captures the attention of readers is what makes the book enjoyable. When touching upon the themes in those certain chapters, Steinbeck writes as if he were engaged in actual conversation with readers, and immerses them into his explanations. To add humor to the novel, Steinbeck intersperses the narration with sharp and insightful comments about human nature and the motivations and actions of people. For much of the book, Steinbeck's language is simple but conveys deep meaning and accurately paints the images of the novel in a way that is easy for people to comprehend. Readers may feel that East of Eden is far too long to be read quickly, but the storylines and conflicts will keep readers hooked and eager to delve into the story and analysis.Overall, East of Eden is a deeply entertaining novel that accurately reveals human nature and the difficulties and trials surrounding the lives of human beings. Steinbeck efficiently blends in Biblical characters and themes and elevates the struggles of ordinary people to as religious level that has relevance for all people. Such an accomplishment is rarely achieved by any author, making East of Eden a unique novel that is interesting to read and discuss."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What an incredibly written novel portraying the Biblical story of Cain and Abel! I have never come across a book this great. Steinbeck did a marvelous job in putting his thoughts and themes together throughout the book. Each characters is very well defined and each symbolizes either the good or the evil. Thimsel- \\"thou mayest\\" is a Hebrew word that means \\"GOD has given humans the choice to overcome their sins\\". This phrase means a great deal to the novel and in fact, it is the core idea of the novel. A person might inherit characterstics of his predecessors, but he is the one who has the ability choose whether to follow though it or to stand up on his own conscience."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have seen the movie and thought I knew \\"East of Eden\\". I got the book for Christmas and decided to read it. Surprise! The book is a wonderful, in depth story of the lives of many characters against the back drop of the Salinas Valley at the turn of the 20th century. It is a terrific American story. The movie uses only about 15% of the book. I am not as impressed with the movie now that I have read the book. I realize now that the movie is supported by it's fine acting rather than by the story. The story in the movie is really a cut-and-paste job of the book. Read the book. It's a real treat."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"By the time Steinbeck wrote \\"East of Eden,\\" (EOE) he had already written several American classics including \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and \\"Cannery Row\\" to mention only a few. By then, he was a recognized master of the use of language. He could and did create complex images that evoked a wide range of thoughts and emotions. The first chapter of EOE - where he describes the setting of the Salinas Valley - lets any doubter know that they are reading the product of a magnificent writer.I have sampled a few scholarly reviews of EOE, and I was dumbfounded by the negative tone that critics have used in reference to this novel. Their problem seems to be with the heavy-handed use of symbolism. There are one-sided characters that can be nothing more or less than the idea that they are representing. Cathy is probably the clearest example of this, evil and nothing but evil. Steinbeck also portrays two sets of \\"Cain and Abel\\" brothers who act out variations of the themes of brotherly murder and being a \\"brother's keeper.\\" So, this is an interesting and valid observation.However, the wonders of the book clearly overshadow all else. In addition to the imagery, which is arguably unsurpassed in American writing, he has used the story of his mother's family, the Hamiltons of Salinas Valley, to serve as an historical backdrop for the story of the symbolically challenged Trasks. He has painted a picture of his own beginnings with flair and insight while interweaving the morality tale that creates the tension and vehicle that moves the plot along. This feat is handled seamlessly. Each family is colorful and interesting. Each individual is fully developed. As a result, each page is anticipated and savored.In the end I would say that the \\"scholars\\" need to be careful. Like all subjective evaluations, the judgement of the quality of John Steinbeck's work is relative. Perhaps he did not surpass his greatest accomplishments with EOE. On the other hand, very few novelists have come close to the artistry that flows through this book from beginning to end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden was stunning in its portrayal of the human soul. It encompasses the Face of Mankind with all its frailities and complexities, failures, struggles, wisdom gleaned and truth discovered in the beauty of our daily lives. The book was a canvas of the human heart- from the dark, innermost monsters and demons that haunt every last one of us to the far reaches to the summit where we discover fleeting joy and light and love. East of Eden is about forgiveness and LEARNING to forgive and acceptance and about choices and the awesome magnitude of free agency and how what each individual does affects everyone around them. East of Eden can be summed up in a word: Sublime. Read it. You won't soon forget it. It is astounding in its narrative clarity and ability to transport the reader into the heart and minds of the characters and the lessons learned within and internalize these truths. Beautiful!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If Oprah Winfrey was looking to get the American public (and perhaps even the world) interested in reading \\"classic\\" literature she could have not chosen a better selection than John Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden.\\" This is certainly not the \\"tamer\\" Steinbeck that I read in high school English class. While we may not even think twice about it today, \\"Eden\\" must have been simply scandalous when it was originally published in 1952 with murder, prostitution, and adultery just some of the more \\"adult\\" issues explored in this epic novel.Despite its intimidating length, \\"East\\" moves along quickly as we follow the life of Adam Trask - from his East Coast childhood and troubled relationship with his brother to businessman and father of two sons with equally complex relations of their own. As the title suggests, the book is a modern retelling of the biblical story of Cain and Abel story. As with most of the \\"classics,\\" the novel is rife with topics and themes to deeply delve into and discuss with your book club. My only criticisms are that the \\"good vs. evil\\" angle gets a bit heavy-handed at times and, for me, the novel loses some steam in the final quarter - but these are certainly not enough to not heartily recommend the work.The nice thing about \\"Eden\\" is if you choose not to take the \\"literary\\" route, you can still be simply entertained and enthralled by Steinbeck's plot and characters. There is enough suspense and intrigue that make it not terribly different from many of today's bestsellers."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I'm so pleased Oprah chose this book. I feel it's overshadowed by \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" yet so much more powerful. Take the time to get through the first part of the book about the history of the land and region where the book takes place -- it's well worth it to get to the meat of the story. The story follows generations of a family repeating the same cycle of hurt and betrayal parallel to the story of Cain and Abel in the Bible (you only need a cursory knowledge of the biblical story to understand). It's a gripping story, but the message of the book is all about personal choice, how life may throw us curve balls but it is up to us individually to decide how we cope and CHOOSE to live. I read this book almost 20 years ago and it changed the way I view life. More than anything, this book is very empowering and challenges readers to be responsible for actions, or lack thereof, in their lives."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" is one of John Steinbeck's most fascinating and disturbing novels; a tale of envy, conflict and betrayal between two generations of brothers - Adam and Charles Trask, and Adam's twin sons, Aron and Caleb. The novel spans the period between the American Civil War and the end of World War I. Adam Trask grew up with his brother, Charles, on a farm in Connecticut. Their father clearly favored gentle Adam throughout their lives, leaving Charles, the wilder and more violent of the two boys, bitter and envious. Charles loved his father and brother deeply, but could never elicit the old man's affection. The jealousy he felt towards Adam gnawed at him constantly, and he finally left home to join the army. The brothers did not see each other for many years. Whenever Charles came home they argued relentlessly. And again Charles would go away. Finally, their father died, leaving both sons a fortune.Cathy Ames, a narcissistic, manipulative girl with few redeeming characteristics, plays a profoundly symbolic role in this Steinbeck novel. When she showed up at the Trask home one evening, beaten and close to death, Adam nursed her back to health. Gulled by Cathy's seeming vulnerability and beauty, he married her. She got him drunk on their wedding night, and while he slept, she had sex with Charles. Adam bought some land outside of Salinas, California, and moved there with his unwilling wife. He wanted to create an Eden for his Eve. Pregnant, and miserable at the thought of becoming a mother, Cathy tried to abort and failed. She stayed in Salinas long enough to give birth to fraternal twins, Aron and Caleb. Soon after their birth, Cathy abandoned her family, shooting her husband in the chest before exiting. Adam was so disturbed by the loss of his wife that he wanted little to do with his sons. The boys were raised by Lee, an Asian hired hand, who cared for them as his own. Samuel Hamilton, a neighbor and local philosopher, visited Adam frequently, attempting to jolt him out of his depression. On one occasion the two men discussed the biblical story of Cain and Able, Mr. Steinbeck's metaphor for this novel.Like their father and uncle, the twins constantly vie for their father's attention. Aron meets a young woman at school and becomes deeply attached to her. She is the first woman to show him affection. Caleb is beside himself with jealousy...and longing.The ensuing conflicts, and unnecessary alienation, between Aron and Caleb are heartbreaking. There is a painful scene when Adam repeats history, and tells Caleb, in spite of all the young man's efforts to please, that he should be more like his brother. The novel, however, does ends on a note of hope and redemption.I don't think Steinbeck's main characters are as fully developed, or as complex, as they could be because he is so intent on drawing similarities between them and their Biblical counterparts. In his retelling of the Cain and Abel story, Adam, Charles, Cathy, Aron and Caleb, are forced to reenact the ancient drama of exile from Eden. However the Biblical references are interesting, and the plot and subplots are tension-filled and moving. His secondary characters, Lee, Samuel, Abra, are beautifully drawn, realistic portraits of believable people. Their stories, histories and motives, are fascinating and add much to this deeply moving masterpiece by John Steinbeck.JANA"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The blurb on the back of this book says that it is a Biblical story, a modern retelling of the Cain and Able story. But it is more than just a clever satire. It is the story of humanity as Steinbeck perceives it, told as an allegory through two generations of two families in the Salinas Valley of California. John Steinbeck reached very far into himself to write this book. He has an incredble insight into human emotions - as I was reading his simple and beautiful prose I felt that he must have known me intimately to write to me so succintly and so personally. As it was written fairly late in his life and his career, one gets the impression that he wanted to tell one final, ultimate story that would last forever. This may be as close to that story as one man can get.The last book I read was Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson.The next book I plan to read is Love in the Time of Cholera, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A fantasic novel with enough twists, turns, descent, heart ache and mental anguish to entrain even the average 21st Centruy reader.I have always enjoyed Steinbeck and after completing \\"East of Eden\\" I truly believe that he is one of, if not the quintessential American author. As accomplished as Hemmingway and Salinger are, Steinbeck has a gift for relating to the most common-place among us.

That's what makes them real. The main female character, Cathy Ames, or whichever alias you want to use turned my insides out. I know that I would have easily succumbed to her as many of the characters did. Steinbeck incorporates little side stories that cling like branches to the main story. When I finished it, I threw it across the room. I couldn't have it around me anymore and since I've finished it, I haven't been able to get into another book. I might just have to reread it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is clearly a great novel. There is crime and psychopathology and horror. There is adventure. There is lyricism.

The description of the surroundings is so eloquent and makes you feel like you are right there in California. The plot can essentially be boiled down to good vs. evil. You can read the other reviews for more informative plot synopsis. Essentially you just NEED to get this book, sit back and enjoy."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is one of my favorite works of fiction. It is rich and multi-layered. That the allegory is so obvious does not detract from the story, since it is, in essence, a universal tale of human nature. The Grapes of Wrath (Steinbeck's more famous novel) is more political, while East of Eden is, again, a study of human nature. Between the two, I find East of Eden to be better written. Both have intercallary chapters, but whereas the intercallary chapters in Grapes of Wrath seem like abrupt diversions from the main story, they are better integrated within the immediate world of the characters of interest in East of Eden.I read East of Eden when I was 15 (it was part of my high school curriculum), and I've decided to read it again, at the age of 29. I am certain that I will appreciate facets of the work that escaped me 14 years ago.Anyway, it's a must-read.

I've read some of Steinbeck's most celebrated novels and none of them even came close to this one.I have been in the sciences for some years now and have neglected reading novels.

Despite my impatience and my harsh criticisms of most the novels I read, I found this one to be engrossing due to each character's fantastic description and roles they play in the story. Despite the fact that the copy I had was over 900 pages long, I found myself wishing it had never ended. The book stayed in my mind for weeks after I finished it. I have never had a novel impact me so much in my life and I will never forget it. Everything else I've read since then has just seemed like complete garbage.I look forward to the day when I have a copy on my bookshelf and my future child gets old enough to pull it down and read it. What a reward, what a gem."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It would be impossible not to rank John Steinbeck along with Mark Twain and Faulkner as one of America's greatest writers. I have known that for years, and why I had not read \\"East of Eden,\\" I do not know.Steinbeck's characters speak of and to the soul of man, perhaps never more so than in \\"East of Eden.\\"It had been a number of years since I last read Steinbeck. With \\"East of Eden\\" I'm reminded how brilliant his writing is, but also never to let his other books gather too much dust."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"I enjoyed this American classic by Steinbeck - complex story with many characters and stories interwined, in a tale of good and evil literally personified. I found the story a bit overloaded with parallels to the story of Cain and Abel, particularly the naming of various characters, but, overall, a very enjoyable read, making me want to read more Steinbeck."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. Very beautifully written, almost poetic while being gritty, raw and a real page turner. Doubles as a history book of the California valley."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Excerpt from the first page of East of Eden:\\"I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gaymountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you wantedto climb into their warm foothills almost as you want to climb into the lap of abeloved mother. They were beckoning mountains with a brown grass love. TheSanta Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the valley from theopen sea, and they were dark and brooding -- unfriendly and dangerous. Ialways found in myself a dread of west and a love of east. Where I ever gotsuch an idea I cannot say, unless it could be that the morning came over thepeaks of the Gabilans and the night drifted back from the ridges of the SantaLucias. It may be that the birth and death of the day had some part in my feelingabout the two ranges of mountains.\\"Oh my goodness, who wouldn't want to keep reading?The sheer beauty of the location is conveyed so incredibly well, along with the harsh reality of the less lush and fertile, but still awe inspiring countryside. The first pages absolutely captivated me, I don't know that I have ever read such beautiful descriptions of a place. I'll be honest, sometimes lengthy descriptive writing bores me a tad, I want plot, a story, I want to know what is going on with the people in a book. Oh, I like vivid descriptions, especially vivid descriptions of something magnificent as much as the next person . . . but don't make those descriptions take pages and pages please. Not so with East Of Eden, I could read John Steinbeck's representation of the Salina's Valley all day long.I don't think there are many coincidences in East of Eden, there seems to be symbolism everywhere, that goes beyond all the C and A names and boys giving unappreciated gifts to their father. I wonder if there is something symbolic in the description of the eastern Gabilan Mountains seeming to be warm and representing the love of a mother, I wonder if they represent Lee the Chinese-American servant and if the dark and dangerous Santa Lucia mountains of the west represent Cathy? This is a book I could read over just to try and find nuances that I am sure are there but I have missed. It is that kind of book, you know you are missing stuff. Well, I'm at least sure that I am missing stuff! That isn't a criticism, it is praise. I think I could dig my teeth into this book again, albeit for different reasons the second time around. I rarely read books again, unless years and years have passed."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Awesome book. i would highly recommend to everyone. Very hard to put down once you start.So if you want a great book to read. You must choose this one. 5 Stars!!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a beautiful but brutal story of sibling rivalry, parent-child relationships, and the inherent good and evil in each one of us. The novel spans three generations of the Trask family, beginning with the amoral patriarch Cyrus, who invents himself as a heroic soldier but is actually a thieving failure in the army. His two sons--Charles and Adam--recreate the story of Cain and Abel. Charles is smart and bitter over his father's obvious preference for Adam. Adam is naive and unimpressed by his father's affections. Adam marries the beautiful but sociopathic prostitute Cathy, who sleeps with Charles on their wedding night and shoots Adam after bearing twins. The twins--Cal and Aron--recreate the story of Charles and Adam in a pathetic and depressing historical retread.The overall theme of this tale is that each person has good and evil within them, and must consciously choose the moral path. Steinbeck rejects the idea that a person is inherently good or evil and has no control over his destiny. Even the evil Cathy ultimately recognizes her immorality, and seems to regret having no love in her life.I found the characters dealing with Cathy to be the most interesting. Cathy and Lee were the most finely developed character in the novel for me. Though Cathy is primarily \\"evil\\" and Lee is primarily \\"good\\", both characters contained complexities and contradictions more finely tuned than those that were present in, for example, Adam Trask and Samuel Hamilton.I can't help but compare this epic novel to Steinbeck's other opus, The Grapes of Wrath. I enjoyed the Grapes of Wrath more, because the characters were more multi-dimensional and the story more fluid. Here the characters seemed like symbols more than actual people--pawns in Steinbeck's obvious allegory. Nevertheless, this novel is worth your time to read. It contains beautiful prose and thought-provoking ideas. This highly ambitious novel succeeds on many levels, and is a pleasure to read and ponder."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"These book is one of the greatest clasics you can come across. It is a serene insight in relationship on man-women and brotherhood issues. Though is not very crystal on answering the question why the main character is so sentimentaly naive and as such against all odds, but still the situation, the consequences of it are colorfuly depicted. It's a book how Good can survive against the Evil but still it gets the shorter end of it. There is no ideal or divine realization that good will win overall. Being truly and naivly good doesn't mean that you will be awerded for it and that a true love can win at the end. It can be farse to itself."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read East of Eden as a freshman in college. To be frank, ABC was premiering their miniseries, and I wanted to have some knowledge base before it started. To say that I am not a fan of Steinbeck is a severe understatement. Whenever we were required to read one of his novels in high school, I truly wanted to cry every time. I went to a very small college in Wisconsin, and the library only had one copy of the book that had not been checked out in a loooong time. I brought it back to my dorm room with the idea that if nothing else, I could use it to aid with my insomnia. By the end of the first paragraph I was hooked!! To say that it was a difficult read puts it mildly. It really does have the power to strip pieces of your heart away as you take the journey with Cal. It's also one of those books that you know that when you finish, you will not come back to it for a long time. You can't. The emotions are just that powerful. I watched the mini series afterwards, and was pleased at how true they tried to stay to the basic essence of the book. I'm glad Oprah's brought this beauty back into the light for everyone to enjoy. But, be prepared for the bruises that your emotions will take along the novels journey."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden by John Steinbeck captivated my interest, leaving me spellbound during many incidents. However, I sometimes felt like a fish trying to catch a bait that was put before me and snatched away just when I wanted to take a big bite. That is, I could almost never guess the outcome. The characters often seemed to switch positions from being the good guy to the bad guy, and perhaps that is the way of temptation, luring a good person into doing evil things. Adam should have remained pure,Cathy should have had more decency but was a &quot;wolf in sheep's clothing,&quot; and Charles, though presented at first as an icon of everything that was good, all to soon does an about face being lured by his ego and loose women. The characters battle against each other and the strong forces of nature to transform resistant land of the Salinas Valley in California to a garden of splendor, all in a backdrop of the Civil War years. Steinbeck splendidly uses his mastery of language and genuis at depicting one-of-a-kind characters to create a tale of love/hate, good/evil, trust/deception, poverty/wealth cleverly intertwined so that a second guess turns into a soured truth with a hole in it. I highly recommend the reading of this book with its unpredictability, even though the reader may feel manipulated and deceived, just as the characters often were."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was a little apprehensive to start reading this 602 page long novel, but after the first 40 pages or so, I really got into it and couldn't put it down. The characters are well thought out and have distinct, unique personalities that make the reader feel as if he or she knows them. To get the full meaning of East of Eden, I read Spark Notes after every chapter. Doing this helped me understand the relationship between Cain and Abel, and Charles and Aron. The only complaint I had with this book was that it seemed to end quickly. It seemed a little predictable and put a damper on the wonderfully written 550 preceding pages. However, East of Eden is my favorite novel written by Steinbeck, and I will definitely read it again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The Story written by John Steinback reaches into new depths of exploring a persona of identity. Resembling the tale of Cain & Abel, the conflicting forces of good and evil wage war with the dream of Eden. The power of goodness prevails, the mystic background of those who can or cannot be trusted, are all included in this all-out deep thinking novel. This novel stresses the such points on frienship, bitterness, dealing with decit, persistence to achieve, and a twisted romance leading to disaster.For those who will enjoy reading a fast pace, deep thinking, adventure, romance, this book is worth the reading and worth the time. The con of this novel, is the amount of page reading to do, not unless you like long page books, or the difficulty or understanding level. Overall though, this book is a classic that cannot be ignored and a book for almost everyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden cannot be looked upon as strictly good versus evil, as it appears with Adam and Cathy. To the reader, Adam appears to be the extreme \\"good\\" while Cathy appears to be the extreme \\"evil\\". Taken from a different perspective, can Cathy be seen as \\"evil\\" when she does not view herself as being \\"evil\\"? Is Adam \\"good\\" or merely human? Without analyzing the complexities of the language, the story will appear to be solely good vs. evil. Without the mindset that the characters are either good or either evil, the characters are more believable and realistic despite some of the extremes of good and evil such as Cathy's apparent lack of all the good that people can have.East of Eden also parallels the fall of Adam and Eve and the rivalry of Cain and Abel. The parallel to the fall of Adam and Eve is quite subtle and not as easily apparent as the rivalry of Cain and Abel. For example Charles and Adam, and Caleb and Aron represent the Cain and Abel pair. Although the parallels do exist and even have recurrences throughout the novel, Steinbeck does not make it the main point of the novel. The use of these biblical parallels serves as a backdrop to the story.Ultimately Steinbeck shows that people have a choice over good and evil having the choice to be good or to be evil. As an example from the novel, Cal (Caleb) recognizes that he is evil yet chooses to attempt to lead a good life as portrayed through Aron, his twin brother."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book opens up with the most persuasive commercial I've ever encountered - it's a commercial for California. And it stays on such a standard for the rest of its great length. It encompasses so many of the struggles, feelings, and victories that \\"the man's man\\" feels, and that the rest of us can feel too. This book is so human. We find ourselves wanting more than anything for Adam Trask to be stronger, for Charles to do something good, not for goodness' sake but for his own. We want Samuel Hamilton to come over to the Trask house again. We want to go there and live in all of this.Then, as Cal and Aron grow up and distinguish themselves from one another, we find their most distant of moments our saddest, their laughter becomes ours, and near the end (which I won't spoil) we want so much for Adam, Cal, and Aron to have more time to spend together. When I finish this book the next time around I'll have to give my brother a call. or maybe just go home for a week to spend time with him. Great book. Great book.Even for the reader who remains separate from the characters, East of Eden is a story about the most intriguing of human actions. The reason I say this book is so human is because of the characters. They make the action, of which there is plenty, not the other way around. It is not a boring book - Steinbeck filled it with plenty of interesting and complex characters who all refuse to be spectators and show themselves instead to be agents of goodwill, love, hate, evil, jealousy, ambition, and embrace."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one novel I read when I want to appreciate the mastery of the writing as well as the pleasure of the story itself. Steinbeck sure has a way with words! The story itself is almost the stuff of soap operas - two brothers and a woman one of them marries, twin children abandoned by their mother (the aforementioned woman) who becomes a madam, and a wonderful Chinese character who is never quite what he seems. But what a wonderful story it is!The characters are very well drawn, and Cathy is one of the best evil characters to fill the pages of a novel in a long time. There are of course the parralels to Cain and Abel, but that was a fairly simple story, and this one certainly isn't! A truly great read and one I highly recommend."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. It is the old story of Cain and Abel with a few twists--most of which you don't see coming. The characters are well drawn and thoroughly believable. This is a gotta read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"And I am gearing up and reread it. I happened upon the movie and fell in love with James Dean. So, then I found the book at the local library. I couldn't put it down. There was so much more than the movie offered!

Even if you are not a fan of classic American lit you will love this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I recently reread East of Eden. The first time I read it, I thought it was powerful, the second specatcularly powerful. The timeless issues in this book, Cain v. Abel, father and children, knowledge and its pursuit, and of course the concept of pursuing one's own destiny reverberate through each chapter. Whether dealing with Charles and Adam, Lee, Kathy, Caleb and Aron or Samuel and the Hamiltons, the book raises so many questions worth pondering and discussing. I would add this is one of the great book club books. Anybody with a love of thought should read this."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a book I could hardly put down.

I read it first time 40 years ago and I'm even more moved today."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"At 600 pages, East of Eden is a serious commitment but one that is well worth the effort. It beautifully captures life in America from the Civil War to the end of WWI while creating page-turning excitement thanks in large part to the terrifying machinations of its villain Cathy Ames, possibly the most insidious figure in all literature. (And I mean that.) It is an incredibly ambitious, meandering, sweeping, disorganized and totally mesmerizing experience. It is far from perfect. The allusions to the story of Cain and Abel started to border on tiresome, and some generous editing would have been welcome. But that doesn't take a way from the book's hypnotic power and the magic of its finely portrayed characters. I felt that I knew Samuel Hamilton and the servant Lee, like they were sitting in my living room. Character development is the book's greatest strength, along with the dream-like descriptions of the Salinas Valley.

This manages to mix his usual poetic styling with a story of utmost cruelty, sadness and pathos that you are left profoundly moved and affected. This novel doesn't flow quite as easily as 'Grapes of Wrath' and has more asides to comment on the story and points being raised, but this made for a more in-depth experience and one that leaves you thinking about the themes to a greater degree. The introduction is very good, but be aware it has many spoilers and is best read after you've read the novel through, I didn't do this and some aspects of the story were slightly ruined as a result. Steinbeck has the power to draw you into the novel and make you delight at his turn of phrase and the emotions he evokes within you. You feel yourself despairing with certain characters and smarting at the injustices portrayed, as well as a whole host of other emotions, the mark of a great novel. This wont leave you feeling especially upbeat, but it will leave you profoundly moved and different from when you started it and I don't know about you but I cherish and respect that in any book. Snap it up and immerse yourself in the world of this book. HIGHLY recommended.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a positively wonderful book. Steinbeck's literary ability & style is phenomenal. One of the very best writers of several of the best books I've ever read. I recommend \\"East Of Eden\\" to everybody! And you'll want to read \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" too!!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said before? It's a great story about the struggle between good and evil in all of us. One of my favorites."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Oh Steinbeck. You and your accessible classics laden with allegory!This novel is an American classic in every sense that it can be: It's a going-out-west story. A family story. A foraging off the land story. A story of fortune. Of dreams and thwarted dreams. Of what makes a man (or woman) who they are.Steinbeck \\"himself\\" narrates the story--though from a still-omnipotent perspective--giving a unique tie into the story and also increasing the feeling that (though we know their innermost thoughts and motivations) we are merely observing the characters. We are all players in the Great American Drama of our lives.Steinbeck smacks the reader a little hard with the allegory stick--it's heavy handed and its explanations feel inorganic compared to the rest of the story--but the characters are so finely drawn that we forgive him. The players are in themselves flawed and good (or flawed and flawed), with depth--tragedy and fortune carefully portioned.Through the novel, we get the sense that our lives will repeat on a loop; the scenery will change. The players will change. The times will change. But there will always be the same kind of people in the world playing out the same acts of their lives. Perhaps this makes the Cain and Abel biblical allusions (heavy handed!) not so far-fetched after all."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this as a teen, but didn't appreciate the power and beauty of \\"East of Eden\\" then. It is Steinbeck's best work! I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Amazing. Six hundred pages of amazement. This novel is a page turner and will keep you occupied. With an equal distribution of suspenseful plot and biblical allusions, John Steinbeck adds a twist to the well known Cain and Abel story, creating two generations of brothers who endure all, injury, betrayal, isolation, curiosity, faithfulness, appreciation, doubt, and deceit.This story begins with Charles and Adam Trask who are brothers who constantly bicker for their father's attention. When Cyrus, their father, publicly favors Adam over Charles, Charles becomes consumed by his jealousy and goes so far as an attempted murder. After this incident, Charles and Adam are not the same towards each other again; however, isolation and much time apart have partially repaired this broken brotherly bond. One day Adam meets Cathy, a beautiful yet weak girl, who he nurtures and eventually marries. Cathy and Adam have twins, Cal and Aron who are representations of Cain and Abel. Similar to the process that their father went through, Cal and Aron also bicker for Adam's attention. Since Aron is liked more by others and seems to have a bright future (his incredible knowledge that will land in college), Cal wonders why he cannot be like Aron, and so he begins finding answers by searching for his runaway mother, Cathy. When Cal learns about Cathy's real character, he wonders if a part of her is within him and if it is causing all the pain and darkness he feels. He wants to find himself and discover who he really is instead of whom people think he is.Based off of popular biblical stories, this novel is incredibly well written, yet easy enough to read without a dictionary handy. Despite its length, this novel is not drawn out and the events occur fast enough to forget about its length."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A biblical parallel to the stories of Cain and Abel and the Original Sin, East of Eden is written by John Steinbeck in the 1950s. Steinbeck beautifully captures the social and economic atmospheres of the late 19th to early 20th centuries, and gives an honest depiction of man's struggle in a society. There was no fluff or buffer as Steinbeck presents only the very truth in this novel. From Adam Trask's generation to that of his sons', they all faced the challenge of surpassing their inner fears and jealousy. This constant struggle truthfully conveys an ever-existing problem that remains unsolved today.Once I look past its daunting appearance (a whopping 762 pages!), this book is definitely a page-turner with its complex plotlines and dynamic characters. While there is a distinct climax (Cal, enraged and jealous when his father rejects Cal's gift of $15,000, takes out his anger on Aron by telling him about their mother's life as a prostitute and takes him to see Cathy at her brothel), the rest of the eventful novel retains a high interest level throughout with constant twists and turns.Steinbeck also introduces the interpretation of the ultimate message of the story, centering on the Hebrew word \\"timshel.\\" When Samuel Hamilton reads one translation of the story, the story seems slanted, but as Lee finally reveals through his investigations, the word is not a command, but rather a choice \\"thou mayest.\\" The original sin was the choice of humans, but Cain, and now Cal, can choose for themselves to overcome the inherent evil within them by taking a stand. They will never be perfect, but from now on, they can seek what they know is right.This novel is a pleasant surprise as compared to other Steinbeck's novels I have read - most of all however, is that it has worn off my mentality that John Steinbeck = dull. East of Eden is anything but dull."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you do not have much time over the next couple days, DON'T read this book. Not only will it eat away your life, but also you will be distracted by whatever you need to do. Rather, wait until you have a nice week or so to spare. The book's masterful and entrancing writing had me awake in the wee hours of morning, unwilling to stop reading the story's beautiful progression.Successfully paralleling the novels' tale of two families to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel, John Steinbeck intertwines the aspects of the allusion to reflect the actions of the pairs of brothers in the story. Furthermore, he even corresponds the first letter of the brothers' name to be C(ain) and A(bel), with C jealous of A.Each character is imbued with a collage of complexity and struggles. Adam Trask is overly trusting and inability to see people as they really are while his brother Charles Trask fails to attract the approval their father. Adam's twin sons, the next set of boys, subsequently have their troubles too. Aron suffers with moral sensibility, whereas Cal strains like Charles to find the acceptance of his father. Complementing these composite brothers are Cathy, Adam's malicious, yet pretty wife, Lee, the helpful Chinese assistant, and Samuel Hamilton, Adam's poor unfortunate, but kind neighbor in the Salinas Valley who aids him throughout the novel.Steinbeck's style is plainly awesome. The captivating style entices all. Its eloquence mimics the Biblical allusion wonderfully. The contrasting characters bring layers of intricacy to the story. Each is supplemented by the question of an innate destiny and how much they truly are affected by it.In conclusion, for your life to be complete, you must have read this book. The book is essentially the epitome of literature, the apex of novels, the zenith of stories. If you have some spare change, go out and add this masterpiece to your collection. It definitely is worth every half-a-penny."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book could not have been written in 1952. It is too sexy, too vibrant, too....awesome, but it was, and you should read it and add it to your top ten collection of best books ever."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I hadn't read any Steinbeck since high school and I didn't remember liking him all that much. But East of Eden was highly recommended to me so I decided to give it a go.I have to say I liked it. I then watched the movie and boy, was that a lot different. But I liked it too in its own way.The story is really a timeless one and essentially a retelling of Cain and Abel times two. And if you don't have a knack for the Biblical symbolism, well Steinbeck screams it at you every chance he gets ( I think Cal actually says, \\"Am I my brother's keeper\\"). I was worried about how it would end but I thought it did so very well."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"While this book is a little rough around the edges (I believe this was Steinbeck's intent and therefore part of its beauty), it delivers with amazing insights into theology, human nature and psychology. Steinbeck writes in such a way that you find yourself not just reading a story but experiencing the events as if you were there witnessing them. This book drew me in from the beginning and satisfied at every turn. It is a wonderful look at the nature of God and humanity from an unorthodox perspective. Very enlightening and rewarding."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck delivered another great America novel with one of his masterpiece, East of Eden. When I first picked up the book from the shelf of Borders, I was a little intimidated with the thickness of the book because long lengthen books tend to contain a lot of rambling and eventually I would loose interest. But because of the positive feedbacks I heard about the book, I decided to give it a read. The book was simply amazing and I'm glad that the length of the book didn't intimidate me as much.Steinbeck begins the book with the setting of Salinas Valley, California. With the beautifully written description of the valley, Steinbeck introduces the start of the Trask family and the innately malevolence woman Cathy. The sympathetic Adam Trask takes in the ferociously beaten girl, Cathy, after he finds her on their doorstep during a rainy night. After taking care of Cathy's injuries, Adam finds himself madly in love with the girl. Cathy has extreme physical beauty, but the nature of her immorality is at hidden. Adam marries the girl and soon Cathy gave birth to twin boys- Aron and Cal. The young couple moves onto a plantation next to the Hamiltons. Then Cathy shoots Adam by the shoulder and flees from the city. Torn by Cathy's love, the confused and deprived Adam raises the twins with the help from his Asian helper, Lee.Steinbeck then shifts the focus of the story to the Hamilton family. Samuel Hamilton, the man of the house, alludes to Steinbeck's grandfather. He describes Samuel to be a highly respected character with a brilliant mind. Through out the story, Samuel Hamilton becomes a great inspiration to Adam Trask. But when Adam takes Samuel's idea and starts the cargo business, the Trask family fells into poverty.In the middle of the book, Steinbeck begins to unravel the mystery of Cathy. He starts this with her sons Cal and Aron. It is inevitable for the sons to not question about their \`deceased' mother. But the words escapes and Cal finds his mother in the brothel of a city not too far from Salina Valley. After Adam learns the location of his wife, he travels to the city in search of her. Adam learns the abusive history of Cathy and the reasons to her beating on that raining night when they first met. Later she poisons the owner, Faye and takes over the place under an infamous title. Knowing that his sentimental brother will be crushed to know he has been lied to, Cal tries the best to keep the secret. But one night when their father chose Aron's gift over Cal's money, jealousy overwhelms Cal and the secret flees as well. After Aron learns about the truth, he immediately enlists in the Army claming that he has no emotions left to care.There're more to the story after Aron goes to war. The book is enriched with plots, emotions, conflicts, and descriptive insights. I simply love Steinbeck's creative story line and the highly sophisticated way he played with the adjectives. The story is allusion to the Book of Genesis especially Chapter 4 of the story Cain and Abel. Steinbeck managed to obtain many of biblical references to the story without giving obvious ending to the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who simple is looking for a good read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden covers two families interwoven histories from the American Civil War to WWI. Most of the characters and events represent Biblical characters and events pretty overtly. One Biblical and philosophical theme constantly grappled with is the eternal question of good and evil. Steinbeck's answer to whether humans are destined to a life of good or evil is with a Hebrew word in the Bible: Timshel!, literally translating to 'thou mayest.' While the characters appear to be inherently good or bad, they are not that simple. As Steinbeck attempts to prove, humans dictate their actions.At times East of Eden is jumpy and a mumble jumble of references and tangents. Yet Steinbeck's ability to cover the behemoth topic with pretty direct writing is impressive, and more than makes up for the wild tangential passages. After reading a brief synopsis of Steinbeck's personal biography, I see much of Steinbeck and his family comes alive in the characters. Steinbeck succeeded in covering an immense range of issues loosely following his own family history, and still maintaining his central thesis. Even though the first hundred pages are slow, I recommend this book, even to those with a lay knowledge of Genesis. Keep pressing through and enjoy Steinbeck's enlightening work and imaginative characters."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I had read this book and thorougly enjoyed it so I sent it to my grandson who is 21 who basically is not really a \\"reader\\". His reaction to the story was worth everything to me. He now wants me to send him more classics which in itself is a miracle. So more Steinbeck and now Faulkner, Williams and whatever I can think of."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have never felt the need to review a book before, but I just finished reading East of Eden for the second time. I read quickly, but this time I read slowly and savored every page. As a long-time resident of Monterey County, I am touched by the poetic descriptions of places locals take for granted. The Salinas River which runs underground in summer made a dry river bed into a lyrical image that I have never lost. The beauty of the conversations between Samuel Hamilton and Lee, the sadness of the anecdotal stories that claim only a page or two, and the history of the area combine with the larger story seamlessly. Steinbeck didn't just write -- he conjured full-blown images that stay with me long after I put the book down."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Standing in front of monsterous shelves at Border's, staring at my summer reading list with 600 pages of Steinbeck in my hands, I think: \\"My teacher is trying to kill me.\\" That was two years ago.If I could pin down any one reason or instance that transformed me from the proverbial couch potato to avid reader, this epic novel would be it.Steinbeck's East of Eden is absolutely spacktastuler (yes, so good, I just had to fabricate a word for it). The novel, set in the early 20th century, follows the story of the Trask family. A parallel to the biblical story of Cain and Abel, the conflicts between members of the family in two generations serve to explore the nature of good and evil and mankind's tendencies toward each. Steinbeck is able to envoke deep-seeded, universal questions while stunning the reader with a playful subtleness.Perhaps most defined is the developement of character. The reader cannot help but fall in love (or undying disgust)with each of Steinbeck's masterfully crafted personas.The book is long - 600 pages in four parts - but every bit the worth and more. The ending, not to be spoiled, even served to leave a beading tear in the eye of this hopeless \\"tough guy.\\"Truly a masterpiece of modern times."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is music. Steinbeck gets it, he gets it like no author that I have ever read has gotten it before: this book is the spirit and story and soul of man in roughly 700 pages. In the past few years I've read so much wonderful literature, and nothing has ever struck me so completely with reconciling wisdom over my troubles and my condition like this novel. I don't say that about any other book, and I doubt I ever will.Every honest and open-hearted individual must see himself in Caleb Trask---and Steinbeck is there, always, with the blunt genius of some great wily grandfather, to show us what this means and who it makes us. I will never forget the lessons of this beautiful novel. It can make you so free. When I think about it I still want to weep with a passion to do and make memory. It really is that inspiring.If there was ever anything about this book that I didn't adore from the beginning it was the fact that Adam, Cathy, Caleb, Lee and the rest had to be players: they play parts in a fiction for a message, and the potency of their flaws and characters could not reflect the harsh complexity of, say, Dostoevsy or Tolstoy's people (I suppose this came accross to me so starkly because I had just been reading these Russian authors). What ended up amazing me more and more about the book as I got further was how REAL Steinbeck could make has cast. I'm still not sure how he did it, but I literally feel like I know these men and women. Maybe thats why I want to say that Steinbeck &quot;gets it&quot;: the characters, enacting such a strict and siple fable for an's nature are just SO real. I've never met anyone who's read this novel and doesn't count its people among some of the most real and beautiful characters they've come across in literature. You'll never forget them. No kidding.The second half, by the way, is richer in all of this than the first. The first half is great, but the second half (now that, I suppose, the first half has made you good and ready) is pure gold."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East Of Eden is my favorite book of all time. It is not nearly the best, the most respectable, the most polished or most intellectually compelling, but it is my singular favorite. It reminds me a bit of Chaucer's Cantebury Tales, often enough relying on the bawdy, even the implausible-- or occasionally knowingly dubious science-- to further plot entanglements, but ever weaving hooks of melodramatic delight. Steinbeck writes inside a woman's brain as can very few men. He artfully meanders through different lives and generations, often willfully steeped in bits of caricature as with Adam,Samuel and his wise Chinese friend, frequently surrounds us in contrived circumstances, all by design. How else can we be introduced to Catherine/Kate: the single most deliciously evil bad seed who ultimately emerges as the single most deliciously willful, outrageous,independent and morally indifferent woman of her century, a woman who, in recollections well prior to the film's focus, gives birth to unlikely twins in the most amazing of circumstances.One of those third generational boys is portrayed- in his single most brilliant performance riviting from its opening moments(among only three films in which he ever appeared)- by James Dean as Cal Trask. That film version commences fully two thirds through the book. We watch a young man following an older woman who pretends to be unaware of his presence. That particular slice of drama slowly builds to shocking enlightenments. For me, the other book (of roughly that time) to film leap a single character's brilliant portrayal so effectively is Rostand to Ferrer's Cyrano, but I digress.At first I had difficulty with the author's opening in East of Eden, which takes us through nearly a score of scene setting Salinas Valley pages before Steinbeck begins his masterly hypnotic storytelling. When I posed this personal dilemna to a classrom of students, they were fairly evenly divided on that author's decision. The half who loved it were almost all studying art as their elective, whereas the other half had chosen another course. Later in life, when I came to draw as a hobby, I too appreciated Steinbeck's initial soft scenic opening before many following tempests.From too perfect paternal men both Asian and American of one generation through too flawed authority in another, there finally arrives in a third at least one character who has a chance at something both plausible and good. We herein also encountered women too hot, too cold and like, in the fable, one just right, once again all by design.My beloved shrink sister-in-law (at the time) gave me two great pieces of advice: get a shrink (which I did) and read East of Eden (which I did). My favorite memories of teaching involve that book multiple times in the context of an NYC gifted program.Finally, I am so jealous of most who are reading this indulgent review. The presumption is they have not yet, for the first time, realized the joy of savoring this unique treasure, perhaps both in the literary and film version. Steinbeck is, for me, along with Hawthorne, the greatest American writer and storyteller. I would love a selective bout of artful amnesia to experience such memorable firsts once again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"for me this book was life changing. excellently written, captivating, in depth character development.

Find out what kind of destiny is in store for Cyrus's offspring; Cal and Aron, Adam's sons, in this well written novel based in California.The Trask brothers will have a life like none other for they will prove different, and throughout this story we will be entertained by the people who surrounded this family; those who tried to make them appear as normal and tried too hard to accept them. We will also, meet those who knew too much about them and carried their secrets to their graves.However at the source of this book is Cathy Ames who will be responsible for their good or bad future in an indirect way.A page-turner that will keep you up all night. If you haven't read any other of John Steinbeck's books, please get your hands on The Grapes Of Wrath after this one.

Somewhere in my literary past I read EAST OF EDEN and my memory of the book is positive.However, over the last week or so of driving and doing mindless tasks around my house, I listened to Richard Poe's reading of EAST OF EDEN. The resonant tones of Poe's voice mixed with the masterful story telling of John Steinbeck make for a magical experience.For those who do not appreciate the classics and do not understand the power of Steinbeck, I urge you to listen to Poe's version. He makes the characters come alife. You can feel the evil of Kate and the wisdom of Lee. You can feel the pain of Cal and Aron and struggle that they lived.EAST OF EDEN is a wonderful and power story that recreates the story of Cain and Abel. There are a thousand term papers and phd dissertation in this work. Classes and discussion groups could go on forever.The version I had was 22 CD's and it seemed like a lot when I got started.

The simplicity of Steinbeck's writing allows readers to fully comprehend his descriptions and ideas on life's realities. John Steinbeck's use of the Biblical story of Cain and Abel illustrates the imperfection that lies within the realities of life and how that imperfection ultimately gives Man the opportunity to dicate choose the style of life for oneself. As many people might think East of Eden is a boring novel with no excitment, on the contrary, East of Eden is a page turning novel that takes the reader on to the edge with unexpcted twists and turns during the novel's most exciting moments. East of Eden examines how life is never how it is planned. Life will never follow the perfection that is envisioned, but it is through the imperfections in life that Steinbeck reveals that makes it so close to reality, a reality where everyone has flaws and no one is capable of abandoning those flaws."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is the most interesting book I have ever read. Slow paced and somewhat unorganized, yet the book presents powerful and unique characters, making the book even more intriguing. Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb recreate the old Biblical story of Cain and Abel. Battling between the choice of good or evil, the characters allow themselves to shape their lives. Therefore, Timshel or &iexcl;thou mayest&iexcl;, the power of choice, is the most important underlying theme in this book. The choice helps characters to reflect oneself and to mature by recognizing their own mistakes. Read this book! I strongly recommend it. And learn how to make right choices, which could change your life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden takes the Biblical story of Cain and Abel and brings it to life with the characters. Analysis of the story reveals the belief in the power of man and choice. Complicated relationships and personal struggles in the characters portay life as it is. East of Eden is a book which discusses human nature.It looks into the hearts and minds of people, revealing both the good and bad that battles within a person.It stresses individuality and the hardships of life as well as the joy that can be found in living.He portrays numerous characters, each unique, developing them and describing the struggles and personality, revealing both strengths and weaknesses,just like any other person. Stuggles such as rejection, longing for love, ignorance, blindness from love, search of identity, shame and guilt, anger, and many more are expanded on and looked into.It brings understanding to the reader of differnt issues and patters in people. The story is well developed and written, containing much thought and insight.It starts with differnt stories but craftily intertwines as the story progessed, developing into a complicated web of relationships and lives. Many connections are made throughout the book, making the book a complete whole with constant substance, bringing it to life.This book contains a lot of useful information and insight that can even be applied to the reader's own life. It may allow greater understanding and personal growth. This book is definitely worth reading. It is by far my favorite book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Throughout East of Eden, John Steinbeck creates characters that are intriguing but pushes their personalities to the extreme ends of the spectrum of good and evil, making them difficult to relate to. Despite this, the characters' interactions and the history that they weave makes a compelling read. The parallel to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel is clear and at times, the familiar struggles of the \\"Cains\\" of the book provoke an empathy that the more angelic characters fail to stimulate. Even the evilest of characters such as Cathy, can be identified with more then the more moral characters, such as Adam, and, without a doubt, make for a more interesting read. Still, despite issues with characterization, the book pulls you into its world of interweaving stories and one quickly gets lost in trying to sort out the intricacies of relationships and human traits. Despite puzzling family history stories that will have you wondering about their exact significance to the rest of the book, the parallel themes of guilt and forgiveness tie the book together from beginning to end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden creates a dramatic story that keeps the readers on the edge of their seats waiting for what might happen next. It talks of human nature in both extremes, good and evil. These extremes are incorporated in his theme of good versus evil. People aren't born as good or evil. Rather, everyone has a choice to become better people or not. This key theme of \\"choice\\" or \\"timshel\\" is carried throughout the book by Lee, the Chinese servant, and Cal, the manipulative child who matures through mistakes.The book is so vivid because John Steinbeck grew up in Salinas Valley. This personal experience adds to the realistic settings he creates. It makes the extremes of human nature more real. The theme of good and evil explains our personal conflicting emotions. In the end, like the characters, we learn that our choices determine our destiny. East of Eden is a great book to learn about human nature and destiny with his realistic imagery."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck thoroughly demonstrates human nature within each character of this novel. Themes such as good vs. evil, hate, jealousy, love, and family relationships are present throughout. Steinbeck successfully retells the Biblical story of Adam and Eve in a modern version set in Salinas California. He also manipulates the story of Cain and Abel through two generations of brotherhood. Although there are allusions to the Bible, the foreshadowing of events is not as predictable as one may think. One suggestion that may increase the understanding of this novel is to read the story of Adam and Eve, and the story of Cain and Abel found in the first book of the Bible: Genesis. All in all, Steinbeck does a spectacular job in accurately referring to the Bible, and using his creativeness to capitvate the reader."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's East of Eden has been one of the most influential readings of my life. Within merely 600 pages, Steinbeck enlightens his readers with the most controversial and enthralling issue of life: its purpose. If you have ever doubted your existence or questioned who or what you are living for, this book will definitely pour you with insight. Contrastingly, if you have never encountered these doubts, this novel will force you to reevaluate your cordial acceptance. Steinbeck oversteps the boundries of traditionality and conservatism and audaciously expresses his unfiltered, most purest thoughts. There is never a dull or meaningless moment in this book. Although the plot of events may appear somewhat unorganized and haphazard, each incident has its unignorable significance within the novel and a single misplace or change of word would desecrate its message. Not only that, Steinbeck is amazing in his character analyzations. Through his detailed and meticulous descriptions, the readers are able to protrude into the character's deepest thoughts and scrutinize it from every single aspect. There is not one character that stands out as the main protaganist; each individual has his own complex personality and mindset and Steinbeck magnificently portrays this complication, inflating his characters into realistic, 3-D human flesh. He also addresses common themes, or rather experiences, that the common reader can relate to. The most developed theme within the book is that of the struggle between good and evil, but he also discusses issues such as a parent's favoritism of one child over another and the disastrous effects that are imposed upon the unpreferred child. We also see frequent themes such as love and rejection, which make the story a very personal experience. All in all, this is a mind-blowing masterpiece, as well as a heart-warming tale, that will leave you breathless and asking for more."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is not just a retelling of the biblical story of Cain and Abel. The story of two generations of brothers and their relationships is ultimately (at least in my interpretation) about human weakness as well as the strength that derives from the power of choice. Of course, there are many other themes that are prevalent throughout the entire novel, such as ancestry, love, jealousy, identity, redemption, and good versus evil.Although the story traces the Trask family from Cyrus's sons, Adam and Charles, to Adam's twins, Cal and Aron, the message of novel culminates in Cal. The offspring of an inauspicious union, it is in Cal that the forces of good and evil battle. However, he does not only represent the fight between good and evil; he also demonstrates the choice that humans have, the choice that makes us human, timshel - \\"thou mayest,\\" and proves that every man's destiny is not a result of what he is born as, but rather what he chooses to be."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I was never an avid reader of the Bible but this classic rendition of the old book's makes me want to sit down and read over the original stories again and again. Steinbeck achieves greatness through his tale of two families whose fates are intertwined and destinies preordained by the Bible itself.Although the chapter organization seemed jumbled as if the chapters were somehow mixed in a strange order,however, the sheer insight emanating from Lee and Samuel Hamilton always made me hungry for more.The lack of character development in Cathy (or Kate) is somewhat frustrating as it lead me to question why she kept reverting back to her previous ways when she's better off leaving them behind but she proves to be critical to the forced development of the weakened Adam Trask and also aids critically in the joining of the Hamiltons and the Trasks.I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's guaranteed that East of Eden will move you and maybe even change your outlook on life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's East of Eden is a book that truly captures humanity in its desires in love and impulses in hatred. Everyone has the choice to choose good over evil. Cal portrays such a life of struggles between being good and being bad, and ultimately, it will be his own choice to give up or triumph. Timshel.Steinbeck also depicts the importance of family. Love is essential, or else it becomes dysfunctional and treacherous. As Adam should have learned, brother will turn on brother for the love of his father. Sibling rivalry adds to the reenactment of Cain and Able.East of Eden really sends a message that hits home at the heart. The character personalities are so real and relatable. It ranges at extreme opposites: from pure ignorance in Aron to profound understanding in Lee, from evil contempt in Cathy to loving care in Samuel. It makes us explore our own standings. East of Eden exhibits great awareness of all humankind and is such a truly captivating and inspiring book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. A great story concerning the interconnected families of the Hamiltons and the Trasks, over several generations, as they become prominent in the Salinas Valley. As Steinbeck says, this book is about the central issue of good versus evil, and whether we have the ability to choose how to live our lives. It's also about sons and fathers, what blind love can do to you, and how you need to see the world for what it really is. Each character is truely unique and engaging. I could not put this book down, and loved every moment of it. Steinbeck is an amazing author."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I hated Of Mice and Men, The Pearl, and The Red Pony. John Steinbeck didn't seem to grasp that superfluous pessimism is annoying, especially three books of the stuff. The setting in this book, a lethargic farm, was very similar to those I had hated and for about 100 pages I also hated this book. It came as a surprise when I realized I loved it.Despite what many think, the characters are only at first glance one-dimensional. As the story progresses that you realize that things are not as they seem. The supposedly good Aron is ungrateful, the supposedly bad Caleb is repentant. As a matter of fact, I found myself openly rooting for Caleb and hoping he'd make the most out of the story's theme. The book also contains one of the most interesting, and perhaps most evil, female characters in all of literature: Cathy. The first-hand account of her miscreant doings and psychopathic thoughts was quite simply incredible.And I must say that the ending of this book was fantastic. It was both uplifting and powerfully written. I couldn't put the book down, which has happened to me only about ten times. I definitely recommend this book as it is now one of my favorites. It stresses the importance of choice and that, despite the expected outcome, a person is always in possession of it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck has this incredible way of making you feel like you're a part of the families you're reading about; like you're living their lives right along with them, and East of Eden is a particularly great example of that. After 600 pages, I was sad to come to the end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read \\"East of Eden\\" and three other books by Steinbeck when I was in my twenties. I have to admit that, back then, I wasn't taken with the man and his storytelling. I am now about the age that Steinbeck was when he wrote \\"East of Eden.\\" Today I have enough life experiences under my belt to truly appreciate and hear what the man had to say. Today I have fallen in love with Steinbeck.\\"East of Eden\\" has been reviewed to death over the years, so I will limit my comments to a few special notations that I made. As I read \\"East of Eden\\" it struck me that Steinbeck's background as a journalist and his curiosity about human behavior in general molded him into an excellent armchair psychologist. Indeed in East of Eden, Samuel Hamilton recommends William Jame's voluminous \\"The Principles of Psychology\\" to his son Joe. I also wondered if Steinbeck the journalist \\"borrowed\\" from the Lizzie Borden patricide case as he wrote of the methodical premeditation of Cathy's first murders. Aside from the sociopathic Cathy, Steinbeck's characters impressed me as truly beloved by their author. In fact, Steinbeck seems to me a deep lover of humankind with all of its flaws and struggles. Unlike many authors who seem detached or put off by their own characters, Steinbeck reveals himself as forgiving and understanding of his characters' foibles and craziness. I love him for that.Steinbeck summed up this great story best when Lee tells Samuel: \\"And I here make a rule - a great and lasting story is about everyone or it will not last. The strange and foreign is not interesting - only the deeply personal and familiar.\\" Perhaps that is why I needed to compile that large portfolio of life experiences in order to belatedly fall in love with Steinbeck. And that is no doubt why \\"East of Eden\\" will endure as a great and lasting story."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I bought this book as a gift.

Somehow or another Steinbeck is able to write a multi-dimensional story with phenomenal characters and keep the entire novel cohesive from start to finish.I had a difficult to wanting to do anything but read this novel once I started reading it. The writing is fantastic and entertaining... The characters are fabulous and there was always so much going on in this novel that you eagerly want to find out what is going to happen next!This is a must read novel. Steinbeck is such a wonderful writer that I can see why he won the Nobel Prize for Literature!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck's classic is a story about every family. It's a story about the first family. In a totally unoffensive nonreligious style his Cain and Able takeoff examines the cyclic nature of humanity. We frequently find ourselves eerily following in the footsteps of our parents. Or find ourselves with the ones most similar to those who have hurt us before. Ultimately, \\"East of Eden\\" gives an example of how to break the mold. Whatever holds us back, whatever our mistakes, Steinbeck shows how it is possible to break the cycle, how we can learn from the past, how the greatest endowment of humanity is choice."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Hard to imagine a greater defining work of the 20th century ... the story is so complex and multilayered, and yet so simple and clear in its narrative. The reader finds a lot to ponder in its pages, and many times I had to put the book down for a moment and merely think about its truth. Like the following:\\"And I feel that I am a man. And I feel that a man is a very important thing -- maybe more important than a star. This is not theology. I have no bent toward the gods. I have a new love for that glittering instrument, the human soul. It is a lovely and unique thing in the universe.\\"The story of Adam Trask, his sons and his good friends -- Samuel Hamilton, the handy-man philosopher; and Lee, the house servant and wise man -- is a parable of how we all struggle between the forces of good and evil, placed in a rough and beautiful American milieu, the Salinas Valley, Steinbeck's Garden of Eden. Adam is caught between hope, conveyed by a strong desire to prosper and transcend, and the deep wound of a dark secret, conveyed by his failed marriage to Kathy, a serpentine soul who dwells in darkness and evil. In this crucible his sons, Caleb and Aron, act out the tragic drama of earthly competition, fratricide and redemption that is the inheritance of the children of Abel and Cain.In this Eden we encounter ourselves in our reckless, restless existence. Over a conversation with Lee, Caleb hears about the wild adventurous nature of Americans, violent and generous, fearful and bold, who \\"go from barbarism to decadence without an intervening culture.\\"And in another, between Lee, Samuel and Adam, the reader faces the core challenge of living: While we are not commanded to be good, neither are we predestined for it. \\"Timshel,\\" Lee quotes from the Fourth Chapter of Genesis, the story of Eden itself. \\"Thou Mayest.\\"Poised between right and wrong, good and evil, life and death, this masterpiece asks, which do we choose?"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I bought this book, Steinbeck could not have been further off my radar. I suppose I expected a solid, picaresque novel that was good in a musty \\"literature\\" sort of way. I could not have been more wrong. I don't think that I have ever been punched in the gut more times by a work of art. The mixture of mythology and gritty realism never felt forced, in fact it made the story even more fluid and vicious. It is a wonderfully sad, dark, violent and oddly hopeful chronical of human frailty, loyalty and weakness. It is one of the supreme achievements of the art (all forms, not just literary) of the 20th century. After I read this, I bought everything by Steinbeck that I could get my hands on and buried myself in eleven more of his works before coming up for air."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's novel is truly a masterpiece as he weaves the stories of two unique American families and exposes the character's deepest, darkest thoughts, particularly those of Cathy and Cal. Each character is carefully constructed and the personalities are told in great detail. The story begins when Steinbeck describes the serene land in the Salinas Valley. I felt mesmerized by the beauty of his language, for he describes things extensively- from appearance to scent. I could imagine the wild flowers in spring and the tiny Victorian houses right before me. From the complexity of the characters to the meticulousness of the setting, this novel is simply beautiful.Even the structure is unique and it is evident that Steinbeck took a lot of time to perfect the order in which his story would be told. In Part 1 of the novel, Steinbeck alternates between the Trask family and the Hamilton family each chapter. The families are on different parts of the country and have no relationship whatsoever. It is not until part 2, where the two families merge in Salinas, California. I found this method very clever because I was able to differentiate the families in their respective environments. It was interesting to read the characters' pasts because it would certainly affect their futures. For example, the fact that Adam Trask's father lied to him as a child accounts for Adam's determination to be a good father for his own children; Cathy's poor childhood and the lack of parental love account for her horrible actions towards her children. As the story progresses, I learned that Adam's tough character is a result of serving in the army. Away from his family, Adam had to be independent and strong- both physically and emotionally.In an attempt to start a new life, Adam bought a piece of farmland from Samuel Hamilton. However, the story immediately turns dark and somber as Cathy, Adam's new wife, abandons her twin boys. Cathy is a dark character and she is the epitome of evil. She is a selfish woman who blames her wrongdoings on other people. Every word Cathy said made me despise her, for this woman neglected her children to run a brothel. Cathy's dialogue in conversations with other characters made me develop only disgust for her. Steinbeck was careful in his writing because after depicting the evil Cathy, he would switch to men of wisdom: Lee and Samuel Hamilton. These characters offered relief from the tense drama occurring by offering peace. Lee and Samuel, firm believers in God, spoke straight from the Bible to convey a sense of goodness. Unlike Cathy, these characters care for the twin boys and are proof that there is still good in the world. Cathy's ruthless nature is passed on to her son Cal, as he struggles to form his own identity. Cal feels trapped between good and evil, until the wise character Lee offers him profound advice. He learns that he is his own person and is not doomed to be evil like his mother. Cal is a human being (whereas his mother is a \\"monster\\") and thus is subject to make mistakes. I developed so many emotions from reading this, such as joy, relief, sadness, pity, and utter disgust. Even though I found some parts to be predictable, I felt that the entire novel was filled with suspense. There was not a single moment that I wanted to stop reading. This novel is so intriguing because it explores the dark side of the human mind, including such concepts such as revenge, sin, and evil."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It is the rare book that hums like a sweet concert of history, drama and soaring wisdom. \\"East of Eden\\" does that and more. Its tale unfolds in measures that tease with insinuation and deeply satisfy with masterful, gorgeous prose that is both precise and soul-warming. And it is utterly, inescapably readable. There is not one passage that wavers from hard, piercing storytelling into whimsy or tangent. The novel's dialogue is sparse, and largely unremarkable, with one exception. If you've read it, you know who I'm talking about. If you haven't, you'll want to find out."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is the first Steinbeck novel I have ever read, and I have to say that I'm hooked. The prose is unbelievable, the detail stunning and the characters have a gritty realness to them that I've never experienced before. You loath them one minute and love them the next. Only Shaara's The Killer Angels has ever taken me on this kind of ride before. Great book!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read EAST OF EDEN when I was in High School, and I thought it was one of the greatest books I had ever read. I've just finished it (for the 3rd time) all these years later, and it still remains one of my favorite books.Steinbeck's talk of the Hamiltons and the Trasks is lyrical and magical. This is simply one of those books that everyone should read at least once in their lives."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I first started reading EAST OF EDEN I was surprised by the fact that it did not rush into the saga of Caleb and aron Trask. I was also somewhat shocked by the vulgarity. But as I read on i saw that John Steinbeck wasn't being vulgar, he was giving a provocative look at what human nature really is, down to the ugly roots of imperfection.This book starts out with the story of good-hearted Adam and his wild brotehr Charles. Their father is harsh and they both come off with emotional issues. When Cathy Ames shows up at their house, beaten and in need of care, Adam rushes to her rescue. She is sweet and angelic and he falls in love, and they are married. Little does he know evil lies beneath her pretty face. She has a past of murder and is completely heartless. She is unfaithful to him on the very night of their wedding, and in just gets worse from there. After the birth of their twins she shoots Adam, leaving him desolate and in a state of shock. Eventually he comes out of it with the aid of his wise freinds Lee and Samuel. Adam recovers somehwat from his shock and starts raising his boys.This is where Aron and Caleb come in. Aron is beautiful and loved by all. Caleb is covered in a cloud of darkness and he is loved by very few. All he wants is acceptance from his father, and all Adam wants is him to be like his brother.With a splendid cast of unique characters, this book is amazing. It goes very deep and while it does ramble at times, the story is one of both good and evil, loved and unloved, love and hate."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book for the first time many years ago because I am a John Steinbeck fan. I thought that Grapes of Wrath was wonderful, but this book is even more mesmorizing. You can picture the characters and actually feel the good and evil and confusion in each of them. I read both Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden at least five times. Both are lengthy, but both tell a story that will keep you up all night reading. If anyone has seen the old movie, it no way compares to the book. What did compare to the book was a television mini-series way back in the 80's which starred Jane Seymour as Kathy. It was wonderful and so portrayed this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Here is the intertwined story of two families-the Hamiltons and the Trasks-that Steinbeck masterfully explored questions of good and evil, inherited depravity, perfectionism, and free will. This book is drawn out of the well of the Old Testament story of Cain and Abel. A great read-I only regret it is finished. The almost-fatalistic approach can be depressing at times if you imagine humans as better than they really are, but there are enough glimpses of hope? and goodness to keep you with him. My favorite author is Michner-mostly because he writes of places and generations. This book is similar, but besides doing the place-generations thing, the author tosses in a paragraph or phrase (about one per ten pages, for me) that are so stunning in their crafting and depth of thought that I would sometimes would lay the book down at that point and go meditate on the porch for an hour on that single phrase. I now have a whole new group of people who are a part of the pantheon of good and evil? in my mind (some busts appear in both pantheons): Cyrus Trask(I know someone like him), his favorite son Adam (A Isaac-type guy) his unfavored brother Charles. I know even better the next generation: Adam's sons Cal(unfavored, a lot like the God-be-merciful-to-me pray-er) and good Aron. Sam Hamilton is a stand-out example of good and in a curious way his straight-laced wife which reminds me of many stern holiness folk of the past generations. The real central character of evil is certainly Cathy (later Kate). Whew-are there really women this evil? Abra Bacon remind me of a girl I knew in grade school, and perhaps Steinbeck is successful in making the central character a Hebrew word-timshel. Buy the book and love it as I did. -Keith Drury, Associate Professor of Religion, Indiana Wesleyan University."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I love this book - but I feel a certain shame about the Oprah book club logo. This book stands as a masterpiece without any endorsements from a pop icon (fad if you will). For someone like Oprah to vainly attatch her name to piece of art is kind of like blasphemy (though oddly enough I don't consider myself religous). Does anyone else out there think it is distasteful to attatch your name to a classic and sell it around the world -as if the book wasn't capable of communicating on its own? Steinbeck is a great author - and he is not to be insulted by this horrid oprah book club logo - restore his works properly like any respectable artist!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Personally, I consider it to be the best work of Steinbeck. It is well-written, moves along well (with the exception of a few passages) and builds up characters (for the most part). It's not a perfect read, not a horrible one - but a good book. I can't say that about a vast majority of books.The themes behind the book are far reaching and as old as any story's. Good verus evil, free will, and what truth is or can be. The use of Cain, Abel, and Timshell are laced in the idea of sin. There are characters and ideas that are quite good in nature and being, and those that are nearly pure evil. The outcome is a bit predictable and smacks of popular religion. The contrasts may be overdone and the characters a little too foreseeable, but it makes for a good read - and isn't that the point afterall..."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck has always had a very odd style of writing; he tells the reader the theme of the next section before the section. This style of writing can often be aggravating, especially because I personally would like to discover the theme alongside the characters, not before they do. In addition, Steinbeck goes through the whole family lineage of the Trask's etc. before starting the actual narration. I can see why Steinbeck would want to set the scene of the book by going through the family lineages, but the extent that Steinbeck did this was slightly to much. But after getting through the family lineage, the reader is totally immersed into the story of Adam Trask, and his struggles while living in Salinas Valley, especially of his wife, Catherine. Though there are many flaws in the book, Catharine is one of the best characters in literature of all time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I found this a difficult read, but ultimately rewarding, and it wouldn't be fair to give such a well-written book anything less than 4 stars just because it wasn't written in my preferred style. \\"East of Eden\\" is a sort of repeat of the Biblical Abel and Cain story in modern times, in modern terms. A masterpiece of American literature. I'm usually not a big Steinbeck fan, I prefer Hemingway and F. Scott Fitsgerald. But even I felt the power of this book and I couldn't stop reading. You'll never forget the Trusks.David Rehak(...)"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a philosophical investigation into the human mental condition, emphasizing greatly the struggle between good and evil. It explores the complexities of such varied themes as depression, lonesomeness, hate (from Cain and Abel), and of course, love. But one should read this novel with a proverbial \\"grain of salt\\". Steinbeck will sometimes replace character development with his own analysis, much as a historian would look upon past events. For example, he begins a paragraph with \\"When I said Cathy was a monster...\\" To the reader, this may be an emotional anticlimax to the plot; it gives the tales a feeling of redundancy. Why not let the stories speak for themselves? It may be that Steinbeck is teaching us something with this novel, something important, something life changing - Timshel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"We make many choices in our everyday lives. We decide what clothes to wear, what food to eat, and what we want to do with our lives, but how many of us decide whether we want to take the evil path or the \\"good\\" path? Steinbeck addresses this important choice in East of Eden.Overall I feel that this is an excellent book because of its well rounded characters and its enduring theme of good vs. evil. Each character has his/her own story and Steinbeck intertwines these stories in clever fashion as the relationships between Adam and Charles as well as Caleb and Aaron resemble the relationship between Cain and Able in the Bible. East of Eden is definitely worth your time if you are looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Have you ever read a book that you can't keep down? East of Eden is that book. East of Eden is an amazing story by John Steinbeck. He incorporates biblical themes from Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel. His characters portray good and evil and the importance of control. The plot twists keep you turning pages. It is exciting to see the development of Cathy, Adam, Cal, Aron, and Lee. However, the orginization was less than satisfactory. Steinbeck would reach a climax then switch to another topic. Other than that, East of Eden is another phenomenal piece written by Steinbeck."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The first part of the book is a lot of background on the characters. It really helps to understand the rest of the book later on, but I feel as if I got jumped randomly without a clue from one character to a totally different character. The random jumping is the only beef I have about this book thus the subtraction of one star.The other four stars are for the plot and the development of the characters. East of Eden is more than a mere pleasure reading book. You can read it expecting to hear only a good story and finish feeling like you closed the door to the world. Themes aren't as dreary as they sound like: there's more than the theme of \\"good vs. evil\\" (actually i find that an almost nonexistent/unimportant theme). Steinbeck plays at the choice to be either \\"good or evil\\" and the difference or value of truth or ignorance. As a student, I think it's great to be reading a book where the theme isn't dry and overdone into another tedious assignment."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is probably one of Steinbeck's most compelling, realistic and multilayered novels he has ever written. Set in the picturesque Salinas Valley,East of Eden is about the story of two different families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. Themes of fraternal love are frequently emphasized and commonly allude to the biblical tale of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck eloquently intertwines the families' life experiences while creating a dynamic group of characters that shares a common thread of good and evil sentiments. Steinbeck explores new levels of heartache, jealousy and sexuality in his writing, and also sticks in brief interludes of strong political opinions against the U.S. government and World War I. His style of writing was surely inventive during his lifetime, and definitely still stands out from other novelists of the 20th century."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is an excellent book but i would not recommend it to the faint of heart. It deals with many issues of human nature such as the struggle with sexuality, good versus evil, and stories from the Bible. I found it fascinating how well it coincided with how humans work. To those of you afraid that it might be a dark, depressing book: it really isn't that bad! Steinbeck's descriptions of the Salinas Valley are lovely and the characters in the novel experience happiness. But that is all intertwined with many other events and happenings . . .I won't tell what. I hope that those of you who purchase East of Eden enjoy it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This novel by Steinbeck easily won me over the first time reading it. The wording of this book is simple yet interestingly complex. Throughout the novel, you are introduced to 2 main generations between two interacting families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks. Most of this novel though is focused on the brotherly rivalry the Trask brothers, of both generations, experience. A wedge that drives the brothers apart is the continual struggle for the love of their Father.The brotherly rivalry described through the description of both generations parallels greatly with the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Also a very interesting biblical term, timshel, thou mayest, is mentioned several times during this book advocating the CHOICE for oneself. This book is extremely enjoyable to read!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"While I did find this novel enticing, enjoyable, and a fulfilling read, I did at times find East of Eden by John Steinbeck somewhat unorganized and hard to understand. For a majority of this novel, I couldn't put it down. Themes of good vs. evil as well as love become apparent to the reader. Characters are well developed and liked by the audience. Unfortunately, it was difficult to keep track of what or who you were reading about. Steinbeck would go for a chapter on one character in one setting and then completely jump to another family or character in another city. It was in the hope of the reader that these two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks, would one day cross paths. In many ways I found this novel much like a soap opera you would find on television. There is Cathy, a whore of a mother to the sons of Adams children, Caleb and Aron. However, it is unknown to the audience if they children are even Adams, possibly being his brother Charles who Cathy slept with at one point in the novel. I found myself getting so in depth into one part of the novel and just when it got good or revealed a fact about a character, Steinbeck would go and change everything all around. If you are looking for a quick read, this isn't your novel. If you are ready to maybe read sections over a few times to understand what is going on then this is your novel. Steinbeck is an amazing author however maybe this isn't his best work."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck incorporates a number of biblical themes in his novel, East Of Eden. I strongly recommend readers to have an affirmative grasp on the Bible before reading the novel. It was not until my friend mentioned some major themes of the Bible that I fully understand the Steinbeck's intentions. The themes that prevail in this novel are family values, free will, and the ultimate choice of good vs. evil. Note: the reader can understand the novel without a strong biblical background, but one will gain so much more if one is able to incorporate the novel's themes with that of the bible. Biblical themes set aside; the plot of the novel is entirely captivating. The binds of brotherhood and family are constantly tested and the reader is able to witness firsthand how important personal values contribute to one's success in life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I loved this book. My favorite Steinbeck book (have read Of Mice and Men, Cannery Row, The Grapes of Wrath and The Moon is Down). I read The Grapes of Wrath just prior and I found Eden to be the better of the two. It was a book that I had trouble putting down. The characters were great."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"After being required to read this &quot;novel&quot; in a literature class, I sighed feeling the weight of this 600 page book burdening down my summer. Once into the book, however, I wasn't able to put it down. This timeless classic shows the American Dream of moving west to find a better life. The parallel between the generations of Trasks and also the &quot;greatest story ever told&quot; of Cain and Abel. This story deals with a child's greatest fear of not being loved and the means if forgiveness. Not just your average novel, East of Eden is a story of life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is one of those books that you long to get back to when you're at work or grocery shopping or wherever! The characters are well-developed and stay with you long after you finish it. I was saddened that the book just didn't go on and on. One of my favorites!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My father introduced me to Steinbeck when I was in the 7th grade. I started with \\"Tortilla Flat\\" and was immediately addicted. I then began reading everything I could get my hands on...with the exception of \\"Grapes of Wrath\\". In 8th grade we were given a list of \\"American History\\" books to choose from to do a book report on. I searched desperately for a Steinbeck book and nothing was listed! I finally went to the teacher and insisted that I was mature enough to handle \\"East of Eden\\". She reluctantly agreed to let me read the book for my report and I have been forever grateful! I grabbed the book from the library that day and was finished with it in two days. I remember feeling such a connection with the characters. I felt that they became friends. I jumped into writing the book report with a lot of enthusiasm and received an \\"A\\"! To this day, fifteen years later, I consider \\"East of Eden\\" one of my all time favorite books. I have reread it on numerous occasions and always walk away with a feeling of astonishment and a certain sense of envy that I couldn't develop the writing techniques of a genius author like Steinbeck. After all these years and all these rereads of Steinbeck's other works, I am finally working my way slowly, but surely, through \\"Grapes of Wrath\\". My only regret is that I put it off so long. After all, the top ten spots have been filled. Apparently, I'm going to have to extend it to the top twenty!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is definitely Steinbeck's greatest masterpiece.

It is one of the greatest novels of this century and deserves every bit of praise that it gets. I really could interact with the characters.

This book is one of Steinbeck's greatest achievements."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A book that teach es us how to live. Discusses religion without bein religious. Shows us characters and their spirit without being pathetic. Trully one of the best ever.

Hope, abandonment,impassioned love, pure evil, friendship, loss...and above all the search for reason are unusually well embodied in this special book. I kept thinking that the old adage,&quot;they just don't write 'em the way they used to&quot; is absolutely on display here. And I'm not sure even with all the writing talent that is out there that it would be possible to write this kind of book today - the moralizing and questioning is vintage mid 20th century.

Once you pick up this you will not be able to put it down. I cannot put into words my feelings as I read the book, totally engrossed. Regardless of what I say, I cannot do EAST OF EDEN justice. In short WOW! I will now continue my quest to read everything Steinbeck has ever written. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is perhaps my favorite Steinbeck book. I recently moved to the Monterey/Salinas area and started reading Steinbeck. I also recommend Tortilla Flat and Cannery Row if you are interested in the area and like reading good books. If I'm not mistaken, I thought John Steinbeck disliked Salinas. After reading East of Eden, Salinas disliked him to the point of refusing to keep his books in the local libraries or schools. Now Salinas is on the verge of opening &quot;The Steinbeck Center&quot;, a multi-million dollar facility about his life and times. You can even eat lunch in the house he grew up in. I find it disturbingly ironic that even though Steinbeck and Salinas shared a strong mutual dislike while he was alive, now Salinas is the &quot;Steinbeck Capitol of the World.&quot; It's a shame what people will do for a quick buck. I'd have to say that Stienbeck's feelings toward Salinas are warranted, even more so today."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was so good that I couldn't sleep until I had finished it. Cathy Ames is a delicious character who also kept me up at night thinking about the things she had done. I think she is my favorite character feom any book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden has so much potential to be a book which has more of a satisfactory impact. This book, was at times poorly written, contradictory, confusing, and unfortunately boring. I say the book was poorly written at times because John Steinbeck spent so much time writing this book (several years I believe) and he could not manage to create many characters which interested me. Also, he included too many characters which were not important to the novel and even makes it unclear who the narrator is in the novel. I think the book is somewhat hypocritical because the novel's emphasis on freewill as one of its themes is not expressed through all the characters. Cathy Ames for instance, is condemmned as a devil during the entire course of the novel. How can you claim that freewill exists, and then permanently condemn one of your characters to a satanic status? I think that makes the book boring because it causes the plot to be too predictable, and at some points dry and corny. I am not saying that this book was completely awful though. The three stars I gave were for, the decent character development of Charles, and the insightful amorphisms provided by Lee, the Chinese servant of Adam. Also, Steinbeck's development of Cathy also had its strong points, but overall, I was disappointed at the way many character's dealt with their dilemmas. At times I was left feeling jipped at the outcome, or craving for more than what was provided. Overall, the book has strong themes, and a sufficient plot, but is hindered by its poor organization and mild character development."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck plays a cute little trick in East of Eden, a re-tooling of the Cain and Able story; all the &quot;good&quot; character's names begin with an &quot;A&quot; and all the &quot;bad&quot; character's names begin with a &quot;C&quot;."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was very good.

It was a sad book in the end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"With much regret I am reporting that I did not like this book. I know I am an anomaly from all the other positive reviews this book has received. I came to read this book upon the prompting of my mother and sister who both enjoyed the book immensely.I stopped reading \\"East of Eden\\" the other day. I just couldn't take the brutal nature of some of the characters. I do not remember feeling so upset and disturbed when I read \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" \\"The Red Pony\\" or \\"the Pearl\\". That was a long time ago so my memory has been dimmed by the years maybe it was in those books as well.I wonder if the character Kathy/Kate was the summation of all the horrible women Steinbeck ever knew.

More of how the more things change the more they stay the same."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" is a good book, however it is a bit on the tedious side. After a time, the plight of Adam Trask seems pathetic, and you start to not care about his outcome. Samuel Hamliton is a strong force in the book, which is lost at his death. The most interesting characters were, in my opinion, Charles, the brother of Adam Trask, who we do not hear from in the later part of the book, and Cathy/Kate. Cathy's emotional detachment makes her dangerous and interesting, as she makes a life for herself.Ultimtely, I am pleased that I stuck with the book, but I would recommend Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men.\\" Both of these novels are not such a chore to read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck is considered a great writer and for years I heard this was his masterpiece. I finally picked it up one day because I loved the movie (the version with James Dean). I quickly found out that the movie only covered the last fourth of the book. Still, despite the length (601 pages), I decided to read it anyways. Man--this was a struggle! It's a slow-moving \\"epic\\" that follows the Trask family from the Civil War to WW1. There are tons of characters and situations but it's not an easy read. Steinbeck was a good writer--his descriptions of California and Salinas Valley are beautiful. However when it came to characterizations and motivations he was terrible. All the characters are either evil or good--very black and white. No shades of grey. They don't speak--they preach. I don't think anyone ever talked like this in real life. Every single event or twist is oversimplified and talked to death. More than once I got the unpleasant feeling that Steinbeck was talking down to his audience. Also whatever his message was (I'm assuming he had one) it's totally lost as the story just rambles on and on and ON! As for the ending--it's kind of silly and pointless. It doesn't even SEEM like an end. It seems Steinbeck just got tired of writing this and gave up. I got through this hoping there would be some point (or POV) but there wasn't. I'm surprised this was published in 1952. Some of the material (mostly dealing with sex) was pretty explicit. I heard this was not a big hit because it was considered too simplistic and anti-climatic. I agree! The movie simplified it even more (but the Hayes Code was still in effect so they had no choice) but it was more interesting. It some excellent actors (James Dean, Raymond Massey, Julie Harris) fleshing out their characters and even gave some motivation and feelings to Kate (Jo Van Fleet won as Oscar for her acting) who is just evil and nothing more in the book. It's never a good sign when a movie adaptation has more interesting characters than the book! So--it's too long, too obvious and just rambles on and on for no rhyme or reason. Skip this one."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Or you may not. However, should you decide not to you are comitting a serious error.Steinbeck proves himself to be a THE American novelist as he masterfully weaves history, the bible, and his own family into one story. Steinbeck considered this to be the book he was destined to write. Therefore, if you're a big fan of his other works you MUST read this. This is storytelling at its finest."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Although I have not finished the book,East of Eden, I believe I have read enough of it to critique it.The book is set in the early 20th century in the Salinas valley of California. The book is separted into three parts, two of which I have read. The two main characters are both men, one lives in California and one lives on the east coast. The two characters don't meat untill about 200 pages into the book. Each character has an interesting life, but the book seems to focus more on the character Adam, more than the other, Samuel. The character that lives in California, Samuel, has a family of 9 and is a very intelligent man. The character that lives on the east coast, Adam, grew up with an emotionally cold and detached military father. He and his older brother lived as bachlors untill Adam was about 40.The begining of the story moves very slow, it is only when a third character is introduced, Cathy, that the story becomes interesting. Adam finds her beaten on his door step, nurses her back to health and marries her, but Cathy is an almost inhuman woman and never wanted to marry Adam. She is cold, distant, and calculated. Her real personality is shown by how she reacts to her and Adam's two sons when she gives birth.John Steinbeck has given this story a plot similar to that of the biblical story of Cain and Abel. There is that type of sibling jealously not only between Adam and his brother, but also between Adam's two sons. Steinbeck rarley has all the charactes in this book coexist. For the most part, each chapter is about a speific character and their individual life, not how they exist with the other main characters in the book.Overall I would say that this book moves much too slow for most readers. Although the detail is great, there is very little action or excitement. Every time the book seems like it is picking up, it goes right back to its slow pace. Out of what I have read so far, there has mabey been one whole page of action, combined. If you enjoy a long book full of vivid detail, this book is for you, but if you prefer drama and excitement in your reading, you will most likley not enjoy this book. On a scale of one to five, I would give this book a 3."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Perhaps every great novelist has one truly great novel. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is outstanding, but \\"East of Eden\\" is Steinbeck's best novel and one (1) of the five (5) greatest novels ever written (in my opinion).Not only does Steinbeck make Genesis Chapter 4 the centerpiece of this novel, he literally wagers the success of this novel on one (1) Hebrew word found in Genesis Chapter 4: \\"Timshel\\" (\\"thou mayest\\"). Steinbeck wins the wager. Actually, he breaks the casinos-all of them-at Vegas by basing his novel around \\"Timshel.\\"This book is a stunning work of achievement.

I first read it at about age 12, and fell in love with his descriptions of the Salinas valley. I went to California in 1984 just to see how Salinas looked 30 years after the book, and it was just that beautiful with the miles and miles of cultivated fields. The characters are real, the plot is pure Steinbeck. You know what is going to happen, yet you continue to hope for human behavior to change.

It's been a long time since I've found characters that have stuck with me long after the book has been read. It's not an action-packed, page-turning adventure at all, and would probably make a horribly boring movie. It's more of a home-cooked, slow-simmer novel in a world of fast food stories. I believe that the more you put into this book, the more you will get out of it. Put the time and effort in, and you will most likely end this book a little different of a person than who you were beforehand."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Let me start by saying, I would NEVER have read a \\"classic\\" if Oprah did not suggest it.....but this book is WONDERFUL!! The characters are all so richly described and I read it in 1 week. It's a swift read, even though it's 600+ pages, because it's so riveting. While Samuel was my favorite character, Cathy was the girl we all love to hate. I couldn't believe her!If you're scared of buying this book due to it's \\"classic\\" status, take it from me: IT'S FANTASTIC!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden was in no way a dissapointment. True to Steinbecks' descriptive writing, it once again delved into the human pysche and the root of hatred and evil. It showed mankind's struggle in where else, but California. Kind of like a family history, but a decent storyline. If the beginning seems a tad boring, dont worry the end gets quite good. The book was greatly fascinating and it kept me hooked to the very end. The twisting, turning plot line tended to keep me guessing. Even when I thought I knew Steinbeck's next move, I was quickly fooled. Very, very depressing, so dont read if youre already down."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a great book. The author takes you through a few generations of a family but cleverly keeps the audience attention. This book has it all.

I enjoyed it.... it is very long so get ready for a long but interesting trip."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I found East of Eden to be a great book, though the biblical allusions were rather obvious. I found Cathy Ames a frightening yet interesting character and kept attempting to figure her out. She doesn't seem to have a heart, yet at the end of the book, she shows a side of her that I hadn't expected and didn't know what to make of. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Simply put, this book so clearly touches upon what it is to be human and the many trials and joys of our human existence that I dare say it has few rivals in the world of literature.

If you don't agree, you will still have had the pleasure of knowing intimately the wonderful characters of Steinbecks East of Eden as if they were your own extended family, a truely great gift from such a talented author."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is primarily set in the Salinas Valley, California in the time period between 1900 and 1918. Primarily, but not exclusively: some chapters are set in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and the story also goes back to the period of the American Civil War.Two families and their intertwined stories feature in the novel: the Hamilton family, and the Trasks. The Hamiltons anchor the story: Samuel and Liza Hamilton (John Steinbeck's maternal grandparents) and their children convey a sense of life and continuity in the Salinas Valley. The Trask story is of two generations of brothers: with each brother trying to win the love of his father. The how and the why of this struggle is beautifully depicted. From the first generation's Adam and Charles to the second generation's Aaron (Aron) and Caleb, the enduring themes are the battles between good and evil; love and hatred; and acceptance and rejection. It is the possibility of change through the exercise of free will: \`Thou mayest' that adds such a rich dimension to the novel.\`Virtue and vice are warp and woof of our first consciousness and they will be the fabric of our last, and this despite any changes we may impose on field and river and mountain, on economy and manners.'It is the characters who make this story come alive. Cathy Ames, who becomes Adam's wife, is a truly evil character. And yet, for me, the most monstrous action in the novel is Adam's passive withdrawal from his sons rather than her acts of violence. Cathy may be a monster:\`I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents.'But acts of monstrosity can be passive as well as active.Two of the characters are simply wonderful: Samuel Hamilton and Lee stand out for their wisdom and humanity. This is a complex, multi-layered novel that is magnificent in a number of different ways. I first read it over 30 years ago, have just finished re-reading it and intend to read it again.\`It's hard to split a man down the middle and always reach for the same half.'Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is my favorite work of fiction, and I think it could be in contention for the best work ever."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have to say that this book came as a surprise to me. I saw the movie recently and was spell-bound so went and got the book immediately, and have to say that it is now actually the best book I've ever read. Personally, anyway. Something you have to understand, it is a very easy book to read. While lots of acclaimed books have pages upon pages of impossibly tiresome 'details' of the most uninteresting things, the pages in this are told simply through stories, as if Steinbeck is telling it over a coffee to a friend. There's none of the \\"the stalks were high and brown, and the golden sunlight lit the condensation like a miracle from the sky\\" nonsense to fill out pages. Everything Steinbeck explains is told so through one story after another, and in that way it is easy to see that this is clearly quite a documentation of his own life and memories. Which I personally think is the most wonderful form of storytelling. The characters are great, too. The first part has a chapter where one brother goes out with a hatchet to murder his other brother. Then not too long after we hear the tale of the most wicked woman ever created, Cathy, who kills her parents by lighting their house on fire. This is gripping, intriguing stuff. I can't believe it was written so long ago. I've never been much of a fan of Steinbeck's until now (we had to read Of Mice and Men in high school and that was okay), but now I have the great urge to buy all his books and have the time of my life all over again."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The Bible deeply influenced John Steinbeck winner of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature. In \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" he takes his inspiration from Exodus; in East of Eden it comes from the primeval stories of Genesis.The long 602 book was published in 1962. The novel begins in Connecticut where Adam Trask and his older brother Charles live on a farm owned by their father Cyrus. Cyrus is a bigwig in the GAR and has a wooden leg from his Civil War service. We later learn he stole money from the GAR. The Vice-President of the USA and Secretary of War attend the old man's funeral. Adam enters the army for ten years while his irascible brother Charles stays on the farm making a fortune. There are shades of Cain and Abel in the tumultous relationship between these brothers.Adam marries Cathy Trask who has burned her parents to death in a fire at her New England home. She has the face of an angel and the mind of a devil. After Adam and Cathy move to Salinas California she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to Cal and Aron but deserts the boys. She shoots Adam running away to a whorehouse. She later murders Faye the madam and becomes rich. She is one of the most evi women in American fiction. She will later meet Adam and her two sons in bitter confrontations. Cathy's suicide takes her to the secret place where she believes Alice in Wonderland waiths for her! Cathy is a greedy, horrible, cruel and devious witch!Adam and the ever faithful Chinese servant Lee raise the two boys. On the night Cal takes Aron to the house of prostitution owned by Cathy the two boys engage in a fight. They also resemble Cain and Abel from the Bible. Aron elists in the World War One American Army and is killed in combat. Cal falls in love with Abel's longtime girl friend the beautiful and kind Abra Bacon. Adam who has suffered a stroke following the shocking death of Aron forgives Cal for his sins. As the last page ends we know Adam is at peace with his oldest son.The novel is a big three masted ship which also looks at the family of Samuel Hamilton, his faithful wife Liza and their brood of nine children. The Hamiltons are good people and are friends with the lonely Adam Trask.East of Eden is one of the greatest novels ever written in the United States. This reviewer has read it several times and enjoys it each time. It deals with such big subjects as love, hate, sin, forgivenss, the love of the land and what it means to be an American. This book is essential reading!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I LOVED this book. I bought it and got about half way through but became very busy with school and had to put it down. I picked it back up and finished it a couple years later, when I had more time, but I am pretty sure I lost a lot in the time between. I can't wait to go back and read it again!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Biblical accounts abound in this John Steinbeck novel revolving around the turn of the century Californians - on a tale loosely based upon relatives or neighbors of the relatives of the author's heritage.East of Eden is the quite simply where Cain - of Cain and Abel fame - was exiled. The two stories within this tome are of Adam and Charles Trask, and the sons of Adam - Caleb and Aaron whose names mirror alphabetically Cain and Abel: a theme for both the stories of Adam and Charles (note the initials) and the sons of Adam.Within the confines of the novel are great parables and stories of the pilgrimages of persons who made the America of today so great. But, the personalities include evil - including the mother of Caleb and Aaron (Aron) - Cathy, later requesting to be called Kate. She is quite simply stealth: \\"I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents,\\" Steinbeck writes in the novel. \\"Some you can see, misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies; some are born with no arms, no legs, some with three arms, some with tails or mouths in odd places...And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born? The face and body may be perfect, but if a twisted gene or malformed egg can produce physical monsters, may not the same process produce a malformed soul?\\"This monster belies all human nature when she gives birth to Caleb and Aaron and on same date abandons them. She leaves them to do what she does best - be a woman of ill repute and ridicule men at her trade. \\"She combines the brains of a businessman, the toughness of a prize fighter, the warmth of a companion, the humor of a tragedian. Myths collect around her . . . \\"Amid this novel of human weakness exists strong literature. \\"Samuel Hamilton rode back home in a night so flooded with moonlight that the hills took on the quality of the white and dusty moon. The trees and earth were moon dry, silent and airless and dead. The shadows were black without shading and the open places white without color.\\"And, amid this novel arises a person or two of great character. The first is Samuel Hamilton - believed to be based upon the grandfather of the author. Secondly is the protagonist Adam Trask. And, lastly is my favorite, Lee, a China man who aids Adam in raising the twins when his monstrous wife leaves them to raise the two infants. He is more than just a helper. He is a philosopher - a topic to be discussed more thoroughly later. As Adam states, \\"I don't see how you could cook and raise the boys and take care of me and still do all this.\\"In the great philosophical dialogue, we return to the Bible - and not surprisingly to the Cain and Abel where Lee discusses how the King James' version differs from the American Standard translation of the Genesis chapter of Cain. To decipher how the difference came about, Lee read the Hebrew version and found a difference in translation in the word timshel. And, this little discourse in the first third of the book cannot be forgotten - as that word and the differences of translation become the focus of the ending. So when you go to the end, and if for any reason you forgot the great philosophical dialogue between Lee and Adam and Hamilton about the word timshel, save yourself time and go to [...] where it is all delivered in a few strokes at the monitor. In effect, it is whether you believe there is fate without choice; or does man have the ability to control destiny by choice.There are also great anti-war undertones. \\"There were people who gave everything they had to the war because it was the last war and by winning it we would remove war like a thorn on the flesh of the world and there wouldn't be any more such horrible nonsense.\\"It has been three decades since I read Steinbeck. And, to be certain, many of the undertones about timshel or the ignorance of youth would probably have been lost upon my younger reader's eyes. Maturity abounds in this novel written in less decorous language, but beautifully painted verse, of the life and times in romantic agrarian northern California when it was truly the land of fruit and plenty.At this time of my life, when I have read most of this author's works, and all of the acclaimed works, I must claim this to be my favorite. This is a masterpiece. And probably because of its size and occasional rough topics, not the choice for classrooms. Unfortunate choices by the classrooms."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is John Steinbeck's greatest work! It is full of wisdom and has lots of autobiographical material about the author. Steinbeck writes beautifully so that the reader gets a clear picture of the people and places in the story. It is a study of good and evil as the story unfolds. You can draw your own conclusions as to whether there are any completely good or evil people in the world, and what the author thinks. It shows Steinbeck's love of the Salinas area in California and makes you want to visit. As it traces three generations of families, you don't want to stop reading until you find out what happens to them."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Great novel, emblematic of Steinbeck's story-writing, including thematic spacer chapters. Classic novel that really gets at the heart of the human condition."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Critics of this novel will tell you that it's a heavy-handed, melodramatic, bloated example of literary self indulgence; and frankly these are valid complaints. And yet I enjoyed this novel - quite a bit actually. Steinbeck, for all his shortcomings, is an accomplished story-teller and I found myself consistently reading \`just a few more pages' instead of putting the book down. What can I say? The novel's flaws are maddeningly apparent, and yet I genuinely looked forward to each opportunity to pick the book up again.To address the (perfectly valid) criticisms of this novel:1. It's heavy handed: It's hard not to argue with this criticism. Steinbeck is about as subtle as a sledgehammer with his use of themes in East of Eden. We get it. Cain and Abel, Good vs. Evil, Free Will vs. Destiny. At one point Cal (aka Cain) is asked if he knows where his missing brother is and Cal replies \\"How do I know, am I supposed to look after him?\\" (aka \`Am I my brother's keeper?'). Personally I would have liked to have seen Steinbeck use a lighter touch and let readers interpret the novel for themselves.2. It's melodramatic: I can't argue with this criticism either. Frankly, it's a big sprawling multigenerational soap opera; more guilty pleasure than literary masterpiece. But the fact that it's a Steinbeck novel gives you a rare opportunity to indulge in a guilty pleasure (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) and read a \`classic' at the same time.3. It's boated and self-indulgent: Did this novel need to be 600 pages long? Of course not. The central story with its Good vs. Evil theme, centers entirely on the Trask family. But the novel tells the story of two families; the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The Hamiltons are Steinbeck's own family and in fact John narrates much of the story as himself. True, real Hamilton family members play pivotal roles in the fictional Trask family saga, but Steinbeck dedicates a considerable portion of this novel to telling his family story (that's the self-indulgent part). The result is that the novel meanders, lacking focus, particularly during the middle portion of the novel. The Hamiltons are mostly absent from the final quarter of the novel and the momentum picks up considerably as a result.East of Eden, particularly in its final quarter, is remarkably entertaining and compulsively readable. To this, I attribute Steinbeck's gift for story-telling. The bottom line: despite myself, I really enjoyed this novel. I can't give it five stars because of the novel's shortcomings, but if you are looking for a guilty pleasure that you don't have to feel guilty about (on account of it being a classic novel written by one of the 20th century's eminent writers) look no further than East of Eden. This is a far cry from Steinbeck's best work (although I understand he is most proud of this novel, probably because of the self-indulgent telling of his own family story and its celebration of his beloved Salinas Valley) but it is still well worth reading. 4 stars."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden draws from the biblical story of Cain and Abel, reliving the age-old theme of good versus evil. The similarities between the brothers in this novel and the biblical brothers are numerous. First, note the \\"C\\" in Cain, Charles and Cal, and the \\"A\\" in Abel, Adam and Aron. The fathers in the book represent God and Cathy (Kate) plays a very convincing Satan.In Genesis Chapter four, Cain and Abel both offer gifts to God, and Abel's is respected and accepted while Cain's is not. Similarly, in East of Eden, Charles gives his father a knife and Adam gives him a puppy; Cyrus loves the puppy but does not use the knife.Years later, Cal and Aron are in the same situation with their father, Adam. Adam wants nothing more than the gift of pride that Aron gives him through his scholarly endeavors, and rejects the gift of money from Cal. There are many similarities between Cal, Charles and Cain, but also one major distinction that sets Cal apart from the other two evil characters. Cal recognizes the malevolence in himself and hates it. On that basis, a part of him is as good as Aron, Adam, and Abel. In the end, Cal is redeemed because he can bring himself to ask for forgiveness."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"As a little girl in Denmark, I read it for the first time and fell in love with the Salinas Valley and the people who settled there. Later, I visited Salinas and the Steinbeck museum. The book, which I re-read regularly, had a big impact on my life - and the story of the origin of the word 'timshel' is fascinating and riveting. The discussions among Adam, Sam Hamilton, and Lee are my favorite scenes of the book. Steinbeck will always be close to my heart.... Kirsten Weinoldt"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"After several distractions, and more than two months, I finally reached the end of Steinbeck's so-called 'epic'. Apparently, I should have watched the movie instead.There's not a lot to add to previous reviews. The story is long, unfocused, long, rambling, long, cliched, long, tiresome, long, repetitious, and not short.The scope of the story is simply too large, and there are too many characters who ultimately add nothing to the drama. The 'modern day Cain and Abel' angle is worn into the ground long before the story even turns its attention to Cal and Aron. The previous generation(Charles and Adam) make perhaps the dullest pair of charcters ever put together in any work of fiction, and the long, incresingly frequent digressions to catch up on the Hamiltons, the progress of American history and its impact on Salinas, and the state of the prostitution industry, serve to slow this book to a glacial pace.The Chinese housekeeper, Lee, is perhaps the only saving grace in the second half of the book, although the final scene involving he, Cal, and Adam redeems some, if not all of the novel's shortcomings.Generally, 'East of Eden' disappoints, because it asks readers to make a long-term emotional investment in a largely lifeless and dull saga, populated (with only a few exceptions) by cardboard characters.In my view, Steinbeck was at his best with more compact novels or short stories. 'Eden' might have worked better if Steinbeck had followed the more loosely-formatted framework of 'Cannery Row', rather than weighing down this story with so much verbiage."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What can I say about East of Eden. This book is a masterpiece. This book made me love reading. I have never in my life become so envolved in a story. I recommend this book to everyone. If you pass this book by you will be denying yourself a truly wonderful experience. The story is timeless and thrilling."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Without a doubt, this is good writing. This is a wonderful book for school reading and book club discussions. However, if you want to kick back and enjoy a fun book, I don't think this is it. There were times when I was bored. At times when I had to put the book down, I found it hard to pick it up again. Once I considered giving it up completely.There are quite a bit of profound discussions (about life, morals, family, etc) between the characters Lee, Samuel, and Adam. Half the time, I haven't a clue as to what they're saying (I may not be an intellect, but I'm not dumb either). I had to re-read some of the lines or paragraphs to get a better understanding, only to find that some of the verbiage was irrelevant to the story. It seemed such a chore having to constantly interpret what they said into simple English.Steinbeck sets up each scene by giving us some insight into history, or by describing the land and people. For most part, I found it to be overly descriptive; some parts either too long and dragged out or simply unnecessary. Also, much of the descriptions are repetitive. It&#65533;s burnt into my brain that Cathy has tiny pointed teeth, that Aron has a pretty face, that Ethel is dumb. I must admit though, however boring it was, it did helped to paint a clear picture in my mind as I was reading the book. I guess that's what makes it good writing!!!All in all, I&#65533;m glad I read this book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck took his turn at the Cain and Abel story, turning it into a towering epic of the westward journey of Americans to the promised land of California. The book is richly detailed, and certainly Steinbeck's most ambitious effort, but ultimately fails to deliver on its central theme. The book is a continuous battle between opposing forces, beginning with the Civil War and ending with land development and the railroad system in California. Caught in the middle of this sprawling epic is a pair of brothers, who find themselves living out an eternal grudge match. The supporting characters are the most interesting in this novel, such as the Chinese cook who becomes so involved in the story of Cain and Abel that he pursues the topic with his elders in San Francisco's China Town, and even searches out a direct Hebrew translation to resolve the meaning of the parable. He finds that the intended word was \\"may\\" and not \\"shall\\" overcome sin, thereby reaffirming man's free will. But, for the most part this is a heavy handed novel, falling short of Steinbeck's better novels, \\"In Dubious Battle\\" and \\"The Winter of Our Discontent.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"There were times, in the middle of the book, when I was so bored by the writing style and I wanted to stop reading it. But I was patient and it paid off. At times I wanted to give the novel two stars, then three stars, then four stars, and it probably deserves a full mark. But I'm keeping it at four stars to tell some readers, especially those who haven't read classics before, that it's not an easy read.I've read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" by Dan Brown before reading this. They were entertaining throughout, but you forget them the moment you finish them. East of Eden, although boring at times, had an impact on me and changed the way I look at life. It just gives you wisdom and a new perspective. And that's what makes a book a great book.

Covering a period of over 50 years, the novel tries to do so much more: the retelling of the Cain and Abel story in the farmlands of the Salinas Valley which was Steinbeck's home and the setting for many of his works. If there is any fault in the novel that stands out, it is in the heavily contrived nature of the storyline and its characters. In spite of this, Steinbeck wrote with such force and utter conviction that the reader is asked to be carried along on faith. One does not enter into such a pact lightly. For his part, the author presents his tale with honesty and integrity. It is not asking too much for the reader to take him at his word. This saga of the Trask and Hamilton families covers the gamut of human experience, and while many of the characters are despicable in nature, the reader may feel a degree of empathy for them. This is no small feat for an author. As in earlier works, Steinbeck is unrivaled in setting the scene, in this case the Salinas Valley he knew so well. There is a love-hate relationship here. Life is hard, especially for those unfortunates who struggle in the arid wastes in the foothills. This is home to the Hamiltons, an Irish immigrant family scraping out a living from its meager topsoil. The interior of the Valley is described as rich and bountiful, and the other family described in the novel, the Trasks, enjoy its fruits. In time these two parties meet, and through their association, their lives are enriched. Steinbeck chooses this novel to introduce the character of Cathy Ames, a monster with the face of an angel. Nowhere in literature is found a more frightening and twisted individual. This evil in the form of innocence is thrust suddenly into the life of Adam Trask, and from here on the novel broadens into a tragic epic. Having entered into a pact with the author the reader is begged to forgive Steinbeck for the various contrivances he employed to bring his story to life. For those who have seen the awful movie with James Dean, forget it. Give Steinbeck the benefit of the doubt and read the novel."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck's East of Eden is a masterpiece. It is at once an epic narrative, a human drama, a journey through lives and generations. It is also a very simple story--that of original sin, of brothers and sons and fathers, of love. You might think that it is long, and it is--but once you get going time will fly because you're having fun!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"You know, from the outset of the description of the Salinas valley, that you are in the hands of a master. Steinbeck takes you on a voyage through American History, and more importantly, deep into the hearts of human beings. The book was long, yes, and sometimes Steinbeck seemed to harp on notions of good and evil; but every chapter seemed to leave me with a fresh and lasting insight on the human experience. As he said in his introduction, the story is meant to be a box full of tales about humanity. A book that everyone should read, swallow, and use as a measure against the world around them."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you love drama, or don't get enough in your real life, this book is filled with it. From the beginning you meet two families, one of course is the soul of the book. This of course is the Trask family. First you meet Adam, he of course is this first son, also symbolizing religious aspects. Then you meet his charming bride Kate. If ever there was a bad seed, here it is. By book 2 of East of Eden, the two boys are born. This being Cal and Aaron. Two handsome twins, that in reality are nothing alike. Finally book 3. This is where the James Dean movie comes in. But as usual, this book is not given proper justice in the movie. The total irony of the end, is a complete surprise, and by the end you want more. If ever their was a dysfunctional family, you meet it in the Trask's. I loved this book and can read it over and over again. It is completely unlike his other novels, such as The Pearl, or The Grapes of Wrath.

Needless to say, I was dramatically wrong; this is the best novel that I have read in a long time. The story is engaging, but never melodramatic; the characters may be simple, but only in the sense that real people are simple too. The theme developed in the book is that all struggles between men are struggles of good and evil. It takes a good writer to be able to write a novel with that theme and never have it seem hokey; it takes a truly great writer to be able to tell the reader, in a short chapter in the middle of the book &quot;This book is the story of good and evil.&quot; In my years of reading so far, I have read only one story that is this much of a fable yet is still memorable, months later, in vivid detail -- that is, of course, the Book of Genesis (Adam/Eve, Cain/Abel, Noah, etc.).

I don't know what else I can tell you about it without telling you the actual story. It's great. Read it. You will love it. That's all I can say."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I first picked up East of Eden, I was not sure that I would enjoy it. The first 40 or so pages did not hold my attention, but it seems that once I turned to page 41, I was HOOKED and could not put the large novel down until it was done.The stories of the Hamiltons and Trasks intersect so beautifully and Lee's character is one that I will probably remember forever. So many of his observations about Americans and California are ones that were true in the 1900s and continue to ring true a century later. I highlighted many passages in this book as ones that I won't forget and would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"These book is one of the greatest clasics you can come across. It is a serene insight in relationship on man-women and brotherhood issues. Though is not very crystal on answering the question why the main character is so sentimentaly naive and as such against all odds, but still the situation, the consequences of it are colorfuly depicted. It's a book how Good can survive against the Evil but still it gets the shorter end of it. There is no ideal or divine realization that good will win overall. Being truly and naivly good doesn't mean that you will be awerded for it and that a true love can win at the end. It can be farse to itself."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Honestly, I thought the first 400 pages were more compelling than the conclusion. However, this book is quite remarkable. The Biblical theme of Cain/Abel with Charles/Adam and Caleb/Aron is a haunting revelation into the complex balance between good and evil that defines us as human beings. Cathy (Kate) is without a doubt the most devious and evil literary character I've encountered EVER in literature. Every scene she was in I couldn't wait to see what happened!I do recommend this book, despite its flaws, because the glimpse into humanity is powerful. It did concern me a bittoo when I realized that 3 of my 4 children are named Adam, Caleb and Kate!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Excellent book. The characters are SOOO well developed and the insight into the human mind so profound that I will have a hard time picking up a typical murder mystery again. I spent much time pondering some of the magical paragraphs and exhalting in the fantastic ending. It is great after reading the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" since it also considers the true origins of parts of the Bible. This is a great read and a great book club selection."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Excellent book!! Much better than in highschool, go figure! Such talent in writing, wish I was there in the time and moment. Truly one of the great writers in literature. A MUST READ in your fourties, you will appreciate it so much more!!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Cain and Abel, Steinbeck captures the tragedy of the human experience in all his characters in East of Eden. I'm a life-long admirer of Steinbeck. That's caused me to go back and re-read each of his books several times over the years. I find my tastes have evolved. Some of my favorites in 1960 have become least favorites. Not so, East of Eden. I loved this book as a young man and love it still as a curmudgeon."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I recently re-read this book and think it's amazing. Although it can be convoluted and unfocused at times, it's central themes are amazingly relevant and important. The question of whether the sins of the father (and mother) taint us forever, or if we can be reborn, speak to what America, and more specifically California, are about - places to come and start a new life - where the future, not the past, is important. Although I'm not a big fan of the James Dean version, I would like to correct some things that Alan Cambeira says in his review. Although I agree with his dislike for the movie, some of the details in the review make me wonder if he knows what he's talking about. First, he says the movie was shot in black and white. This isn't true, it's in vivid color. Second, he says James Dean's father is played &quot;imperially by Anthony Quinn.&quot; This is also false - it was Raymond Massay. I don't mean to nit-pick, but if you're going to criticize something, you should know what you're talking about."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a novel that successfuly weaves strands of fact with threads of fiction to create a stunning tapestry of American life that is timeless. The novel is based in the early part of the 1900's and despite it's massive length (over 600 pages) Steinbeck manages to draw you in and make you think. His characters are richly drawn so that you almost know them. I believe this is because we can find a little of each character with in ourselves. This book is the very best book I have ever read and that says a lot because I am constantly reading. Pick up East of Eden today and take the journey to the Salinas Valley. You will not regret it!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What is so great and compelling about the stories of Genesis, that of Cain and Abel in particular, is that they are eternal. Steinbeck successfully conveys this in a modern retelling, where the reader can relate more successfully to all parties involved. He uses the helpful technique of telling the first story through Adam Trask's eyes, who plays the role of Abel. For the second generation, it is Aron (the Abel figure) who is now aloof and distant from us and we relate to and understand Cal (the Cain figure.) However, this is not the only story that is being told.At the same time is being woven in stories of love, human nature (and seemingly inhuman monstrosity,) betrayal, and pity. Steinbeck helps us understand these diverse characters by immersing us in them for what seems like years. This novel really feels like an epic to read, and although it seems to be impregnable and dragging, you finish feeling enlightened and wishing you could read it for the first time again.Clearly the most important message Steinbeck wishes to convey is the element of human choice. No god or higher power of any sort compels you; your destiny is not predetermined. You have the choice to do good OR evil whatever your circumstance. We hope for Cal that he understands that he is not condemned by his mother's evil and his seemingly inherited hatred, and we also relate this precept to our own lives. For this reason, as well as its simple storytelling merits, I feel that East of Eden far outshines The Grapes of Wrath as a chronicle of the human condition.Many don't understand Steinbeck's obsession with the Salinas Valley and if they do, they don't understand why they have to be subjected to reams of pages describing it and its inhabitants. Some reasons may include westward movement (i.e. struggling back to Eden) and also that it provides an effective parallel in many ways to a hard land that is east of Eden. This is no heavenly garden of Eden, but its inhabitants incessantly toil to overcome.To understand about this and many other tools that Steinbeck employs, I highly recommend that with this book you read \\"Journal of a Novel: the Writing of East of Eden\\", (the name is something like that) In this journal Steinbeck would begin every day of writing with a journal entry to his dear friend and editor Pascal Covici. He makes obscure references to the book that necessitate constant referral back to the pages, but it is understandable enough. This journal is more useful in its function of helping the reader understand John Steinbeck and where he is coming from; his passion for invention, his own fears and love for his two young sons (in fact he wrote this for and about them,) and his feelings on contemporary subjects all show what a multi-talented and opinionated man he was. One of many gems in these pages is his discussion of children, and adults' attitudes toward them. He basically says that adults often discount the opinions and needs of children as fanciful and useless, because these adults have forgotten what it is like to be a child. On the contrary, Steinbeck says, adult thoughts only get more cloudy and jaded as they age, whereas the thought of children is pure, deep, and real, even if they can't always effectively communicate it.So in addition to a helpful companion to East of Eden, Journal of a Novel is important life-reading in its own right.Anyway, I highly recommend East of Eden and feel that any reader should lay aside a lot of time to read and re-read this complicated and moving novel. If you go too fast, you might miss something. In Journal of a Novel, Steinbeck effectively said with no reservations, \\"This is the one. Everything else I have written has been practice for this one.\\" This \\"everything else\\" is a distinguished body of literature, so why don't we take Steinbeck at his word and confirm his quest for greatness, realized in this epic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is probably what Michner was reading when he started creating his books. Steinbeck does this big drama like no one else can. The story is really good, he keeps it moving and it is really engrossing. The book is filled thoughout with plenty of interesting and complex characters. He does a great job describing California. This is not his best work but an all around great effort."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is an amazing book. I wasn't sure what to expect when I first opened it, but then I was hooked. This book teaches you about good and evil. Every character was interesting enough to be their own character. from this book I learned a lot about the world in 1900 and today."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My husband and I have a tradition. Ever since our honeymoon 8 years ago, we've read books aloud to eachother. East of Eden was our latest. Having read Grapes of Wrath together 4 years ago, we thought nothing of Steinbeck's could top it. These two books are very different books, so I'm not going to say one is greater than the other. There was a different focus, they are so different you can not call one greater. But we were amazed at the greatness of this book!!! We were so engaged in it that we read it much faster than anything but Wilkie Collins(it's impossible not to read WC fast...but that's another review.) We were very attatched to the characters...these are not shallow characters you don't care much about. You want them to succeed! You want to see what is going to happen to them. It's a very introspective book, you WILL remember it, it affects you. So just start reading and don't worry about being bored or worry about choosing the book which was Steinbeck's best. Just start reading."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"All I can say about this book is that I loved it. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down, and I finished it in about two days. It completely encompassed me. I have never read Grapes of Wrath but Steinbeck called that his one book... If that is his one book then I don't know what you would call this besides amazing. I am so glad I got to read this treasure."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book quite quickly, in about a week, for school. I found that it was very entertaining and that it shows the depths of evil possible. There are two sides in this book. Evil and good. The evil is shown in characters like Cathy and Caleb. How? Well, you'll have to read the book to find out. I can ruin it for you, though. All I have to say is that this book has sex and whores, farms and pidgin talk, lies and lies, sins and naiveness.The main character is the towering Adam Trask, whom I think is too gullible. Why? You can figure that out by reading the book. I recommend it. It's quite long though."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is the reason I passed Junior English. The thickness at first turned me off but Steinbeck makes it so riveting I could not put it down. The character of Cathy Ames/Kate is the reason why I love this book. She is a disturbed evil being whom I love to hate and her actions make you want to read further to determine why she is the way she is. Cathy is one of the greatest characters I have read about in a long while"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is absolutley fascinating. I read it in highschool and I cannot wait to read it again some day. Steinbeck creates such dramatic images, it really is a great classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is a probing, philosophical work focusing on the inner struggle between good and evil. Steinbeck creates angelic characters in Adam and his son Aron, pure evil in Adam's wife Cathy, and a testy coexistence of the two in Caleb and Charles. He strips away the shells of these characters, exposing human nature and its many complexities to the reader. Powerful emotions like love, jealousy, and shame shape the novel and its characters. Steinbeck writes with rugged honesty and incomparable beauty, making East of Eden a treasured American classic."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is about two families--the Trasks and the Hamiltons- whose destinies will intertwine. The relationship between Adam/Charles, re-enact the rivalry of Cain and Abel, while Adam's marrige, the fall of Adam and Eve. The story takes place in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley. In the first generation, Charles and Adam were introduced, Cahrles as Cain and Adam as Abel. Though Adam was not killed by his brother Charles, he was beaten badly. Luckily, as both grew older, their relationship changed for the better. However, the rivalry amongst the two brothers was passed in Adam's twin sons, Cal as Cain and Aron as Abel..... Adam's marriage to Cathy was never he thought it would be. Like Eve, Cathy brought troubles in Adam's life. Cathy left her family and became a whore, in which led to her death. The only man that helped Adam get through his hardships in life was Samuel Hamilton, who became his dearest friend. I highly recommend this book because it's a powerful piece that deals with sibling rivalry as well as the loss of ones love."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is the kind of book that is a true joy to read. The bittersweet ending is the highlight of this study of one family's internal conflict. The character of Samuel is one of the richest that exists in literary history. His words are always a comfort both to the other characters and to the reader. East of Eden is John Steinbeck's grand opus. Some will be daunted by the length but Steinbeck can warm any reader's heart with finely drawn characters, an intense plot, and beautiful imagery. Do not pass on this!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I find it hard to read a book whose characters I have not respect for. I never had any reason to care what happened to these people.That is what I wrote, when I read the 1st 1/2 of the book. I hated the first 1/2, but then when I read the 2nd half it was a lot better... But it won't let me change my review..."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I thought this book was a waste of my time. it may have emotion... but it is riddled with chapters that contain little relevance to the plot! Save yourself and don't bother."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book was yellow and old. I did not want to touch it and threw it away. Condion of book appaling."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In my opinion, East of Eden tops everything written by John Steinbeck. Although it is a biblical story, Steinback doesn't present it as such. It's a modern-day Cain versus Able story. If you liked this book, you'll probably also like From the Heart by Kendall Bell. Both of these books are very inspiring."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"My problem with this book isn't its length, because to me length is an asset when the book is fascinating-I didn't feel the length of Crime and Punishment, Anna Karenina, Mandela's Long Walk to Freedom, and these are all 500 page plus books.The problem with this book is that although there is a sort of guilty pleasure involved that keeps you going for a very long time-how evil is this woman?-it does not pay off. We all enjoy stories about fictional characters without a conscience, because it creates all kinds of interesting possibilities. But after a while, the heavy symbolism of Cain and Abel, the repeating family tragedies, and so on, become tedious and the book just drags on and on until you just can't wait for it to be over. This is not an indictment of Steinbeck (or Oprah, whose book recommendations are usually very good), because I've liked other writings of his and he is certainly an American treasure in his depiction of so many early twentieth-century experiences, social situations, etc.This book didn't really have much of a moral in my opinion, which is fine, but the writing style wasn't good enough to compensate for a lack of it and to stand alone based on the beauty of the writing."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I know most people say this is an incredible awesome book, but as most classics, it has \\"its parts.\\" It has some parts that will keep you sooo interested, but there are others that really feels like the author was just filling out pages. There are characters that have nothing to do with the plot, but have 30 pages about them. As most classics that I have read, the general plot is awesome, but don't expect all the book to keep you awake. There are parts where you will need real will power to keep going, so just be patient, and continue reading."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is by no means a good representation of Steinbeck's ability to write. He uses the most overplayed theme in literature of good vs. evil. The seemingly obvious plot and significance of motifs (or lack there of) lend to a pretty weak recounting of his family history with the infamous Cain and Abel tale woven into the plot. Much of the book is spent in narrative form, and when the simple and stolid characters do get a chance to talk, their words are tasteless and lack energy or fervor. The plot didn't seem to move anywhere as I was repeatedly caught hoping for the book to end (it drags on for 602 pages). In addition, Steinbeck attempts to use old fashioned cliches and metaphors, and fails miserably. It is obvious that he tries to incorporate deep significance to certain aspects of the book and fails miserably. For example, he uses this metaphor several times: \\"she must have had a pelvic arch of a whalebone, for she had big children one after the other.\\" Maybe it's just me, but that's not very inspirational. Lastly, Steinbeck crushes all chance for the reader to think for him/herself (even though there wasn't much thinking to do about this book anyway). He reveals all the symbolic, deep thinking, significant ideas through his character dialogue and by outright statement of them. At the beginning of Book IV, he expressly states the main theme of the novel to the reader, ruining all chance for the reader to think beyond the level of a first grader. Overall, I was not very impressed with the level of writing in East of Eden. Maybe this is because I had such high hopes for Steinbeck material. Nonetheless, many people happen to like this novel. It could be better (much better)."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Though it's been years since I read this book it still remains to be one of my favorites.

I think you will find the same is true of most good literature, in this case \\"East of Eden.\\"You have not read the book recently? You only remember the movie (based on only the last quarter of the book)? Maybe it was assigned by a teacher. At that age it was probably very easy to read the sordid parts, giggle at the whores, wonder at Cal, who probably morphs into James Dean as you think about it, put the book down and forget it. Many of us have done it, many will continue to do it.What high school student can possibly understand Samuel's statement \\"You know, Lee, I think of my life as a kind of music, not always good music but still having form and melody. And my life has not been a full orchestra for a long time now. A single note only - and that note unchanging sorrow. I'm not alone in my attitude, Lee. It seems to me that too many of us conceive of a life as ending in defeat.\\" As far as that goes, is it possible for a high school student to conceive of the end of life for either them or their friends? How many funerals do you have to go to before you understand Adam's knowledge that it would be unthinkable not to go to Samuel's funeral, but at the same time have to maintain his knowledge that Samuel was not dead? Sure it's easy to wonder why Adam can't see through Cathy, but it takes only one failed marriage to come to the beginning of an understanding. How many people do you have to know to comprehend the sorrow that drives Tom to suicide when his sister dies?As the author says \\"Nearly everything I have is in it, and it is not full. Pain and excitement are in it, and feeling good or bad and evil thoughts and good thoughts - the pleasure of design and some despair and the indescribable joy of creation.\\" Perhaps, just perhaps, the problem most people who attempt to review this book have is that it has been too long since they read it. This book has been around for over fifty years. Many of us read (or were supposed to have read) it in high school. Many who did think they remember it, or that they understood it.It is an adult book. It has characters developed over a lifetime. I have read this book at least 15 times. It still surprises, depresses, enlightens, engrosses, and thrills me each time I read it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck incorporates a number of biblical themes in his novel, East Of Eden. I strongly recommend readers to have an affirmative grasp on the Bible before reading the novel. It was not until my friend mentioned some major themes of the Bible that I fully understand the Steinbeck's intentions. The themes that prevail in this novel are family values, free will, and the ultimate choice of good vs. evil. Note: the reader can understand the novel without a strong biblical background, but one will gain so much more if one is able to incorporate the novel's themes with that of the bible. Biblical themes set aside; the plot of the novel is entirely captivating. The binds of brotherhood and family are constantly tested and the reader is able to witness firsthand how important personal values contribute to one's success in life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The plot of East of Eden is massive yet similar to a soap opera and has many characters which might be confusing to those who aren't used to those type of books. but if you can stick with it youll find it is an addicting book and its well written. This is a great classic book and I recommend it if you are willing to tackle a tough but wonderful book"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I felt impressed to write a review after reading the book only because I felt the other reviewers were a bit one-sided in appraising this &quot;20th Century Classic&quot;. While he develops his thesis wonderfully by spinning a modern day version of the Biblical &quot;myth&quot; of Cain an Abel, and while he lovingly develops the characters of Cal, Lee, Sam Hamilton, and Abra, he simultaneously vents his spleen's bitterness against women, Christians, and especially Christian women. I felt over and over that Steinbeck had nurtured his prejudices and was using this novel as a means of lashing out at former lovers, Sunday school teachers, aunts and any other woman who had any level of conviction and authority over him at any point in his life. Beyond Cathy, the human personification of Satan (literally), each and every woman character in the book is demeaned until we finally meet Abra, the liberated teenager who is more like Steinbeck's male characters than any of his female characters. By the end of the book I was tired of his cranky and pedantic &quot;macho&quot;/independent voice. I was glad to be back in a world where women are human beings and where moral communities are actually a viable place of nurture and not merely (imagined) oppression."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Though I am no fan of the classics, the plot and dialogue were easy to follow. My only real criticism of the book was that it forces its readers to read far into the book to reach the more intense sequences and interesting points of the storyline.

What an amazing story as told by an amazing author.I tend not to provide a synopsis of the book in my reviews and I will continue that trend in this review. I will say that East of Eden is basically a grand morality play using the Biblical Story of Cain and Abel as its backdrop.As in Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck throws in chapters that are very omniscient in scope, some might even say Biblical in tone. It is in one of these chapters that Steinbeck basically asks the reader to make a choice between good and evil in his or her life. I had to stop reading at that point and just think for a little while....that is the sign of a great author at the top of his game!Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you've read any of Steinbeck's other books, don't expect anything different from this one. You either love him or you hate him. I've never been a fan of his, but it had been a while and having made such an impression on Oprah, I decided to give East of Eden a shot.It seems trite to say the book was depressing, but heck, it was really depressing. The message is that we all have free will, but that's not breaking news to me and reading it was too much like tedious homework. The lesson was conveyed and learned, but it was not an enjoyable process. I just couldn't connect with the characters which, in my humble opinion, were never developed enough to incite any real empathy from me. I just watched on in disgust.In looking back, I recognize the genius and the simplicity of the theme and how he incorporated it into the novel. I'll also admit (reluctantly) that the book was very well written and successfully delivered the message. I applaud Steinbeck's writing skills, which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars.Alas, in the spirit of the book, we all have free will, so I won't choose to read Steinbeck again. I was disappointed in the read, but I'm sure my book club's discussion will be interesting. If you are in a book club or want something to talk about at the water cooler, then have at it. If you are just getting back into reading or looking for a good book to sink into, I would suggest you look elsewhere. If you don't know where to start, look at the reviews from a favorite book, find someone who had a similar opinion and look at that persons lists and other reviews. I've found some real gems that way."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I first read EAST OF EDEN when I was in my early teen years and remembered I was absolutely captivated by it. (I had run out of reading material and raided my mother's bookshelves at the time) I remembered the story read as a sort of soap opera with larger than life characters and I simply couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. It also helped that the novel takes place in California - where I live - and that just seemed to add to my enjoyment.So, when I picked this novel up again I was very much looking forward to it once again. I felt I would be re-visiting a few old friends. I was to be sadly mistaken. Unfortunately, this go round I found this novel tedious and mostly boring. Gone were the larger than life characters. They had been replaced with people who seemed more unreal than anything else. Steinbeck rambles and meanders - a lot - to the point where I wanted to simply skip entire chapters or yell, \\"Get to the point!\\" He wrote this book towards the end of his career, and during a very bleak time in his life, and it seems to show. There is no focus. Steinbeck takes the reader on a long, rambling walk over the hills of California and when it concludes, we've no idea why we went or for what purpose. I doubt Steinbeck knew, either.I think the biggest problem I have this go round that I didn't have when I read this book the first time, is that I compare it to THE GRAPES OF WRATH. By far, this novel comes far, far short of that one, and that is perhaps where I'm making my error.The language of Steinbeck is beautiful, there can be no doubt. He can truly transport a reader to another place and time! But I would recommend that if one decides to read only one Steinbeck novel in their life, let it be GRAPES OF WRATH, and not this one. It is a far better written book and far more important one as well. However, if one feels s/he wants to tackle this project, just be prepared that it is not easy to wade through. It is tedious, more than a bit boring at times, and very easy to put down. However, one may find it worthwhile in the end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden was one of the most remarkable tales of betrayal, brotherhood, and just simply finding \\"yourself\\". John Steinback is a wonderful author and he caught me almost from the start with this book.Most of all, I really enjoyed Steinback's style of writing. Just the way he writes makes you want to read more. First, there is Cathy, when you read about her it's almost like she is right there next to you. Growing up as a whore, she gets lost within strange thoughts, and is almost \\"devilish\\". After murdering her parents in a house fire, which was only the start of her terror, she runs off and isn't heard of for a long time.Then there is Adam, an almost robotic man, who isn't alive or dead. He just exists. He is very much in love with Cathy and his life revolves around her. She has other ideas though. She cheats Adam on their wedding night and leaves him after her twin boys are born.The two brothers relationship is also a very good example of Steinback's writing. They have a very realistic care towards each other. They would get a long very well, then get in a massive fight and one would leave.Throughout the book, it was easy for me to \\"paint a picture\\" of exactly what is going on Whether it be the setting or characters, it was all very vivid.The only downside for me was I had a difficult time getting into the book and following it at the beginning. But, honestly, once you start getting what is going on you won't be able to stop reading it. So that was the only thing I didn't like because it was a REALLY good book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting into books with style, great characters, and close to the realistic events that happen in life."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have yet to read a poor Steinbeck book and I think this was his all-time best (Grapes of Wrath is a close second).

His colourful landscapes, or the unique characters, and the poetic style of every novel. East of Eden ranks amongst the finest of Steinbeck's work, along with The grapes of Wrath and Of mice and men, but also the lesser known works which also astounded me, like To a god unknown. The length of this novel should not put anyone off, as it is an easy read that you won't want to put down. You'll end up wishing it was longer. This is a perfectly epic construe of literature. It is also great to see the recent revival of interest in this book, and many others like it. It gives the choice of reading back to the reader.This is a modern fable, and one that should last as long as the ones from the bible upon which Steinbeck constantly plays."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The book is great, don't get me wrong.

However, maybe without Oprah's generous promotional efforts, this particular work by John Steinbeck (1902-68) might have remained the obscure and enigmatic masterpiece that it is. Keen movie buffs will recall the attempt some thirty-odd (or more?) years ago to convert this novel into a movie [executed appropriately in funereal black and white, instead of in dazzling color ... despite the sunny brilliance of California's Salinas Valley]. The brooding actor James Dean had the role of brother Caleb, who vies for the affection and approval of his father, played imperially by Anthony Quinn. The movie version was not at all a box-office success mainly because, in my view, the story was so amazingly intricate and overwhelming with its ponderously convoluted psychological elements. The same is true about the novel: multi-layered in approach, tone, and structure, resulting in constant nervous tension and anguish. But then who would dare argue with a giant of such innovative literary artistry as Nobel Prize (1962) winning author John Steinbeck? At some point shortly after after the initial publication of this novel (1952), Steinbeck himself publically alluded to the \\"difficulty\\" (e.i.,complexity) of this powerfully dramatic work. He was totally pleased with his creation. And difficult, indeed, is this novel. I know I'm dating myself, but so what? Does anyone remember those essential Cliff Notes that regularly accompanied literary Master Works? Well, there was one for EAST OF EDEN. Believe me, this handy little yellow booklet proved indispensable to some readers 'back in the day.' A Masterful Read, so enjoy."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"John Steinbeck depicts three generations of human beings for whom life is the most cruel teacher or torturer you can imagine. More cruelty cannot exist in life, in any human being's life, except within deportation to a slow torturing extermination camp. John Steinbeck is the American Emile Zola.And yet he finds his inspiration in Genesis, Chapter 4, verses 1-16, the story of Abel and Cain, of Abel slain by Cain and Cain punished by God with a phenomenal promotion since his descendants will be the inventors of cities, music, metallurgy and a few other essential human inventions. Many people would like to be cursed to do that. Steinbeck stops though before that future and terminates the story on the curse from God and the mark Cain will carry to protect him against an accidental and fast end, hence to enjoy his curse as long as possible. That's the God of Genesis. But a lot more about it in the novel and this review.The whole novel centers on the reading in King James Bible of the passage in Genesis quoted above and then a discussion about the translation and meaning of verse 7. The exploration of the meaning of that verse is conducted by the Chinese servant of the central character Adam (in the Bible the father of Abel and Cain), the perfectly named man since we are dealing with the descent of the first human beings in the Garden of Eden and then out of it. This verse 7 has two translations. In King James version Jehovah says:\\"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\\"The meaning is a promise from God to Cain, a prediction that comes from some higher authority, in a way a contract with God, with this higher authority. But in the American Standard Bible, the end of the answer is:\\"Do thou rule over it.\\"And that is an order from God to Cain (an interrogative form would have used \\"doest\\").Our Chinese servant, Lee, with the help of four learned Chinese in San Francisco and two rabbis, cuts the Gordian knot of these two translations and readings that are both wrong. They go back to Hebrew and the word concerned here is Timshel and this word means \\"thou mayest rule over him.\\" Lee identifies this as the possibility of a choice on Cain's side: the choice to rule over sin or be ruled over by sin. It is an eventuality expressed my \\"mayest\\" that leaves the choice open, unpredicted and unordered, and it could even be seen as a permission from God that gives Cain the initiative and responsibility to do or not to do. Neither a prediction for sure nor an order definitely.I am of course not going to tell the story but it is easy to show how Steinbeck invests this biblical reference in the novel from beginning to end. The reference to the Garden of Eden in Chapter 15-3 and the Eves who like apples. Four mentions of Genesis Chapter 4 in Chapter 24-2, in Chapter 47-2, in Chapter 54-1, in Chapter 55-3, one sentence and six words before the final period.Numerous other mentions of Cain's crime and punishment are scattered in the book but what is more visible is the use of the couple of initials C and A.First generation. A certain Cyrus Trask with an unnamed Mrs Trask who is Absent as soon as the second page procreates Adam. Later with his second wife Alice he provides Adam with a brother Charles. That's the second generation and the love and hostility between the two brothers are exposed in much detail. It will not lead to the death of Charles, but Adam will move west to California abandoning his brother to whom he will only write some fifteen years later to find out that he is dead. Charles' death, and his being killed by Adam is purely elliptical, purely symbolical.Charles will have no descendants.Adam runs away from Charles in Connecticut to California, the Salinas valley with a wounded woman they both recuperated on their door step. She is called Cathy and from what we know she killed her parents and was severely beaten up by what amounts to her pimp when she rebelled against him. Adam falls in absolute blind love with her and Charles wants her away as soon as possible. Adam will take her to California against her will but after she has had one sexual night with Charles. She will be discovered pregnant in California but with twin boys, false twins, the two being very different.As soon as the boys are delivered and Cathy is strong enough to walk, she leaves Adam and the boys in the sole hands of Adam's servant Lee. She shoots Adam before leaving to prevent him from preventing her from going away. That episode will ruin Adam's life and energy and he will end up living on the inheritance he got from his own father and had shared with his brother.The two boys will be named, from the Bible, under the strong initiative of a neighbour who is under the strong order from his Bible-bound wife. The boys will be named without surprise Caleb for the dark one and Aaron fro the blond one, later shortened to Cal and Aron, both from the Bible. Aaron, the brother of Moses, and his spokesman, later the high priest of the Jews when leaving Egypt, is also the one who brought the golden calf into existence. He will not go into the Promised Land just like Moses himself. Caleb takes part in the Exodus and will be one of the twelve scouts who see the Promised Land and he will, along with Joshua, advocate immediate taking possession of it. Moses and Aaron will stay behind and never get to it. These facts are not mentioned or alluded to in the novel. That C - A couple is loaded with a lot of meaning.Cathy becomes Kate and a Madame in Salinas. She will finally die remembering her favorite literary character that helped her escape her parents, and eventually kill them, i.e. Alice in Wonderland. Another C - A ouple, even if virtual.Adam will not remarry but will live with his Chinese Servant who will take care of the children. This Lee is essential in the whole novel. At the end of the novel, the nurse who will take care of Adam for a very short period of time will call him a chink and Charley, creating thus an A - C couple. Adam is thus taken between two Cs: Cathy/Kate - Adam - Chink/Charley. Of course the nickname Charley is an allusion to Charles, Adam's brother and probably a mental embodiment of this brother of his that he had abandoned to his own slow and lonely fate and death.The love and hostility between Caleb and Aron will naturally be the main course of the novel. They are Abel and Cain, Aron having the project of raising hares, hence be a herdsman like Abel, and Caleb of cultivating his father's farm, hence be a farmer like Cain. This is stated in Chapter 22-4, just after the first reading of Genesis Chapter 14:1-16 in King James Bible. It is the strong \\"thou shalt rule\\" prediction of verse 7 of this story that will determine Lee's research because he disagrees with that fatality: for him a human being is human because he always keeps the capability to choose, to operate his free choosing power.This third generation will relive the drama of their father with the girl who will intrude into the story. She is called Abra (her father wanted a boy and would have called him Abraham, both like Lincoln and like the patriarch in the Bible who is ready to sacrifice his own son Isaac - or Ishmael - on the simple command from God.) Abra will fall in love with the beautiful blond Aron, but it will eventually not work because Aron is pure and dreams her as pure, and after Aron's death she will move to Caleb who is bad just the way she is bad. And that will be another C and A couple. We have to be very careful with the use fo bad or pure in this novel. Both words are mythical and if they are mystical in a way it is essentially because they are full of mist.Aron will die in France in 1918 after enlisting for the war because he is led to his mother Cathy/Kate who he did not know before by Caleb - out of spite because Aron had been preferred by Adam and Caleb had been severely and unfairly if not unjustly rejected - and Aron thus discovers she is a Madame in a house of ill fame next door to his own family home. Another C - A - C triad surges and turns very bad in this case, Caleb - Aron - Cathy/Kate. Then Aron cannot accept this for him abominable fact that proves he is rotten at the core in spite of his absolute dream of being virginally pure.I will of course not give the many details but the biblical fable is led to the worse possible ending. Caleb's initiative, caused by Adam's rejection of Caleb, leads to the death of Aron and this death leads to a bad end for Adam. Caleb in other words kills two birds with one stone, though we could consider Adam killed the two birds with one stone. It is in fact this second interpretation that the intervention of Lee in a new triad Chink/Charley - Adam - Caleb will bring, the only moment of relief of the book with the final word \\"Timshel\\" that opens the door to the couple Caleb - Abra and a next generation. Knowing the cursing nature of God, and John Steinbeck, I would be surprised if that fourth generation were not plagued with more curses. Isn't the punishment of god to be carried out till the seventh generation?This fateful, cursed and remorseless story is told to us with an avalanche of details that we just cannot stop reading - even though the story telling itself is slow - and we are torn open with compassion, empathy, remorse, sorrow and an ocean of love and hate for Caleb who is thus turned into a plaything in the hands of God. In fact this can expand to all the male characters and a little to the female characters who are few: Cathy/Kate who is the born and everlasting ever-regenerating doomster and doom-generator in human life; and Abra who is a promise who defines herself as bad, and that is a promise indeed.The last Cain-like son and brother, if he is really saved, is saved by the alliance of the Chink/Chinese/Charley Lee with Abra, a son who was a girl and who will be a wife since she cannot be a brother and that might break the mould of the curse. The final word will come from Adam and it will be \\"timshel\\" but will that mean freedom or just the introduction to the next Caleb - Abra cursed couple in line with producing the next generation of Cain and Abel, of doomed brothers? That we cannot know and I won't tell what I may think. I shall not tell and don't tell me to tell because I may do what I freely want to do, tell or not tell included.What is left to say after this long dissertation? Not much at all. John Steinbeck's style is his own and some sentences are hard to get because they contain quite a few dangling modifiers.This book is also the enlightenment that gives the meaning of later books like Of Mice and Men, the story of two disproportionate \\"brothers\\", the big one called Lennie Small being in the end killed by the little one called George Milton, a visionary name and person who was able to imagine and describe the promised land of a farm on which Lennie would have been happy and protected.And we are not surprised the dog Steinbeck will travel with at the end of his life was called Charley. The subservient loving friend that Lee was all along in this novel whose title is taken from Genesis, Chapter 4. And when Caleb is asked by his father at the end where his brother Aron is he naturally answers \\"Am I supposed to look after him?\\" an echo to Cain's answer to God's question in King James Bible or the American Standard Version : \\"I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?\\"This answer turns Adam into God himself since he is the one who asked the question: \\"Do you know where your brother is?\\"Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I love to read family sagas and that is basically what this book is about - the story of two families - the Hamiltons and the Trasks and the background of these families' story is mostly the Salina Valley in California. This book is partly based on the author's life, or more accurately, that of his maternal family (the Hamiltons); in fact, John Steinbeck narrates the story - he is Olive's son and Samuel Hamilton's grandson. I have also read (Oprah's Book Club) that Cathy's character is based loosely on his experiences with his second wife Gwyndolyn \\"Gwyn\\" Conger.This is primarily a book about brothers and their relationship - their rivalry, their love for each other and their guilt. It is a book about Cain and Abel and how the story is recounted time and time again throughout history.All in all, \\"East of Eden\\" is great \\"storytelling\\" and a fabulous book to read for leisure, but don't expect much more than pure fun out of it. Important characters are flat (but others are so wonderfully complex and rich - like Samuel Hamilton and Lee for instance!), and the story is very melodramatic and appeals too much to cheap sentimentality; that said, it is beautifully told and I highly recommend it.I wrote a more thorough review which you can read at my blog \\"52 Books in 52 Weeks - A personal quest to improve my writing in English.\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Giving this a 2 star because that is to mean \\"I did not like it\\" -- does not mean to report anything about what literary value this novel might have to others.I found this lengthy novel filled with cardboard characters, drawn in broad strokes, nothing nuanced or believable. The narrative voice did not appeal to me, at most times it was omniscient, seeing all that a particular character saw, thought and did. Then, randomly, a first person in the form of a cousin of some of the characters, dropped in and assumed the role of storyteller, only to disappear in short order. This provoked a skeptism of the narrative voice, which was difficult to overcome. Especially given that the narrative voice was repetitive, drawn to long passages of dialogue that seemed not at all like dialogue but more like lectures. And totally devoid of humor, wit or self-deprecation of any sort. Story teller took himself far too seriously, in my opinion.Plot was primarily a repetition of symbol after symbol, good vs evil, self torment unbounded. One driving issue for Steinbeck seeming to revolve around the translation of a verb included in one of the texts included in Old Testament. Great deal of weight given to whether the verb might give man the option of determining his own destiny, as opposed to the \\"Presbyterian\\" idea of pre-determination. So if you think you would like to spend 600 pages on this issue, and if you believe understanding man's destiny hinges on this translated verb from an ancient writer's text, then this is your book, I suppose."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is probably Steinbeck\\"s best work. I read it when I was 14 or 15 yeaars old and am now reading it again at age 50. My public library had an old yellowed copy which I could not read. Great book, read or read it again.

The characters were very fascinating and the story line easily fit many of the characters into the events naturally. Yet, in this day and age, there seems little astonishing about the book. The whorehouse and the description of Cathy/Kate are heard everyday from city life. I hear about more unusual lives from the morning news. Yes, I know unusualness was not the purpose of this book. It was written so that we can see how relationships, lies, and love affect the normal and abnormal person (if there is such a thing). Relationships become the corner stone of our lives and build us to our full potential or in some cases break us down to nothing. So, choose your friends and family wisely."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I just finished East of Eden by John Steinbeck, one of the greatest American novelists. Though it wasn't this novel that inspired Bruce Springsteen to write his father trilogy (Adam raised a Cain, Independence Day and my Father's House) it might as well have been the similarities are startling, both between the author and the singer as between the novel and the songs. Both Springsteen and Steinbeck are autodidacts when it comes to social and religious matters, both have been known to weave that subject matter into their works. The most pronounced link between Springsteen and Steinbeck might be Grapes of Wrath but East of Eden shows that Bruce attraction to Steinbeck is far from coincidental. In short the novel deals with the heritage of sin. Steinbeck modeled his novel to Genesis and especially to the story of Cain and Abel. The novel is a slow unraveling of a family drama over three generations, with the focus on the last two. It was his most ambitious yet controversial novel at the time. Although the novel works at various levels, the level of inter familiar relationships is where the relation to Springsteen's music strikes the clearest chord.In the centre of the novel is the upbringing of Cal(eb) and A(a)ron, the twin \\"sons\\" of Adam Trask. Their youth is plagued by the secret and sins of their parents. Unbeknownst to the twins their true father is Adam's brother Charles. Their mother, Kathy, they are told died at birth although in fact she rejected her marriage, her children and all that is good. Kathy ran of after giving birth to Salinas where she runs a brothel. When the oldest born, Cal, finds out he's is burdened by this. Cal feels his mother's sin in his blood, experiences it as something he barely can escape. \\"In the darkness of your room, your mother calls you by your true name, You remember the faces, the places, the names, You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain, Adam raised a Cain\\" Springsteen sings; \\"You inherit the sins, you inherit the flames\\", the song continues. Both the novel and the song pose a question. Is sin something we inherit out of the pain of our parents, is it in our blood, can we possibly escape the trappings our parent set for us.In the novel the question around the heritage of sin is discussed in length. Ironically it takes a Chinese servant, Lee, to shed some light on the case. Almost as if Steinbeck wants to tell us we need a foreign view to understand ourselves, to show us our trappings, to be our mirror. Thought Steinbeck might also have wanted to stress the universality the heritage of sin. Anybody who's ever read close into the Bible already knows that it's not free of contradiction and mystery, some of it spurns from translation as not all Hebrew let's itself easily translated in other languages. Steinbeck shows us through Lee that the whole notion of heritage of sin might be as a result of clumsy translation. In the King James Bible God promises Cain he'll conquer sin, where as in the American standard Bible Cain is commanded to rule over sin. \\"Thou shalt rule\\" or \\"Do thou rule\\", two translations, a world of difference. Both seem to imply we inherit sin, but the way we conquer sin differs. In the first God takes away our sin, in the second He commands us to stay free of sin. In both cases man is left without will. It has been decided for him what sin is and that it must be conquered, the only difference is who does it. God or man himself by command. The translation drives from the Hebrew \\"Timshel\\", more purely translated \\"Thou mayest\\", implying a far more open question, leaving it open for man if he'll recognize sin and if he'll conquer sin. Steinbeck in East of Eden radically reinterprets the Bible giving us free will and choice, close to making God irrelevant. If we have free will and choice, if we can decide for ourselves independently, God is no longer all powerful. Not only that, it means we can shake ourselves free from our heritage.This realisation is close to the understanding Springsteen reaches in Independence Day.\\"Well Papa go to bed now it's getting lateNothing we can say is gonna change anything nowI'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's GateWe wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehowCause the darkness of this house has got the best of usThere's a darkness in this town that's got us tooBut they can't touch me nowAnd you can't touch me nowThey ain't gonna do to meWhat I watched them do to you\\"In Independence Day is enclosed the realisation that the past cannot be chanced, it is something we carry with us and between us the rest of our (joint) lives. But Independence Day is also an affirmation of free will. In this song it seems that Springsteen no longer feels trapped in his heritage, he starts to make his own choices. The darkness can no longer touch him he exclaims and Springsteen decides on a different path as the one his father set out on or may have intended for him. The analogy is almost Biblical. Cast out of the Garden man set out on his own path making choices God neither intended nor wished for us but we have made with the free will installed in us.With the unravelling of the novel Steinbeck starts to focus more and more on Cal and his relationship to his father. Steinbeck lets Cal play out a question that troubled him in the Bible. Why would God take preference over Abel's offer, does God have preferences, does he love some more than others. Steinbeck also shows our basic human need for recognition, our need to be accepted as full individuals by our parents as he lets the triangular relationship between Cal, Aron and Adam unravel. In the novel Aron develops as character that seems to meet Adam's wishes and desires. Adam sees in Aron the son he wanted, in Cal he seems to see the negative no matter how hard he tries, in his mind affirming the Sin he must have inherited from his mother, affirming he's no good. Although Cal has declared his independence earlier in the novel, his hunger for recognition fails to die causing him to hate his brother and hurt him severely. When Cal asks for his father's forgiveness and acceptance on his dying bed Adam just says Timshel, he may give him that, leaving the question unresolved but also leaving the choice of acceptance and forgiveness with Cal. He is left to forgive himself, he is left to accept himself, he is left with his own choices for bad or good despite how his father may perceive him.A same kind of sentiment seems to breathe from \\"My Father's House\\", the song where Springsteen revisits his Father, looking for some closure but finding none. \\"My father's house shines hard and bright it stands like a beacon calling me in the night, Calling and calling, so cold and alone, Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned\\""},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I enjoyed Steinbeck's big novel. I once lived not far from Salinas and the feel of the land and people came back to me.The characters seem to live soap opera lives, though this novel could not have been faithfully filmed in 1952. Some of the language seems orotund, but Steinbeck is careful to put such talk in the mouths of exceptional \\"characters,\\" purposefully stylized to carry the novel's ideas. (I wish I knew men like Samuel and Lee.)Steinbeck's prose rarely draws attention to itself. You keep turning the pages because of the couplings, shootings, deaths and inspirations over three generations. I am uncertain if the casual style is to his credit. I think the book could have been better written, yet kept its commonplace language. But, how much can you change something before a new essence is created?That question goes to the heart of this book. From the outset you know this work is highly ambitious. Genesis contributes symbols and nudges themes. For most of my life, I have brooded over events and tried to track down their causes. Are things pre-ordained or is volition real? Do people have an immutable nature or does the warp and woof of becoming change their being? This argument continues to rage and one can find it beneath many disputes in biology, religion and politics. As I read through the novel, I kept a mental balance sheet to see how Steinbeck would ultimately apportion it. Would the mark of Cain be passed on or would sweet love and reason triumph?I am happy in the outcome. Neither side wins, but both remain on the field. It's an American ending from this most American of novelists."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"One of the most significant vignettes in this book appears in the opening to Chapter 13, wherein Steinbeck appropriately recognizes humans as our planet's sole creative species, and champions the concept of individuality.He wrote, \\"And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about. I can understand why a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind, for that is one thing which can by inspection destroy such a system. Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts. If the glory can be killed, we are lost.\\"This is part of the reason a book such as \\"East of Eden\\" will continue to be read for pleasure, for study and for enlightenment -- whereas some communistic political hack's ghost-written piecemeal autobiography is destined by its nature to be a mere flash in the pan, and nobody will ever read it again after she has departed the stage."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is the story of the everyman. It exemplifies the idea of good and bad living within one person, and the idea that doing the right thing is always a choice, a statement of free will. This idea is not professed by perfect people, as the perfectly evil and the perfectly good in the novel are the exceptions. Those who don't fit in, don't have the ability to understand the choice, perish by their own hands. This books is about the decendents of Cain, you and I. Flawed, but forgivible. After all, God did not kill Cain, but sent him into the world."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I thought the review below by bluejaye99 to be particularly interesting. I dont think Steinbeck is in the absolute top rank (with, say James or Faulkner or Twain) but he is a fine story teller who uses words much more fluidly than most American writers. Yes, this book has its clumsy parts, but it is easy to read and makes an impressive beach book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is not a story. Rather it is a collection of stories about semi-related events occurring over a period of about 50 years, which in and of itself would not be such a bad thing, but East of Eden is so long! The style of Steinbeck's prose is erratic at best which, again, wouldn't be so unpleasant if East of Eden weren't trying to pass itself off as a novel. The basis of the story's symbolism is evident from the first chapter, but Steinbeck doesn't stop there. He hammers his message home with a three ton sledgehammer that is about as subtle as a train wreck. For example, each generation in East of Eden has a Cain character and an Abel character, and Steinbeck dives relatively deep when he begins the name of the corresponding characters with a &quot;C&quot; and an &quot;A&quot;. That seems to be the limit of his subtlety as this bludgeoning draws slowly out over the torturous course of over seven hundred pages, finally grinding to a leadenly melodramatic finish. And yet, at the end of this gruelling road, the message is still frustratingly vague. The reader has suffered for nothing. The sporadic insertion of episodes totally unrelated to the rest of the book is reminiscent of bits of trash floating in a river of sludge from some factory's drain pipe. John Steinbeck is that factory, and in East of Eden he pumps out page after page of superficial writing. As Steinbeck would, were he writing this review, extend the metaphor beyond its use, one might even consider East of Eden a waste product from the creation of masterpieces such as The Grapes of Wrath and Tortilla Flat.I see that East of Eden might contain a modicum of interest for students of Steinbeck (I myself have researched the man and used this book to defend a thesis), but someone looking to become acquainted for the first time with the power that Steinbeck can wield would be better served by The Red Pony or one of the afore-mentioned alternatives."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I've crossed another classic off of my \\"to read\\" list, and boy am I happy I read this one. This was pure satisfaction from start to finish. John Steinbeck's East of Eden is an amazing book that embodies the intersection of literary weightiness and readability. There are plenty of epics out there that span generations: Colleen McCullough's The Thorn Birds or Isabel Allende's The House of the Spirits, for example. Those books are a joy to read and you can luxuriate in the authors' virtuosity as characters are added to weaving storylines, but East of Eden seemed to have more weight to it. Unlike many epics, which to thrive on love, unrequited or forbidden, Steinbeck's book focuses on the struggles of brothers seeking their father's admirmation. From the title alone, it is obvious that this notion is Biblical, and the book's Biblical quality becomes its center. For the first time in a very long time, I did not rush through the book's last chapters, eager to get to my next conquest. I felt that pang that you sometimes get when you finish a truly magnificent book, the pang that is part sadness at the experience of reading the book being over and part a feeling of that book permanently lodging itself in your memory to be drawn from and remembered with reverence. There are, I think, very few books that can produce this sublime reading experience, but East of Eden is on that short list."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Steinbeck has managed to carry a biblical idea into the future, taking everyday characters and bringing them to life with ancient tradition while allowing his readers to see the commoness of man through both good and evil doings.Not only is this book biblical in theory but it is biblical in proportion as well at 600 pages it is a testament to Steinbeck that he was able to sustain his idea for such a lengthy saga. I read the book voraciously and finished it within two weeks, a first for someone conducting a busy life. I will be forever haunted by the impressive characters I came to know so intimately in the pages of \\"East of Eden\\". Steinbeck mastered the art of transferring biblical characters into believable modern life, Adam and Eve, Moses, Cain and Abel etc... Steinbeck convinced me that all people hold within themselves a choice between good and evil and he further instilled in me the fact that I have a choice (timshel) to embark on whatever journey my soul so wishes. I once believed that evil stemmed from abuse or neglect but I am better able to realize now that evil sometimes is just inborn. Steinbeck's words make you question your own choices and prepare you to some extent for the outcome of those choices. Although a choice may seem easy today its repercussions can destroy you tomorrow.I am amazed how this novel can actually apply to the modern day accusations about American life as well. I highlighted one paragraph and will refer to it often when I am finding that I have become spoiled by this American way of life, \\"Lee went on, \`That's why I include myself. We all have that heritage, no matter what old land our fathers left. All colors and blends of Americans have somewhat the same tendencies. It's a breed-selected out by accident.

We're oversentimental and realistic. We are mundane and materialistic-and do you know of any other nation that acts for ideals? We eat too much. We have no taste, no sense of proportion. We throw our energy about like waste. In the old lands they say of us that we go from barbarism to decadence without intervening culture. Can it be that our critics have not the key or the language of our culture? That's what we are, Cal-all of us. You aren't very different\\" (Pg. 570). As I search for connection in the world, not just as an American, but also as a human this paragraph says it all. We are a wasteful, ambitious and free nation that tends to exaggerate our excess and ignore our contribution to other nations in this world out of habit and a sense of security. These luxuries are something we have a choice to share or misrepresent. I can only pray that the novel of our lives ends with as much compassion and insight as did Steinbeck's, \\"East of Eden\\"."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I hadn't read this book in years and years, so I just picked it up again recently. I have to admit, I didn't enjoy it as much the second time around. And it is not as good as &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot; Still, even though it is not Steinbeck's best, it is better than most books I have read in my life (were this by any other author, it probably would have gotten five stars). I thought the story was captivating, and I didn't want to stop reading. I just loved the characters, even though they are a bit one-dimensional. The book often alludes to the Bible, but don't worry about missing the hidden themes, Steinbeck lays them all out in the open. If I have one major complaint, it would be that the ending lacked drama. Other than that, this is Steinbeck at his near best."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I've read books by Steinbeck before this one. Actually, now that I think about, I read a quite a lot by him. But none of them hit me like &quot;East of Eden.&quot; I think he was truly at his best when he decided to write &quot;East of Eden.&quot; The characters are fascinating, and the way he seems to tie several different sub-plots together is absolutely amazing. His other books like &quot;The Pearl&quot; or &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; showed that he was a good author. But &quot;East of Eden&quot; shows that not only is he an extraordinary writer, he has gift for portraying human relationships skillfully. Truly, his use of character interactions is astounding. And each character is wonderfully full and complete, lending a multi-faceted quality to his book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I am a voracious and selective reader and recently decided to read this book as a departure from the contemporary novels I generally read. Steinbeck is a flawless writer! His powerful character sketches especially of Cathy (Kate), and interweaving of the families' complex and profound stories provoke visceral and lasting impressions. Steinbeck is hard to beat, in any era!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In East of Eden, Steinbeck craftily analyzes and challenges many aspects of human nature. He expressly voices a powerful message in 'Timshel', meaning that people hold the choice over their fate and over their defeats. Steinbeck conveys this idea passionately throughout the book as he represents the story of Cain and Abel between two generations of brothers. East of Eden rejoices in the human spirit and is made to inspire one in time of trial. Since Steinbeck portrays life where one can overcome defeat, he captivates people with the ability to triumph.Through compellingly lifelike characters, he constructs the human spirit and shapes them with infinite shades of darkness and virtue. Characters such as Sam Hamilton, Cathy Ames, and Lee are deployed to depict the free and inventive soul, reclusive guilt, austerity, and the influence of religion and human power. Steinbeck not only employs the characters with superficial features, but investigates these character's souls to communicate a deeper understanding of their nature. East of Eden's portrayal of human phsyche and universal philosophy is magnificently strewn and engrossing."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The bible is possibly one of the oldest and most read book in the world. There have been countless numbers of books based on biblical allusions, and \\"East of Eden\\" by John Steinbeck ranks top among the ones that I have read. The novel is a modernized re-creation of the story of Cain and Abel, two brothers in the Bible. Steinbeck incorporates the themes of this old biblical story to explore the truths of the human soul.The story details the layers of good and evil through the characters and relationships of the families of Adam Trask and Samuel Hamilton. Adam Trask is a man who, blinded by illusions and a lost within himself, travels to California with his beautiful, but insidious, prostitute wife. There he meets Samuel Hamilton, a man poor in money but wealthy in life. The novel chronicles the development and relationships of the two men, their families, and the people surrounding their lives. It is an excellent novel, for Steinbeck effectively integrates his message throughout the book.This is not a carefree, happy novel; rather, it is very dark as it explores the blacker areas of the human soul. Despite the foreboding mood and circumstances of the novel, Steinbeck manages to assert an uplifting message about the strength of human goodness and the perseverance of the human soul. Although the novel is fiction, he magnifies human nature through exaggerated circumstances. We may see a hidden part of ourselves, whether it is deceit on one occasion or jealousy on another, through the characters in the novel. We may also realize that the true message of the novel is indeed a very essential part of our lives. Perhaps this is why I feel that East of Eden is such an exceptional novel: not only does it bravely delve into an exploration of human morality, but it causes us to reflect on our own existence."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Forget the movie. It stinks. read the book instead. This is a wonderful book. I have heard people say that it is all symbolic and metaphorical, and not in the least realistic. That is not true. The background characters, such as Adam and Cathy, are certainly symbolic. I'll concede that. Adam is unable to bear evil, and in a sense, he is good, but he, in his goodness, is cruel to his son Cal by not accepting him for who he is and always comparing him unfavorably to his twin brother Aron. Cathy, who is a person completely lacking a conscience, to the point where she sees nothing wrong with incinerating her parents to steal their money. But she is still attracted to the &quot;good&quot; character of her son Aron, and tries to protect him from Cal. She recognizes that there is something about Aron that is admirable that she doesn't have. What she can't see is that Aron, like his father, can unintentionally be cruel. What Adam and Cathy represent is that good and evil is never complete-- Adam is evil because of his goodness, and even Cathy is not a complete monster. Now to Cal, who in my opinion is the main character. Is his rage realistic? As a twin, I think so. I don't want to kill my sister, but there are times when I wish she were dead. Or at least far away and out of my life. I don't want to be constantly compared to my sister, who gets better grades, who is nicer, who is more religious. I can understand Cal's rage, becuase I share in it. Poeple say they wish they had a twin, to share secrets, to have a best friend always there, etc. What they don't realize is that the bad part comes along with it. You can't get away from this person. You live in the same house, go to the same school, perhaps belong to the smae cicrle of friends. Soon, perhaps when you are about five years old or so, I'm serious, you want some time to be alone. And you can't find it. You want to be your own person, and you can't and you rage against the person who prevents that. You try to acoomplish something on your own. What else do you think Cal is doing when he invests in beans. But his father takes away his pride in that by saying he wasn't fair to the farmers, and again, compares him negatively to his brother. I have not yet had such a problem. But if I did, I know I would be so angry at my sister that I would want to hurt her as badly as I could. cal does that to Aron, when he shatters all of Aron's illusions about their mother, showing him that she is a murderer and the madam of a whorehouse. So don't say a book isn't realistic just becuase it is outside the range of your experience. Maybe it is part of someone else's experience. maybe you just don't understand. What amazes me most, is that Steinbeck, who wasn't a twin himself, understood. The man was a genius. Oh, as a side point, Steinbeck quotes a hebrew word from Genesis. Timshel. That is slightly incorect, as there is no such conjugation of (m,sh,l) The corect version is timshol. A slight difference, but notworthy to any hebrew speaker. It means that you, in the future, will conquer or rule [something] Steinbeck was pretty close."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Well, this particular title has certainly brought about some interest in a number of people. And I thought no one read the classics anymore...After writing my review I began reading the novel again, for at least the fourth time. There is one interesting passage early on dealing with the sanctity of the individual human spirit, and of the author's pledge to defend the individual's right to think freely, to the death if necessary. I found it odd, at first, that this passage was included at the particular point in the story, since the concept of choice and free will was not brought up until quite later. Given the fact that the novel was published at the height of the McCarthy era, however, it does make some sense. John Steinbeck, as it was taught to me, was considered only a minor master in the field of literature, certainly not the equal of Hemingway or Faulkner. I've always disagreed, and I have wondered to where this disparaging attitude among many academics can be traced. Not all of his novels were masterpieces. &quot;In Dubious Battle,&quot; while a great story, often reads like propaganda. Steinbeck fares better with stories such as &quot;Grapes of Wrath,&quot; &quot;East of Eden,&quot; and &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent,&quot; which present to the reader a much more balanced and ultimately more authentic take on human nature. He does, however, show some interesting weaknesses in his portrayal of female characters. Despite his flaws, Steinbeck was a compelling author, and certainly a voice of honesty. As was once stated, he &quot;had no mind to be an unoffending comforter and entertainer...&quot; And that from the Swedish Academy after presenting the author with the Nobel Prize in 1962. Certainly Steinbeck was no lightweight escape novelist."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"It was three years ago when I picked up this book for a way to pass the cold winter days in Virginia. Having come from a dysfunctional family, and fearing that I would be doomed to repeat the past of my family and after fearing that my mother would someday awaken within me, this book changed my life and my perspective on life and how I see it. It is the summation of many philoshical viewpoints on God and self-determination all rolled into one story. The story does take a while to pick up, but I am glad that I stuck with it. Anyone who sticks through it and allows Steinbeck to flesh out the meaning of his novel will be pleased with the end-result. It is a great lesson/message for anyone who has had difficult people in their families (who hasn't?)."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"As the title implies, East of Eden by John Steinbeck contains a plethora of biblical allusions. These allusions primarily stem from the first book of the bible Genesis as references range from Adam and Eve to Cain and Abel, even sometimes quoting the passages directly. The many parallels add interest to the novel as the reader is able to see the interesting interpretations presented by Steinbeck.While this book does maintain a great tie to the Bible, knowledge of the Bible is not required for one to enjoy this novel. Steinbeck's masterful intertwining plots along with his thought provoking style are engaging, creating a desire to continue reading. His writing is not immensely difficult to read, yet was dense in incite. East of Eden causes one to question aspects of one's own character, leaving an everlasting impression on one's way of life. East of Eden was truly a pleasure to read. ..."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This book is my all-time favorite book from my all-time favorite author. I read the first 175 pages towards the end of the eighth grade before giving it up for several months. This year, as a freshman, I read the rest of it and was blown away. It is a beautifully crafted piece about family, love, and human fate. It retells the story of the fall of Adam and Eve and the rivalry of Cain and Able in a way that shows the relevance of the story in todays time and the dangers of making your children live as you want them rather than as what they are. The Grapes of Wrath got more praise because of its' social applications but I feel that this is Steinbeck's finest novel.Timshel!"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I hadn't read John Steinbeck since high school but returned to him a year or so ago when our book group read his novel \\"The Winter of our Discontent.\\" Following that, I read several other Steinbeck novels and recently had the good luck to read \\"East of Eden.\\" It is admirable that Oprah Winfrey used this large, complex novel to present to her audience.Steinbeck wrote \\"East of Eden\\" in a burst of energy over several months in 1951. He loved this book among all his works and, literally, put himself into it. The first-person narrator of the story is, indeed, Steinbeck himself speaking in his own voice as a grandson of Samuel Hamilton, born in Ireland and a hero of this novel.Steinbeck said that he wrote \\"East of Eden\\" to tell \\"the story of my country and the story of me\\" to his two young sons in order to demonstrate \\"the greatest story of all -- the story of good and evil, of strength and weakness, of love and hate, of beauty and ugliness, how these doubles are inseparable.\\" For all its melodrama, length, sometimes black-and-white characterizations, and preachiness, the novel achieves its goals. I was transfixed by the book, couldn't put it down, and read it in a short time.The story includes the \\"doubles\\" to which Steinbeck refers as well as some others. The book is the story of two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks. It is the story of two Trask brothers, Adam and Charles, and of the two twin sons of Adam Trask and his wife Cathy -- Aron and Caleb. Both Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb replicate in their own ways the Bible story of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck gives this story a full, rabinnical exegisis as the reader sees the story of the conflict between good and evil play out in double over the course of the book.The Trask family and the Hamilton family are settlers in the Salinas Valley in Northern California. \\"East of Eden\\" develops a finse sense of place, and when I finished bhe book I felt I knew an area and its history that I have only in the most superficial manner seen myself. Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck's granfather, figures prominently in this book for his wisdom, his stoicism, his inventiveness, and his other - worldliness. His wife, Lisa, is also portrayed lovingly.Perhaps the most memorable character of the book is Cathy Trask who becomes \\"Kate\\" after she leaves Adam Trask and returns to the profession of prostitution in which she was engaged before her marriage. Steinbeck calls her a \\"monster\\" and well he might. The protrayal is striking and even nuanced at the end for all the starkness.Lee, a Chinese servant, is also well-portrayed for his fine mind, wisdom, tact, love of learning, and, ultimately, devotion to the Trasks and understanding of himself.This is a sweeping, dramatically told story which captures the land, the good and evil of which people are capable, and the importance of what in the Cain and Abel story is described by the Hebrews word \\"Timshel\\" with which Steinbeck concludes his novel. People have the capacity for both good and evil and the power for choice -- to understand the good and reject the evil. The story is told in a humanistic rather than a theological way.\\"East of Eden\\" is a memorable work of American literature that, as a result in part of Oprah Winfrey and her edition of the book, is receiving the attention it deserves."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I have to admit that I read this book because of the warm praises it received and how it touched so many lives. And...I have to agree.The book plays with the ultimate struggle with good and evil. Cathy, symbolizing Satan, looks for the evil in each person and tries to draw it out and exploit it. Steinbeck says, \\"And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\" Cathy has to continue to change. She changes her name and story constantly. After the murder of her parents and the shooting of her husband, she changes to Kate and becomes a prostitute in a whorehouse. This is the story of evil. Satan can always conceive new and creative ways to lure people to him and yet the evil always dies and is forgotten. On the other hand, virtue is remembered and honored from generation to generation. Samuel's teachings and philosophies are often relied on long after his death. Lee incorporates Samuel's teachings into his upraising of the Trask twins. Therefore, good always conquers in the end as it does in East of Eden. Cathy begins to realize reluctantly near the end of her life that the evil on which she thrived caused her downfall. She had trained herself never to trust anyone and in the end Cathy even began to doubt herself.The most obvious case of an internal struggle between good and evil is present in Cal, whom I feel I strongly relate too. As a child, he is aware that his light-haired brother is favored over him by nearly everyone. When Cal finally confronts his mother, he believes that Adam loves Aron more because he looks like Cathy. Cal's peers are scared of him and he has no friends. The first young girl that that twins meet is won by Aron. Cal often feels that he has no choice in his evil actions. He believes that his mother's blood that runs through his veins causes him to be bad. Most of Cal's evil actions are merely because of his desire for love and acceptance. \\"...everyone in the world to a large or small extent has felt rejection...and there is the story of mankind.\\" Cal has felt this rejection throughout his entire life. He knows that Abra favors Aron so he tricks the young girl to try to win her love. But underneath Cal's harsh appearance, is an earnest desire to live a good life. He has a genuine love for Aron and a desire to protect his weaker sibling. \\"In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love.\\" In Cal, one can see the entire story of mankind unfold-the search for love, the feeling of rejection and hopelessness, and finally the acceptance of one's individuality. Steinbeck successfully created a story that will endure for generations because of its truth and honesty of the story of mankind and our constant battle between good and evil."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I read this book back in November (2002) and was quit surprised when Oprah picked this masterpiece as the book that brought her club back... Even without Oprah's backing this is probably one of the GREATEST books I've ever read. You can't put the thing DOWN!In this story, which is loosly based on the book of Genesis insident between two brothers at war(Cain & Able), John Steinbeck gives a brutal examination of almost every nook and kranny of human nature: sex, love, betrayal, hypocrisy, greed, jealuosy, etc... and successfully weaves these elements into a heart wrenching tear-jerking story you'll always remember.This book is one of Steinbeck's most powerful novels since the Grapes of Wrath, and it's realism is POWERFUL enough to invoke a number of EMOTIONS in all of it readers. Buy it. You can't go wrong."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"What I want to know first is why, until now, no one had told me to read this book. If I could break the 5-star rule and give this book a 9-star rating, I would. It is currently, through the rose-colored glasses of my own perception and taste, the best book I have ever read. Steinbeck is my new favorite writer.For books of this caliber, it seems a waste to relate the story in some kind of abridged synopsis. When one says a book recently read was good, people tend to ask the question, \\"What's it about?\\" The better question for a book like this might be \\"What makes it good?\\" The first question forces the reader to relate the storyline like a plot-spoiling movie trailer. The second encourages the reader to explain why the story is worth reading while preserving the integrity of the book. After all, the purpose of the book is just that--to relate the story.I believe that good books entertain you, better books teach you, but great books inspire you. This book does all three. It is an ornate and cogent poem of a novel--relational, affecting, captivating. Every other sentence is profound. Steinbeck wastes no words. There is no filler--though the book is 600 pages--and not once did I feel as though I were working to get through it. The writing is absorbing and the content stirring, heart and mind.For the first time in a long career of novel consumption, I did not binge on this book. It was so spectacular that I forced myself to moderate how much I read in a sitting. This is a filet mignon of a novel. Read it. Savor it. Tell someone else to do the same."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When i first read &quot;East of Eden&quot; back in 1986 I remember my teacher telling the class that we had 3 weeks to read the book and have a book report ready to discuss during week 4. Then the teacher handed out the books and the class started making noises, ie...moan, no, oh. The book was as fat as the phone book and look/sounded &quot;B&quot; boring.I began reading East of Eden the following day. I remember it was Friday night and I had just finished watching tv and wanted to start reading this boring book to see what non-sense I was in for. The first chapter grabbed me and wouldn't let go. The story is very realistic and has great character development. I'm not going to talk about the story because there is too much to talk about, but it plays on a lot of emotions and it will make you use your imagination, much like you/we did when we were children.Thanks John...You will always be remembered for this great classic novel.P.S. some literary boneheads/stuffy people ( you know who you are) disliked this story, but for those of us who like jam on our toast (not dry) you will like it.....Daniel"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden was originally published in 1952, and the setting for the novel is the late 19th and early 20th century. I still enjoyed reading East of Eden though, because there are timeless themes presented in this book. Sibling rivalry, guilt, and betrayal are some of the main themes in this book. It was ironic and interesting to read how 2 sets of brothers from different generations compete for the approval and love of their father.There are many memorable characters with strong personalities in East of Eden. I loved the complex character of Cathy. She is a whore who shoots her husband and abandons her family. This incident leaves her husband Adam shattered and confused in the beginning of the story. I loved how Adam becomes a stronger person and a better father later in the book. I loved the supporting character named Lee in this novel. He is a loyal servant to the patriarch Adam Trask. He is also the primary caretaker to Adam Trask's sons Caleb and Aron.I loved reading about the development of the characters especially the twins Caleb and Aron. Caleb is the curious, brave, independent, strong willed sibling who has dark thoughts. His brother Aron is the sensitive, studious one. The contrast between their personalities is very interesting. The most intense part of the book is when Caleb learns of the existence of his mother and confronts her.East of Eden becomes a very predictable book about a third of the way in, but it is still a wonderfully written book. I simply loved the evolution of the characters especially Adam. East of Eden has themes of sibling rivalry, guilt, betrayal, loss, and the American dream of getting ahead and raising a family that are still relevant in society today. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I chose to read this book for my high school's required reading. It was a great decision.Though this book goes slowly (took me a week to read), it doesn't feel slow. Steinbeck's lavish descriptions of the lush California transport me there.But this book isn't meant to revolve around the plot. The characters drive the plot, not the other way around. I agree that the many of the characters are hard to relate to, but I can understand them. From the most evil character, Cathy, to nice guy Sam Hamilton, I could see why they chose to commit each action. The youngest characters in the book, Abra, Aron, and Cal, are easier to relate to by teenagers such as myself.Though this book was written half a century ago, the themes are timeless. There is the battle between good and evil, which encompasses sub themes like jealousy.Overall, this is a book that's worth your time."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"When I read this book, it launched me on a personal goal to read all of his novels. I have completed almost all of them and anticipate re-reading them all over again!He has personally inspired me to appreciate the beautiful lands of California's Salinas Valley and Monterey. The history of the valley and coast is widely recognized because of the stories and novels by Mr. Steinbeck. He publicized their unique problems in a literary format widely received and applauded at the time. It is obvious that by the endorsement of Oprah's book club, his writings are as fresh and pertinent as ever._East of Eden_ is a powerful novel spanning generations and focusing on two brothers, Adam and Charles. As profiled in the editorial review, the family dynamics becomes incredibly complicated. This complication is the facilitator of future difficulties and the impetus of a great story you should not miss.His novels struck a chord in many people, myself included. Each one of his books propelled me forward to read another, and another.

From my school years I am familiar with his \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" and \\"The Pearl,\\" but that just scratches the surface of the 27 novels written by this Pulitzer Prize winner. I've set myself a goal to read my way through his creativity, and this book so far is my favorite of his. In fact, it might be one of the best books I have ever read. It is a book that is magnificent in scope, beginning with a strong reference to Cain and Abel from \\"The Bible,\\" to covering the United States from east to west, mostly focusing on the Salinas Valley in California. It's basically the story of two families: the Trasks and the Hamiltons (Steinbeck's ancestors; he even appears as a minor character); and the two opposites: good and evil. From whorehouses to family farms, Steinbeck has covered a lot of ground in these 600 plus pages as he writes with deep feeling, strength, and brutality. One short section on how to start and drive a pre-World War I automobile is magnificence in a nutshell. Steinbeck believed that this was his greatest work, and with ample justification."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"story totally wraps you up and changes what you think about appearances. writing style is amazing and paints such an amazing picture. incredibly impactful story"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A brilliant story told with passionate prose. I couldn't put it down. The characters are so deep and so strong and so seductive in their musings, madness, and greed that I had to know what they were going to do next. And Steinbeck does not dissapoint."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is well-written book, a classic deemed worthy of reading. Steinbeck does a great job of making the piece of literature entertaining. I felt glued to the book many times because the plot would be wonderfully constructed, leading readers on an adventurous journey through the lives of the characters in the Salinas Valley.What surprised me the most were the characters in the story. Each individual character had his or her own unique personality. Each person seemed real and true to life. I would be going through the book and start saying to myself \\"oh this character reminds me of so and so.\\" Plus, the characters are dynamic and many of their personalities are not at the extremes, but instead they have both the good qualities and bad qualities of mankind. I love how I can read into each character and judge him or her through his or her actions. The subtlety in revealing the motives behind each character was astonishing. The way Steinbeck depicted the characters through their dialogue and actions was overwhelming as I soon developed my personal opinion on each character. It made me feel like I was involved in the story itself.Adding to the amazing characters is in intricate, well-developed story line. The plot was complex in that there were many subplots running through the main action. However, when I was reading, the complexity of the story did not hinder my progression because everything seemed to flow. The story was being pieced together in a rhythmic fashion as one event leads to another. The biblical allusion to Cain and Abel was also a fun thing to locate. After reading the story of Cain and Abel, I would go through the East of Eden and get excited when I would notice the similarity or the differences between East of Eden and the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck truly does a fascinating job of weaving his story together.Although the book is rather long, the wonderful characters and amazing plot line makes up for it ten times over. East of Eden makes you appreciate good writing."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is truly a work of art. It is much more than a story about two families; in fact it is a sin to call it one. The story explores concepts that are rooted within every family: love, hate, jealousy.Drawing on the book of Genesis and the story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck creatively weaves a tapestry of the interaction of two familial generations. Much of the story is devoted to explain the brotherly struggles between Charles and Adam (first generation) and Caleb and Aron (second generation).The interactions between the characters are quite amusing, as each pair of brothers try to outdo one another in order to gain their father's love. However, in both cases, the father reluctantly favors the one with an \`A' (Adam/Aron).To say East of Eden as one of the best books ever written would be an understatement. It is much more than a book; it is a story of life. Don't let its length throw you off, every single page is worth it."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I really am not sure how I should review this book. East of Eden is mind blowing. It is, without a doubt, Steinbeck's greatest creation. I have not read all of the Steinbeck canon but I have read enough of his major works to know that this tops them all.You'll hear everyone throwing around stuff like \\"retelling of Cain and Abel\\" but that is misleading. Yes, it *is* a retelling of Cain and Abel (twice, actually) but it is so much more than that. Don't constrict your enjoyment of this book based on its parallels. Take it for what it is. It's a magnificent epic story that has some of the deepest characters in American literature. As an example, Kate is one of the most evil characters I've ever read, but she's not just a cardboard character that generally represents evil. Underneath her vile loathsome exterior you can catch the stirrings of a great conflict within her, a desperate desire for love. But Steinbeck doesn't spell it out for you. He doesn't plop it in your lap and say, \\"Think this now about this character.\\" He let's you figure it out. He lets you fill in the blanks. And it's not always too easy to figure out. Don't expect a facile read. But don't expect a boring read either. I never wanted to put this book down.John Steinbeck's characters are amazing. That is his charm. Nobody is all good or all evil, nobody is unconflicted, nobody is always a certain way. And isn't that how we are in real life? \\"East of Eden\\" has characters that are so real that they almost seem unreal. It's not until one looks deeper within the characters that one sees that what a character says isn't always what he means, or that what a character does is not always what he wants to do, etcetera.This book is absolutely mandatory for anyone who calls themself a Steinbeck fan. This book is mandatory for anyone who claims to be a lover of American literature. I would suggest this book to aspiring authors and even actors and directors to get insight into real characters, developed characters, characters that are so human that they don't make sense sometimes.Anyway, read this book. It's worth all 600 pages and then some."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This and \\"Of mice and men\\" have made me a total Steinbeck nut. Im serious, this guy can write! Timshel, I will never forget that word. I really wont, and anyone thats ever read the book will know exactly what Im talking about. I picked this book up after reading \\"of mice and men\\" which totally blew me away, not much caring for the prostituted OPRAH label on it, but because the title was intriguing. It centers in around the themes of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel, not in a religious sense but in more of a human kind form of looking at life. The defects of life and society are portrayed to a point where you really gotta sit back and think for a bit. I loved the characters too. I really felt like i Knew Sam hamilton. I loved it. Pick it up. Its a keeper."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Detailing the intertwining stories of the Trask and Hamilton family, John Steinbeck weaves an amazing story of the many aspects of life. Steinbeck chronicles the development of the Hamilton and the two generations of the Trask family, providing a thorough outlook on life as seen through the characters. Although the volume of the book is daunting, the chronology of events is extremely interesting and enjoyable to read.The first installment of the story centers around the development of the Trask family and the relationship between brothers Charles and Adam Trask, covering a variety of themes that are common to daily life. Charles is extremely competitive and constantly seeks to prove his physical prowess by defeating Adam in matches of ability. Adam, on the other hand, tries to escape his brother's anger by letting Charles take the upper hand, but arouses Charles's jealousy when he wins their father's attention. Charles however, loves his brother, but is incapable of expressing this affection, an issue common amongst siblings. The theme of sibling relationship and rivalry is present in these early chapters of the book, along with motifs of jealousy and love.As the story progresses, Adam falls in lust with Cathy, a beautiful and manipulative girl, quickly advancing the plot. Cathy epitomizes evil as she uses her beauty to her benefit. Upon the birth of their two sons Cal and Aron, Cathy abandons Adam and leaves him to sulk about the house. However, their Chinese servant, Lee assumes responsibility of caring for Cal and Aron, and helping Adam get back on his feet. Throughout the incident, Adam and Lee develop a relationship with and receive help from the Hamilton family, who are of Irish descent, and thus intertwining the two families.In the second installment of the book, Steinbeck chronicles the growth of the second Trask generation, Cal and Aron, who are replicated after the figures of Cain and Abel in the bible. While Aron receives praise and revel in the love and attention of those around him, Cal is enshrouded in his brother's shadow and grows dark and mysterious. However, the progression of events accompanies dramatic changes within each character, emphasizing themes of dark and light and the affection between brothers. The intricate plot makes the book a great choice for those seeking high quality writing and a great read."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I agree with other reviewers who said this was a life-changing novel. In my estimation, this novel is second only to \\"Gone With The Wind\\" in terms of excellence. John Steinbeck has created characters that somehow never quite leave you, and a story that keeps you enthralled long after you have finished the novel. If you are interested in seeing the movie, rent the 1981 remake with Jane Seymour, Timothy Bottoms, etc. Although it seems a sacrilege to say it as the great James Dean was in the original, the remake is much better. It follows the book faithfully and is able to explore themes that could not be explored in the 1950s. Jane Seymour, at the height of her beauty, is utterly believable as the evil Kathy."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a true classic in every sense of the word. My book club read it a few years ago (before Oprah announced it as her pick). This is a must read for everybody. To me, it is about how decieving people can be, and how many people seem to be born good or evil. The story is absolutely riveting. I never read ahead in my book club, as we meet every week and agree on a certain stopping place, but I just could not put it down, and finished the entire book in a few days."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A partially autobiographical tale of Steinbeck's own family, EAST OF EDEN is also a re-telling of the biblical tale of Cain and Abel. Two brothers' lives split because of an evil and calculating woman who in turn gives birth to two boys who must face up to their past and find their true natures. One of the finest novels I've read, and one deservedly receiving its just due, at last."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Always reading classics for fun or school, I get really excited when I read a book as phenomenal as this one.The thing that made this book stand out the most to me was what I saw as a magical aura about many of the characters. They all (Adam, Catherine, Lee, Sam Hamilton) have very exaggerated traits that bring out all sorts of facets of humanity. Innocence, evil, rash, thoughtful, acceptance, love, hate--to me, each character seemed to explore one (or more) of those. I felt like I was playing in somebody's head as he went through life.Couple that with the vivid, gorgeous writing, the scenery that Steinbeck evokes of Salinas, and you've got a great book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"First, a large disclaimer. I have become a Steinbeck zealot over this past year and have found all of his work fascinating. I have always gotten to the end of one of his books and wished for more. And the same holds true for this tome, despite its great length, and as in all of his other books, I feel as if I personally know many of the characters and think of them as acquaintances.Plot review: As has been mentioned in other reviews, this is supposed to be a metaphor for Cain and Abel, but it is much more than that. Steinbeck weaves in the philosophy of choosing your own destiny as opposed to accepting your fate, as told in the book of Genesis. To do this, he weaves together many stories of families and does a masterful job of describing the good and evil found in people.Why I liked this book so much: The characters! I wish that I was as powerful with the pen as Steinbeck is so I could properly gush over them. For example --Kate: is the most vile, evil woman I have ever encountered in literature. And not because she is hateful, but because she is totally devoid of any scruples or feeling and only seeks her own gain. She is manipulative and cold and puts on the appropriate facade for whatever it is she is trying to accomplish. She also recognizes the intelligence in her adversary, and strongly dislikes those who see through her facade.Samuel: One of the jolliest, wisest, and most inventive characters you could ever hope to meet. He recognizes his strengths and weaknesses, and he has a thirst for knowledge that is enviable.Lee: The servant who is actually the cornerstone of the main character's family. A wise and learned man who can pretty much do anything he puts his mind to and keeps the family afloat when Adam dulls his senses to the world.These characters all play second fiddle in the Cain/Abel story to Adam, Cal, and Aron, but they are the stars of the show in my eyes.The book does lose its way for a little while, in my mind, when Steinbeck spends alot of time describing the Hamilton family. This part did not add much to the story to me, but I understand he was trying to describe people from his own family in this part. This part is the only reason I rated the book 4 *s instead of 5, and is but a small detractor.This book will cause you to philosophize about choices in your own life, and the characters will possibly cause you to become as much of a Steinbeck addict as I have become."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"If you have never read another Steinbeck, try this one. It is perhaps his best work, but alas, all of his work is breathtaking. One of my favorites."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is a phenomenal novel. The crowning achievement of Steinbeck's lexicon of inspired work. The book is operatic, pondering the burden of free will and spanning generations of a family that constantly struggles to escape itself. It is fully American, fully human, and fully a religious experience. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to be moved, inspired, and find their new favorite book."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This is the best book I've read so far. Steinbeck is amazing at drawing you into the story. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"I usually do not read the comments of fellow reviewers at this site (or, in some cases, at least not until after I have written my own). I was, however,interested in finding out whether Steinbeck and his tale still held interest for today's readers. The answer seems to be yes. Moreover, I was also interested in what other people had to say about the symbolic nature of the clash between brothers and its relationship to the old oft-told biblical tales going back to the \`first family'.Damn, life has definitely been tougher since the \`fall' from the garden. The morale to be derived from Steinbeck's novel is, apparently, that while the \`fall of man' under the spell of earthly temptations had its downside humankind is better for the struggle. A strong argument can moreover be made that without that struggle by fallen humankind no serious progress would have been made. That struggle here is epitomized by the characters, tensions and actions of the two brothers (in both generations father Adam's and son Aron's) which makes me believe that that Steinbeck may see this process an eternal struggle and that we are endlessly doomed to roll that rock up the hill just to have it come crashing back down on us.Those who have only seen the 1950's movie version of this novel starring, among others, James Dean and a young Julie Harris have missed some great writing about the effects of the struggle to rebuilt and attempts at redemption in the wake of the fall of Adam Trask and his struggle to change his ways. And through him, his sons. The movie (that I had seen long before reading the book) skips over the compelling first section which deals with the seemingly pre-ordained destruction of Adam, by his \`wife', and his own character, among others. Moreover, in the movie the demonic role of the \`wife' Kathy is glossed over (probably due to the less tolerate and more squeamish mores about \`fallen women' in the 1950's). She is not a \`nice' person. However, in the book she is positvely evil. Read the book and see why we, even the best of us, are all living just East of Eden."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"A book that should be slowly savored to the very end."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East of Eden is truly a novel of biblical proportions. Set in the Salinas Valley of California, where Steinbeck himself grew up, the story follows two generations of the Trask family, the main one consisting of Adam, his two sons Cal and Aron, and their servant Lee. When reading this epic piece of literature, I found myself immersed in the struggles, triumphs, and emotional battles of the characters, who are so thoroughly developed, I felt somewhat connected to them. There is no doubt that the story claims its grand renown predominantly through Steinbeck's ability to capture every facet of human emotion within his characters. They are intriguing, witty, flawed, unfathomable--the exact qualities that make them stand out as so real.What is also interesting about East of Eden is that it not only parallels the story of Cain and Abel, but it explores it in greater depth, exposing the emotions and thoughts of Cal and Aron. This book is all about relationships--the main one being sibling rivalry, a competition between the sons for the father's love and approval. Steinbeck does the story of Cain and Abel justice through his captivating presentation of the classic tale, showing one son who is seemingly perfect, and the other son who finds it difficult to achieve love.This story contains all the elements of a masterpiece: dramatic plot, round characters, intricate relationships, honest writing, and numerous messages about life.I recommend this book to everyone who is literate."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"In what is truly a masterpiece on many levels, John Steinbeck delivers with East of Eden a compelling tale of two families whose lives in the Salinas Valley are fascinating and seemingly intertwined. This novel began as merely a required piece for school, but as I read on, I found myself unable to put it down, often reading late into the night. The characters are realistic and masterfully tied together, their lives tied together, as if by fate. The plot provokes the mind, raising philosophical questions that opened to me different ways to view the world and choices in life. Steinbeck's story-telling is simply wondrous, saturating the novel with detailed descriptions and narration. The fact that this is the centennial edition, still wildly popular and discussed more than a hundred years after it was written, is testament to the allure of the novel. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of age, as it is an exploration of some of the most important ideals in our society. Steinbeck even stores the essence of the 601 pages into one word- thimshel, a word as important and essential to the story as carpe diem is to Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society, both tales that have enabled me to view the world in a different light, and help me become a better person as a whole."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"The book is true to its title as its inner plots follow that of biblical stories of Cain and Abel, Adam and Eve and Jezebel.Now don't be discouraged. This book is full of shocking moments that will beg you to not stop reading, which is good because the book is very long. Each page will keep you wanting more as you strive to understand the connections between the bible and this book seemingly filled with evil characters whose only intentions are murdering their loved ones.Watch as the lives of several different families become connected and good and evil switch bodies. Everything that you thought was true in the beginning begins to take a path much more different than you ever though it would.Who is good and who is evil?Who will ultimately win?These questions also help to outline the major struggle in the book over being good or evil. Some are born with evil already buried deep inside them and others must choose for themselves whether they will be evil or choose to be good. The word \\"timshel\\" or \\"thou mayest\\" takes on new meanings and becomes the center of the story as it lets the characters know that they do have a say in their lives. They choose their own destinies and can decide that they will not be evil, even if they feel that everything else in the world is making them so. They have the final decision, not anything else in the world. What are your choices?"},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"This riveting novel is a must read for anyone, let alone a Steinbeck afficionado. The many twists and turns in the intertwining plot(s) of this novel require much attentiveness to track and piece together. Reading this novel is an adventure in itself, as Steinbeck lays out the pieces of the plot of his novel thoughtfully and carefully reveals them one at a time to create a linking time puzzle that only gets more compelling as the pages go by.Steinbeck's diction is strong and although the plot is slow to unravel, the book picks up speed after the first segment that lays the foundation for the rest of the novel. Every page nonetheless offers something interesting and captures both your attention and your wit. This is a novel that you would definitely call \\"smart,\\" as it takes pondering to finally piece together the final meaning of the book.Without a doubt, this novel will leave you thinking, \\"Wow, I would of never thought of it ending like that.\\" For any reader who appreciates fine writing, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"East Of Eden is a remarkable novel surrounding family and love written by John Steinbeck. Despite its intimidating size and thickness, the book is actually quite enjoyable and entertaining. The book presents an astounding story filled with episodes of love, despair and family. Steinbeck molds the novel to resemble the different situations found in the Genesis of the Bible: the tale of Adam and Eve and the rivalry between Cain and Abel.In this novel, Steinbeck follows the traditional story of a tragic hero alongside his sidekick battling against the evil nemesis. Adam Trask, son of the former Cyrus Trask, finds himself passively living life and attempts to find a way to grasp the days as they progress by. He searches for an essence of life and finds Cathy, whose role is the apparent antagonist of the novel. As Adam is heartlessly abandoned with his twin sons Caleb and Aron, his Chinese servant Lee helps to provide for all of them until Adam, especially, can fully recover. Lee, in my opinion, serves as the essence that Adam has been looking for, the sidekick that heroes need. While Adam drowns in desolation, it is Lee who fosters the children and tends to everybody's needs. Though he has aspirations of his own, he consistently delays them in order to take care of the Trask family.Cathy is immediately labeled as the villain through Steinbeck's dramatic descriptions of her manipulative dark side. Yet Adam was completely oblivious to her deceit that he would have done anything to please her. She eventually abandons him, leaving him hopeless and miserable. This situation alludes to the Bible as Eve betrays Adam after she bites from the forbidden apple. Both women prove to be unfaithful and bring sorrow to their lover's lives.The confusing yet deep rivalry between Caleb and Aron are almost identical to that of the Bible between Cain and Abel. As one is seemingly treated with more recognition and admiration, the other becomes envious and ultimately homicidal. Though in this particular book, Caleb is not at fault for Aron's death, Caleb senses guilt from it and blames himself nonetheless. While in the Bible, Cain deliberately kills Abel as revenge for his mistreatment from God. Ultimately Cain is punished but Caleb also finds peace within himself to not put himself at blame.The immense effect as this captivating novel ties together is just incredible. Each story, each family, each relationship depicts those of real life, which also appeals to the readers. Steinbeck concludes the entire story with the term \\"Timshel\\" as a blessing from Adam to his son. Ending on such a melancholy yet perfected note simply enhances the overall effect the reader gets as the book is closed."},{"Title":"East of Eden","review":"Unfortunately not my style.

Hard to argue with that, although Grapes of Wrath, and &#34;Of Mice and Men&#34; are also terrific. An astute observer of how flawed we all are, Steinbeck shows there is hope for us if we choose to make the struggle.

Steinbeck used Genesis and the story of Cain and Abel as a setting for the characters in this novel. It is amazing the magnitude of abuse a parent can thrust on a child, how a child can endure that abuse, then end up being horribly abused by a spouse who also had no maternal instinct or feelings whatsoever for their children. Her lack of any emotion at all except hate almost makes Cathy inhuman, an evil presence that those around her feel, but can't quite put their finger on what is different about her.

Not many, I'm afraid--this seven-book cycle will turn out to be more than 1/4 of the annual GSTP (Gross Star Trek Product), and that's not counting other multi-book series within the Trek universe this year. It's a tendency towards grandiosity that's a step away from the old fashioned &quot;space opera&quot; format that made Trek the 35-year phenomenon which transcended the vast wasteland of TV where it has its roots--where boredom operates at tachyon speed. Okay, this book has a lot of the aspects that made TNG a success. Like Picard doing his usual thing of gaining the respect of cultures who think the Ferderation is otherwise populated by wusses. This trait in Picard makes him (don't you dare call me disloyal to Kirk!) the best skipper any Enterprise has ever had. We get to see Troi successfully command a ship in battle--being that I'm an admirer of hers, I like to see this strong but delightfully feminine woman get to prove she's more than just a shrink. And I get a kick out of watching her daddy's girl/ doting papa relationship with Picard. Worf shines here as a Federation statesman worthy of a Kissinger or Lodge--I like seeing him as more than just a skillful pair of hands with the bat'leth. But this whole idea of (blaring trumpet fanfare) &quot;major sagas&quot; is not what Star Trek is all about--why not leave that to descendants of Frank Herbert? Followers of Herbert and other &quot;highbrow&quot; SF have always sneered at Trek as being lightweight. Fine--I think of them as elitists and pseudo-intellectuals, got that? I've been a member of the Trek fanbase for all 35 years it's been around--why don't the people back in the real-life Trek Aitch-Cue listen to us like they used to. No more huge sagas! No more huge sagas! No more huge sagas! Or at least fewer of them, okay?"},{"Title":"Doors into Chaos (Star Trek The Next Generation: Gateways, Book 3)","review":"I have to agree that this trend toward series of books going through all the &quot;Treks&quot; is annoying. I have tended to not buy them even though I have a huge Star Trek book collection. I am a ST:TNG fan and do not enjoy reading the other series books as much. It seems like the publisher is trying to force me to read them in order to make sense of any single title.I understand the marketing strategies here but I wish there were more stand alone titles in any single Trek series. Making me wait 6-8 months for a new title leaves me looking for other types of reading material and not Trek.This book is okay but is a little to confusing for most of us.

I know about myself that I am a little picky about this sort of thing, so I try to forgive the first few typos and other similar errors I see in any given book, but this was a mess. There were run-on sentences I wouldn't have gotten away with in the sixth grade, sentence fragments that didn't even make sense, and commas run amok. Yow. It was so irritating I even stopped reading the story in the middle to email the publisher to complain, and it's not all that often I willingly put down a book midway. So. If you are willing to tolerate these errors (or wait til they get around to fixing them in another printing, perhaps?), it's a decent story, and it does start to make sense of the set of books, between which I had previously not seen the relationship, and it does have the advantage of being a Star Trek book. Your call."},{"Title":"Doors into Chaos (Star Trek The Next Generation: Gateways, Book 3)","review":"Of the five I've read (excluding Challenger), this was the most disappointing Gateways book. I am a huge TNG fan, but this book was very slow.I enjoyed Troi as Captain, but that was about it. And the crew of her ship had some personality.This book and the Deep Space 9 version, were the most integrated of the Gateways series. Between the two, most of the Gateways story is told, prior to the conclusion in book 7 and you will definitely want to read the conclusion. If you like a series, read these two for sure. You may not need to read Voyager, or New Frontier. If you don't like a series, these are the two to avoid. See my review on the others."},{"Title":"Doors into Chaos (Star Trek The Next Generation: Gateways, Book 3)","review":"I had heard in reviews of some of the other Gateways books that this might be the best of the series. That turned out to be not the case. As all these Gateways books, this one lacks an ending, so I deduct a star for that. I would have given the book only two stars anyway, so its down to one.The first half of the book is dreadfully boring. Characterizations are superficial, and everytime the author built even a little momentum he immediately snuffed it out with his little vignettes that were supposed to prove how much trouble the Gateways were causing. I found the vignettes to be mostly highly unlikely, and also just as boring as the rest of the first half of the book.In the second half of the book we have Picard and other ships from some other races encountering the Iconian fleet. At this point the book went completely haywire. A space battle was obviously being thought of by the author as if it was being fought in a gravity well, when it was not. The actions of the \\"Iconians\\" before, during, and after the battle made no sense within the framework of either the series, or even this book. The characterizations of the Enterprise characters we know so well were unbelievably bungled. In what may have been only a lull in combat, and in obvious Red Alert status, the author has Picard retiring alone to his ready room to consume tea and a scone, and is wishing he could comfort himself by playing his little flute. REALLY?? Just absurd. Little senseless tidbits like this dot the second half of the book. The author forgets things like how many ships have been destroyed in the battle. The \\"Iconians\\" start with 63 ships, lose several, and magically, after the battle, still have 63 ships. Any record of Kirk having encountered these aliens in their natural form at the end of Gateways Book 1 is evidently lost and long forgotten, although many other facts about that mission are referenced on several occassions.It is hard to maintain interest in a book that the author couldn't even pay proper attention to as he wrote it.If I had not read the other books of this series, I would absolutely have put this useless effort down FAR, FAR before I suffered to the wretched end of it. All of these books are flawed, some very badly, and after having now read through them all, I cannot really recommend that anyone undertake reading this series."},{"Title":"Doors into Chaos (Star Trek The Next Generation: Gateways, Book 3)","review":"This is a well-written book with good characterizations, good pacing, and excellent action.

And of those the TNG book is easily the best of the series. Yes it does start out a tad slow, but to me this building of the story is what makes it so great. The author goes out of his way to make sure you completely understand the seriousness of the gateway situation. I also enjoyed the fact that this one had several different things happening all at once with the crew basically split up to accomplish the goal.In addition I liked the nod to Voyager with the Nyrians that were lost in the Alpha Quadrant.The purpose for my title &quot;There's Something About TNG&quot; is that when it comes to book series that span them all TNG seems to get the best stories. I also enjoyed TNG's Section 31 book the best of the Section 31 series."},{"Title":"Doors into Chaos (Star Trek The Next Generation: Gateways, Book 3)","review":"Anyone who's pooh-poohing the &quot;Gateways&quot; series just ain't paying attention! This is the best so far, and I'm not quick to give out the kudos for series. In fact, for the most part, I hate 'em - but Gateways grabbed me, and Robert's TNG installment is simply a fabulous cog on a great big wonderful wheel.I'll admit I was lost at first as to what the heck was going on, but once I understood that different races had already been approached by the, uh, Iconians, about purchasing the gateways tech, I immediately understood the reason why Picard and his mighty ship was summoned to the task of organizing everyone into a united front to meet with the Iconians.What follows is not quite united but certainly surprising, and full of enough references to just about everything TNG Trek that's gone before to cause me to rush to my tapes! Robert Greenberger is just plain amazing in this capacity, and I'm betting he had it all in his own little head.Add to that Troi's successful stint as captain and loads of Riker/Troi not-so-subtext, and you've got what amounts to - not to put too fine a point on it - a GREAT read.And yup, this one ends with a go-through-the-gateway cliffhanger set to finish in Book Seven of the series, &quot;What Lay Beyond.&quot; And who else goes through but our great Iconian master, Jean-Luc Picard. Much, much too much fun."},{"Title":"Doors into Chaos (Star Trek The Next Generation: Gateways, Book 3)","review":"As my review title suggest this one for me was the best so far. But book 4 is turning out to be just as good and maybe even better. I have to finish to be sure. Book one and especially two were major disappointments. Two was confusing!!! I know most people haven't rated this book well but the story was to me a lot easier to follow compared to book 2 and the characters much more realistic to the Star Trek universe.There are many references to past episodes even to other Trek books that blend in wonderfully. The story helps advance major story lines that belong to other series too. I also enjoyed the many species that are involved and for me well written. It was great to read this book and reminded me why I like TNG so much."},{"Title":"Doors into Chaos (Star Trek The Next Generation: Gateways, Book 3)","review":"The title &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; is extremely appropriate for this novel, the third in the Gateways saga. The story is in the beginning quite chaotic, jumping from scene to scene to set things up, but it soon settles into an elaborate and engrossing plot that continues to build as the pages turn. &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; is the TNG installment in this series. As the story opens several things are all happening simultaneously. Gateways across the galaxy are turned on and various races, both familiar and unknown, begin to take advantage of the ability for instant transportation that they provide. Until they were activated the existence of these Gateways was unknown. It soon becomes apparent that stepping through the Gateways either intentionally or accidentally can lead to ramifications that no one could possibly foresee or guard against. Consequently Captain Picard and Counselor Troi have been summoned posthaste to Earth to attend an emergency conference. The ancient Iconians have returned. Or have they? Each of the major powers in the Alpha Quadrant has been approached by representatives of a race claiming to be the descendants of the legendary Iconians. They are the ones who have reactivated the Gateways and are offering the secret to controlling the technology to the highest bidder. War weary and still recovering from the Dominion war, Starfleet is suspicious of the mysterious aliens but at the same time must prevent the technology from falling into the hands of any potential aggressors. Admiral Ross calls upon Picard to head up a seemingly impossible mission. The first objective is for himself, Picard and Troi, to approach key Alpha Quadrant races and enlist their support in forming a task force of representative races to approach the Iconians as a united group. Some races decline to join with the Federation in this endeavor, being either unwilling or unable to cooperate. But others decide to join in, if for no other reason than to make sure that whatever is learned of the technology is shared. The second objective is for this convoy of ships to approach the Iconians and try to determine if they can either prove or reasonably be supposed to be who they claim to be. Harder still will be trying to persuade them to deactivate the Gateways while discussions about the technology are taking place. Comprised of Romulans, Klingons, Deltans, Ferengi, Gorn, and others, the Enterprise and this unlikely fleet prepares to confront the Iconians and attempt to learn just who and what is behind the riddle of the Gateways. Picard struggles to control his allies and their sometimes conflicting interests as elsewhere chaos is reigning across the quadrant and beyond. It does not take long for things to get out of hand and a fierce and deadly battle ensues. A battle that seems to provoke yet more questions, but whose outcome forces the Iconians to talk and to finally supply some answers to at least a portion of the riddle. In the end some of pieces of the puzzle are in place, but important ones are still missing as conditions across the galaxy are becoming more and more desperate. Just like the other commanders before him, Picard is forced to step through the Gateway in hopes that the answers they need can be found in what lays beyond. &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; finally sees this series coming into focus. And certainly with this novel the series shifts into high gear. This fast paced story is a bit hard to follow at first. There are so many characters to be established and scenes unfolding as the author jumps from situation to situation setting up the plot that I found myself getting a bit frustrated at times trying to keep it all straight. Additionally I usually I enjoy a novel with lots of various Trek references to episodes and previous novels, and &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; certainly has those in abundance, as well numerous cameos of characters from other series. But it's a bit forced at times, and sometimes more of a detriment to the flow of the story than an enhancement to the plot. Despite it's flaws &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; was the best in the series so far. An enjoyable and interesting story that certainly holds your interest. The plotting and events moves quickly and if you enjoy long descriptive battle sequences you are in plenty of action. Overall I would call &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; a good read. Not great but certainly worth the time, especially if you plan on reading the remaining Gateways novels."},{"Title":"Egyptians","review":"Well illustrated, this classic book, written by a remarkable Egyptologist, is a comprehensible overview of Egyptian civilization. The author discusses the discoveries which led to the beginning of Egyptology; he presents Egypt's geography starting with Sudan and Nubia, ending with the Delta; he describes the history and formation of Egypt from the Predynastic to the Late Periods; he describes Egyptian social groups from the pharaoh to the peasants.

The earliest period of Egyptian civilization after the unification of the upper and lower kingdoms is, as Aldred suggests, the most creative, and the entire cycle of civilization stretches as long as the period in our tradition from the Classical Greeks to modern times, a tremendous range, with an amazing overall continuity.

I like how the Littles get help from animals. I thought Aunt Lily was not going to make it in time for the baby.But with the help of everybody she was found."},{"Title":"The Littles to the rescue (Little apple)","review":"This is a great entry in a great series, which features the adventures of a family of small people-with-tails named the Littles, who live in the walls of the clueless humans, the Biggs.This is probably my favorite book in the series, prominently featuring two other families of little people, the Specks and the Tinies. These two clans have an irrational distrust of each other, and the Littles get caught up in their struggles just when they desperately need to be focused on the pregnancy of Mrs. Little.The elements that make the series consistently great are also on full display. The little people are essentially living in isolated pockets in the vast and dangerous frontier created by humans, and they must rely on their own wits to carve out a decent living. The problems they face, and the solutions that they struggle to find, are amazingly realistic, and there is no need to create evil-minded villains when the terrain is so inhospitable. Seeing the other clans in action also shows that the methods of living life on such a small scale can be very localized; the Specks, who live in the trunk of a tree, have an entirely different way of life than the Littles.This is a charming series, with hundreds of thoughtful details that will delight children with their ability to portray a real world. Interactions with housecats and toy gliders are particularly thrilling.Also, I would be remiss not to mention the wonderful sepia-toned drawings by Roberta Carter Clark. They mirror the text's adherence to realism, and give us a very graphic and fun look at the scenes that the text describes."},{"Title":"The Littles to the rescue (Little apple)","review":"In \\"The Littles to the Rescue\\", Mrs. Little is expecting her third child, and, by tradition, she wants Aunt Lily to deliver it. However, Aunt Lily and her son, Cousin Dinky, live four houses away, which is quite a distance for Tinies (little creatures--approximately 4 - 6 inches tall--that vaguely resemble elves with tails). Nevertheless, Cousin Dinky pilots his mother in his glider plane to the Littles' residence, even though it's in the middle of the night and snowing. However, during the trip, Aunt Lily falls out of the plane and is captured by the reclusive Ground Tinies. A search party is formed to locate Aunt Lily, with the added help of a cat and skunk, who remarkably don't make a meal out of the Littles. But will they find her in time?This was one of my favorite books (and cartoon series) when I was a kid. It was given to me by my grandmother when I was about eight-years-old. Not only are the black-and-white illustrations terrific, but the Littles are extremely resourceful and imaginative in this story, using most things people throw away as tools, decorations, etc. My only two complaints are that the book has a rather abrupt ending (or perhaps there's a page missing from my book; I have had it for about 15 years), and that it's a bit ...., though younger readers may not pick up on this.

This book (and part two) solved that problem for me. Barclay takes anywhere from one to several verses at a time and discusses them in the contexts of the time they were written, the prevailing religious thought, and their admittedly proseletizing purpose. He demonstrates how Matthew took ideas from the Hebrew Scriptures and showed that they predicted the coming of Christ. He also tells that many of these references were inappropriate, but because Matthew was intended for the Jews, this method was used. Beyond this, though, Barclay explains the meaning of the words and deeds of Christ, making opaque parables and homilies clear and compelling. The love of Christ and his ministry to save mankind come alive in this book. Barclay elucidates the message of Christ in a powerful, heart-gripping and understandable way.

Written about 50 years ago, much of the background information and schalorship in his commentaries are outdated. Sometimes he stretched historical/cultural background too much to explain the text. Conservative readers should be aware that Barclay was a universalist (one who believes that all people will be saved ultimately). He does not believe in miracles and tries to explain them away in his commentaries on the Gospels. However, his comments on the relevance of the Bible can still be very valuable for discerning readers.Advanced students would not need to be told where to find more updated scholarship on NT Bible. Beginning students should get Tom Wright's two-volume \\"Matthew For Everyone\\" instead of Barclay's. The volume on Matthew by Michael J.

As she often does, the mistress of mystery builds a great detective story around a seemingly simple plot."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"As more than one person has noted, Agatha Christie (1890-1976) is best known for fiendishly cunning plots, stories that twist more than once before arriving at an unexpectedly logical conclusion. She is, however, often criticized for her lack of skill with characters, who are often described stereotypical and cardboardish. In the 1950 A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED, however, the characters are equal to the plot, and the result is a novel that many fans and critics feel is among her best works--and possibly the single best novel she wrote featuring Jane Marple, a character she gradually came to prefer over Hercule Poroit as the years past.Although it has several subplots, the primary story concerns Leticia Blacklock, a retired business woman who resides in a house named Little Paddocks in the small town of Chipping Cleghorn with her friend and companion Dora Bunner (commonly known as Bunny), her neice and nephew Julia and Patrick, a boarder Phillipa Haymes, and highly tempermental post-war refugee Mitzi, who acts as the household's cook. Their ordinary, comfortable lives are disrupted when an odd announcement appears in the local newspaper: \\"A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 29th, at Little Paddocks, at 6:30 pm.\\" Suspicion falls on Patrick, who is known for practical jokes, but everyone in the household denies any knowledge of the advertisement. One thing is sure: every friend and neighbor will be drawn to the house that evening--and indeed they are, all of them under the assumption that they will play \\"the murder game,\\" which was fairly popular at the time. But when the clock chimes six-thirty, a terrifying event occurs: the lights go out, a man with a bright flashlight bursts through the door, shots are fired, he seems to stumble--and then shoots himself as well. When his mask is pulled away he is recognized as a clerk from a nearby hotel. It is all very bizarre.The police are puzzled. What was the clerk's motive? Did he intend to gather a group of people for a robbery? It seems unlikely, for few of the household residents or guests had valubles on them. How did the clerk die? Did he accidentally shoot himself when he stumbled? Or was it deliberate suicide? Both possibilities seem unlikely. But one thing does become clear: it seems that he did in fact attempt to kill Leticia Blacklock, who was slightly wounded. But why? And again the answers are unsatisfactory. Fortunately, Mrs. Marple is on hand to contemplate this very strange occurrance--but even she is unable to pinpoint the killer immediately, and one violent death follows another. Indeed, if A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED has a flaw, it is that from time to time it seems to strain in order to encompass all the deaths, not to mention all the double-identities, it includes. But in the end it hardly matters, for Christie is one of the few mystery writers who can consistently perform \\"the big trick,\\" and she does it here magnificently: within the last few pages of the novel all the convoluted plotlines and characters and clues are drawn into a sudden sharp point, and when the killer is exposed it is with unexpected, jaw-dropping, yet impeccable logic.

She is, however, often criticized for her lack of skill with characters, who are often described stereotypical and cardboardish. In the 1950 A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED, however, the characters are equal to the plot, and the result is a novel that many fans and critics feel is among her best works--and possibly the single best novel she wrote featuring Jane Marple, a character she gradually came to prefer over Hercule Poroit as the years past.Although it has several subplots, the primary story concerns Leticia Blacklock, a retired business woman who resides in a house named Little Paddocks in the small town of Chipping Cleghorn with her friend and companion Dora Bunner (commonly known as Bunny), her neice and nephew Julia and Patrick, a boarder Phillipa Haymes, and highly tempermental post-war refugee Mitzi, who acts as the household's cook.

It seems like a bad hoax - until the murder really happens.If there was one Miss Marple novel to be chosen as the most ingeniously put-together plot, it might well be this one. The aforementioned first murder, meanwhile, is not the last. Miss Marple is fortunately on hand to stop murdering and divulge the true nature of tragic events that shake one home in that little English village, with the repercussions from a few years ago, during the war."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"One of my favorite Miss Marple novels so far. She really is a sweet old dear, but amazingly shrewd. The plot was complex, suspenseful, and interesting. I had no idea who the murderer was until the end. The whole plot is attention grabbing and creepy - I like that."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"This announcement in the morning paper was the main topic of discussion in the village, especially at Little Paddocks. No one knew who had placed this absurd announcement, it had to be a joke but at the appointed hour friends and neighbors just happened to drop by....and since this is a Christie novel, a murder did occur.This 1950 novel is an interesting look at village life in postwar England. The housing shortages, food rationing (and resulting underground trading), the influx of foreigners and the English themselves left uncertain at how to cope with the postwar world. Little Paddocks was a slice of this new world, the owner, Letty Blacklock had opened her home to a childhood friend, two young distant relatives, a boarder and hired a displaced person as a cook/housekeeper.Fortunately for all concerned Jane Marple was visiting nearby and was soon unraveling all the little village mysteries - just who was the strange man seen around town, why did Miss Blacklock wear those necklaces, how was the victim at Little Paddocks and why was he there and why was there a second murder?This is one of my favorite novels, as always with Christie the clues are all there but the plot twists and turns so much that it would be a rare reader indeed who could arrive at the answers before Miss Marple reveals all."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"Agatha Chriestie has always been my favorite mystery writer, and Miss Jane Marple has always been my favorite of her series detectives. \\"A Murder Is Announced\\" is by far her best Miss Marple mystery. This plot is set in a rural village, jus the appropriate setting for Miss Marple since she lives in St. Mary Mead.In this installment, residents of the village Chipping Cleghorn are shocked to discover an advertisement in their newspaper, \\"The Gazette\\" which announces that a murder will take place at 6-30 PM at Little Paddocks. Thinking that it is either a cruel joke or a murder mystery party, the villagers arrive at the home of there friend and neighbor Laticia Blacklock, and are horrified to be the witnesses of an actual murder. The novel progresses as Miss Marple, who is visiting her godchild Bunch at the vicarage, struggles to unravel the complex mystery along with Inspector Dermot Craddock.All the characters in this novel are extremely likable, particularly Dora Bunner, Hench and Mergatroid, and Patrick. They each have their own quirks which always appear in village life. As usual, Agatha Christie has woven a superb plot with an astonishing conclusion. You cannot honestly say you are a fan of \\"The Queen of Crime\\" if you have not read this particular installment. It is unforgettable, and one which is destined to delight readers for many generations to come. Happy reading to you all!"},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"If you like Agatha Christie, this is a really good one. Had great fun listening to this story and thought it was well done."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"Although first published in 1950 \\"A Murder Is Announced\\" by vaunted mystery writer Agatha Christie has lost none of its zest. Deemed a classic in its genre this suspenseful tale is ably represented by British voice and television actress Rosemary Leach.When invitations are sent reading \\"A murder is announced, and will take place on Friday, October 29th, at Little Paddocks at 6:30 p.m.,\\" everyone, including the indomitable Jane Marple, would anticipate an unusual party game. Such as, someone will be chosen as the murderer, the room is darkened, and the victim meets his fate.It's not all fun and games when a real dead body is found. Miss Marple, on your mark! With her inimitable skill Agatha Christie allows listeners to enjoy solving the crime, step by step, just as much as Miss Marple does.Curl up in an easy chair and revel this remarkable tale wonderfully read.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"Like with \\"The Moving Finger,\\" this is a Christie mystery I read maybe 5 years ago and then picked up again just recently. And, similar to that one, I somewhat remembered the solution to this mystery, though I couldn't remember nor ever quite reconfigure the logic behind it.For those who don't know, this excellent mystery starts off with a murder being announced in the personal ads in the local village paper. Somewhat akin to the irony of \\"Gross Pointe Blank\\" - where nobody believes that Cusack is a hitman because he states it directly - no one believes that a murder will really happen. Who would advertise such a thing? And so, in a predictable English manner, all the neighbors turn up - each insisting they just happened to drop by.Thus begins a subtly humorous and mind-bending tale. After reading a number of poor books lately, I have to say that it felt good to be back in Agatha's capable hands. She develops a small pool of likable characters that you can keep track of...and never really trust. She throws out red herrings galore and keeps you on your toes as you try to fit together the random jig saw piece clues handed to you. Of course, Miss Marple is on to things fairly early, but will you be?Of note in this particular Christie mystery:- In addition to Miss Marple, Christie develops a likable & capable if slightly lackluster inspector in Craddock. I think it shows Christie's continued desire to mix things up and try new crime-solving combinations- The time period is right after WWII, and so you pick up on what life was like in Britain in that time period. There is reference to food rations, Mittel European servants, reduced amounts of hired help, shifting of the population (even in small towns), an increased amount of suspicion with foreigners, etc. It's all very interesting.- This is one of the few murder mysteries I remember with a real lack of rich/titles characters. There are a few in the background, but they don't play in the main plot at all. It was quite nice to read about working folks and their lives.- Christie sets up several foils with the number of middle aged women in the book. I've never read a British novel where 3 main characters were weak minded (Bunch, Murgatroyd, and Dora), but Christie is able to develop each with distinction. However, each woman's relation with a strong woman (Marple, Hinch and Blacky) makes for an interesting study. (BTW - It is unclear if Murgatroyd and Hinch are a gay couple. Certainly, it seems possible, but Christie doesn't focus on that.)"},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"Although this is a great book--if you like Agatha Christie for fun, pastime reading--this edition infuriated me. One of the key clues to solving this slowly building, engaging mystery came in the form of an occasionally and purposefully misspelled word. (I won't say anymore!!!) I caught the misspellings as I was reading the book, and yet I overlooked them because the book had several egregious typos in it--leaving me to assume that the misspellings were typos too!!!WRONG!When, at the end of the book, I discovered the importance of some of the misspellings I felt cheated!!!This goes to show you how important copyeditors can be. Granted, not the most glamorous job, but if they do it wrong...erg!!!Oh...the edition I read: Paperback with a purple cover, Pocket Books (Simon and Schuster)--though it doesn't say the year. The cover art is copyrighted 1987, and it looks like the book is the 31st edition (??). Definitely avoid this one!!"},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Black Dog & Leventhal edition?

It was adapted for the stage in 1977 by Leslie Darbon :Agatha Christie's \\"A Murder is Announced\\" (Adapted for the Stage).I can't but recommend this book that presents one of the most inventive mysteries ever concocted by Agatha Christie. For once, if you're very careful, it's possible to find the murderer before the last ten pages of the novel because all the clues are given by the smart Lady of the Crime. As always in Agatha Christie novels, light notes about the English social and political climate spreaded all along the chapters allow us to better imagine the everyday life in an English little town some five years after the end of WWII.A book for your library."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"This was the third book of Agatha Christie's that I read, and the one that cemented my opinion of her as an utterly ingenious storyteller. \\"A Murder is Announced\\" is a book that I can come back to again and again, noticing something different each time, and marveling at the amount of foreshadowing and carefully-placed clues that have been strewn throughout the narrative, so obvious in hindsight, yet so carefully woven into the story that it takes a keen eye to pick up on them.The residents of Chipping Cleghorn are astonished at an advertisement placed in their local paper, claiming that a murder is to take place in the home of Miss Letitia Blacklock that night. Even more strangely, Miss Blacklock is as baffled at the appearance of the announcement as the rest of them. The other residents of the house (a childhood friend, two distant relatives, a refugee and a somewhat mysterious boarder) all claim innocence, and so it is a rather bemused gathered in the drawing room once her neighbours converge on Little Paddocks for what they assume is a murder-mystery party. As the clock chimes the half-hour, the lights go out, and gun-shots are fired. When the confusion passes, someone is dead.Luckily the elderly Miss Marple is staying with a friend in the village, and offers her services to the police to help gather some more information about the people involved. What with the authorities having come to the shaky conclusion that the events of the night in question were some kind of botched burglary, the spinster-sleuth decides to do some of her specialized snooping. That is, she socializes with those involved, and draws parallels between the impression she has of them with the residents in her own village in an attempt to understand character, background and possible motivation.The amount of detail used in building the mystery is wonderfully complex, particularly in the dialogue: the second time around, I could pick up on the fact that several characters are saying completely different things to what we assume they are the first time. In hindsight, there are several early details that practically scream the solution at you, and even what first appears to be a typo is a clue! If you're sharp enough, you can certainly deduce who the killer is; as Christie lays out all the information...but then proceeds to baffle you with it.The general time-period of the story is informative without being obtrusive. Set in the years directly after WWII, we get the sense of a society still trying to find its footing after great turmoil, and coping with drastic changes in the world. Along with mention of ration books and identity cards, displaced refugees from Eastern Europe, the decrease in hired servants, illegal bartering system among neighbours, housing development and distrust of foreigners, there is a prevailing sense of uncertainty and hardship as communities try to rebuild their understanding of the world. One feature of the postwar world in particular has an important bearing on the mystery: the upheavals in population settlement, in which old families died out or moved on, resulting in previously close-knit village residents suddenly becoming strangers to one another.There was one thing though that seemed to go unresolved; when the police are discussing the case, one of them opens a file and says: \\"Here's a little something we've dug up on Mrs Easterbrook.\\" We never do find out what this something is, unless I missed something obvious. Can anyone enlighten me?At the time of its publication, \\"A Murder is Announced\\" was heavily advertised as her fiftieth story; a somewhat dubious claim, but one that gives this particular mystery an added bit of renown. As one of Christie's best and rewarding mysteries (yeah, I know I probably say that about all of them) my advice is to read carefully, as everything means something."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"This was my first Miss Marple mystery but by no means my first Christie book. I have enjoyed the different way in which the sharp mind worked over Hercule Poirot's genius but truth be told, Miss Marple as good as she was didn't appear in the book too often. This was also the time I figured out who the murderer was, more likely because I have read a lot of Agatha and knew her to be a trickster when it came to fooling the reader but also partially due to clues given out fairly this time. The final answer made total sense and there were a few things that were twisted and few truths were new to me but overall it all came together , so those who pay attention can figure it out.Murder is announced - in deed it is, in a local Gazette that everyone reads in Chipping Cleghorn. When everyone assumes it's some sort of a party they get a huge surprise that a murder does take place and one of the attendees is somehow responsible. I will not give anything else away but the story has a great setting and there are tons of clues. I felt like a grand detective reading all the accounts and enjoyed the old-fashioned talk and mannerisms. The house of Letitia Blacklock has been violated and her closest friends, neighbors and family members are the only ones who could have dipped their fingers in the dark pool of death. Miss Marple enters the book and shines some light on interesting family relations and past that wants to be forgotten with a few unlucky turns for some of the members of the party. When more deaths happen the police know they must act quickly or there won't be anyone left.The only problem I had with the book was the amount of characters; my head was spinning and I was dizzy trying to gather them all up in my mind. The names were also similar and long some making me a bit batty but overall I enjoyed the book and loved the cozy setting marred with chilling death hiding in the dark corridors of the Blacklock house. I do recommend this but it left me with a bit of a headache at the end and I was anticipating the ending to finally come and bring my brain some relief. Murder is nasty business and Christie knew how to work it to her advantage.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"In A Murder is Announced, Agatha Christie's fiftieth detective story, and surely the best of the Miss Marples, \\"the latest idea is to advertise one's murders beforehand\\", by placing an advertisement in the paper-hence the title. And so, \\"once more a murder is announced-for the benefit and enjoyment of Miss Marple.\\"The setting is Chipping Cleghorn, which is perhaps Christie's best-drawn village setting-and certainly the quintessential Miss Marple novel. Christie vividly captures the feeling of how \\"the world has changed since the war... Fifteen years ago one knew who everybody was... If anybody new-really new-really a stranger-came, well, they stuck out-everybody wondered about them and didn't rest till they found out. But it's not like that any more. Every village and small country place is full of people who've just come and settled there without any ties to bring them... And people just come-and all you know about them is what they say of themselves... Nobody knows any more who anyone is.\\" It is this feeling of insecurity Christie admirably captures that allows the ingenious plot-quite simply one of her best-to take place. Despite the beauty of the village, however, the simple rural cosiness, \\"there was a nightmarish feeling at the back of [Detective Inspector Craddock's] mind. It was like a familiar dream where an undertone of menace grows and finally turns Ease into Terror...\\" Neighbour cannot trust neighbour, and the tension slowly mounts-no atmospherics here, simply first-rate characterisation, with Christie particularly good at depicting elderly spinsters, with a sympathetic treatment of lesbianism and of old age.Miss Marple's statement that \\"one is alone when the last one who remembers is gone. I have nephews and nieces and kind friends-but there's no one who knew me as a young girl-no one who belongs to the old days. I've been alone for quite a long time now\\" captures the whole feeling of the book-elderly spinsters living in solitude in the country, dependent upon each other for their comfort. At the heart of the novel are five old women: Miss Marple, the detective, \\"the finest detective God ever made. Natural genius cultivated in a suitable soil...\\"; Miss Blacklock and Miss Bunner; and Miss Hinchcliffe and Miss Murgatroyd. Miss Blacklock and Miss Hinchcliffe are the dominant partners, shrewd and capable; while Miss Bunner and Miss Murgatroyd are woolly-minded and amiable, dependent upon their stronger-minded friends for security. Yet when Miss Bunner and Miss Murgatroyd are both murdered, the true depths of the feelings-of the dependency-Miss Blacklock and Miss Hinchcliffe felt is made apparent. These portraits of love and grief are unrivalled anywhere else in Christie's books, and show her ability to create human characters.Miss Marple herself is at the top of her powers, actively detecting. Sir Henry Clithering remarks that \\"an elderly unmarried woman who knits and gardens is streets ahead of any detective sergeant. She can tell you what might have happened and what ought to have happened and even what actually did happen! And she can tell you why it happened!\\" Although she deprecates her abilities, modestly claiming that she has \\"no gifts at all-except perhaps a certain knowledge of human nature\\", her ability to reason from both material clues and dialogue is seen at its best; and she is an active player for once, reasoning and sleuthing like the best of them.Setting and characterisation aside, the plot itself is one of Christie's best. It is complicated, \\"all so complex, nearly all so trivial and if one thing isn't trivial, it's so hard to spot which one-like a needle in a haystack\\", but not cluttered-one of Christie's gifts. The motive, stated quite clearly from the beginning, is money, and Miss Marple \\"know[s] only too well the really terrible things that people will do to lay their hands on a lot of money.\\" Yet the identity of the real beneficiary / murderer is so well-hidden, aided by \\"the most amazing impersonation\\", that the reader will never work out the meaning of the clues, despite Miss Marple's listing them.\\"You could get away with a great deal if you had enough audacity\\", Miss Marple reflects at one point-and both murderess and author do have enough audacity."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Signet edition?

Unlike some of her works, this one has not aged quite as well; part of the problem is that the mystery's machinations depend upon things which are not today, including the WWII effects mentioned before. Also, some of the people and types are simply different nowadays, people do not behave the same way. In many Christies, of course, this is the case, but in this particular one the apparently unnatural behaviour stands out rather more. Of course, the mystery iteslf is well written, well hidden, and satisfyingly revealed with the help of Miss Marple. Indeed, the climactic revelation is quite as dramatic as any of Christie's i can remember offhand. Sadly, though, i am not left with the complete satisfaction she usually gives me."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"You'll never meet a murderer prepared to devise a killing as elaborate and risky as occurs here. Indeed, Agatha Christie, the Queen of Crime, who admitted that she had never knowingly met a murderer, creates a dazzlingly daring one in this brilliant little book. Bear in mind that Mrs Christie's aim is to create an old-fashioned murder mystery, intent in baffling and misdirecting the reader who is trying to guess the solution. Don't look for any but a game-playing analysis of a murderer's mind. In addition she adds plenty of charm, she depicts a cozy village community, she displays a shrewd understanding of elderly folk, and she gives Miss Marple free rein to collect gossip in tea shops, kitchens and vicarage drawing rooms and to discern before anyone else that the murderer is .....Dating from 1950, this is one of Agatha Christie's very best books from her later years. Of all her books, I rank it amongst the top ten. Those who like a good reader to present it should acquire the reading by Rosemary Leach, whose timing, articulation and slightly nasal voice adds additional charm to the story telling."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"Once again Agathe Christie's clever and strong storytelling, combined with social critcism and description have produced an entertaing mystery.While not Christie at her best, &quot;A Murder Is Announced&quot; is a worthwhile read.Written in 1940, the story isn't as clever as many other mysteries Christie produced in her time, and having Miss Marple as the investigator always stretches the boundaries of credibility.Fortunately Marple, as usual, really isn't as prominent a character as, for example, Hercule Poirot is in his books.We get a newspaper announcement concerning a murder that's going to happen later that very same day. The curious inhabitants of a quiet little village in England rush to the announced murder scene, and a mystery is started.Christie describes the post-WW2 England intriquingly. We see a definite battle between the working class and the snobbish elite, as well as the suspicious and prejudisious wiev towards the jew refugees that went to England after the end of the concentration camp period, and one of the most contravercial aspects of the book is the possibly unkind description of a jew housemaid, who is supposed to bring humor to the story. This might very well shed some light to the after-war mentality in England.The overall ethics are fortunately in place, though.A recommendet, light, and entertaining, if predictable, little mystery."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"In what I am learning must be typical Agatha Christie fashion, the solution to this mystery is ludicrous, but this time I enjoyed the ride to get there. Christie is still mind-bogglingly classist and xenophobic as she paints rural villagers and foreigners as silly and ignorant, but at least she plays that for comedy this time instead of making it an assumption in a serious piece. There are some laugh out loud moments when poor daffy Dora speaks, and Christie maintains a generally humorous tone throughout, aside from the tension of the murder mystery. The scenario is a complicated one - a mysterious classified ad announces a murder, and when some curious villagers arrive at the scene with the intention of role playing a murder mystery game, someone ends up a corpse on the floor. After some secret identity subplots and complicated probate matters are drawn out (sometimes relevant to the solution, sometimes not), the murderer (whose identity I guessed pretty early in the story) is revealed, along with a motive (which I find preposterous and far too elaborate).This is not classic literature by any stretch of the imagination, but it is an amusing little tale that makes for an enjoyable afternoon, and I recommend it for mystery fans with good attitudes and low expectations."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"This book is very good. But what do you expect, it's Agatha Christie &amp; Miss Marple. These books are interesting, enthrolling, and improve thinking ability. What more could you want from a good book? So, sit back, get a nice warm cup of tea and enjoy reading &quot;A Murder Is Announced&quot;. Be prepared, you won't be able to set this book down."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"Many characters - intricate and subtle plot. I didn't get it until the murderer was identified, which was almost on the last page."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"I have seen the DVD of this mystery, however, it was a long time ago so I enjoyed reading the book."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"On the morning of October 29, an advertisement appears in the \\"Gazette\\" newspaper in the small village of Chipping Cleghorn. It is very strange, announcing a murder to take place at 6:30 that evening at a cottage called Little Paddocks. Intrigued, several villagers turn out for what they expect to be a murder game. The proprietor of Little Paddocks, Leticia Blacklock, knows nothing about the event but figures that several people will be coming. With several in attendance, at the appointed hour, the lights go out and several shots are fired. When the smoke has cleared, Leticia has been shot at (but only grazed) and a masked man from a nearby spa is dead on the floor. What was the purpose? Who wanted to kill Leticia? Why advertise it in the paper? And what does a Swiss hotel receptionist have to do with anything?As luck would have it, an elderly lady named Miss Jane Marple is staying at the spa. Miss Marple has built up a reputation for solving murders in her spare time, and with this in mind, local authorities turn to her to help with the case. She has a way of making people at ease and bringing out information that the police may not think to ask. Combine that with her sharp observational skills, and Miss Marple is fast on the track of the truth - but not before two other people die.As much as I enjoyed the book, one thing did take away from it a bit: some glaring errors in editing. My version is published by Black Dog & Leventhal, and is yellow with a clock on the cover. In several cases, names of characters are misspelled (ex. Blacklock becomes Blocklock for a paragraph or two) and other words are substituted as well. I'm not sure if it is a transcribing error or a problem with the original manuscript, but it was annoying.Agatha Christie is on top of her game with \\"A Murder is Announced\\". I had originally read it about 15 years ago, but this didn't take away from my enjoyment at all. She has managed to bring together not only an intriguing premise but also worked in a large inheritance, unknown twins, and several cases of mistaken identity - and it's not at all contrived. It's what makes her so uniquely the Queen of Crime."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"One of Christie's most intricate murders, it is abound with clues, and only an eye for detail can get near to solving it. One I want to re-read."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"Who killed Agatha Christie? That is the question that comes to mind when reading this edition of one of my favorite AC classics. First off, I have to say that I am not one of those readers who generally cares what edition they are reading. To me a book is a book. But this edition is so bad that even I had to look at the book jacket to say, \\"Who the heck is responsible for this?\\" Like many readers I was initially dazzled by this edition of AC's books, by Black Dog and Leventhal. They look so nice on the outside! But when you start reading, you will be appalled by the large number of typos and printer's errors, and most of them can be traced back to Spellcheck. I don't know about you but when I am reading along happily and I come across \\"could water (instead of cold water)\\" I just want to throw the book into the fire. And that is just one of many examples of the mistakes that permeate this edition. The way I look at it is, nobody held a gun to these people's heads to force them to go into the book publishing business. There are plenty of other jobs. It is my understanding that the apple growers of Northern Italy are in constant need of agricultural workers and no spelling or editing abilities would be required. In \\"A Murder is Announced,\\" Black Dog and Leventhal have seen fit to \\"correct\\" an error made by one of the characters in pronouncing another character's name. I'm not going to spoil it for you but it would be the equivalent of correcting a Freudian slip. The slip itself gives you the clue to unraveling the mystery. Of course, you wouldn't have unraveled it anyway, because Mrs. Christie was too cunning for that, but that is not the point. The real mystery, then, to my mind, is not who made all these mistakes, because the answer is, \\"some underpaid drudge.\\" And it is also not, who failed to catch the mistakes, because the answer is, \\"a software program.\\" The real mystery, to my mind, is why so many individuals and libraries invested in this new edition which is anything but improved. They bought a pig in a poke and we readers must pay the price. Who killed Agatha Christie? Black Dog and Leventhal. Do yourself a favor, get the Dodd Mead & Company edition."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"I first read this more than 30 years ago when I was in high school. While reading it this time, I couldn't remember \\"who dunnit\\" but by the end of the book, I remember thinking again just how gifted a story teller and mystery writer Agatha Christie is. I didn't give it five stars only because the joy is in the story and not the actual writing when enjoying an Agatha Christie mystery."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"A murder is to take place on Friday at Little Paddocks at 6:30 p.m., its all assumed a joke in poor taste, is its aim to mock the somewhat nosey inhabitants of chipping cleghorn or is something more sinister afoot, no doubt when Miss Marple becomes involved in the web of murder its transparently clear...This in my opinion with he possible exception of nemesis is the finest marple I have read, the plot runs smoothly and lulls one into a wonderful idyllic 1950's world till we are snapped back out by a series of wicked though fabulously staged murders. My personal favourite the strangulation, this book grabs your attention and for one of the first times we feel miss marple has the wool pulled over her eyes she seems somewhat detached from the plot only really flourishing at the end sealing the murders fate like the ambassador of justice this \\"old pussy\\" is. The mismatched disjointed plot is no literary mistake but adds a wonderful style which really catches the reader by surprise, the cruel pursuit of money and comfort after a life of repression is a fine example of what miss marple chooses to call human nature, do not miss this book it will enchant every type of reader with the simplicity yet genius of the crime executed."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"This book started out wonderfully -- the announcement of a murder is placed in the ads of the local paper in a small English village, identifying the house and the time but nothing more. The residents of the village, all thinking it's an invitation to a murder mystery party, invent various excuses to show up at the stated house at the specified time. The residents of the house read the ad as well but no one will admit to having placed it. So the master of the house -- an older, single woman -- says they'd better be ready for company.But then there's a real murder, and suddenly all of the eccentric villagers are left looking at each other and wondering who was responsible.I've read two other Agatha Christie books prior to this (one with Hercule Perot, the other without one of the author's 'regular' sleuths) and this one started out much better than the others. The characters were more distinct, the situation more interesting, and the reactions of the characters more believable.Unfortunately, the book proves to be a letdown. Miss Marple seems sort of \\"tacked on\\" to the story rather than being part of it. The plot relies on too many coincidences (e.g. a cat doing something that shows Miss Marple exactly how the murderer managed something, characters with mysterious but interlinked pasts showing up at the same time with the same motives without knowing of each other, the culprit being at exactly the right place at the exactly the right time to overhear things multiple times) for my tastes.Worst of all, the resolution just doesn't feel right. The murderer is caught out in a ridiculously elaborate scheme, and when you hear their motives from Miss Marple and Inspector Craddock, is just doesn't seem believable. *This* character, with *that* background, was capable of conceiving and carrying out a murder and then committing multiple more crimes to try to cover their tracks? Even the motive for the initial murder just doesn't ring true -- there are multiple ways the culprit could have dealt with their problem that would have been far less risky than committing a murder.A pity, as the book had started out so well."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"When a murder is forecasted in a local paper to occur in the quaint village of Chipping Cleghorn, none (well, perhaps one) of the locals knows what to expect. As the townspeople show up at the specified time and place, most anticipate a murder game of sorts. As readers, however, we feel certain that this will be no empty announcement of murder. And indeed, murder soon bursts upon the scene.A Murder Is Announced is the nineteenth Agatha Christie book that I have read, and it certainly does not disappoint. However, it does happen to be the first Christie mystery in which I've been able to correctly identify the culprit, and this overwhelming hunch, surprisingly, came to me early in the novel. Expecting to be disappointed since I thought I had solved it, I read on. Well? As it turned out, I was correct in finding the murderer. And yet Christie includes myriad details that I had no idea about, making the story more and more intriguing and revealing specifics of the murder that only the most astute reader will deduce. I thought I had solved it, but I had in fact only seen the tip of the proverbial iceberg.An aspect of the novel that I particularly enjoyed: Christie employs a (partially) omniscient third-person point of view, allowing us, for at least a short time, to follow Miss Marple's thought processes, which aren't always revealed to us in the other Marple mysteries.Though I said previously that the novel does not disappoint, I must admit that my only (very slight) quibble about the book is that some of the relatively significant characters might have been present in the storyline more often. This is a mere trifle, though. Some readers might protest Christie's use of amazing and almost-unbelievable situations and coincidences. I, for one, enjoy them--I'd rather read an ingenious mystery that's slightly far-fetched than a realistic one that's predictable.All in all, this is a fine read, and one that can be readily taken in one sitting, thanks to a plot that constantly reveals new twists and turns. I'd highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"I used to think that I was of above average intelligence.But after just finishing A Murder is Announced (the 7th Christie book I've read) I know differently.Each time I start a Christie novel I am sure that this time I'll be able to figure out whodunnit, and every time I fail.This book is just another example of Christie's mastery of the mystery.The story begins when an advertisement runs in the paper announcing a murder will take place in a small town.Naturally, the towns people are intrigued thinking it's just part of a game. Of course it isn't and when there is a murder Miss Marple is called in to solve the case.With great characters and an outstanding plot (featuring more twists than you can get your head around) this is Christie at her best.A must read for anybody interested in the genre"},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"Agatha Christie takes us and Miss Marple to the wonderfully cozy village life of post World War II. We get an insight into what life was like for the English in those years---housing shortages, food rationing, inability to get domestic help, the arrival of strangers into towns that had known stable populations for years. This last part is central to the mystery of this superb novel.Miss Marple is visiting with friends in Chipping Cleghorn when an ad in the Personals column of the morning paper sets village tongues wagging. The ad reads: &quot;A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 29th, at Little Paddocks, at 6:30 p.m.&quot; Is there anyone who will be able to resist turning up at such an occasion?Readers can follow all the clues---a photograph album with missing pictures, central heating vs. a fire in the fireplace, and a conversation over morning coffee---to solve along with Miss Marple this story of impersonation and foul play in a cozy and quaint English village."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"In the small English village of Chipping Cleghord something quite remarkable is published in the advertisement section of the local Gazette. Most advertisements are about antique cars for sale, puppies for adoption or lovers seeking reunions, but not this particular one. This one advertises murder. \\"A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 29, at Little Paddocks, at 6:30 p.m. Friends please accept this, the only intimation.\\" Needless to say that quite a party of people appears at Little Paddocks at the appointed hour. Alas, when it turns out to be all but a joke, only Miss Jane Marple seems to have a clue about what really happened.This book, published in 1950, was claimed to be Agatha Christie's 50th novel, although not everyone agreed to this number, due to of a few short story collections. It certainly is one of the most memorable books she ever wrote. As always, the personalities of Miss Marple's friends create ample opportunities to introduce subtle sparks of humour to the story. Quite remarkable are the characters of Amy Murgatroyd and Miss Hinchcliff. This was certainly the first time Agatha Christie went this far portraying obviously \\"gay\\" people in one of her novels.The plot itself is quite ingenious, even measured against Agatha's high standards, while the suspense is present from the very beginning until the final revelation. But most importantly the outcome is unscrupulously fair, since the book is scattered with clues - but also with quite a few of her famous red herrings. You need to note down every little detail if you want to catch the murderer before our old friend Miss Marple does.This book is a must-read for every Agatha Christie addict or fan of a good detective story."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"Murder is not confined to large conurban locales as is made manifest in \\"A Murder is Announced.\\" The Agatha Christie murder mystery was published in 1950. It features the inimitable Miss Marple and introduces Chief Inspector Craddock a nephew of Sir Henry Clithering. Sir Henry is an old friend of Miss Marple and a member of her Tuesday Night Club.The Plot: An advertisement is placed in the October 29th edition of \\"The Chipping Cleghorn Gazette.\\" The macabre ad invites persons to attend the home of elderly Miss Letitia Blacklock on the night of October 29th where visitors will be witnesses to a murder. Several of the townsfolks attend the murder party where at 6:30 PM the lights go off and a masked intruder enters crying out \\"Stick 'Em Up.\\" Three shots are fired. The intruder is found lying dead with a revolver next to his body. He is identified as Rudi Scherz an employee of the tony Royal Spa Hotel. Whodunit? One other murder occurs in the book as an elderly woman is strangled.The novel, like so many in the Christie canon, reverts back to past days and the recipients of a will who will inherit a fortune. This murder mystery baffled my ability to match with with Miss Marple and Detective Craddock. The book ends with a very surprising revealing of who the murderer was and what was the motive of the foul crime. This book is an excellent murder mystery which would be a good introduction to the works of the Queen of Crime Agatha Christie. Well recommended."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"You'll never meet a murderer prepared to devise a killing as elaborate and risky as occurs here. Indeed, Agatha Christie, the Queen of Crime, who admitted that she had never knowingly met a murderer, creates a dazzlingly daring one in this brilliant little book. Bear in mind that Mrs Christie's aim is to create an old-fashioned murder mystery, intent in baffling and misdirecting the reader who is trying to guess the solution. Don't look for any but a game-playing analysis of a murderer's mind. In addition she adds plenty of charm, she depicts a cozy village community, she displays a shrewd understanding of elderly folk, and she gives Miss Marple free rein to collect gossip in tea shops, kitchens and vicarage drawing rooms and to discern before anyone else that the murderer is .....Dating from 1950, this is one of Agatha Christie's very best books from her later years. Of all her books, I rank it amongst the top ten. Those who like a good reader to present it should acquire the reading by Rosemary Leach, whose timing, articulation and slightly nasal voice adds additional charm to the story telling."},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"Agatha Christie was fond of choosing unusual settings for her stories - her mysteries are set on luxury trains, on airplanes, cruises, and even in the middle of card games! But I think this one tops it all - a murder is announced in the local paper of Chipping Cleghorn as being scheduled to take place that evening! The residents of Chipping Cleghorn are intruiged and of course, show up at the appointed time in large numbers - some out of curiosity, others out of sheer boredom, and still others in hope of good sherry! However, instead of playing a \\"Murder Game\\" as some of them think, they find themselves witness to an actual murder. Unfortunately, no one knows anything about the victim and still less is known about the possible identity of the murderer. Enter Miss Marple, who is staying nearby and happened to have met the murder victim in passing...this sets the stage for a finely developed and intricate mystery that traces the lives and pasts of all the major characters and throws up several possible suspects. Christie builds up the suspense gradually, as more murders are committed to cover up the first. The sense of menace threatening this peaceful little village builds and builds until the final shattering denouement. A wonderfully entertaining and well constructed mystery!"},{"Title":"A Murder Is Announced","review":"This book surprised me at the ending. It was so obvious throughout the book but like all the others you never realize. Though the begining was slow it soon picks up the pace and it amazing!

He also reminds us that we must have the confidence to be who we want to be.The story of the main character's (Johnny spokain) adolescence, is almost haunting. It reminds me of a stephen king story in its portrayal of the nasty things that children and adults do. I don't want to mislead anyone, though. The story rings very true.If you want to read a great story and with lots of substance and you don't mind reflecting on adolescence, I would recomend this book for you."},{"Title":"Johnny in the Spot","review":"Author, Ed Gallagher, has not only broken the \\"glass ceiling\\" in literature for gays, but also slayed the demons that haunt them.In a world where gay men are strictly defined as effeminate, weak, un-athletic sissy's who smile submissively with limp wrists, Ed Gallagher violates our cultural, societal, and global hallucinations. Gay men in general, and gay jocks in particular, will revel in the main character's revolution from within as he wrestles with such socially proscribed apparitions, and, surprisingly, survives as himself.This book is for everyone - women and men, young and old, black and white, straight and gay, those with disabilities and those without. It is for anyone whose power has been limited by a lack of self-esteem and is inspired by gay men, whose self-esteem is making the deepest revolution."},{"Title":"Johnny in the Spot","review":"One great strength of Johnny In the Spot is how Ed Gallagher makes the everyday details of disabled life such well-integrated story elements. By talking about the &quot;real stuff,&quot; Gallagher satisfies the reader's curiosity about spinal injury while making Johnny neither heroic nor pitiful, but simply a man with life challenges different from the average guy's."},{"Title":"Johnny in the Spot","review":"On its face, Johnny in the Spot is a brutally honest, thinly disguised autobiographical narrative of author Ed Gallagher's journey through the painful confusion of puberty and the profound effect it had on his life. There's acne, fumbling love, greasy fries, and a head strong father. Typical teenage stuff to which all of us can relate. But how about if you're gay? Whether gay or straight, Gallagher wants us to know that there's really no discerable difference in our struggle to evolve into productive adulthood-societal standards notwithstanding. For Johnny, standards are arbitrary, fashionable, and pernicious. They only parlay additional burdens on a gay teen who 's struggling mightly with the typical and socially acceptable teenage pressures. The result is far less devastating in the book than it is for the author, who attempted suicide and cheated death with a severe spinal cord injury. Perhaps Gallagher's predominant message is that we take far too much for granted and that we would be far better served to mind our own shortcomings instead of worrying about someone's sexual orientation."},{"Title":"Johnny in the Spot","review":"Johnny in the Spot is one impressive read! Not only does it delve into one persons fascinating &quot;alternative&quot; lifetyle, also offering a peek into the life of a disabled person, but it made me take a closer look at my own values, standards and life. You find yourself relating to the interesting characters and detailed situations they find themselves in in a way that is surprising and at times disturbing. Ed Gallagher not only entertains you, but, most importantly, he makes you think."},{"Title":"Johnny in the Spot","review":"I wish I had this book years ago. As a kid, I beat myself up and remained silent about all the gay feelings I had. I still have them, and life has been better since coming out of my shell. JOHNNY is a good friend. He speaks to me. A blanket of warmth. And knowledge. I was never so different. We are all together here. We are all just HUMAN."},{"Title":"Johnny in the Spot","review":"I think Ed accomplished delivering an experience of learning how precious our gifts are.

Your contribution enriched me and you certainly left your mark here."},{"Title":"Johnny in the Spot","review":"We are conditioned for the three-strike rule. When you are gay and disabled, this feat can seemingly be accomplished in two. In a culture bombarded with images of perfection, young gay males have a difficult time forming an image of acceptance. They are expected to meet specific physical criterion for entrance into the gay realm while struggling for simple justification from society at large. When a physical disability enters the equation the odds seem insurmountable.In Johnny In the Spot, Ed Gallagher, a disabled gay man himself, tackles the demons head on. We are drawn into Johnny&#65533;s struggle as he defines his role. Gays see themselves and draw comfort from a shared past. Straight society gains insight into the pressures placed on impressionable youth to conform. When Johnny becomes disabled, both cultures are slapped with the realism of truth. We have been conditioned to &#65533;look away&#65533; from differences. The author graphically and intelligently walks us through Johnny&#65533;s world. A world we are only a split second away from.As an educator and a gay man, I am keenly aware of the conflicts that young men face. Forced into a role they find unnatural in order to gain approval or in many instances for sheer survival. Ed Gallagher&#65533;s novel provides a basis for hope."},{"Title":"Johnny in the Spot","review":"I read Ed Gallagher's novel, &quot;Johnny in the Spot,&quot; with some degree of trepidation. It takes place over the course of one day--all 200+ pages--and is written in the point of view of a paraplegic. Neither scenario excited me, but what Gallagher brings to the page transends all preconceived notions about both his conceit and the protagonist's physical abilities. Not only does &quot;Johnny&quot; offer an interesting look inside the world of what must be that of many young men, with its relationship and societal issues, it does so in a way that for the first time in my life, helped me view &quot;differently-abled&quot; folks as not at all different as anybody else. By the end of the book, you'll be cheering for Johnny and feel attraction toward him regardless of the limitations put on him by society. Gallagher manages the impossible...he spins a good story and broadens horizons with every turn of the page."},{"Title":"Johnny in the Spot","review":"&quot;johnny in the spot&quot; is a facsinating story, that outlines clearly, the choices, complications, implications, and predicaments associated with the simple, but not so simple issues of sexuality.A must for every young adult living in the twenty first century era."},{"Title":"Johnny in the Spot","review":"Ed Gallagher's work does a wonderful job of addressing the questions many youths face; especially sexual identity.

Meticulously fashioned after a real yearbook (right down to the ads and classmate autographs), the National Lampoon yearbook is a comic masterpiece to be enjoyed over and over again.I'd read that it was so successful that Hollywood wanted to make a film of it, but the Lampoon humor was a little risque for a high school setting. So they moved it to a college setting and that's how we got ANIMAL HOUSE.Fans of ANIMAL HOUSE will spot familiar names in the yearbook: Larry Kroger, Coach Vernon Wormer, etc.I can't wait until I get another copy--and I'm hanging on to this one!Definitely CHECK THIS OUT!"},{"Title":"1964 H.S.

It perfectly captures the absurdity of yearbooks of an era long gone by: group class pictures taken at such a distance as to render the faces tiny specks with names like &quot;Lotta Zits&quot;; pictures of teachers in their classroom situations: the shop teacher smiling widely at the camera next to a student whose face wears a very surprised look because lower down in the picture his fingers have been separated from his hand by the band saw they are ignoring while the picture is taken! The fun goes on and on--a description of the class trip to D.C. wherein the author takes every opportunity to use the adjectives and adverbs based on the school's mascot the kangaroo. And who could forget the mottoes accompanying the Senior Pictures: the leering face of the school &quot;bad girl&quot; over the phrase &quot;I guess I missed that period!&quot; I haven't seen this book since I loaned it to a friend in the early 1980's yet the material is fresh in my mind.

She's written so many, but this one especially touched my heart. This book is part of the Ramirez Bride series and the final in that series. What I think is so incredible is that Harlequin chose three authors from three continents.....Sandra Marton (US), Emma Darcy (Australia) and Michelle Reid (UK). This series is about three half brothers scattered to opposite sides of the globe; each must find a bride in order to find each other.Jake Ramirez has just found himself in a real predicament. He's become a guardian to Catarina, a young woman he's never met and she lives in Brazil. He's also received the news that the father he believed to have died as a soldier and hero was not his father at all. That his biological father was a wealthy Brazilian who recently died and he has two half brothers he didn't know existed. In order to meet these half brothers he must become Cat's guardian and marry her off in order to gain his brother's names.Cat is a sweet, innocent orphaned girl who is just waiting to turn of age so she can escape the Convent and experience life. Little does she know that her life will change when Jake enters the picture and whisks her away to New York.Jake is strong, handsome, rich and sexy and a very powerful businessman. His youth was not one to be proud of growing up in the streets of New York, find a little trouble but turning his life around and making himself one of the most powerful and sought after bachelors in New York.From the moment they meet, anger and sparks fly, plus a tension neither of them understands. Their journey together will melt your heart. However, the final meeting of the brothers in this series was perfect, a perfect ending to a wonderful series.BOOK DESCRIPTION:Catarina Mendes is young, innocent and rich. Jake Ramirez is handsome, worldly, rich... and now he's Cat's guardian. He's supposed to protect her from unscrupulous men and find her a good, solid Brazilian husband. Once Jake does that, Cat will inherit the fortune her parents left her... and Jake will finally learn the identity of his two half-brothers. There's only one problem. Cat's a virgin, and Jake wants her. Can he resist taking what the innocent Cat offers before he finds her a suitable husband?"},{"Title":"The Disobedient Virgin (Harlequin Presents)","review":"I usually don't read harlequins very often because i use to collect them but quickly realized that some are not that good. I read about one book every two days or sooner and this book remains to be one of my favorite books.My other favorites:Gentle Rogue by Johanna Lindsey *****Laird of The Mist by Paula Quin *****Hearts Aflame by Johanna Lindsey *****Dark Embrace by Brenda Joyce *****All the books in the dark series by Christine Feehan: The love is portrayed so wonderful in all these books! *****You have Jake, which is rich by working hard. Its hard to put into words but the connection, love, and tenderness between the characters is rare. Caterina is a young woman that has matured living in a convent. She is conservative, innocent, and oblivious to the real world. Jake rescues her (Caterina thinks he is a monster at first)and introduces her to finding love while searching for the right husband that will complete the will that is strict and air tight. You may read thousands of books but its rare that you will ever find a book that expresses and shows the love and tenderness that is portrayed between the characters and how they came to the spot where love won and everything else didn't matter! I will keep the details light because its more beautiful when you read the book.The book is shorter than most books because its a Harlequin novel but please don't deny yourself the pleasure of reading this book. I read it once a month because its that good. Actually, I just read it again and had to express my love for this book.

Now in his will, his real father informs him that he has two half brothers and that in order to meet them, he must travel to Brazil and take his ward, Catarina \\"Cat\\" from the convent she has lived in until her 21st birthday and find her a suitable Brazilian within 2 months. After he has completed this mission, he will be given his brother's identity. Jake is stunned to find his new ward, Cat to be a beautiful if naive young woman. Soon he is fighting feelings for Cat because he knows he has to find her a husband, the trouble is he wants to be that husband. Sheltered Cat longs for her independence, she wants Jake to teach her the secrets of sex so that she can use it to gain her independence, the trouble is she wants it to be real.This was a nice book, but so much seemed unreal. In this day and age it is hard to believe that a woman would be kept in a convent that long against her wishes and be that naive even if it is in South America. Also, I kind of wished more time would have been devoted to the end for the brothers to interact instead of a couple of pages....otherwise nice story."},{"Title":"The Disobedient Virgin (Harlequin Presents)","review":"This book was great,I loved. Jake was ,wow ,so hot, no meanness,or verbal abuse on this one,he was just caveman jealous. Catarina, although growing up in a convent was a feisty little thing.

I also love the character of Catalina, she's innocent but feisty. Sandra Marton does not disappoint. She's a superb writer."},{"Title":"The Disobedient Virgin (Harlequin Presents)","review":"Jake was this realistic hero, charged with taking care of his ward, Cat. He expected her to be a meek, mousy kind of girl, but what a shock! She was a spitfire! He couldn't help but fall in love with her while he was searching for a suitable, Brazilian husband for her in order for her to be able to claim her inheritance and so he could meet his other 2 half brothers. This was the stipulation of his father's will.....I think when it comes to dialogue between a hero and a heroine, or just between harlequin characters, Sandra Marton is the best! She infuses humor in the dialogues which definitely makes her books page-turners. This did not disappoint, it had fantastic dialogue that had me cracking up most of the time. Even the conversation between Jake and his ex, Sam, felt so real. Bottomline, I enjoyed reading this book. I must not overlook the fact that some things just weren't realistic however or they just failed to convince me well enough. Although trivial, one of them would be how easy it was for Cat to wear sexy heels, for instance, and be comfortable enough to dance salsa and tango in them. In addition all of the convent bit just failed to impress me, I mean c'mon, in this day and age?? I loved how the brothers met, though it would have been nicer if they were given more ti e to spend together as brothers in the book. All in all, it was a good book. I give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Disobedient Virgin (Harlequin Presents)","review":"I have read many of her books and this is one that I have read several times and still love it.

He's clever, but not without a sense of humor, strong and stubborn but not the overdone \\"Alpha Male\\". Though he dates beautiful women he is not the typical playboy so wary of the grasping gold-diggers of the world.The female counterpart is naive and stubborn due to being raised in a convent- that being said, it is surprising how quickly she and Jake fall into bed together but then again this is Harlequin!Not a bad book, in fact it is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Disobedient Virgin (Harlequin Presents)","review":"Because it\`s a little different than below I write the back cover text also: She\`s young, innocent and rich...Catarina Mendes, at twenty-one, is finally free and independent woman.

Currently forced to fend for herself, she suffers from low self esteem and allows her ex-lover to come and go since she has no other romance until British heart throb Flynn bumps into her repeatedly. What she does not realize is that he is an insurance investigator, and she is his prime suspect in a series of museum robberies.This was a really hard book to finish. The first two in the trilogy were great - the heroines were spunky and the heroes were hunky. This one was just... well, clunky. The heroine is so spineless and insipid - a perennial college student who is shocked when daddy cuts her off at 31. As for the mystery - anyone could see where the author was going within the first 50 pages.I had the feeling that author London managed to obtain a British slang dictionary and used just about every cockney colloquialism and attributed them to Flynn in order to give the story some British validity. The biggest problem with that is that Flynn is upper class, and would never utter a cockney phrase, so the dialogue just grates on the nerves and becomes distracting. This was just a really horrible end to what was an enchanting series of novels punning a Shakespearean classic."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Disgusted with how soft a mark his youngest daughter is and her role as a \\"perpetual student\\", ailing billionaire Aaron Lear cuts off her hefty allowance that she seems to always give away to others like her sponge ex boyfriend Myron. In Providence, Rachel decides she needs to find a way to make money, lose weight as she dubs herself \\"Tubby\\", and obtain a new lover.Her best friend, practicing witch Dagne casts a spell for Rachel to meet a lover with a James Bond looks and accent. Not long afterward Rachel meets and keeps running into Flynn Oliver. As they begin to see one another and fall in love, he wonders how she will react to him when he reveals the truth about his identity.The third Lear daughter tale (see MATERIAL GIRL and BEAUTY QUEEN) is a fun contemporary romance that ties up the loose ends of the previous stories. Rachel is a terrific protagonist as a caring chump who is unconcerned with material things and believes she too overweight to be a beauty. Jake is an intriguing male lead as he shows up wherever Rachel is; making the weird Dagne believe her spell is causing this to happen. Fans of the series will appreciate this lighthearted romp and want to see one more sequel starring the good witch of Providence.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"In two previous titles, \\"Material Girl\\" and \\"Beauty Queen\\", we read the stories of Rebecca and Robin Lear. Now it is time for the youngest sister's story.Rachel Lear lives in Providence, R.I. is the youngest of Aaron Lear, multi billionaire. Aaron has told all three of his daughters that he is going to cut them off unless they make their own way. Bonnie, Aaron's ex-wife, has Aaron going to marriage counseling by \\"Daniel the Jerk\\". Aaron hates it, but will do anything to win Bonnie back and smooth out the mess he has made with his daughters. Rachel is the only one left for Aaron to worry about. And she is the one he has hurt worst of all.Rachel is too soft hearted. She teaches weaving class, but most of her students cannot afford it so she lets them attend for free. Rachel also pays for the supplies for them. Problem is, Rachel is flat broke herself! Rachel has a broken upstairs window, a tree that has fallen down on her neighbor's fence and he is taking her to court, she had loaned out money to a friend, Myron, who keeps stealing her T-Mobile phone and claims he cannot pay her back yet, and her best friend, Dagne, keeps popping over and convincing her to practice witchcraft.

But that is such a minor part of this wonderful tale that I could care less about because watching Rachel and Flynn together is astounding! The secondary character named Dagne needs her own story. She is totally into white magic, but is very bad at it. She never has the needed ingredients and keeps substituting items. It seldom works the way expected either. Dagne's story would be just as fascinating as Rachel and her sisters'. Anyhow, back on track. This novel is unputdownable! I had an awful time pulling my nose out of the book long enough to deal with my own everyday life. I could not get enough. The characters are easy to love and believable, the plot is very good, the story is filled with wit, and a sub-plot or two keeps things hot. Highly recommended reading! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"...out quickly within the first 100 pages. I was very intrigued with the premise of the novel--poor little rich girl has to learn to make it on her own. I thought, this one could be really fun! However, what I found instead was a story about a walking doormat, who let everyone and their family up to the 6th cousins take advantage of her. With this statement, I have in mind visions of MYRON floating through my head. At one point, Rachel has a box of macaroni and something else left in her fridge, with no money to get more food to make it through a whole week, but she blithely shrugs off Myron's raid on her pantry. Her attitude is, \\"Who cares if he eats all my food and clutters up my house? He's my FRIEND\\". This attitude safely does fall under the TSTL category, which I was relieved to see another reader point out. Furthermore, Rachel teaches a weaving class OUT OF POCKET...and we're all expected to believe she does it out of the goodness of her little heart, and for sheer love of weaving? Please! I could understand Rachel waiving the wee for a student or two, or bringing weaving materials for a student or two, but PAYING HERSELF for the class to take weaving? Come on! No one is that desperate and lonely that they need to PAY for other people to enjoy their company! And if they are, I certainly don't want to read about them!One of the worst and most annoying things about this book was the horrid slang Julia London had Flynn speak in. I could understand a few slang comments thrown in, but his entire character spoke in dialect. (Most people, when taking beginning writing courses, are warned to use \\"dialect\\" SPARINGLY. So what does Julia London do? She writes a whole character who speaks in nothing BUT dialect. Help me rip out all the hairs on my head one by one for each \\"nancy boy\\" and \\"bit of all right\\" and \\"I rather suspect...\\" and \\"lucky chaps\\"!) Two of my best friends are British, and do they speak like that? NO! They have a few expressions we don't use in America, but they still speak ENGLISH! Instead of being charmed, I was desperately annoyed.One more thing that bothered me was the way Rachel's dad was painted as a horrible villain who, although dying, didn't deserve to see his daughter for Thanksgiving. No matter how awful your parents are, if they're dying, you could at least agree to go spend the holidays with your family! This coming from a girl who pays for other people to take her classes, who rescues kittens from cruel owners, and who buys groceries for a vilely grouchy widower. But yet we're expected to believe she won't go see her dying father for the holidays? Whaaaat? Oh no, he tells her she needs to finish school--she's THIRTY! What does she expect? Yet of course, once she starts having a relationship with a man and falls in love, she suddenly is able to finish her long-stagnant thesis. Gag me!Now, after all my ranting, were there any redeeming qualities to this novel? I'll admit, there was quite a lot wrong with this novel. However, I did enjoy the way Rachel's character tried to take her life into her own hands by doing things she'd never been good at before. She stopped whining about being overweight and went to the gym, she stopped saying she could never get a date and started flirting with a nice, normal seeming guy. Also, the tone of the novel was mostly light and humorous, especially throughout Rachel's first encounters with Flynn. It made the novel more appealing and comedic, which I enjoyed. However, all in all, I found Rachel's repeated put-downs of herself to be too much of a hindrance to the story, and her newfound self-confidence blossomed much too late in the story for me. Sorry guys, but I give this one a miss."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I've read few published books that were a mess from beginning to end, so this book didn't lack in achieving something for me. It was also entertaining, though probably not in the way the author intended.Rachel Lear is the sort of person I do not form relationships with simply because she's the sort of person who cannot live without some sort of chaos in her life. That chaos has a way of spilling over into friends' lives, no matter how much she may not want it to. Hell, her sisters have so little respect for her as a person that there's no interest in reading their stories. Where Rachel is a directionless mess, they seem more self-involved and nasty.That being said, Rachel is a total disaster, tore up from the floor up. The most frustrating and annoying heroine I've encountered in my 41 years. She's a doormat, needy, and whines endlessly. Her life is filled with people who take from her and she doesn't seem to think enough of herself to demand more from them as friends. The only person Rachel stands up to is her father, which is just another example of her selfishness and lack of common sense given that the father is dying of cancer.If Rachel makes me cringe at every turn, there is hero Flynn Oliver, who London must have cobbled together from \\"Everyday British Slang For Dummies.\\" I've known and worked with British people numerous times. None of them have talked like Flynn, who is so annoying in his bits of all right, bloodies, smashings, chaps, lads, nancy boys, and other dated vernacular that I ground my teeth every time he opened his mouth.The secondary characters weren't any better. They seemed more like stereotypes of characters. Dagne Delaney is Rachel's best friend and she's as flaky as a pie crust. When Rachel bemoans the fact that she's jobless, broke, and manless, Dagne thinks it's a good idea to cast a spell to fix all that's wrong in Rachel's life. Dagne is exactly what you expect, buying her spell book on eBay and embracing all things crunchy and granola.Rachel also teaches a weaving class that doesn't make her money unless the participants pay for the class. It's filled with just about every stereotype you can imagine, parodies of characters. 1) a hypochondriac who regales the class with the endless nonexistent medical problems she suffers; 2) a gay senior; 3) two African-American women, both complete with neck poppin', \\"no he did'ents, and 5 children between them. They're shrill and engage in every stereotype you'd expect, and 4) a Goth kid who is naturally in love with Rachel.And really, let's not forget the freeloading exboyfriend Myron. Rachel has so little backbone that when she comes home to find that he's eaten the last of her brownies, she says nothing when he tells her that she didn't put a note on them. It's her house! It's her food. He doesn't live there, although I'd argue that fact as he still has a key and comes and goes whenever he wishes, whether she's there or not. He doesn't buy her food, doesn't pay rent, doesn't share in any expenses of her house and she can't even stand up for herself over a pan of brownies.By the book's end, Rachel has gotten all she's ever wanted, but I don't feel she worked toward any of it. No, when things got tough either she or Dagne cast a spell. I'm sure some will find that charming, but I found the entire mess annoying and laughable, something I'm fairly sure the author never intended."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"In two previous titles, \\"Material Girl\\" and \\"Beauty Queen\\", we read the stories of Rebecca and Robin Lear.

Truthfully, I did not expect to love the book, much less like it. I'm not a fan of reading romances where the ditsy and childish heroine needs to learn to grow up and be an adult. I thought that was what I'd be getting from 'Miss Fortune' - I was very pleasantly surprised otherwise.From the getgo, I didn't sense the usual baby-nature and airheadedness from Rachel that usually drives me crazy. Instead, I found her a warm character who was just struggling during a part of her life. London makes Rachel's less-than-satisfying life very easy to sympathize with. A+ main character.As for Flynn Oliver, well... let's just say that I was warm for Flynn's form. Something about him seemed decidedly realistic to me, and I turned out loving him by the middle of the book. Another A+ main character.Now, it wasn't just the main character's that really had me loving this book. London very craftily combined the protagonists, the plot, and the antagonists (who, in my opinion, were very well written in their sleezy-ness and assholish natures) to leave a reader very satisfied by the end.Some people, like me, may feel hesitatnt to read this book. However, some people, also like me, may be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This conclusion to the Lear family trilogy is good, as London is a fun and fresh writer with great characterization and hip storytelling.

I get what London was trying to do but it didn't work. She tried so hard to make her the likeable, youngest child that she made her into a pushover. I wanted to slap her, tell her to stand up for herself and stop eating brownies. The witchcraft angle was old after the first one, and they proceed to do several more after. My pet peeve with writers is when they just want you to buy a romantic spark by just writing it. That's just being lazy. I don't see why either of them liked each other. The ending was anticlimatic, the plot predictable, the characters blah, and yet I still liked it better than the second Rebecca Lear story."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I love Julia London, but this trilogy just didn't do much for me.Well, I was glad to see that Aaron finally got his head on straight, but other than that, I didn't particularly care for this book. Something in this book make me not like Bonnie very much, while in the first two books, I got the impression that the whole debacle was Aaron's fault. Bonnie was way too self-righteous in this book.And the main characters? All three of the Lear daughters were spoiled brats, but Rachel was my least favorite. She's all about being nice to everyone, so that was a point in her favor, but she had no backbone and no desire to get one. She was just very annoying, and she was surrounded by annoying people.I'm not sure if I liked Flynn or not. He was stuck in the typical undercover-cop-falls-for-suspect trap, but that wasn't what bugged me. I guess I'm too much into the \\"happily ever after\\" type of romances, but cheating bugs me. Okay, he didn't really cheat, but he sure didn't have a problem with getting up close and personal with another woman - until Rachel busted him.This was definitely my least favorite of the trilogy. I'm glad it's over. I'd hate to see it get worse."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This novel revolves around Rachel Lear, a carefree student with a big heart and even bigger ambitions. Her biggest problem is a nasty habit of letting people walk all over her. As a result of this she is flat broke. To make matters worse, a tree has fallen on her house and partially across her neighbors fence, causing a broken window and a lawsuit.Rachel curses the world while her ex-boyfriend keeps showing up at her house uninvited and her best friend Dagne keeps convincing her to try some white magic as a way to change her luck. Rachel jokingly wishes for true love with a hot man with an accent.Low and behold Flynn Oliver shows up in her life. He is a temporary transplant from England, Stateside working as a computer programmer. He has his eyes on Rachel from the moment he meets her, but she finds the situation more than a little bit curious.When a rash of art thefts plagues the city Rachel finds out that not everyone, or everything is as it seems to be."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"What really ruined this book for me was not the writing---the writing was alright---it was the main character. The storyline held promise but the characterization of Rachel was horrible. She is such a clueless doormat that you're far pass feeling sorry for her and end up questioning how such an idiot can even be smart enough to get through all the schooling to get her phd.The scene where she rescues a chained cat seemed so force, as if added in to drive home the point that she was a sweet, caring, unselfish person. So wonderful that she couldn't bring herself to tolerate celebrating Thanksgiving with her father---who is battling cancer, supported his entire family so they can live in luxury, and is painted as the bad guy for cutting off his 31 year old daughter just because he wants her to do something with her life. She helped buy groceries for a grieving, newly widowed man in her weaving class but can't be bothered to have her dad come visit to make amends?So many parts of this story aggravated me to no end that I find myself cringing in disbelieve at how much I can't tolerate the main character. She is so broke that she can't pay her utility bill but she could charge a $400 dress to her account credit card for a date?! She has practically no food in her house but she waves the fee of half her weaving class and lets her freeloading exboyfriend eat whats left in her frig? She's up for a phd in history but doesn't recognized all the smuggled artifacts laying in her house are authentic?It seems that making Rachel so clueless and prone to be taken advantage of is meant to make her seem endearing but I find myself wishing incessantly that it were possible to reach into the pages of the book and strangle the idiocy out of her. Even up until the end I was frustrated with Rachel when she thoughtlessly flies to the location of the bad guy (or antagoist or perpetrator, whatev). It was made to look like a brave act, like she'd finally started to take full control of her life when all I could think was that she'd been so easily tricked that she deserved to be taken advantage of.Nevertheless, I managed to finished the book so it does serve its purpose being entertaining even if only because I felt complelled to turn the page only to see how much more clueless Rachel can get. Reading the overload of British slang by Flynn and all the \\"Yo\\" and \\"Dude\\" by Joe was hilarious. It was too much, the author went overboard to emphasize the dialogue differences between the two. This is my first book by this author and its made such a bad impression that I hesitate to pick up another of her books"},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"After reading Ms. London's BEAUTY QUEEN, I was anxious to read MISS FORTUNE. However, the book just never caught on with me and the heroine is definitely someone I wouldn't want to know or be. I have a problem with romance novel heroines who are in their 30's and still living off their parents yet get angry when their life goals, etc. are questioned. After a while I gave up on Rachel and wondered what anyone would see in her. She really had no redeeming values. I did like the book's hero more and loved how Ms. London used a lot of British slang with this character. I found him charming, but once again, couldn't see what he saw in his lady love."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I will not write a synopsis as this has been done very well before I put my 2 cents in. I must say that I loved the first two books in this series (and have really liked most of Miss London's previous books), but this one had me skimming which is always a bad sign. I never believed the chemistry between the two main characters. There was some good suspense and a mystery to solve which was the only reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 2. I know others will disagree with me, and hope they do. For me, this one just didn't do it."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is the third and last book in London's latest trilogy and I found it to be very entertaining. I loved the cast of characters, including her weird friend Dagne. Flynn and Rachel had wonderful chemistry and even though I enjoyed her Rogues of Regent Street more, these were definitely worth the read. However, my favorite of the three was Beauty Queen."},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I was so dissapointed by this book! I read the first two and thought while they were not up to Julia London's previous books, they were light airplane reads. After 50 pages of Rachel not doing anything but letting her friends use her and eat, I was bored, bored, bored.I only skimmed throught to see her parents moving forward.I do not recommend this book at all!"},{"Title":"Miss Fortune (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I LOVED the first two books in the series, MATERIAL GIRL and BEAUTY QUEEN, and I was really looking forward to MISS FORTUNE but this one just didn't do it for me. I really had to struggle to finish it and my gut tells me to give it two stars, but I didn't hate it, I did enjoy the last hundred pages or so, and I like the author thus three stars.Rachel is the youngest of the spoiled Lear sisters and far from the free-spirited, flaky hippie chick I had expected, I found her more under-achieving, incredibly insecure, lacking-in-common-sense doormat! She's thirty-one years old but acts like she's 21. She's been in school for ten years, generally floating through life directionless and wonders why her dad gives her grief! Her father is dying and all she wants to do is avoid him because he might yell at her! I found her character both annoying and amazing at the same time. Unfortunately, rather than empathize or identify with her I kept yelling at her to grow up and gain a spine! And to kick Myron to the curb for pity's sake! I'm sorry, but she was such a cliche, whereas Robin and Rebecca were sympathetic and believable to me, Rachel just wasn't.And if you're expecting a lot of romance, forget it. It takes forever for Rachel and Flynn to get together and even then, I never bought into the romance, nor did I feel much chemistry between them. You can figure out what's going to happen almost from the very beginning and as a result, I found myself just generally bored up until about page 300.And Flynn just didn't do it for me at all. He seemed perhaps not cold, but remote and I never believed he had real feelings for her - except that the author told me so! Very little of the story is told from his perspective and I didn't ever have a strong sense of what he was thinking or feeling. I guess she did this to keep mystery and suspense around his character, but I had figured out who he was and what he was up to from very early on. And I think she went a bit far with the Brit slang/terminology.So what did I like? The continuation of the Bonnie/Aaron storyline was really satisfying. And just when Dagne was getting on my last nerve, she becomes lots of fun in the last hundred pages.Overall, disappointing but I will look forward to future books and consider this a fluke."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"Leonard's &quot;new&quot; book was actually written in the mid-1960s, I suspect. Whether it's a novel long out of print or simply an unpublished work, &quot;The Big Bounce&quot; is more for Leonard completists than newcomers.Hard-luck protagonist Jack Ryan loses his job at a migrant camp in Michigan after assaulting his crew leader. Resort owner Walter Majestyk hires Jack, despite the fact that his old boss, Bob Jr., told him to leave town. Bob Jr. and migrant camp owner Ray Ritchie are seeing Nancy on the side, unbeknownst to each other. Once Nancy learns that Jack's past consists of a life of crime, she seduces him into a plot to steal $50,000 from Ray.Those who found Leonard's last few books to be a bit tepid might also be disappointed in &quot;The Big Bounce.&quot; Aside from being a dated piece of work, the novel falls more comfortably into a romance fantasy than traditional Leonard crime. Still, the impeccable characterisation and the way the plot pits characters against each other is indicative of Leonard's earlier works. Those looking for another &quot;Ryan's Rules&quot; or &quot;Get Shorty&quot; won't find as much bite here. If anything, &quot;The Big Bounce&quot; serves best as a means to chronicle Leonard's progession than fulfilling the need for an all-new Leonard novel (no more sequels, please)."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"This novel is not a mystery, rather an all-to-true to life expose of the kind of characters that we read about in newspapers (or know in real life) that live on the fringes. I couldn't help but see Hillary Swank as Nancy and George Clooney as Ryan (if I am not mistaken Jack Ryan reappears in Out Of Sight) the same role he did play in the movie.I love Leonard and think he is a must for any serious lover of crime fiction (not just &quot;mystery novels&quot;) read him all the way through and you will have fully explored unknown territory though the American psyche....If Out Of Sight is a 5, then The Big Bounce is a 4. I'd give Swag 4.5, Be Cool a 4.5, Get Shorty a 5, and Cuba Libre only a 3.If you like Leonard go to Jim Thompson next, or vice versa, or Andew Vacchs, but also I would say Cormac McCarthy (the writer that most resembles Leonard in my opinion)or even Russell Banks, Raymond Chandler or Richard Russo."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"The big bounce threw me until I realize it was in the tradition of the noir such as I married a Dead Man, The Postman always rings twice, The Killer inside of me and Pick-up.It was't going to follow the more modern concrete line but a more abstract plot. If classic noir isn't your strong point you might be totally lost if you expect a version of Mr.Paradise, Rum Punch or others of his work. The characters are strong, the plot is noir which might seem pointless or weak to those expecting a 'traditional' mystery. [Agatha Christie is over to the left thank you.] The play between the thrill seeker in life and those who just coast a long is strong. It is suprising who wins in the end or do they?If you are looking for a nice tight sewed up ending where the bad guys are carted off to jail and everything is sewn up neatly in a cute little package.. Aggie, the Cat who, and Sandford is off to the left thank you. If you want a bit of intellectual exercise or just plain miss the old noir of the 30s to the 50s come on down. It is a real rare bird these days."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"Leonard's style is to create strong, engaging characters and \\"see what happens.\\" This story has neither interesting characters, nor does very much happen. Leonard is also famous for looking into the lives of petty crooks - but these are among the pettiest. A couple of selfish and self-indulgent losers get their kicks throwing rocks through the windows of homes. The readers are invited to giggle with glee at the stupid fools who live within, and stumble into the night to see what has happened. I tossed this book after reading the first half - a first for me. I have read every Elmore Leonard I could get my hands on. But this one, I couldn't wait get rid of. Skip this book."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"I picked up a paperback of THE BIG BOUNCE somewhere and was thrilled because I thought it was a new Elmore Leonard. It wasn't until I was halfway through the book that I discovered it was written in 1969, almost 35 years ago. That is how well this book has held up: it reads like a fresh story. And smooth. That is the word that comes to mind: the writing in THE BIG BOUNCE is smooth. It flows and moves along easily. Maybe the best writing I've read of Elmore Leonard's works and I've read many. It's a subdued, subtle story with a great fight scene and a tense house B&amp;E scene. It features Jack Ryan, maybe a little slow en la cabeza but who can swing a bat (or a tree limb) and knows a 100 ways to break into a house, and Nancy as the ambitious rich guy's GF who is more than a little psychotic. Rather than a roller coaster ride of plot twists, this novel is like like a fine vintage wine to be savored and enjoyed on the veranda with a good cigar. Get this book and light one up."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"Jack Ryan is a small-time migrant worker/burgular/baseball player who's never accomplished much, aside from getting arrested a couple of times and finding a job as a hotel handyman. Nancy Hayes is a rich man's girlfriend who's made a life out of taking advantage of men and whose idea of a good time is shooting out windows and running people off the road. When the two of them get together, Nancy sees a guy who can help her latest boyfriend pay off, while Jack just sees someone attractive and interesting, but whom he can't quite figure out.It's hard not to like any of Elmore Leonard's books; the characters are always shady, the plots are always interesting, and the dialogue is always fantastic. The Big Bounce is no different, though the ending is a little odd. This isn't Leonard's best book, but it's still entertaining and a pretty quick read. If you like Leonard's other work, you won't be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"Bouncing around is what Nancy Hayes does best, flitting out into the resort town, shooting out windows, leading men astray, planning for that big, cheap, yet dangerous, thrill.But Jack Ryan stays oh so close to her, hoping, hoping ... for what? Certainly Nancy is stylish and cunning, but a psycho-babe is not what he needs, now that he's escaped from the dangers of migrant work. Why doesn't he just go home to Detroit, grab himself a beer and a nice woman?Elmore Leonard, author of THE BIG BOUNCE, probes his daring hero's motivation, but can never give us a clear answer to Jack's attraction. Why would anyone want to climb into Nancy's web willingly? Why get that close to such a manipulator, unless, oh the horror, he's just too stupid to leave?Once again, Leonard creates a fictional woman we've read about in our local papers. She's the babe who got our friend in jail on trumped-up sex charges. She's the one who was involved with the captain of the college basketball team, causing him to lose his scholarship. She's the one who smiled as the TV cameras whirred, designating her as the most dangerous woman in black. Oh boy, she loves fame, and she doesn't mind taking you to your own grave, while she shovels the first load of dirt on top.Gentlemen, read this cautionary tale before some mysterious lady winks at you in the cocktail room of your neighborhood motel, and you go along with one of her intrigues.Larry Rochelle, author of the mysteries DEATH & DEVOTION, DANCE WITH THE PONY and TRACETRACKS."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"I am an avid Elmore Leonard fan and have lost count of the number of books of his that I have read. Some of them rank with the best crime fiction ever written. However, this is not one of them. In fact, this is the first one I have read that is actually bad. The main problem is the very thin plot, which Leonard all too frequently compensates for with flashbacks to the character's earlier life, which have nothing whatever to do with the plot. It is obvious that he does this just to fill space and stretch this short story out to book length.That having been said, I must say that I liked the book's ending. It was surprising and abrupt. But this book is only for Dutch-ophiles who may be curious to see what the master's early work was like."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"Dutch Leonard doesn't like to let you relax. He keeps you wondering if Jack Ryan is a bad guy or a good guy with some bad habits. Every time you begin to get comfortable with the direction of the story, a new twist triggers the anxiety attack that won't allow you to set it down. And then there's Nancy, I've known a few like her and she's downright scary. A book that will genuinely hold your interest."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"The most astonishing and strange thing about this book I find are the quotes from newspapers saying it's a great book. When I finished the book I thought the clue, story and good ending everyone is talking about were simply missing as I bought it secondhand on a trip trough China. I found out that the book really has no ending, no suspense, no clue and no good reason te read it. Too bad I just found out after I finished it. It's really a question of whether it should be called a story. I have no clue why someone would read or write it, as it is about as interesting as listening in on a conversation between some dull people on a train."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"Elmore Leonard's writing sets the Gold Standard for noir fiction. He treats words like fine-cut jewels and never wastes a single one on unnecessary ornamentation. He is so disciplined in following his own rules (&#34;Kill All Modifiers&#34;) and his ear for dialogue is so true that opening one of his stories is like moving into a new neighborhood for a few hours. Like a great actor who can deliver a whole speech with an eyebrow lift, Leonard can package a character in less material than it would take to stop the bleeding from a razor nick. I've rediscovered him, only to realize that I had no idea how large his oeuvre is, or how deep and rich. Every one is different, and every one is captivating. If you want to learn how to write anything well, read Leonard, and take notes. You'll be at the knee of the master."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"I've read most of the non-western Elmore Leonard collection. I've enjoyed just about everything he has written. The Big Bounce is probably near the bottom of my favorites. Jack Ryan just isn't that attractive a protagonist, and the story just didn't have that much &#34;bounce.&#34; What's at the bottom of the list? Probably Tishomingo Blues."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"Sorry Leonard but the 'Big Bounce' is in need of a few more pounds of air. Not quite flat but doesn't jump off the page as we're accustomed to with this author. Although his b efforts are better than most. Jack and the lady make quite a pair. It's obvious that she's playing him and the question remains as to whether he'll survive the relationship or not. I'm not telling but I wil say that the girl makes a heck of a villian. Her unpredictable behavior will hook the reader and you'll have somebody to root against. Naturally, the hero is typical Leonard, hard luck guy operating on the fringes of the law. I suppose that in the presence of evil, you need good and Jack fills the role. No model citizen, mind you but he would stop to change someone's flat tire. I might have enjoyed the story more if it hadn't of felt so dated. Normally this isn't a deal breaker for me but in this case, the story just felt tired. Even with this being the case, there's worse things than reading this book on a lazy afternoon."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"The Big Bounce was an early (1969) crime novel for which Elmore Leonard had trouble finding a publisher. It isn't Leonard's best novel, but it is still an entertaining book that would make a great read for the beach or a lazy Sunday afternoon.The plot concerns an ex-baseball player named Jack Ryan who ends up working at a resort in Michigan's \\"thumb\\" region. Ryan meets a femme fatale named Nancy who is an excitement addict - she gets a \\"bounce\\" each time she breaks a rule. Of course, Nancy is a beauty - readers learn that she was once voted \\"Miss Perky Pickle\\" - haha. When Jack meets her, Nancy is the kept woman of a wealthy man from whom she plans to steal $50,000 cash - with Jack's help.Though the novel is an early effort from Leonard, it has his typical strengths. There are several vivid characters to keep the reader interested. Also, Leonard makes the setting come alive. Finally, there is enough action to keep the book from bogging down - I found that the 300+ pages turned easily.While I like the Big Bounce, there are some negatives. Readers may feel disappointed in the way that Leonard ends the novel. He seems to have everything set up for a great conclusion, but the ending is mediocre - at best. Also, Nancy is extremely unlikeable. In later novels, Leonard greatly improved the depth and realism of his female characters.I am surprised by the negative reviews on Amazon.com. The Big Bounce is not perfect, but it is a solid, readable crime novel. Leonard's fan should read it."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"The prolific output of crime fiction writer Elmore Leonard somehow eluded me, and there is a possibility I took on the wrong book for my first encounter. He's written some 35 novels, and \\"The Big Bounce\\" at its release more than thirty years ago represented his move away from westerns.The story holds up surprisingly well, despite its age, and - if not for references to then-current Detroit baseball players and the prices of homes - it could have been written last year. Baseball is the background of Jack Ryan, a washed-up minor leaguer who has fallen into petty crime.He's not the brightest crayon in the box, but he's colorful enough to make up for it. Immediately after accepting a handyman's job, he meets a high-roller's mistress who believes Jack and his criminal background are the ticket to the scamming of her Sugar Daddy's payroll.Jack isn't so easily convinced, although he has a tough time saying no to Nancy, who is bored with the life of the idle rich. Her idea of fun is throwing rocks through beach house windows and then running away when the lights come on.Leonard's casual style makes it easy to fall in with his characters, wondering to what degree the thrill-seeking Nancy will go before her actions will finally bring her down, and marveling at Jack's ability to float along at life's fringes. The strength of \\"The Big Bounce\\" is in its characters, but unfortunately, there is little in the way of plot to keep the story heading toward a finish. That may be the reason the book has no conclusion. You turn the last page looking for the rest. There isn't any more.To appreciate his writing style, \\"The Big Bounce\\" is a ball, but as a well-plotted story, it simply falls flat."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"Elmore Leonard has done much better than this and I am usually a big fan. Jack Ryan and Nancy Hayes are two very good characters and are well developed.Unfortunately, a lot of Elomore Leonard's usual humor is missing from this book. Somehow the pacing seems off as well.Leonard's ability to find distinct locations for his capers and describe them well works here as usual. I would never have suspected that cucumber farms and Michigan beach vacation spots for a crime novel"},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"Jack is a former minor league ballplayer who dabbles in breaking and entering. That is when he's not engaged in more legitimate endeavors like carpet cleaning or picking cucumbers. Nancy is a risk taking party girl with a mean streak a mile long. The Big Bounce is largely about the odd relationship between these two rather unsympathetic characters. Nancy wants to use Jack to pull off a big heist. Jack pretty much just lives from day to day. The words loyalty, ambition and commitment evidently are not part of his vocabulary.Elmore Leonard's talent for writing realistic dialogue is well represented here. As is his signature habit of populating his books with quirky characters. The plot is somewhat on the thin side and a few of the scenes appear to have been added in for padding. The Big Bounce is an easy and amusing read. But not one of Leonard's best efforts by a long shot."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"A bit slower than what I expected. I was more interested in the quick flashback sequences between Jack Ryan and Leon Woody. It was entertaining, but slowed to the pace of a geriatric bingo game, at times. The plot's not too engaging, but Leonard's knack for writing from a character's point of view keeps you amused.I'd recommend &quot;Maximum Bob&quot; as my favorite Leonard book, so far.A sidenote, but Detroit Tiger fans may get a kick out of the last few chapters."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"I am an avid Elmore Leonard fan. While this book is dated, the basic premise of the story had all the traditional earmarks of a Leonard novel.Once the book begins hitting the climax, the book takes a totally different direction. The main storyline is aborted.I was listening to an unabridged audio version of this book. I returned the book to Amazon since I thought I had an incomplete book. The book ended on the 5th tape with no warning that it was complete. A sixth tape was added which started with an Elmore Leonard short story that was included in a previous book.Don't waste your time with this book."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"There is no real ending in this book. After the reading the last chapter the book leaves you asking yourself, then what? The characters are interesting and Nancy is surely a woman to stay away from and not unlike some women I have known in my lifetime.

This volume, written in 1969 (and a bit dated as a result), is set in the \\"thumb\\" of Michigan (Port Austin area) - not Hawaii, as in the 2004 movie.The book mostly traces the behavior of two characters, Jack and Nancy, neither of whom are interesting enough to care about. Actually, Jack isn't a bad guy - he's just not given a good story to be part of. There is the start of a good story and a potential theft of some money, but that all falls off the bone - the promise of a good yarn is as deceptive as the cover of the new paperback.It had been a long time since I'd read any Elmore Leonard and I really wanted to give him a try again. This book fell flat, had no resolution to my liking, and left me puzzled about why not one but two movie adaptations had been made from it.The reason for two stars is: 1) decent dialogue, a Leonard trait; and 2) set in Michigan, where my grandparents lived so I recognized the descriptions of the area."},{"Title":"The Big Bounce","review":"Sorry Mr. Leonard, but this book is awful.

It takes a while for the plot to build meticusesly, it really starts to pick up after you're two thirds into it, it starts to climax, and then nothing happens...it seems like Leonard just got bored with it and coped out.

On top of that, she's a very pleasant person so being inside her head as she goes about her day is fairly uplifting. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the Little House books, Westerns, or anything similar."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"Started out with just the sample of this book and I had to get the whole thing! I love the writters' detial. The adventures are great! I can easily imagine what the writer is describing."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This book started out as a good read; however I realized that the letters were probably not originally written as such and actually mailed to a recipient. Written in letter-style format for publication, but not mailed to another person. The Publisher's Note a the beginning of the original 1914 edition (not sure if the same introduction is in the newer editions) states that these are genuine letters, written from a writer to her former employer, that have been published just as they were originally written.They do not have the content of genuine letters. In not one of the letters does the writer ever address the woman she is writing to, other than to say something along the lines of \\"I received your letter to me\\", or \\"I received your card\\", before immediately launching into a long tale without again addressing the person she is supposedly writing to, until she signs off at the end with goodbye. Once or twice something is mentioned along the lines of \\"you seemed to think that in one of my letters I spoke boastfully\\", or \\"perhaps my last long letter was too much for you\\", but that's it.In a true letter, (or email, or verbal conversation, etc.), in addition to writing about their own experiences, one also responds to news that has been received from the person to whom they are writing, and asks the person to whom they are writing, questions about what is going on in that other person's life. This letter writer doesn't ever do that. In all the long letters written over several years' period of time, there would at least be some of this. She never really addresses the recipient of her letters in a personal style.There'd at least be a bit of \\"I was excited to hear about your new grandchild\\" or \\"How is your neighbor old Mr. Jones doing these days?, tell him I said hello\\". There'd be some mention of \\"My best wishes on son's marriage\\", or \\"I remember that time we we enjoyed that outing together\\" Or \\"sorry to hear about your recent illness\\", etc. etc.You could come up with any number of things someone would and does write about at length, in just about any letter they'd send to someone, where they would write about things also going on in the life of the recipient of their letter. The writer herself states in the book numerous times how she loves to write, and can't stop writing when she composes a letter, but there's never a mention of anything about the lady she is writing to, or mention about news that her friend sent her in letters that she herself received.If the letters were actually sent to the former employer as it states in the book, then the former employer is the person who would have been in possession of the letters for publication. Even if the author somehow made copies of the letters she'd written, how did she get them published in book form, by a reputable publisher, (with her living in Wyoming) and the original 1914 book is illustrated by the famous N.C. Wyeth---when the last letter printed in the book is dated November 1913?This book is somewhat enjoyable as a piece of fiction based on real experiences, akin to the \\"Little House\\" series, and I'm sure some of the incidents in the book happened in some fashion and have been fictionalized into a letter-style format.But \\"genuine letters, published as they were written\\". I think not."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I agree completely with all of the glowing reviews of this book. In fact, this is the first review I have written on Amazon and am doing so just because it is that engaging and inspiring. This book was floating around my grandmother's house (published 1914, hand note to my grandmother dated 1917 in the front cover) and I was lucky enough to come across it.What I'd like to point out in this review is how remarkable and inspiring it was to read about this uneducated, poor woman with hardly any training of any kind who set about to succeed in life by the power of her mind...I found it to be a testimony to how the Law of Attraction and Mind Power work in action - unwittingly described by this strong and doggedly optimistic woman.Over and over again we are given Elinore's outlook on life and its subsequent consequences. Every single hardship that Elinore describes is then immediately mined for the positive. Over and over again we see our heroine end up in circumstances that would throw any one of us into rage or depression, but she just really and truthfully finds the \\"humor\\" or the \\"fun\\" in it and, you know what, Eventually things do turn out just fine with her. Wonderful, in fact.Here is a portrait of a very soulful, intelligent, humorous, insightful and even spiritual (not that she preaches in any religious way - a universal spirituality just comes through in certain passages) human being who is determined to wrest every last bit of fun and beauty out of life no matter what it throws her way. More than being an \\"accurate\\" depiction of life out on the west (after all, the accuracy of any autobiographical tale will be tainted by the viewpoint it is written from), I see it as more the depiction of one woman's bold venture out west and into life. Carpe Diem and then some. Adventuresome, entrepreneurial, entertaining and inspiring. So glad I came across it.PS: Lovers of Abraham-Hicks, I invite you to read this book and note the correlations!"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This was a very well written book in the way it portrayed life in the area and the time frame the events took place. It also had a definite charm the way the lady described her day to day life. She related the intricacies of her surroundings, the sights, the smells, the moods; having lived in areas with the same features it took me back to glorious times despite the hardships endured. This story ended way to soon to suit me, I could have just kept reading and enjoying her journey through life."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This first-hand account takes you back to a by-gone era - so different and yet not so long ago. I thoroughly enjoyed reading her story. The details and emotions combined with her day-to-day activities made me long for a visit to that time in history."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This book is an easy read and so entertaining! It's well written and very interesting. She describes her adventures with great attention to detail and makes everything seem like you're right there with her. What a great find!"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"What an absolutely amazing read. In 1909 widowed Elinot Pruitt Stewart took her little daughter west to Wyoming where she filed a land claim and started a ranch. The story is told in a series of letters written home to a woman for whom she worked as a \\"washer-woman.\\" Her descriptions of the realities of frontier life and the people she encounters are absolutely captivating. In one unforgettable letter she tells of having a \\"day off\\" from all her chores so she packs up her daughter and heads off into the mountains, catching fish and shooting squirrels and sage chickens along the way. That night they are surprised by a snowstorm and seek refuge in the cabin of an old mountain man named Zebulon Pike Parker.This is just a great, inspiring, astonishing story!"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"These fascinating letters written between 1909 and 1913 by a woman who homesteaded in Wyoming were free on Kindle. I enjoy learning about those intrepid pioneer women who went west when conditions were harsh and dangerous. Perhaps I want to know more because my own great-grandparents homesteaded in Nebraska, and both my grandfather and his sister were born on the homestead. That's also where my great-grandfather lost one eye when he was chopping wood, a friend of theirs was murdered by an outlaw, and then my grandfather got polio. After all that, they returned to Illinois and a more peaceful life.If ever a woman was made for the life of a pioneer, though, it was Elinore Rupert, as she signed her name before marrying Clyde Stewart. She was the single mother of a toddler and full of dreams to see Alaska and Hawaii and do all sorts of things when she decided to skip the Civil Service exam she had registered for and take a job as a housekeeper for a homesteader in Wyoming. Eventually she married her employer, a \\"gude mon\\" who played his bugpeep (bagpipes) every evening.Her daughter Jerrine called her stepdad \\"our Clyde.\\" Soon she had a little brother but he died as a baby. Later two more boys were born. Jerrine wrote about one of them, \\"My brother Calvin is very sweet. God had to give him to us because he squealed so much he sturbed the angels. We are not angels so he Dont sturb us.\\"They have many adventures which Elinore writes about in her letters to a former employer and friend, Mrs. Coney. She and her daughter get lost in a blizzard at one point and are running out of food. Then they see a light and hear a voice which fortuitously is that of a bachelor settler. He takes them to his cabin to warm and feed them, and he becomes a lifelong friend. In another excursion Elinore, Clyde and friends discover two Mormon women who have been left in cabins alone, and one is in labor. They deliver the baby and later return with an old-fashioned Christmas including tree and gifts for the Mormons.One thing I do like about my Kindle is that I can find free books like this, something I would probably never have discovered without Kindle. I recommend this for anyone who is interested in the pioneer life in America."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I can't review this collection of letters highly enough. It's been said elsewhere that this should be required high school reading and I whole-heartedly agree. It is not simply educational in regard to the American pioneer lifestyle, but also an excellent example of the pioneering spirit that made America great. And just as importantly, it is incredibly interesting. All too often educators focus on all the problems and wrongs in history when it might perhaps be more conducive to society to teach the proper way of doing things and, more importantly, the proper mindset to have when going about doing these things. And while it is good to learn, it is even better to be entertained while learning and here we have both occurring simultaneously.Here we have an admittedly uneducated woman who not only learned how to read and write clearly and rivetingly, but obviously relished these hard-learned abilities and sought to employ them to the best of her abilities, even asking the recipient of her letters for the names and addresses of other lonely, elderly women who might appreciate corresponding with her as well.Here we have an orphaned child who chose, along with her siblings, to live with her elderly grandmother rather than be separated from said siblings, knowing that this decision entailed the trading of her childhood for the responsibilities of a capable and nurturing adult. Yet we don't find the rage, bitterness or complaints (excuses) associated with this loss of parents and adolescence that we'd typically find in modern biographies. Rather, we find her thankful that this experience equipped her for the trials of the future, like the time she got out and mowed hay with her employer when there were not enough men around, something not done by women of her time period. In fact, it was so inconceivable for a woman to mow hay that her employer never even asked her. Rather, \\"I was afraid to tell him I could mow for fear he would forbid me to do so. But one morning, when he was chasing a last hope of help, I went down to the barn, took out the horses, and went to mowing. I had enough cut before he got back to show him I knew how, and as he came back manless he was delighted as well as surprised.\\"Here we find a fiesty, witty and colorful woman unafraid to embrace the people around her and make the most of every situtation. Her every experience is chock full of so much entertaining description and zest for life that the reader is held captive by her every penstroke. Take, for example, the following passage:\\"About noon the first day out we came near a sheep-wagon, and stalking along ahead of us was a lanky fellow, a herder, going home for dinner. Suddenly it seemed to me I should starve if I had to wait until we got where we had planned to stop for dinner, so I called out to the man, 'Little Bo-Peep, have you anything to eat? If you have, we'd like to find it.' And he answered, 'As soon as I am able it shall be on the table, if you'll but trouble to get behind it.' Shades of Shakespeare! Songs of David, the Shepherd Poet! What do you think of us? Well, we got behind it, and a more delicious \\"it\\" I never tasted. Such coffee! And out of SUCH a pot! I promised Bo-Peep that I would send him a crook with pink ribbons on it, but I suspect he thinks I am a crook without the ribbons.\\"Here too we find the capability of a woman to achieve her own independence, not merely for the sake of independence but in a way that betters herself and the lives of those around her (something that seems to be generally lacking in the modern \\"independent\\" woman, who so often strikes me as a rebel without a cause striking her fists against the glass ceiling that, not society, but her own excuses have put in place). Every time she breaks out of societal constraints it is a healthy, purposeful break and not simply done for the sake of being shocking and rebellious. Take, for example, the following excerpt:\\"After I had mailed my other letter I was afraid that you would think me plumb bold about the little Bo-Peep, and was a heap sorrier than you can think. If you only knew the hardships these poor men endure. They go two months together and sometimes it is months before they see another soul, and rarely ever a woman. I wouldn't act so free in town, but these men see people so seldom that they are awkward and embarrassed. I like to put them at ease, and it is to be done only by being a kind of hail-fellow-well-met with them. So far not one has ever misunderstood me and I have been treated with every courtesy and kindness, so I am powerfully glad you understand. They really enjoy doing these little things like fixing our dinner, and if my poor company can add to any one's pleasure I am too glad.\\"And all throughout the letters, the one thing you cannot escape is her determination to have a positive outlook on life. A lot of people think that happiness just happens, that it either is or isn't. But the real truth of the matter is that happiness is a choice, and Elinore exemplifies this better than most. She was an orphan. She was a widow. She was a woman abandoned in the West with a small child, no money, and no easy place to go and yet she prevailed. And in the end she wrote, \\"When you think of me, you must think of me as one who is truly happy. It is true, I want a great many things I haven't got, but I don't want them enough to be discontented and not enjoy the blessings that are mine. I have my home among the blue mountains, my healthy, well-formed children, my clean, honest husband, my kind, gentle milk cows, my garden which I make myself...I have the best, kindest neighbors and I have my dear absent friends. Do you wonder I am so happy? When I think of it all, I wonder how I can crowd all my joy into one short life.\\"If you liked these excerpts, well, there is a lot more where those came from! Yes, these are Letters of a Woman Homesteader, but they are SO MUCH MORE. Here we find the riveting story of a woman on the cusp of civilization and the savage beauty of wilderness. Here we find glorious descriptions of daily life and the interesting characters that peopled the West. Yet here we also find suspenseful descriptions of her many and varied scrapes with near death. At times humorous, at times poignant, always captivating, these are letters that I wish had been written to MYSELF rather than her former employer. In fact, such is the power of her voice and writing, that I wish I could sit down and have a cup of tea with her and know her as a personal friend rather than as simply the author of some palfrey letters I enjoyed. I aspire to learn from her and be more like her, and if that in itself is not enough inspiration for you to read these Letters, perhaps the price of the kindle version will be."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I enjoyed this short novel very much. > > There appears to be a chunk of the text missing at 98% The reader is about to hear some detail on a shooting and all that we see is ****** The next paragraph picks up in a completely different setting. I'm assuming there are at least five to ten pages missing, but I haven't compared the paperback to the ebook. Was I the only person to experience this?What a nice story. Interesting peeks into a woman's life in the raw west. There was just enough detail to keep the reader involved, but not too much to turn it tedious or boring.All in all a nice story.

I would change this from womens' studies to historical studies because it is a timeless study. I moved from the city to the country 40 years ago and lived the life of a homesteader with some of the modern conveniences, so I could relate to the hard work of all these women.

She quit her job as laundrywoman of Mrs. Coney and set out to become a homesteader.The letters, written in a very delightful manner speaks of Mrs. Stewart's life experiences as a homesteader, as well as her encounters with different people in her home life and in her journeys. More importantly, the letters speak of women's strength and independence, that anything is possible and that there should be no limit as to what one can do and achieve just because one is female.This collection, though written in the early part of the 20th century is applicable in any time and era, an inspiration to woman of any race.

This work stirs a sense of adventure and simultaneously creates a longing for the simplicity that existed in that period of history.

I found Ms. Stewart to be funny and very likeable. This does not feel as though it were written from 1912-1914 as Elinore Pruitt Stewart is a very \\"modern\\" woman in so many ways.

The year is 1909 and few women, or for that matter men, have such energy. She also has a young daughter to think about but her heart's set so off into the unknown she flees. Stewart's nature writing is enchanting. It's sensual. With the help of her new neighbors she tentatively begins to get a foothold on the almost uninhabited land but she also takes time out to wander her new country where she learns wilderness skills, faces fears and meets some fascinating people. The entire story is told through letters that she writes to her last employer without a peep from her correspondent though we know she's engaged because Elinore responds to her questions and thoughts. Elinore has an infectious bonhomie that's irresistible but I'd have read this book for the nature descriptions and the evocation of the old West. Brave woman.

For some unknown reason I've always been fascinated with the early pioneers and the later homesteaders.

She reminds me of how I might have been in that era - not afraid to strike out on a new adventure.I highly recommend this read for anyone tired of reading the same story, clich&eacute;s, predictable plots/endings (yawnnnn!) try true life."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This was an interesting read through letters of a woman telling a friend about how she was living in her \\"new home\\". Not so much detail but still a lot of story to it."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This book was fun, warm, and anything but boring. Elinore has a way with words- I found her letters all kinds of entertaining...what lucky friends she had. Read about her experiences building a new life for herself and her daughter, Jerrine. The letters begin in 1909 where she is situated in rural Utah. This stout woman endured hardships but also had her share of happy times, always seeming cheery and optimistic. Perhaps best of all- this little gem is free for your Kindle."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"Really enjoyed this book. It is an account of the life of a homesteader in her own words. Very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This is a series of actual letters spanning from 1909 to 1913 written by a woman, a single mother, who has settled in the Wyoming wilderness. She is writing to her former employer. She is constantly optimistic and cheerful, looking for the positive in everything. Although bad things happen, she plays them down and often omits them from her narratives. She is mostly fearless and doesn't worry much. She loves natural beauty, the mountains, and independence. She also loves to write, has great wit and humor, and is self educated. If this were fiction it would have excellent character development, because the author of the letters is a strong admirable woman.Since it is not fiction, and is true to the historical times, there are a few possibly offensive passages. She tells of making candy in the shape of black people and uses the \\"n\\" word. This story is matter of fact and isn't intended as offensive but in today's world it isn't \\"PC.\\" She also does not like Mormons and portrays the men consistently in an unfavorable light. If the reader is in no danger from insult from these things, it is a highly recommended book.It is especially recommended for those interested in the history of the American west and woman's studies. As she writes of her neighbors their solitude surprises me. It's amazing how many were widowed women (strong independent ones) living hours away from each other. She writes that homesteading for a woman is not as hard as \\"taking in wash\\" in the city, and the beauty of the mountains is a wonderful benefit."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a previous reviewer and found it a bit of serendipity. It is the story of a gutsy woman miles ahead of her time. You will enjoy her letters reporting back to her former employer, regarding her experiences homesteading in the early 1900's. The writing is rich and embellishes her experiences with wonderful descriptions of her life and the land she settles. Though I would not have chosen this title, normally, I followed the advise of previous reviewers and glad I did. Hard to beat the price as well."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader is an amazing book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

I found it for free on Kindle, and thought I would give it a shot. The writing is engaging, entertaining, and educational.This book consists of a series of letters written by Ms. Elinore Pruitt Stewart to a friend of hers in town. These letters provide a wonderful view into the lives of rural Wyoming ranchers at the end of the 1800s. Several of the author's friends are widows running their own ranches, and these resourceful women are incredibly inspiring. Her style of writing had me laughing out loud at times.

This book will remind you to savor both the sunsets and your corner grocery store."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"What a fascinating read! This is just as advertised, a collection of letters. Sometimes there are gaps in the story or facts left out that you really wonder about and in a novel, they would be there. But as these are real and they are letters, with perhaps a few of the collection lost, we just have to wonder occasionally. The characters are quirky, funny and delightfully drawn out. I would love to have had a pen-pal like Elinor and now would like to know so much more about her. Not only interesting, her life inspires. I highly recommend this collection."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This is one of the best books that I've read lately. The book is a series of letters from a lady-homesteader to a friend back home, but don't think that it's a musty old history. Eleanore has a way with words and an excellent sense of humor to boot. She's a great story teller and has lots to tell since she does things that most modern women wouldn't think to try. I would highly recommend this book to anyone for the history or just for a good laugh."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This story of a woman homesteader writing letters of her daily life kept me captivated until I finished reading the book.

That other book (a \\"classic\\") remains forgotten - this book had me hooked immediately. As with other reviews, I couldn't believe these were actual letters rather than the work of a talented novelist - the timing, tone and readability were simply superb, and I was acutely disappointed to find I'd reached the end.You cannot help but wonder if you'd have been the laundress who stayed \\"safe\\" with her wash or the pioneer who sees an opportunity and sets upon it whole-heartedly. With births, deaths, love stories and descriptive prose that always stays just shy of purple, you begin to believe you'd have followed Mrs. Stewart's path, even knowing in your heart it's an impossible comparison to make. With our cells & computers, central heat & air, and all the modern conveniences we take for granted... We've fundamentally changed, I think.An aside: Despite some racism of the time, I'd highly recommend this as a teaching assignment for students from 7th grade on to Women's Studies - Mrs. Stewart shows a remarkable-for-its-time feminist/independent streak, contrasted by the privilege her marriage ensures."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I wish I could sit down and have a cup of tea with Elinore.

Turning her hand to the nearest work, she went out by the day to work as a housecleaner and laundress. Later, seeking to better herself, she accepted employment as a housekeeper for a well-to-do Scottish cattleman, Mr. Stewart, who had taken up a quarter-section in Wyoming. The letters, written through several years to a former employer in Denver, tell of her new life in the new country. They are genuine letters, and are printed as written, except for occasional omissions and alterations of names.\\"The letters begin in 1909, apparently right after a homestead act made it possible for the author, Elinore Pruitt Stewart, to claim a homestead of 160 acres in Wyoming. Ms. Stewart is a very resourceful woman as well as a wonderful story-teller. She explains that she never received formal education but she refers to current literature so I am guessing that she has learned to write from her interest in reading. Apparently she was a prolific author in her time and one of her descendants has published a book about her. (There are pictures of her on the web and more information if you want to know more about her.)Elinore has a cheerful and pragmatic approach to life making her well-written letters a lot of fun to read. She mostly writes about events, usually involving meeting some of the other inhabitants of the area, ranging from mountain men to Mormons. She loves to go camping and several times recounts setting out on her horse with her baby and camping in the wilderness. She brings very little supplies, catching trout and snaring rabbits for food. She also does some description of her everyday life which apparently was very busy and full of hard work but she always describes it as fulfilling.I enjoyed this slice of life from another time. It is a quick fun read and definitely worth the price!"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This was a great peek into the life of a woman homesteader. I was delighted to see (through Ms. Pruitt's writings) how many other women homesteaders there were in that time. She has such an engaging writing style and it kept me riveted for the entire collection of letters.By chance I noticed that one of the films on my netflix list is called Heartland. It's a movie from 1980 whose main character, Elinor, is based on these writings. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie even more after reading these letters.If you like smart, spunky, DIY characters, you'll love Ms. Pruitt's writings."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"Letters of a Woman HomesteaderThis was recommended in one of Jessamyn West's memos. It was so interesting I could not put it down. How courageous this woman was and what a great sense of humor. If you ever thought life was too hard to move forward, just read this book and become inspired!"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"Elinore Pruitt Stewart was my grandmother, my father's mother. She died before I was born; I deeply regret never getting to know her, as she was a remarkable woman. Readers who enjoyed the book might also enjoy the film made from it- &quot;Heartland&quot;, directed by Taylor Hackford and starring Conchata Ferrill as Elinore and Rip Torn as Clyde. It is available on video. The script was originally conceived by the Wilderness Women's Project at the University of Montana. My father and mother got to play bit roles as wedding guests. Elinore also wrote &quot;Letters On An Elk Hunt&quot;, as well as many short pieces for periodicals of the day."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"At first, the thought of reading letters from nearly a hundred years ago held very little interest for me but from the second page I was hooked. Just over four hours later I was done reading, and was equipped with a whole new view of not only life in the early 20th century but of the impact woman had on it. Worth reading by both woman and man alike."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I hardly know where to begin. I have nothing but unstinting praise for these letters and the book, except for . . . well, I'll get to that in a moment. Elinore Stewart's writing is a model to be followed by anyone of any time or place on any subject. Clear as a bell, concise yet comprehensive, replete with localisms and skillfully rendered frontier humor, it makes one want to toss the PC and reference library into the trash and move to some unspoiled wilderness. Yet, a caveat. When you finish the book you feel you know this indomitable woman. Then it suddenly strikes you that you don't. Who was Elinore Pruitt Stewart? Where was she born, grow up? Who was the railroader who fathered her daughter, and most of all, what happened to her?"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"What a delightful and uplifting book. I have always been under the impression that life was so dreary for these folks who were homesteaders. But instead, I have been able to see from one perspective how joyous the experience could be. What a wonderful life Elinore made for herself and everyone else. She obviously knew how to make something out of nothing. A young widow who worked as a laundress and then a housekeeper just so she could experience homesteading. Wonderful! Just the sort of spirit needed to be successful. The cast of characters that surrounded her stories are amazing. What a lovely picture of how people helped out each other. It's almost unheard of in todays &quot;get out of my way&quot; society. This is a book I shall keep and reread often. I am so glad that it came my way."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"Too bad the cover classifies this as dutiful-sounding &quot;women's studies,&quot; as it is first-class enjoyable reading for we menfolk, as well. It is an unvarnished account of the pioneer experience without the intrusion of Hollywood veneer or New York editing, and is all the better for it. Anyone with roots in the Midwest or West is going to relate 100% to this saga."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"A wonderful collection of beautiful letters that provide amazing insight into a single mother's adventures in and around the Rocky Mountains in the very early 20th century.

I kept waiting for interest to build but gave up. I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I have been reading this book with a doubt in my mind as to the veracity of the tale. At first I thought, ok, she was an unusually intelligent woman for the time and it is true. Then came the trip to the mountains she took with her baby when Mr. Stewart left and the women took a trip. She rode from 9am until 4pm. This was September. The sun sets early - she had to set up her camp, collect fire wood, tie up her horse, tend to her baby, cook dinner. Doubt it was all done in the 2 hours of day light she had. Then came the wedding were the bride's mother brought lillies of valley and rosebuds for a fall wedding. Where do lillies of the valley grow in the fall? They are an early spring flower. Tiny rose buds in October? Doubt it. I will continue to read the book and am so surprised that no one else is 'checking' the details as I am. Also, she says she is not bragging -but she wrote that she has pity for the women who are doing the laundry/work she did for the lady in Denver for 10cents that she no longer has to do. She has raised her station and feels she is better than they. I think someone had a tremendous imagination while trying to make a new life in the wilderness. I am sure I will find more things to write about and look forward to a discussion with those who agree or disagree."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I could not read the whole book as it was boring from the beginning.

And I mean lady in every good context. Her words regarding Mr. Stewart just made me laugh out loud. I think Elinor might have burned her bra if she lived in the 1960s!What a pleasant, unknown book.

I can understand why some readers think this is not be be believed, but really, pioneer women were of much stronger stuff than today's modern woman. If she wanted to get away for a day or so to camp, fish, hunt, and see the countryside, she had to take her children with her - there was no other choice. Obviously, there wasn't much that stopped this woman from doing whatever she wanted to do.I moved the movie \\"Heartland\\" up in my Netflix queue so I could watch it while this book was still fresh in my mind. This free Kindle selection is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I really liked this book. It was like reading a series of short stories, so it kept my interest. This is a book of letters the author wrote to a friend through a series of years about the events going on in her life and the people in it. Some of the stories were an eye opener about how people lived in the 1800's. I was pleased to see that people were friendly to their neighbors and strangers.I wish those kinds of things still happened.The reason that I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is because some of the letters were incomplete and left me wondering who she was talking about and what happened inbetween each event. The other reason is that the book ended abruptly and left me wondering what happened to this lady and her family."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"As a print of personal letters I loved the intimacy, but often wished I could ask questions.

The ranch owner name is Clyde Stewart and she was going to do housekeeping for him.It turns out she love living and doing work on the ranch like working the land, hunting and riding on the land. I find it hard to believe anybody would enjoy doing hard labour, but if the auther say she was happy, who is me to doubt her.The book then go of into her younger life. Elinore was young girl when her parents died, so she self educated herself. She raised her eight sibiling on her own.

How interesting could letters written by a homesteader in the early 1900s be? I was very pleasantly surprised at what I found when I actually began reading.Although we learn almost nothing about \\"the story behind the story\\" it is obvious that the letter-writer had been educated before becoming a laundress for the recipient of these letters. It is also obvious that the author had developed a friendship with her employer that lasted after the employment ended. These letters are well written and vividly descriptive: of the landscape, the surroundings, and most enjoyably of the people.What struck me most was that the world the writer described was only 100 years ago! It reminded me again of how much change has occurred - for good and for ill - in our country in a very short period of time."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"Found this in the free section for Kindles and must say it is just delightful!

Elinor's heartfelt and beautifully descriptive letters are inspiring, courageous, and touching. What a wonderful snapshot of homesteading life in the early 1900s. Her descriptions of the magnificence of Wyoming make me want to go back to the state. I highly recommend this wonderful bood."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I found this free book for my Kindle, and downloaded it not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised! The author choose to move forward from previos tragedy and enjoy the life she had been given. She relays the daily events with pleasure. She makes the mundane appear fun and exciting. She faced each day with courage, love and joy. I enjoyed reading and was sad when the book came to an end! This would also be a great read for students who wanted a better idea of how homesteaders lived in the early 20th century!"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This book to me is fascinating.

Hard work and hard &#34;play&#34; gave Elinore a gloriously fulfilled life. Her interest in people made great stories. Kept me engrossed no matter what was going on about me."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I first learned of Elinore Pruitt Stewart in a history course on History of Women in America. I was pleased and eager to find her book, a series of letters she had written, as a free eBook.The letters are surprisingly well written. Elinore Stewart wrote with much humor that had me laughing throughout. I assumed that she must have had a good education in the English language; however, in one of the letters she states that she had no formal education at all. One thing is for sure and that is she is quite a natural story teller. So good in fact, that I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't fiction, but letters based upon fact. One of the letters, for example, tells of twins, Regalia and Sedalia. Sedalia was the prettier of the two and quite a snobbish, unlikeable young woman. Regalia, who was more \\"common\\" looking, was a pleasure to be around, but took a lot of criticism from her twin. So much so that she was willing to step aside and allow her mother to try and marry off Sedalia to the man who was really interested in Regalia. Well, Elinore managed to save the day in such a way that it's hard to believe that it was a true story. Her wit was obviously as quick in real life as it was when she put pen to paper.Stewart really brings the wide open ranges of the new western frontier to life in her descriptive and entertaining letters. Not to be missed by anyone. You don't have to be an independent woman to enjoy Stewart's letters. Anyone with an interest in the true west, homesteading, the history of America, or just plain good story telling, will love this book."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This is a series of letters written by a woman to a friend and former employee about her new life homesteading in Utah.

I was transported by Elenore's detailed descriptions into the scenic beauty of her world and the lives of the people she wrote about. I chuckled often and laughed lots. A feisty and optomistic woman who worked hard and was always helping others. A woman after my own heart, a true lover of adventure and fun.

Courageous and able to imagine a life beyond her circumstances, Stewart wrote letters that are an instruction manual for those who possess a strong heart (and constitution!!) Although set in the 19th Century, her attitudes and selfless lifestyle serve as a modern inspiration to any young woman who is facing challenges and desires to strike out on her own and determine her own path in life. Stewart was a remarkable woman and fortunately, for those of us who read her letters, academic enough to commit to print her experiences and feelings about her life as a homesteader.This collection of letters will remain a part of my permanent library and I will recommend it generously!!"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"Here's a perfect candidate for required reading in highschool that so aptly displays the triumph of the human and the American spirit and such healthy evidence of the melting pot at work and provides a more worthwhile reward than the dystopic books like 1984, Lord of the Flies and Animal Farm that drive students away from the delights of learning.The author, like my grandmother had little formal schooling but, to paraphrase Mark Twain, she didn't let that interfere with her education. Books were hard to come by but they were read carefully and repeatedly. Since books were rare on the frontier and the Old West, they tended to be made up of the Classics often shared or resold, even in Western towns that sported used book stores as well as the more infamous saloons.The anecdotes recorded in these letters are as informative as they are delightful. Here is a wonderful non-fiction account of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and by today's standards, extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Authors like Updyke, Baldwin and Mailer pale before these letters, so full of life and the true spirit of the pioneer. Here discover the can-do attitude that is often missing from our society today.Many of us would enjoy a long conversation with our great grandmother, here's a wonderful opportunity!Even though Amazon delivers this book free to your Kindle or Kindle app, it is worth far more than so many other books costing more. The people you will meet in this wonderful volume will stay with you a long time and certainly inspire you when you reflect upon your own hardships and disappointments."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I don't usually like biographies, memoirs, or diaries and was pleasantly surprised by this find. I'm much more of a risk taker with free kindle books and had recently re-read the little house series with my child.

Great read -- especially for free!"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This book was a great read. My maiden name is Pruitt, which is not too common, and is why I chose it in the first place. I would certainly be proud to have Elinore as a relative, as she astounded me with her skills and fearlessness. She takes her child out camping overnight in the woods, where she kills their dinner, dresses it, cooks it over a fire she has started by herself. She does this because she considers it fun, but it was a tremendous amount of work, not to mention dangerous.I love her sense of humor. And this account tells us just how tough our pioneers were."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"What an interesting view of history thru this woman homesteader's eyes. The most fascinating thing though, is her sense of humor. Sometimes people who lived in the past seemed so burdened with life that the lighter side fails to shine through. This lady had such a zest for life and she lived life to the fullest. Her friends, too! One quote I thought humorous, expressing that they were ravenously hungry: \\"In a short time we were eating like Lent was just over.\\" Another time she is feeling stupid about something she does... \\"And then I began to think how many kinds of idiot I was.\\" This lady's writing made you feel she was living in this century. Not stuffy and boring but very alive! You will enjoy this lady's account of being a woman homesteader. A few times she had me laughing till I had tears squirting out of my eyes!"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"As I child, I was just absolutely mesmerized by the stories of Laura Ingalls Wilder and her family, later sharing them with my own daughter.Mrs. Campbell's stories are those of an adult woman, with a small child, who ventured into the wilderness, seeking a better life for herself and her daughter. The stories are told in letter form, as she writes to her friends, and tell of how her life is progressing. It's an interesting look over one's shoulder, and I can only imagine what her recipients thought as she writes of going of by herself with her daughter and shotgun on days-long camping trips into the wilderness. And even more, of the stories she comes back with of the people she meets on these adventures.I don't know if Mrs. Campbell was a typical woman of her times -- to me it seems not. To me, she portrays a woman who looks at something and slowly breaks it down into small pieces, never once saying to herself that something was not possible. She treats every challenge as an adventure, and I can only imagine what she must have imparted to her small daughter as she watched Mamma cope.I volunteer occasionally with the elderly, and collect stories as we sit or travel. The story of the woman who worked with rescue wolves in the 1950's. The woman who ran a general store on her own for many years until her mother's illness forced her to give up. These are sometimes lost stories that should be preserved of the perseverance of woman to go own in nontraditional roles, and in this respect, it's lovely to see Mrs. Campbell's legacy preserved in too few letters."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This book is really wonderful. It is a first-hand account through letters of the time in our country's past. It is fascinating to see how many women were settlers and homesteaders. It is great to have the pictures in this book of so many strong, independent, adventurous women. Furthermore, Elinore's attitudes and view of life and its difficulties give everyone in any age something to think about.The reading is easy, fun, engrossing, and quite interesting."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I can hardly believe that most of this took place more than 100 years ago; Elinore makes her adventures so real and immediate. I kept being surprised by her beautiful prose (for never having had formal education) and how easy life seemed to come to her. I was impressed by how positive she was about everything even though the reality was so difficult.One reviewer questioned that this was a legitimate account, so I did do a bit of browsing through some history websites and confirmed that Elinore was legitimately a homesteader who did what she says in her letters.By far the best free book I've read! Very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"This small book gives a world of information and an amazing word picture of life, attitudes, personalities, and the cooperation and joy of the time.

Christmas is coming!"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"Genuine substance and sincerity describe Stewart's letters from the early twentieth century while homesteading in this remote corner of Wyoming. Whereas most women would not even consider putting down roots in such an isolated area, Mrs. Stewart was determined to make a life for herself in this territory. And she did just that. It took a special kind of person to live in this far-removed landscape.Her writing, subject matter and approach to life were most admirable. Hard working and always enthusiastic for adventure, she writes of various encounters with surrounding neighbors and experiences into the countryside. If she had any dull moments on the ranch they must have been few and far between.Very optimistic about life, Mrs. Stewart affirms, \\"...all my own efforts have always been just to make the best of everything and to take things as they come.\\"To further quote, \\"It has always been a theory of mine that when we become sorry for ourselves we make our misfortunes harder to bear, because we lose courage and can't think without bias.\\"A wonderful read furthering an appreciation for life in the homesteading era."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I had never heard of this book before getting my Kindle.

What an interesting life - such fortitude and good humor! It is wonderful to gaze into the life of a woman from that time. I can't imagine living in such cold conditions - where anyone within 30 miles is your 'neighbor'..you go traveling for over day to visit someone for a dinner party. She describes her experiences in such wonderful prose - I would have liked to be able to meet this remarkable woman.

I'm not so sure we have progressed to a better life. Even though it was a hard life and a short one I think it may have been a slice of heaven back in old Wyoming.

That country was wild and untamed at that time and taking a baby out camping and on road trips in the dead of winter where she ran into strangers where she or the baby could have been killed, raped or abducted was insane. When she let that horse go in the mountains was fool hardy, her thinking was way off. If a horse comes home alone, that can only mean disaster to the person who finds it back home! Where would a person even start to look for her and the baby? Of course I am sure she didn't leave any notes. I too noticed the flowers for the wedding were way out of season.

LOL"},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I love to read books about pioneers and early US history. This is a little more recent than most I have read, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable to read. I graduated from high school in Cody Wyoming. Many of the places she wrote about I could envision even today. Where Wyoming has grown since the early 1900s, it is still a more primitive and wild state than my present home of California. I miss that atmosphere, that more \\"homey\\" time. A time and a place where neighbors count. I also know how truly rough the winters can be in Wyoming. Some of the writer's adventures out and about during winter time amazed me that she would even attempt them. The fact that she carried her \\"bairns\\" out and around with her was amazing, too. Early in the book she states Wyoming has three seasons: Winter and July and August. That is close to true. I can remember snow in June and ground so hard from the cold that planting anything before then was next to impossible. I can remember wanting to take one last trip into Yellowstone Park but finding the pass going into there closed in late September early October. Best of all I remember seeing moose, buffalo, bear, elk, snakes and other wild life abundant, even as late at the 1960s. This book brough a lot of my memories back to me. I am glad I downloaded the book."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"What a find! I wish I could find this in print for my friends without Kindle. 100 years after these letters were written Elinore's voice remains nearly as accessible today as it would have been to her contemporaries, with a canny sense of story-telling and wonderful observations of the world around her. Upbeat and humorous, the author paints a vivid picture of her friends, family and the breathtaking landscape of Wyoming cattle and sheep ranching. But reading between the lines you can appreciate the hardship and tenacity this life required of homesteaders - extreme weather (\\"we have only three seasons here - winter, July and August\\"), family left far away possibly never to be seen again, children and spouses lost to influenza and other preventable illnesses. I picked up the book because I have an empty new Kindle and it was free and I have an interest in the ascetic life - and I finished the book determined to find more about the author as well as other women on the frontier."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I really enjoyed this Kindle freebie!

It was so interesting and so well-written that I couldn't believe it wasn't the creation of a novelist. But no, they are the authentic letters of an incredible woman. Ironically, she apologizes in her letters, for writing too much. If only she could have known that a century later, people around the world would be wishing she wrote even more.If you choose the audio book, try to get the Sound Room Publishers version, narracted by Kate Fleming. It is far superior than Blackstone Audio's version read by Rebecca Burns (who does a good job, but whose voice is too much like a young girl's to express the wisdom and experience that Fleming projects)."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"No re-written history here. Just a look at how it really was for one woman braving a new life in the West. It is a wonderful look at how one woman dealt with life in her times. Not a DR. QUINN anacronism, but a REAL woman.

The letters that make up the book provide a very personal glimpse into the lives of homesteaders in an isolated valley on the Wyoming-Utah border.

This has become one of our favorite books to share with friends."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I picked out this book with no prior knowledge regarding it and I admit that not only did the collection of letters suck me in, but actually caused me to wonder if this is indeed a legitimate non-fiction collation, or if the book is a hoax. The literate nature, the series like styling of the letters, and more all lead to such questions appearing in this reader's thoughts.If an honest collection of a woman's homesteading experience you can not, to my knowledge, find a more enjoyable read. If real, I personally believe that this woman was one in a million in terms of capabilities, openness, and a sort of brilliance in talents glimpsed through her letters.If, by some way possible, this is not an actual non-fiction collection of letters, it remains an excellent read - just not as impressive. The letters lose none of their charms, but veracity makes a very large difference for the reader so far as learning what a homesteader might live through and how they might handle the varieties of week to week existence.Her losses and gains, her strength of will, and her engaging letters make this a very engaging read and you can not beat the price of free. I choose to believe these a true account and stand by my statement that it is a five star read.It would be nice to see this book eventually have a linked TOC and maybe even sketches or pictures supplementing."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"I found this little book to be one of the most interesting and well written diary/letters books I've ever read - and I have read MANY! Thankfully, the editors resisted the urge to \\"correct\\" spelling errors and grammatical mistakes, thus giving the reader a better understanding of the writer. I found myself drawn into the story immediately and couldn't wait to get to the next chapter/letter. Elinore Stewart was indeed a \\"writer\\" of the highest degree. Her ability to draw the reader into the story is unrivaled and her descriptions of the West - the sunsets, the mountains, fields of grain, the homesteads - everything she writes about seems to come alive. I found myself becoming extremely disappointed as I neared the end of the book, for I was left wanting MORE. Nothing less than a full NOVEL would have left me satisfied and even then, I'm sure I would have still wanted more. The reading is so enjoyable and flows beautifully so that even a young person doing research for a school project would enjoy this little book as reference material. I was sad to see my small book come to an end and would have loved to read more and more of the letters written to her old employer/friend.

Letters written by the author and not altered. Would have been fun to read the letters she received."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"A fascinating and thoroughly readable account of an impressive woman's adventure homesteading, from her own letters -- with a surprising end to the story."},{"Title":"Letters of a Woman Homesteader","review":"What is more intimate than a letter? In this hectic age we pepper our friends with emails and text messages, but letters require a different level of commitment. Sitting with pen in hand, really thinking about what you mean to convey, and getting it right the first time at penalty of a complete rewrite...this is a true test of communication. The letters of a writer can be a magic lantern into her world, and this collection from the pen of Elinore Pruitt Stewart is a fine example.Elinore was supporting herself and her small daughter as a laundress in Denver in the early 1900's. Longing for fresh air and open spaces, she took advantage of the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909 to file a claim for land in Wyoming. She answered an ad from Clyde Stewart of Burntfork, Wyoming, who was looking for a cook and companion, and they were married soon after her arrival.From 1909 to 1913 Elinore wrote letters to her former Denver employer, Mrs. Coney. She wrote about the neighbors--a loose term describing anyone within a two-day ride of the ranch at Burntfork. She wrote about traveling by carriage, sled or pony up ravines and over buttes with camping gear and a mess box. She described the daily routines, the activities of her daughter Jerrine, the pleasures of her small house, the pain of an infant's death, the easy hospitality extended to travelers in the beautiful but unforgiving Wyoming wilderness. Always she wrote of \\"the sage, sand and sunshine\\" of her adopted state. In a letter about a hermit sheep rancher missing his family in the South, she described a treasured daguerrotype of his family peering out from \\"the mellow twilight of long ago.\\"This long-ago time is brought to life through the humor and vividness of her writing. Though she often apologizes to her correspondent for the length and detail of her letters, Mrs. Coney must have found them worth keeping, because they were serialized for publication in the Atlantic Monthly Magazine in 1913 and first published as a book in 1914.Writing about her wedding to Clyde Stewart at their ranch, Elinore describes her urgent desire to make a good impression on the neighbors. She cooked and cleaned all morning; when she dressed for the wedding, she left her good shoes for the last moment. Standing up before the justice of the peace with her bridegroom she realized that she still had on her soft house shoes and her apron. Did this ruin her day? Not at all; she wrote, \\"At least the shoes were comfortable and the apron was white.\\" This is the spirit that Elinore Pruitt Stewart brought to her life as a Wyoming homesteader, and you will be enchanted and inspired by her descriptive letters. She did her best to persuade her correspondent that homesteading was well within the capabilities of anyone, and recommended it for \\"the troops of tired, worried women\\" in the dingy cities.I listened to the unabridged audio ofLetters of a Woman Homesteader (Primary Source History), narrated by Kate Fleming, and enjoyed it very much. As usual with an audio production I missed out on the biographical notes and photographs, but found them on a historical website.

It also has a glossary.We start with stopper knots. While these are often used to protect the end of a rope from fraying, the most common use is simply to stop the end of a rope from running through a block. A simple figure-8 knot is typical here, and we are shown how to make it, as well as how to make many other stops. Another use for stopper knots is to create a weight at the end of a rope that you wish to heave. And we see some examples of these, such as the \\"Monkey's Fist.\\"Next is a chapter on bends. These knots join two pieces of cordage. Once again, a figure-8 type is typical, and we see plenty of others as well.The following chapter is on binding knots. These are used primarily to tie two objects together. A transom knot is a good example. But they are also used as clamps (such as a \\"surgeon's knot\\" to tie off blood vessels) or just to protect the end of another rope, or to lash together two parts of the same rope.After that comes a chapter on hitches. These are used primarily for towing and tethering. One example is a \\"cat's paw\\" hitch, which distributes weight evenly on two \\"legs.\\" In some cases, when one leg of this knot breaks, the other will hold long enough so that the load being held by the rope can be lowered safely.Now, suppose you need to pull a pole lengthwise. A \\"rolling hitch\\" is often recommended. But if that pole is slippery, this knot won't hold. In that case, the book recommends the \\"icicle hitch,\\" which generally works much better. It's a very practical knot!We see some other useful knots in this chapter, such as a \\"barrel sling\\" (which allows one to hoist a barrel upright) and a \\"barrel hitch\\" (which is used to hoist that barrel horizontally). And, given that many knots are of great use to sailors, we see a \\"mooring hitch.\\" This knot is for mooring your boat to a bollard, especially if you also want to be able to pay out a little rope at a time, if necessary, in a tideway.The following chapter is on loops, and we see a great variety of nooses and bowlines. We even see how to make the \\"fireman's chair knot,\\" which can be used in an emergency if no body harness is available for a rescue.The book concludes with some miscellaneous knots. These include a grommet, some sennits, a mat, and even a rope ladder. When you use that rope ladder, it's best to face on edge, with a hand and a foot on each side.This is a useful and practical book."},{"Title":"Knots","review":"This book is great way to learn a lot of different knots and small enogh to keep it with you"},{"Title":"Knots","review":"This book is everything a knots book needs to be.No BS.... just clear, concise directions on how to tie knots.Many knots are included, with a list of uses.

The word \\"Soof\\" is a mystery word in the book that Heidi tries to figure out. Also, there is Bernadette, who is a neighbor but basically is family to Heidi and Mama. She helps out all the time. There are a lot of other characters Heidi will tell you about on her journey.Heidi is also a very lucky girl. Her good luck lets her get enough money to go to New York among other things.

She HAS to find out who is in those pictures, what happened before she was born, and where the rest of her family is. This book is an easy read for 11-13 year olds.

I like this book because it has a very touching relationship between a mother and a daughter."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"So B. It is a story of how a young adolescent can do anything if they set their mind to it. The main character, Heidi, is very courageous and independent when it comes to finding things out about her past. Heidi is a bright twelve year old child who lives with her mother, So B. It, who is mentally disabled. With the help of her neighbor Bernadette, Heidi is able to help take her of her mother while she is being homeschooled. One day Heidi finds pictures while cleaning her closet, and while looking at the images she wonders about her past. Heidi is determined to find out information about her and her mother by traveling to Liberty, New York to locate the place where her mother lived when she was younger. In this she hopes to figure out who she is as a person, as well as why her mother is the way she is.To me, the book is very remarkable in the way the characters looked after So B. It. It was very realistic when Heidi would get frustrated at her mother for not answering question about her past. After all, So B. It only knows 23 words, so how could she communicate to her daughter about how she was born or if she had any family members. Another way was how the character of Bernadette would be so gentle and caring towards So B. It. She was patient with teaching her new household chores, and also when she would have temper tantrums she knew how to effectively handle the situation. Bernadette and Heidi would both be great examples to young readers on how to handle a classmate who may have a disability.I would highly recommend this book to teachers and parents who may encounter a person with a disability. It teaches valuable lessons on how to properly interact with someone who is intellectual disabled, and it also shows how people may feel when they are around someone like that."},{"Title":"So B.

Heidi is a 12 year old girl who lives with her mentally disabled mother and Bernadette, their caring neighbor. Trying to find the answer to this question leads her on a cross country journey to find out her history in this moving novel, So B.

Throughout the book Sarah Weeks makes it so that you can feel the frustration, but also love that Heidi has towards her mother. Appearing to be slow-paced in the beginning, the book soon turns into a page-turning adventure where Heidi is an easily likeable character. Her bravery leads her to meet the most interesting people.The novel is best suited for middle-aged girls who can understand everyday struggles, or ones need help to.

It","review":"\\"So B. It\\" sounds rather like a simple book from the title, and, in fact, it is. The writing style is straight-forward (though thoroughly readable and enjoyable), the plot not the most surprising (though not predictable either), and the matter in which it is presented is not so complex that most older readers (whether young adult or fully grown) will be able to fully appreciate this.On the other hand, it is a touching, powerful book for slightly younger readers willing to have a story that is both interesting and eye opening. \\"So B. It\\" deals with serious issues such as mental illness, family, agoraphobia, and even something as simple and normal as growing up. Heidi is twelve when she decides to figure out from where she came and her journey is one that brings both satisfaction of knowledge and pain of knowledge.This book is bound to bring tears to the eyes of any reader. While more \\"mature\\" readers won't find the simplicity of this book too interesting, younger readers capable of understanding the serious issues confronted in \\"So B. It\\" will be more than satisfied by the read. It is an easy to book to read and understand, but is also emotional, touching, and simply well done.A good choice."},{"Title":"So B.

I think anyone who likes family mysteries and finding out who you really are will enjoy this book, though. Don't let one bad review from not buying it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"So B. It was one of the best novels i have ever read. It really made me think that all you have in life is family, and some people aren't as fortunate as others. Sarah Weeks described this book in terms that helped me understand the characters easier. It was hard for me to put down this book.This novel is about a girl named Heidi who makes her way to New York, to search for ungiven information, due to her disabled mother. Heidi trys to find out, what her mothers name is, who her family is, where is her family, how she ended up in Reno, and most importantly, what is \\"soof\\"? This book takes place in Reno and New York. In the beggining of the book Heidi talks about her life and how it is different from others, she doesn't like to talk about her family with other people because she isn't normal. Heidi and her mother where found at an apartment door one night, Heidi still a baby, and her mother sitting on the floor sucking her thumb. At that moment, a lady (Bernadette) came outside to see what was going on. She realized that she needed to take care of them, and took them inside. Bernadette is like their mother, she tucks them in at night, makes them meals, and is even Heidi's school teacher. But one thing that you must realize is that Bernadette has a special way of communicating with \\"So B. It\\" (the mother). She taught her how to make tea, open a can, take a shower, and many more things.The conflict in this novel is that Heidi needs to find out where she belongs. So she leaves the house alone, and is off to find out where and who her family is. The conflict is solved by traveling to New York to go to a mental hotel where supposedly her mother had stayed a long time ago, to find out information on her.Overall I think that this was one of the best books that i have ever read. It helped me to understand how their are some less fortunate people in the world, and that everyone should be happy for what they have, not what they want. If you haven't read this book, I recommend reading it, it is a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"One of my very favorite books,even though it's really not my type.

It","review":"Heidi had me captivated by page two. The story of \\"So B. It\\" is a heartwarming tale with richly developed characters that deal with real-world issues. In as many ways that it was a wonderful story, however; there were just as many serious issues with the story that make it far from being classified as \\"realistic fiction.\\" *(No twelve year old should be unaccompanied by an adult and travel through a neighborhood he/she is unfamiliar with, let alone halfway across the country. Not only completely \\"fantasy\\" but also unhealthy was Heidi's winning streak. Combine her dangerous trek with the blatantly illegal way in which she gets money (gambling, and lying multiple times in order to do so) are less than admirable. The illegality of underage gambling as well as the extreme danger a child in her situation is subject to definitely weakened the story for me. This story could easily have gone very bad very quickly. Heidi's luck extended much further than coin tosses and slot machines- it extended to keeping her protected in her journey. I just wish her decisions had been more admirable for children reading this book. )*Despite its flaws (which I don't intend to dwell on, but I think are very important to note), I gobbled up the story and found each and every character to be delightfully dynamic and lovable. I was glad to have a box of tissues nearby as the book came to a close (for the ending and the issues mentioned above, I recommend this book for ages 12 and up). Sarah Weeks has an undeniable talent, and this was a very good book, just flawed in a few places."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"this book was really interesting. It was a book that I didn't want to put down as each chapter pulled me more and more into the story, yet a book that at times was so heavy that I needed to take an emotional break.

I would totally recommend it to others, in fact I plan to do that tomorrow."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"Much of this book is great: The plot is this 12-year-old homeschooled girl without a birth certificate and an mentally challenged mother. This girl, Heidi, has lived a \\"normal\\" life with her mother who can only saw 23 words and their loving neighbor, Bernadette, who has fear of leaving her own apartment. When Heidi stumbles upon photos of her mother taken years ago, her intrest in her mother's past is activated. Because her mom only says simple words (\\"Heidi\\", \\"Kiss\\", \\"Tea\\", \\"Done\\", \\"Shh\\" and \\"More\\"), Heidi's mom has no way of explaining who she is. Soon, one word in her vocabulary, \\"Soof\\" begins haunting Heidi and eventually sends her on a cross-country quest from hometown Reno, Nevada, two Libery, New York.This book is UNIQUE and has nothing to compare to. What seemed a little unrealistic was the fact Heidi was only 12 and traveled alone on a bus across the country for days, meeting new friends and getting money off them. And I noticed a flaw: it was said that Dette didn't have a phone, and yet on Heidi's journey she calls her. Make sense or did I make a mistake??HIGHLY RECCOMENDED. \\"So B.

It","review":"I didn't expect to fall in love with So B. It, but I did from my very first reading with my students back in 2006. Heidi's has a very atypical childhood because she takes care of her mother with a mental disability instead of being taken care of. Her mother only uses a very limited vocabulary of 23 words. All the words make sense except for one, \\"soof\\" and it is this very word that sends Heidi on a journey across the country in search for answers about who her mother is and ultimately, who she is.One of my favorite characters is Heidi's reclusive neighbor, Bernadette, who has her own issues. She ends up being a kind of surrogate mother to Heidi and I appreciate her eagerness to help raise Heidi. It's hard to think about a kid who's in such difficult circumstances being all alone without any support.I loved that the chapters were each titled with one of the words that Heidi's mother knows, of course ending with \\"soof.\\" You can't help but admire Heidi's tenacity and courage to find out the truth about her family and therefore herself. She ends up finding out much more than what she expected, but I think that happens very frequently when one decides to go soul-searching. I have a few other books by Sarah Weeks that I've been waiting to read, especially Pie.I've had such rich discussions in lit. circles with my students over the years with this book and it pushes them to think deeper and ask some hard questions about life.

It","review":"this book was amazing. i read it in a day because i just couldnt stop reading. this is a total must readd!"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"As far as I can determine, the most significant thing author Sarah Weeks wrote prior to \\"So B. It\\", was an amusing series for middle readers called the \\"Guy\\" books. Like many children's authors before her (Louis Sachar, for example), Weeks began her career as an author with light fluffy material. Then, out of nowhere, she creates this remarkable, complex, deeply moving book. \\"So B. It\\" may well be the first step towards making Sarah Weeks one of the great writers for kids of this era. She has taken a difficult (some might say impossible) subject, given it warmth and intelligence, and created one of the best books of 2004. If you want to give a kid something to read that's interesting and insightful, but also contains more complexity than your average \\"Droon\\" chronicle, I can't recommend this book any more highly.Heidi It has always, so far as she has known, lived with her mother and her neighbor Bernice (Bernie) in their apartments in Reno. Heidi's family is remarkable for a great many reasons. Her mother, So B. It, has, what Heidi matter-of-factly calls a \\"bum brain\\". She's mentally handicapped and has only the capacity of saying only 23 words altogether. Bernie is a neighbor who has always cared for Heidi in ways that So B. It could not. Unfortunately, Bernie has agoraphobia and can't exit their apartments for any reason. Heidi, for her part, is what you might call normal were it not for one remarkable fact. She's lucky. Anytime her household needs a little more money to fix the vacuum cleaner or to pay an unexpected bill, Heidi tromps down to the local slot machine, wins a load of cash, and gives it to Bernie to use. And life with these three might have gone on in this fashion had it not been for a couple mysteries that Heidi wanted to solve. First of all, her mother can only say 23 words. One of them is \\"soof\\". Heidi wants to know what that word means, but her mom hasn't the capacity to understand or say. Second of all, baby Heidi and So B. It arrived in the apartment next to Bernie's years ago without anything but the clothes on their backs. And finally, Heidi finds an ancient camera in her apartment with film that has never been developed. Film, that dates back to before Heidi was born. Film, that might answer some of the questions she so desperately needs.The book's a mystery at heart. Heidi's personal quest to track down her past and find where she comes from is both believable and the kind of thing kids can identify with. In spite of Bernie's objections, she goes out into the cold world to find what she wants most. Weeks, as a writer, deftly weaves different lessons and wisdoms into her text without ever making it preachy or didactic. Heidi says right from the start that there are some things in this world that you cannot know. That's a truth that places the rest of the book in a distinct and curious light. For her part, Heidi learns quite of a bit of the truth, even if large chunks are missing here and there.What was most impressive about the story though was the character of So B. It. How do you go about creating a mentally handicapped character without reducing her to stereotypes or oversimplification? Somehow Weeks has managed it, and the result is an astounding novel. Quite frankly, this book hinges on whether or not you find the character of So B. It realistic and sympathetic. Weeks treads carefully around her subject but makes it perfectly clear that in spite of her problems, this is a woman who cares deeply for the people who love her. Even if she can't express it all the time.There are also some touchy subjects that Weeks skirts around believably. As I read the book, I wondered how the author would deal with the details of Heidi's conception. I won't give anything away but to say that the book's a class act and the subject, which is addressed in a child-friendly manner, works. And by the way, if you're worried about whether or not this title will be interesting to kids, don't be. The writing here is great, riddled with mysteries and lots of lists that Heidi likes to keep things straight in.That this book never received so much as a Newbery honor rankles me. Not that the actual winners weren't deserving, but this is a truly beautiful book that every child should know. My greatest fear is that someone somewhere will get it mixed up with the far more mediocre, \\"Ida B\\", which came out in the same year. For those who locate this title correctly, however, they will find something that is appealing to kids and yet is well written enough to earn the respect of adults as well. A gem."},{"Title":"So B.

Years ago they arrived at a lady's front step, not knowing where they were. The lady, Bernadette, took them under her wings and practically adopted them. As happy as they were, Heidi still wasn't satisfied. Her mother new twenty three words, common words, except for one. Soof. Heidi feels that she has to know what this mysterious word means so she goes on a mission to find out. She goes through so much, meets a lot of new people, made new friends, and goes through some tears. In the end it works out great, she meets more family than she ever imagined she had. For such a young girl she goes through so many up and downs. This book is mixed with so many emotions because it focuses on family and all the ups and downs a family goes through."},{"Title":"So B.

Their loving neighbor, Bernadette, helps out and is a vital part of their family. Bernadette finally manages to teach Mama how to open cans, but tying shoes is beyond her capabilities. Mama can't read or tell time. She knows 23 words. One of Mama's words, \\"soof,\\" is a mystery --- no one knows what it means, and Mama is unable to define it.Heidi lives in Reno and so is able to wield her incredibly reliable lucky streak at the laundromat slot machine when her babysitting money doesn't quite cover their needs. How did Heidi and her mom end up in Reno, living in the apartment next to Bernadette? Bernadette tells Heidi about their mysterious appearance at her door when Heidi was just one week old. Heidi's mother was able to tell Bernadette that her baby's name was Heidi. When asked for her own name, Mama says, \\"So be it.\\" Since Bernadette believes everyone should have a middle name (or at least an initial), she dubs Mama \\"So B. It.\\" Heidi is known as \\"Heidi It.\\"The truth about her mother's identity eats away at Heidi. She simply cannot rest until she pieces together Mama's past through clues that appear over the years. Why is her mother terrified of buses? Why do rainy days make her anxious? When Heidi finds some old photos of her mother at a Christmas party held at Hilltop Home in Liberty, New York, she decides she must travel there alone in order to discover who her mother truly is. The trip is a frightening yet exciting adventure for determined, courageous Heidi.SO B. IT is a great read. The mystery is intriguing; the characters are quirky yet believable. If you're a sucker for a quest story with heart, the way I am, I predict you'll be \\"So Into It!\\"(...)"},{"Title":"So B.

I used to think, without really thinking about it, that I knew what color that was. But that was a long time ago, before I knew what I know now about both dinosaur skin and the truth.\\"Thus begins the remarkable story of Heidi It, the narrator of Sarah Weeks' compelling book, So B. It. Poor Heidi has grown up fairly isolated, with a mentally handicapped mother, an agoraphobic but good-hearted neighbor, and one neighbor boy whom she talks to when taking out the trash. But Heidi is wise and courageous beyond her years and experience. She has an innate thirst for knowing the truth of her background, and so she begins a remarkable journey across country to find someone who may know about her beginnings.Children and adults alike will enjoy the chapter set up. You see, Heidi's mom only knows 23 words or expressions. Each chapter is named after one of those words and explores the significance of those words to both Heidi and her mother. There are some words that Heidi has no trouble understanding, such as \\"Tea\\" and \\"Back Soon.\\" But one word in particular, \\"Soof,\\" haunts Heidi. Her mother is incapable of explaining the word and her kind neighbor urges Heidi to ignore the word, but Heidi will not rest until she has an explanation for \\"Soof.\\" The meaning of \\"Soof\\" is tied inextricably to everything Heidi needs to know.There are plenty of twists and turns and magical moments as Heidi seeks to solve the mystery of her existence. Heidi is a fascinatingly complex character, and the plot makes for an exciting page turner.Recommended ages: 9 to 109Check out my other reviews at:http://literatureforgirls.blogspot.com/"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"Thirteen-year-old Heidi knows that her life is anything but conventional. Sure, her Mother loves her dearly, but seeing as how her Mother is stricken with a mental disability, it is extremely hard for her to take care of Heidi, or even show her how much she cares about her. That's where Bernadette comes in. Bernadette (Dette) is Heidi and her Mother's next-door neighbor, in the apartment building that they reside in in Reno. Dette's Father died a few year ago, leaving her some money, as well as well as agoraphobia, meaning that she can't go outside for fear. Everything is absolutely fine, until Heidi's Mother utters a mysterious word, soof, that begins to haunt her. Heidi quickly realizes that she must learn the truth, and uncover the secrets about her past. And soon she is on a cross-country journey doing just that.Filled with dramatic twists and turns at every corner, Sarah Weeks has proved that she can not only write comedy well, but heart-warming, touching stories, that will stay with the reader long after the book is finished. Heidi is an amazing, heroic character, who finds the good in all, while at the same time having to deal with such a serious issue at home. Her Mother is kind and friendly, and someone whom you feel for greatly, as you realize just how hard it is for a person to have a mental disability. And Dette. Dette is a Godsend, who helps out with chores, and taking care of both Heidi and her Mother. All together they create an amazing force against the mental disability, proving that you can overcome even the biggest obstacles.

It) intrigued me, as did the description on the back (even with the obvious similarities to the movie I am Sam -- though they are only \\"skin deep,\\" so to speak).I'm glad I finally put other books aside and picked this one up. It's a strange thing - even though this book is, in many ways, a sad one with kind of a depressing storyline if you just laid it all out...it makes me happy. Just thinking about it makes me happy. I'm not sure why that is, whether it is Heidi's quirky lucky streak, her mentally disabled mother's soft charm, or Bernadette's (her neighbor and the real caregiver in Heidi's life) oddness. But there's something about this book that just puts a smile on my face even with the rather sad and bittersweet ending it has.Heidi's mother is really not functional on her own and can only speak a very few words. One word that begins to haunt Heidi is \\"soof\\" and she decides she has to find out what it means. Using clues she finds in an old photograph, she sets off on her own (Bernadette has agoraphobia and can't leave the apartment; besides someone has to look after Mama) to a little town called Liberty.The trip itself is a wonder and I hate to tell you anything about it. I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say it brings up some unforeseen obstacles for Heidi. When she does get there, things aren't as easy as she'd hoped either. But, in the end - and for what it's worth - she finds out what soof means and the truth about her family.Recommended for readers aged 10 and up. It's a gentle book and I think you'll like it."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"An uniquely constructed and wonderful read, this is the story of a young girl living in Reno named Heidi and her journey to understand herself and her past. This is a more difficult mission than most, given that her mother (the only family she has) is mentally challenged and knows only 23 words. Bernie, the agoraphobic neighbor, is able to lovingly care for Heidi and her mother, So B. It (a name that Bernie claims is pure meanness) only because of the fortunate coincidence that their apartments connect though an interior wall. Fond of list-making, Heidi strings together clues until she decides to go to a mysterious place called Hilltop House in New York. There she hopes to find out once and for all what \\"soof\\" means, the only word of her mother's that she cannot figure out. Ultimately she discovers the limitations of knowing. She also discovers the rich layers of \\"soof.\\" Each chapter is entitled one of the words in So B. It's vocabulary. Completely engaging with a likeable, strong-willed and determined young girl as the reader's guide. In some ways this work is evocative of Mark Haddon's autistic tale.So B. It is trapped without language and without a way to help ground her daughter, Heidi is trapped in the unknown without much recourse, and Bernie is quite simply trapped, bound to her apartment lest some calamity befall her or those she loves. This is a book that invites you to question your assumptions about the world as well as yourself."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"This was a very well-written book. The author has a gift for moving the story along quickly and efficiently, without it losing any of its depth. However, I found it hard to believe that there wasn't one scrap of evidence anywhere in Heidi's apartment that would give clues as to who Heidi's mother was. Surely there would have been an envelope with someone's name on it ... SOMETHING. Also, I felt that the premise for Heidi and her mother being able to have paid rent/electricity to be a little convoluted, as were other aspects of the book. It was as if the author needed a way for the story to work, so she made it happen in the only way she could.That said, though, the book was intriguing. I read it in two days and couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. So all in all, a good book."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"So B. It is an amazing story about a challenged woman who lives with her mother and six year old daughter. Now you wonder what does So B. It mean, well Sarah leaves that little clue to find out in your reading! Sarah uses a lot of mystery in her story, but also uses sadness and happiness features. The challenged woman only has a few words in her vocabulary, twelve to be exact. Weeks puts her writing into a format that really excites the reader. Every chapter is about one of the words she knows. Her daughter is very suspicious and try's to figure out what So B. It means. If you like suspense, mystery, and touching writing, then So B. It is the book for you!"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"So B. ItBy: L. Lawson\\"If truth was a crayon and it was up to me to put a wrapper around it and name it's color, I know just what I would call it - dinosaur skin.\\" The book So B. It, by Sarah Weeks, is about a thirteen year old girl and her mentally retarded mother. One day a women showed up with a few week old baby in an adjoining apartment. The person in the adjoining apartment, Bernadette, finds them by coming in the door that joins the two rooms. She raises the baby and helps the nameless woman, who is mentally retarded. The mother of the girl, who is named Heidi, can only say twenty-three words. She seems to favor one phrase \\"So be it.\\" Heidi finds an old camera that her mom had when she first came. This reveals where her mom had once been. She was in a mental hospital in Liberty, New York. On a quest to find out about her family, Heidi wants to go with Bernadette to New York. The problem is Bernadette has a phobia of leaving her apartment. Heidi illegally plays the slot machine and buys a ticket to go from to Nevada to Liberty, NY. She finally gets to New York and learns \\"So be it\\", and another word her mother used to say, \\"Soof\\", is actually \\"Sophia\\", her mother's name. The twist is that when she returns her mother has died of a sudden illness.I really like this book because it has a lot of emotion. At the end when Heidi's mother dies you feel empathy because the author does a very good job of making the characters likeable. She lets you know details about the person, like you actually knew them.Another reason I like this book is because all of the ideas are explained. For example, the quote I used in the beginning of the review was immediately explained it and the reason was scientists who look at dinosaur bones don't know the true color of dinosaur skin, so in a way dinosaur skin is the truth.I also like this novel because it involves strangers doing kind deeds. The woman on the bus next to Heidi talks to her and lets her hold her kittens she has with her. Just because there are details like that it helps you connect to the book.The book also includes a lot of the characters thoughts. This helps you understand their actions better. You can even know for sure why they do some of the crazy things they do.Again, I would definitely recommend this book to any one who likes to read a heartwarming adventure. So B. It is a wonderful novel that is about a personal quest to learn about a family you have never seen or heard of."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"The book So B. It, by Sarah Weeks, is about a girl named Heidi who lives with her mentally disabled mother and her next door neighbor. Heidi's mom only knows 23 words; most of them are common, like good, no and hot. But there is one word that no one understands, soof. Heidi would do anything to find the missing puzzle pieces of her mother's past. She goes on a trip to The Hilltop, a mentally disabled home, where her mom stayed. Here Heidi searched to collect as much information as she could. I really thought the author did a great job making the book come to life and it truly made me appreciate that my mom isn't like Heidi's. I think that this book is good for everyone that enjoys reading."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"I am a sixth grader, and I just finished reading So B. It, by Sarah Weeks. This book is touching and gives you anther perspective on how you look at life. So B. It is about a girl named Heidi It. Her mothers name is So B. It. Her mother is mentally disabled and Bernadette, their next door neighbor, looks after Heidi and her mother. Bernadette though has troubles of her own, she can't go outside which leaves Heidi and her mother to run errands for her. Heidi sometimes plays the slots to get money for whatever they need, she has a lucky streak.The plot of the story starts when Heidi goes looking for what one of her mother's words mean. Heidi's mother, mama, only knows twenty three words. For the most part mama's words make sense. Heidi was Heidi, So B. It was mama and Dette was Bernadette. The only word that did not make sense was soof. Heidi goes on a journey to find out whom, what or the meaning of soof.I really enjoyed this book because of some of the surprising results from the journey. The people she meets are interesting. I especially like the kindness others show towards her. My favorite part of the book is when Heidi meets Georgia on a bus. Georgia listens to Heidi and tries to understand. I like this about Georgia because she really listens. Georgia's kindness makes me think about how I treat others and how they should be treated.The most important thing I learned from the book is that even though Heidi's mother can only say twenty three words she still shows love. This book makes you think of what is really important in life which is to know you are loved and being with your loved ones."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK BY SARAH WEEKS. I PREVIEWED THE GUY SERIES, AND IT DIDNT LOOK THAT GOOD. THIS, IN MY OPOINION, IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ SO FAR IN THE YEAR. READ IT!"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"Sarah Weeks is a very talented and straight forward writer. I have not read a book this \\"easy\\" in years. The story line is heart touching and even though you could predict the outcome of this story, it didnt leave you sad (like most \\"coming of age\\" novels\\", it left you inspired and encouraged.Wether or not this is a realist \\"situation\\", it is a novel. Enjoy is for what it is. Who care if this could have really happened... ? For 245 pages, it did happen and Heidi was the outcome.Enjoy, I did. Thank you for such a sweet book."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"This book was so intriguing that I read it in 2 hours. It is a shorter and easier read, but I can easily compare it to longer 400-page books because of how impressing the content is. If you want to read a great book, then this should be first on your list."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"I love stories about disabled people. I think they're touching and meaning full. Do you like sad but happy stories? If you do you'll love So B. It. Close your eyes and just think. Think that your mom knows only 23 words and you've never met your dad. When you finally get to go on an adventure some thing terrible happens. If you want to find out what happens you'll have to read So B. It."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"I never thought I could get into a story about a girl with psychic ability living with her mentally retarded mother and an agoraphobic woman who hadn't left her apartment in decades. It all seems so bizarre.But great writing made me believe in the setup, hook, line, and sinker. The main character, Heidi, is so well drawn and likeable, and her agoraphobic caretaker is so funny and sweet, I kept turning the pages of this book to find out if they'd be okay. Also, there is a good mystery at the heart of the book which makes this a fast-paced read.Every character is a little strange-- the boy who's a liar, the childless couple, etc. But they're all so fully described that the whole time I was reading I felt a part of Heidi's world. I was sorry the book ended."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"Although this theme has been covered in many books, I thought Sarah Weeks produced a work that was original, intriguing, funny, sad, and satisfying. Although prehaps unrealistic in places, it is rings truer than many books in other places as Heidi learns to see past mental defficiencies, lies, smiles, and fear to the people and the love underneath. My only criticism would be that it ends too quickly and hodgepodgedly, but otherwise, this book was a good read."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"It may be a symptom of my own growing cynicism, but I was expecting something different--an intriguing tale of a young girl who sets out to find out where she came from, how she wound up living next door to a woman with agoraphobia with a mother who has a vocabulary of just 23 words.For about the first half of the book, it delivered. Sure, the secondary characters had absolutely no purpose except to move the plot forward (a pet peeve of mine in children's literature--when authors build a world around a main character where no one has any purpose except to serve the story). But, Heidi is a clearly drawn character who learns a lot about herself as she travels by bus across the country. She's an insightful, intelligent child, who seems like she'd make an amiable traveling companion.But, what's just a plot contrivance in the first half (characters who spring up out of nowhere to teach Heidi lessons and help her find her way) becomes ridiculous when she reaches her destination. There, people fall all over themselves to help her, going so far as to want to keep her forever and ever. (When's the last time you met someone else's kid and decided to offer her your home? I'm pretty sure that's just plain creepy in real life, and in this book it's not a lot better.)I know, it's fiction, and it's not necessarily supposed to mirror real life, but I think in the case of this particular book that this abandonment of reality really harms its message. In the beginning, it's all about Heidi setting out to learn the truth, and in the end, she's learned that there are things you can know and things you can't. And that's a lovely message. But it's diminished by the fantasy elements (of a cop and his wife who want to keep Heidi in their lovely, sweet cottage with a hammock in the backyard, for instance) that seem to serve no real purpose other than to make the reader go \\"Awww, isn't that nice?\\"What's more, after about the first half of the book, nothing that happens after comes as any surprise. If the book had of stayed relatively realistic throughout, it might not be so frustrating, but between the fantasy of a perfect childhood dangled before Heidi, and the silly, trite way the mysteries are wrapped up... I really wished I had of stopped halfway through.The book has value in its three original characters, and in Heidi's overall lesson about truth. My recommendation is to read the last half quickly so you don't waste too much time with it and don't spend too much time trying to make sense of anything after Heidi gets off the bus."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"I loved So B. It. I even cried. It was a great short read, perfect for a vacation book."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"This novel is a great book. It kept me wanting to read more and more. Heidi is a twelve year old girl who lives with her neighboor, Bernadette, and her mentally ill mother, So B. It. Her mom keeps saying one mysertious word, Soof. Heidi nor Bernadete knows what it means. Heidi then decieds she wants to know what soof means and sets out on a journey of a life time. This book is one that you will never forget."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"This is the best book in the whole wide world! It's about a mom and a daughter that share a strong relationship. Mom calls herself So B. It and the daughter is just Heidi. It's just that I don't like calling her that because it's not a good name for a real person. When the daughter goes out to search for her dad, disaster strikes her psycho problematic mom. If I were in her position I would have never been as brave as her to go and search for my dad.A theme that I found in the book was that when someone found something or someone they were looking for on a journey was found or when someone was about to accomplish their goal, then a very close family member died. This made me think of how hard accomplishing your goals must be if you're in this situation. I barely accomplish my goals even if they're in a really easy situation, so I definitely wouldn't be able to accomplish my goals in this situation.I think that this book is so good because my mom and I have a strong relationship and so do Mom and Heidi (in the book). This makes me able to connect with this book, in a stronger way. I also would want to recommend other books from this author but I don't think I've read any other books by her. I will definitely start looking into it now. I hope that you are now encouraged to read this book."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"The audio book was well read and easy to listen to.

It is nearly the BEST book that I have ever read!"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"I read this book about 4 years ago, and i had forgoten the name of it but as soon as i saw the title, i remembered all the details. Really though, this is an amazing book, and i still think about it when i go on trains or meet a nice person with cookies or do any online shopping. The twisted and sad love story in the latter part of this book is amazing and charming. The relationship between the characters present and back home is memorable and the story is one you will always always remember."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"This book is simply amazing. The story line, plot, as a whole is astoundingly detailed and not disappointing at all. The characters are so well introduced and emotional. I love how the story was written and presented, with metaphors, and even stories behind words. For some reason, this book slightly reminds me of \\"A Mango-Shaped Space\\" by Wendy Mass, not so much because of the story line, but more because of the way its written. So if you liked \\"a mango-shaped space\\" (which i LOVED) you will enjoy So B. It as well. So B It is great, to say the least :)"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"I bought this book for my 11 year old neice. I read it before I sent it to her. I couldn't put this book down. I read it in a day.

Twelve years ago, Heidi's mom knocked on a stranger's door and said that she had a \\"bum brain,\\" had nowhere to live, and was holding a baby.Bernadette takes care of Heidi and her mom, who claims that her name is \\"So B.

She doesn't really know where she is going, so she just goes wherever the path takes her. But even as little as Heidi knows about her mother, she loves her.This book reminded me a lot ofWalk Two Moons, because the storyline is similar. That's a good thing in my opinion, because I love that book! At the beginning of SO B. IT, you are kind of like \\"okay, get on with it,\\" but then the story gets interesting. This is a simple yet complicated book, which makes it very interesting.Reviewed by: Taylor Rector"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"So B. ItIf you are looking for a fabulous book that us VERY hard to put down So B. It is the right book for you! Personally when I started this book I got really confused because so many characters and events were introduced at the beginning and it was hard to figure out what was happening.This book is about a girl named Heidi whose mom is mentally disabled. Heidi's mom's life is a mystery because her mom cannot speak and no one knows about her past. So Heidi goes on a search to find out more clues about her. But on the way, Heidi comes across a few speed bumps. Heidi lives with her neighbor. Bernie and her mom who love her very much but it will be hard for them to let her go on this long and hard trip to find out about her mom's past. This book takes place in modern time and is realistic fiction. Heidi is an outgoing and exciting girl who is always up for adventure!I would recommend this book for ages 11-to adults. It is a little harder to understand if you are younger. I found the book exciting because the story was unusual and very interesting she makes an unbelievable situation realistic. I loved this book and I hope you will love it as I did!"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"When she was only a few weeks old, Heidi It was discovered in her mother's arms by their neighbor Bernie. This is how Heidi came into the world. This is the only \\"truth\\" she knows.Heidi lives a very sheltered life. Her mother, So B. It, has a \\"bum brain\\" and can only communicate to Heidi using 23 words. Heidi's true caretaker, Bernadette, isn't much better in the fact that she's deathly afraid of the world outside their conjoining apartments. Heidi doesn't go to school (everything she needs to know about life she learns from Bernie), she shops for groceries, she does the laundry, and anytime they need a little extra cash (the rent and utilities are mysteriously paid every month) the trio relies on Heidi's magic-like streak of luck to illegally win it for them.Heidi loves Bernie, Heidi loves her mother, however as with any child, curiosity soon gets the best of her and before she knows it, against Bernie's wishes, Heidi sets off on a cross-country adventure in search of some answers about her very cloudy past and the meaning of one of her mother's 23 words, \\"soof.\\"I can't remember the last time I read a book and was as enamored by a main character as I was by Heidi. Sarah Weeks does as good of job as I've ever read of bringing Heidi to life right before our very eyes. She's kind, she's loving, she's curious, she's innocent, and she's real. There are some very tender, raw moments in this book that tug on our heartstrings and cause us to want to reach in and shelter her from all that's happening. Heidi makes mistakes in the book and says hurtful things she'd take back if she could, but it's this that makes her human, this that makes us all human and causes us to care for her so deeply. There are some heavy truths buried in these 23 chapters (each chapter is cleverly named after one of Mama's words), truths that Heidi would maybe have preferred not knowing, but that's part of the growing process we all go through in life. This could have been a potentially scary message for children but Weeks handles it amazingly.Don't get me wrong, Weeks by no means let out all of her creative juices just on Heidi. So B. is quietly genuine, while Bernie teaches Heidi the important things in life. The characters Heidi meets along the way are also very deep, which is a remarkable achievement considering the little amount of page-time they're given.It's a shame this book wasn't written years ago, when the free time of our children wasn't wasted in front of a television or a Playstation, because I feel that it would be considered a classic today. I fear that this book will get lost on the shelves of our libraries and I plead to you, don't let that happen. In my opinion, Sarah Weeks has written a masterpiece, with a little something for everyone. Get to know Heidi while she solves the mystery that is her life and I promise, this will be one \\"truth\\" you'll be glad you discovered."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"This book is caled So B. It.

You don't know who she really is, your last name, where you came from, how you got to where you are, and who is paying the bills.

Your neighbor, Bernadette, has severe agoraphobia and won't leave the apartment, so they have to rely on you to do shopping and errands of any kind. If that's not enough to make you want to read this book, picture this young girl being made up to look like an adult, so that she can use her unusual talents and good luck to play the slot machines and get money when they need it. The story takes a serious turn when Heidi finds a camera in the back of a drawer, develops the film, and finds pictures of her obviously pregnant mother, posing with others in front of an institution with the name prominently displayed.

Heidi and I both have got nice neighbors. I especially liked the book because it is like no other book I have ever read. The characters are ones that I normally wouldn't read about.If I could change anything about this book, I wouldn't because it is already a great book. I recommend this book for girls in 4th gradeand up."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"Have you ever NEEDED to figure something out? Like it was going to eat you alive if you didn't figure out how to make the 1000 piece puzzle you've been dying to have, or find out what your friends were whispering behind your back? That's exactly how Heidi felt in the book, So B. It. Except, it wasn't about a puzzle or whispering or anything like it, it was about her bum-brained mom's secret word, \\"soof.\\" Heidi just needed to know what \\"soof\\" meant, no exceptions. She would do anything, and when the time came, she did.So B. It, in my opinion, is the best book ever. Sarah Weeks did an awesome job with keeping you hooked all the way through and wanting more. If I could, I would rate So B. It higher than a 5 and you'll see why soon! (hopefully.)KE"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"When your mother is mentally retarded, you don't know who your father is, you showed up on your neighbor, Bernice's door step when you were about one week old, what would you do? If you are Heidi It you will do anything to find out where you came from! In So B It, Sara Weeks puts in the elements all literature needs to make the characters come alive.Heidi It is a daring girl who is very curious about her past. Her mother's name is So B It, and her care taker/neighbor Bernice a.k.a. Bernie, has agoraphobia. Heidi has never honestly marveled about her past until she finds an old red sweater and some old film that has never been developed. Bernie and Heidi get the film developed, it shows Heidi's mom in the red sweater with a mysterious women. The other photos have a sign that says Hilltop Manor. Meanwhile, Heidi's mom is getting odd painful headaches. Even then, Heidi decides to take her chances and find Hilltop Manor and learn her ultimate question, what is soof.The section I liked was when Heidi figures out what soof means and all of her questions, are answered. She meets her father, her grandfather, and lots of other nice people. Her grandfather answers all of her confusions because her father is unable to, you will see why. I liked this part the most because it made me cry, laugh, etc. This part is filled with detail, suspense, reality, character, happiness, sadness, and a whole lot more.I think book should become a movie because it has a good plot and a wonderful story. Good movies need really good characters, this book does! The charcters were interesting because of their background. Bernie for example, she took care of her dad then when he past away she begin to get agoraphobia. She is basically Heidi's mother who taught Heidi everything, from reading to how to select what your dream is and to pursue it!I recommend this book for ages 10 to 24. This book will make you cry hard so, if don't like to cry don't read this book. If you have a big test and you have not studied, study first, or your grades might be terrible! I advocate this book for people who really like powerful stories."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"So B.

It","review":"\\"So B. It\\" - A Moving and Suspenseful StoryA story telling the tale of Heidi unraveling secrets of her motherBy Kelly LockerbieDecember 20, 2007\\"So B. It\\" by Sarah WeeksSo B. It, 245 pages, is a moving story about a thirteen year old girl named Heidi. She has no father, and does not remember anything about him. The sad part is, Heidi's mother, whom Heidi calls \\"Mama,\\" has a mental disorder, or a \\"bum brain,\\" as Heidi calls it. Heidi and Mama both live with Bernadette, or \\"Bernie,\\" who used to be their next door neighbor, until Mama showed up with Heidi on her front doorstep. Bernie takes care of both Mama and Heidi.Heidi does not know anything about her mother, or what happened to her in the past. She keeps track of her mother's slow progress, and notices that occasionally Mama would throw out the word \\"soof.\\" Mama doesn't know many words; in fact, she only knows twenty-three. Because Mama knows a word that no one knows, this interests Heidi. She becomes determined to find the meaning.Throughout the book, Heidi tries to gather clues towards the meaning of \\"soof,\\" because she believes that it could possibly reveal her past.The protagonist of this story is Heidi, and the book tells the book from her point of view. She is the narrator. Towards the beginning of the book, Heidi does not know anything about her mom, or even how she herself was born. All she knows is that her mom showed up on Bernie's front doorstep and in need of help. Basically, she was frustrated! She didn't know anything that happened before Bernie found her.However, when Heidi visits various places, places she knew to go to from clues she gathered, she stops fighting with the past. Even thought she learns something about the story of her life, she has matured and understands that certain things in her and her mother's life will remain a mystery.The theme of this story is love. Not romantic love, but love and affection for those who care about you. Heidi loved her mom, because she tried her hardest to take care of her despite her setbacks. Heidi also loved Bernadette. Without Bernie, Heidi and her mom would not have been able to survive. Heidi depended on Mama, and Mama depended on Bernie. Bernie held the family together.From this reading I learned to be thankful for things I wouldn't normally expect to be grateful for. For example, my \\"identity.\\" Since Mama is mentally challenged and can't remember anything in the past, Heidi didn't know a lot about who she is. She didn't have concrete evidence of facts that that average person does today. She spent a large amount of time trying to decipher things that we are basically handed to in a silver platter. By this I mean that we don't have to work hard to get information about ourselves, while Heidi was traveling far out of her way.I would undoubtedly recommend this book for other readers, whether they are younger or older. This book wouldn't be difficult for younger people to read, but more critical readers (people in English 10H) would have a better grasp on the moral and meaning of the book. They would know what the author is trying to get across, the meaning of love."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"Do you like touching, heartwarming, realistic fiction stories? Are you looking for a good book? If so, So B. It may be the book for you. Twelve year old Heidi It lives with her mentally disabled mother, and her agoraphobic neighbor, Bernadette. Heidi's mother came to Bernadette's doorstep 12 years ago. They don't know where she came from, and So B. It (Heidi's mother) can't tell them using the twenty-three words that she knows. Some of these words are simple ones like tea and back soon, but there is one word that puzzles Heidi the most, soof. Soon, Heidi embarks on a journey that takes her across the country to find out where she came from, who she is, and what soof means, once and for all. This book was so good that I couldn't put it down until I finished. I laughed at some parts, I cried at others, and I couldn't believe how well Sarah Weeks described Heidi's feelings.

It","review":"You couldn't really tell about Mama's brain just from looking at her, but it was obvious as soon as she spoke. She had a high voice, like a little girl's, and she only knew twenty-three words. I know this for a fact, because we kept a list of the things Mama said tacked to the inside of the kitchen cabinet. Most of the words were common ones, like good and more and hot, but there was one word only my mother said, soof.Everyone wants to know the truth about their family's past, and where they come from, right? The main character, Heidi, in Sarah Weeks's So B. It has the same problem, except, her mom can't tell her the many secrets of her past. Heidi's mom is mentally disabled, and only knows twenty-three words. But there is one word that her mother adds to her vocabulary: soof. Heidi's thirst for the truth about what soof means, her father, her past, and many more secrets that her mother isn't able to tell her leads her on a cross-country journey. Her almost magical luck always points her in the right direction.Weeks's well written, heartwarming and bittersweet book, So B. It is great for all readers that crave realistic fiction books. Her characters seem very believable, and readers can imagine this actually happening too. Weeks did a great job with the plot. It moves at a good pace; Weeks gives you time to digest what has happened so far in the book, but she doesn't drag you along. The way Weeks writes this book encourages readers to think differently about the world, and to be thankful for what they have."},{"Title":"So B.

The emotions that run through this book are so true. Being the parent of a child who is mentally challenged, I heard my own voice so often in Heidi's thoughts. Her struggles to know her mother mirrors the struggles that all people who live and work with the mentally disabled experience. And Ms Weeks does a wonderful job of fully drawing all her characters. She treats both Bernadette and Sophia with dignity and respect, even while showing them in an honest light.

Heidi's neighbor, Bernadette, has lovingly taken care of Heidi \\"It\\" and her mom, \\"So B. It,\\" from the day they appeared at her doorstep, soaking wet. After years of mystery surrounding her origins, Heidi is on a quest to discover, among other things, what the meaning of the word \\"soof\\" is, one of the 23 words her mother says from time to time. Heidi slowly uncovers the answers in a daring adventure that takes her on a cross-country trip and helps her discover the meaning of her own and her mother's life. The book delivers a strong message about how feelings are attributed to those whom we consider disabled.Some premises are a little hard to swallow, like Heidi's uncanny good luck and how she manages at 13-years old to travel without more than a wallet being stolen. What better time of life to embrace the fantastic?The reading level is easy, though some of the subtlety will surely escape readers who think more concretely."},{"Title":"So B.

The author posits that truth is the color of dinosaur skin and that we don't know what color dinosaur skin is even though it is usually pictured as green.All through the book 'Dette is reasoning with Heidi that truth may not be ascertainable, while Heidi in her adolescent intensity plows through seemingly insurmountable odds to perservere and find the truth. The author combines mystery, character, and discovery in a \\"can't put it down\\" read."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"I agree that it is indeed a touching book. But I gave it three stars for many reasons. First off, this book was very realistic to me. Alright yes, the beginning is believable, but the ending? Not to me. What girl goes across the country by herself with permission and never gets in trouble? Also this book wasn't one of those page-turners. In fact I found myself bored a lot of the time. I think this book would have been a great story-if only it was approached differently."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"The book I read is called So B. It. The book is by Sarah Weeks. I would consider this book a realistic fiction book. It was about a girl named Heidi. Her mom has mental issues, she can't say many words. All of them are normal words, but there is one word that Heidi has never heard of. Soof. Heidi would do anything to find out what the word meant. Since her mom is disabled and she doesn't know of any relatives, she doesn't know anything about her heritage or even her mom's name. Heidi's neighbor Bernadette helps Heidi with her mom. Bernadette also teaches Heidi, since Heidi doesn't go to school.When Heidi finds a camera in a cabinet it could lead to everything. Heidi gets the cameras developed and looks at the pictures and saw a picture of her mom in front of a sign for a home for the disabled. She looked it up and found that it is in New York. Heidi, her mom, and Bernadette, live in New Mexico so that would be a long trip, but Heidi doesn't care she would do anything to find stuff about her mom and herself. Since Heidi's mom couldn't make the trip Bernadette has to stay with her because Heidi couldn't take care of her mom by herself. When Heidi finally gets to New York she doesn't get any of the answers right away, but it takes an unexpected turn.I thought this book was really good.

It","review":"My 10-year-old daughter gave this book to me. I read it very quickly. Not because it is classified as \\"young adult\\" literature, but rather because it's a very well told and compelling story.The narrator, a 12-year-old girl named Heidi, is instantly likeable. She at once had my sympathy, as it is very clear that her mother is seriously mentally handicapped. She, on the other hand, is not. She exhibits a strong sensitivity, keen intelligence, and a healthy dose of \\"good luck.\\" She travels alone from Reno to New York to have the questions answered about about who she is and where she came from, and all the while, you feel both her fear and her strength.The outcome becomes somewhat predictable, but the author provides several little surprises about the characters and particularly about the mother's special language, which made this story a true delight to read.

The gentle narrative and mystery in this tale keep you lulled into an excited, desperate world of concern, satisfaction, hope and gratitude throughout this amazing book. Sarah Weeks has treated the subject of mental retardation with grace and honesty. The suspence of the story is simple: what is \\"soof,\\" (a word the narrator and main character's mother says with a smile almost daily) what is the personal history of Heidi It, our sweet, smart 12 year old heroine and what lies ahead on her journey. Gotta run, but you must read this book. It is a heart pleasing joy."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"When deciding to read this book, I must admit that the topic of the book worried me. How could the author handle a delicate topic such as the main character, Heidi, being raised by a mentally disabled mother? Well the answer is that Sarah Weeks handled it beautifully.One cannot help but be charmed by these characters and also feel sympathetic, although the characters probably wouldn't ask for sympathy. Heidi It has been raised by her mother, with the tremendous help of Bernadette, her agoraphobic neighbor. She has been taking advantage of her lucky streak by playing the slot machines at the nearby Sudsy Duds Laundromat. This money helps to contribute to household finances. Heidi has been keeping a list of words that her mother is able to say and understand (with much help and patience from Bernadette). However one day, Heidi's mom says a word that is unfamiliar, \\"Soof.\\" With this odd word, Heidi is inspired to find out what this means and begins her long journey to find out her mother's history and learn a lot about herself on the way.At first, I was admittedly not buying the whole concept of this book, but as I read on, I had to remind myself that I am a cranky adult who sometimes thinks too realistically. This story is a very charming FANTASY. Heidi, Bernadette and Heidi's mom are all very likeable characters and I found myself rooting for Heidi to find what she was looking for. I simply wish that the ending was laid out in a better way. I found the beginning of the story and the story of Heidi's journey to be stretched out and then towards the end, too much happens and quickly resolves. However, this minor complaint does not hamper the story or the reader's ability to enjoy it."},{"Title":"So B.

To find out more, read this touching and amazing story by Sarah Weeks!"},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"\\"So b. It\\" is such a different kind of book than all the others I've read. I really got to know Heidi, the main character, and all the other interesting characters. I read it in school with a book club (we read three chapters over a week and then dicussed about it) and we all loved it so much. It is a great Literature book, and that's why my teacher chose it.I don't want to give a lot away, but here's a summary of the book.Bernadette hears an awful sound outside her door and opens it to see what it is. That's when she finds Heidi and Mama cold and wet and takes them in.Sarah Weeks starts the book of with Heidi talking about the color of dinasors and how no one really knows the truth about the color of them. This book revoles around truth, and not knowing. All of the people that I know have read it say that it's the best book they ever read in their whole entire life! Well, the bottom line is that it's a GREAT, FANTASTIC book and YOU should DEFFINITLY read it!p.s. Even my teacher enjoyed it as much as we did! So READ IT!"},{"Title":"So B.

It","review":"This book is THE BEST!!!!!!!!! I read it in two nights it is so good. Practically all of my friends are reading it. It is so good!!!!!!Okay, so before I start my real review, like where I actually talk about the book, I want to ask you something: Do you know what the word \\"soof\\" means?Don't even waste your time looking in the dictionary. It's not there. The only way you're going to find out what it means is if you read the book, which is what I'm trying to make you do. Here's some background information...Heidi lives in a tiny apartment with her disabled mother. Her mom only knows 23 words! Mama's vocabulary consists of mostly regular words, like tea, and hot, and kiss. But there's only one word tht just her mama says: Soof.Heidi knows that this word means something, and shes going to find out what. But there's much, much more than that. She wants to know who she really is and her history.With a sweater and some pictures, Heidi leaves home, and sets off for liberty, ready to discover the secrets of her past. She doesn't know that she will come home a completly different person, until after she receives a phone call...Well, that's my review. Well, if you read this book,I garenty that you will LOVE it. If you don't, well then So B. It."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"So B. It is about a young, determined girl (Heidi) that just wants answers. She lives with her mentally challenged mother and her neighbor, Bernadette. Bernie has a fear of leaving her house, so as Heidi grows older, she takes on the task of grocery shopping, taking out the garbage, and all other outdoor chores. Her mother only knows 23 words, so she has no answers for Heidi. One of her words that interests Heidi is \\"soof\\". Nobody knows what it means. Heidi soon becomes determined to find her family, after stumbling across pictures of people that could possibly be them. She see's a building in one picture with a girl in front that resembles her mother. She finds that the building is in Liberty, New York, and sets off alone to find it. She slowly begins to find answers that she has been looking for. Some answers are not what she would like to hear. This is a good book. A story about mystery and courage. I recommend that people of all ages read it."},{"Title":"So B.

It","review":"This book was amazing.I bought it at a school book fair because I saw an avertisment in the halls about it. I wanted it from the moment i read what it was about. I loved this book."},{"Title":"So B. It","review":"You must read this book! It was the first book that caught my eye in the book store. I tried to read it at dinner but my mom wouldn't let me! I like reading about disabled people because it's just more interesting for me. This book is very discriptive and made me cry..... don't laugh! If I had three wishes one of them would be that So B.

Item arrived quickly and was in condition stated! Packaged well! Great reference tool!"},{"Title":"Communication and Computing for Distributed Multimedia Systems (Artech House Communications Library)","review":"I was a little concerned when I saw the black and white cover. But the book was band new and the hard cover is in fact colored. Book was in good condition."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I read _Redemption_ without having read _Trinity_ (the subsequent reading of which made me enjoy both versions of the story all the more), and thought it was a beautiful book. The fact that the younger characters learn so much about themselves and (at the risk of sounding trite) life while experiencing the horrors at Gallipoli, a place where it was a struggle to LIVE, much less learn, makes this a book that is even more enthralling than many of the other Uris books I have read. It took me a couple of weeks to get through it, but it was worth every minute and more--but make no mistake: this is not a thrilling story like _Topaz_, but an artistic work that comes much closer to reality. Anyone's life has its &quot;boring&quot; points, and Uris' characters become real for the reader all the more for the fact that they are not always thrill-seeking, but sometimes just want to live to see the next day. If you're looking for an adventure story, this is not the book for you, but if you like exciting literature in the artistic tradition, look no further."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I read Trinity in February, 1978, and I loved it.I have been trying to read Redemption for six weeks now, and am just now fighting the Turks.The character development that enabled Uris to give us background information on many characters (like Caroline, Seamus, Shelley, Atty) without confusing which characters were his clear focus (Conor, Tomas and Kiltie) is missing here. The book bounces around between too many characters and too many story lines with not enough time devoted to any of them to let the reader know whose stories are the crux of the book.Perhaps the problem is that Uris goes over already-told Trinity tales and can't get focused on his main characters. Outside of seeing the word &quot;redemption&quot; batted around by different characters, I can't find anything that unifies the stories contained in this book."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I don't know what &quot;Trinity&quot; is about but from other reviews I can see that is has something to do with &quot;Redemption&quot;. And this is really the greatest book I read during the last few years. I really felt in love with Ireland (and of course New Zealand), Conor and Rory. It was just unbelievable how written words can touch you so much. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I realize I'm going out on a limb here, since Trinity has come to mean so much to so many ( I know people who can quote from the book ) ( I also have a nephew named Conor ), but I really enjoyed this novel. I'm not of Irish decent and cannot relate to the events of either book. I feel the style of writing was very good. It flowed, at times like poetry.I do apologize to thos who have come to love Trinity. Replicating a novel of it's status is very difficult to do.
