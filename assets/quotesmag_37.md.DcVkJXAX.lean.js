The author writes well--the characters are described as real personalities.

In a literary world full of books where, no matter the genre, the characters act in extremely predictable ways, Young's book offers uncomprimising and refreshing honesty in his book about a fraudulent naval chaplain.

One of the Guys is FUNNY, SURREAL AND SEXY--no matter what your persuasion! Miles Derry, the main character, seizes life with a frenzy un-matched by most humans. This book is not for the faint-hearted or the politically correct. Robert Clark Young gives his characters no peace, and his readers even less. It's a read you won't forget."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"What can I say...I simply couldn't put it down. STUNNING."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I found this book amusing, fun, and hilarious while at the same time serious and somewhat heartbreaking. Miles' quest to find out his true identity is hard enough, and pretending to be someone he is not makes it ever more difficult. It was a very original way to show Miles' character. Thumbs up to Robert Young! END"},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"The premise of this book is interesting and the first few pages were both well written, and very promising. Unfortunately, the writing deteriorated through the rest of the book. There were too many run-on sentences and obvious strains of effort in putting together the dialog. A book is generally not worth reading when one starts to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed for the author. I'm not objecting to the premise or language of the book but to the quality of the writing which simply wasn't very good.Oddly enough I first encountered this book when its creator sent me an unsolicited email message urging me to read it. Receiving spam is obnoxious enough in itself, but receiving heaps of self-praise and frantic requests to buy a marginally written work is just sad."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"Bob Young is going places. What a book! I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for your next one Bob."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I couldn't wait to buy the book and after reading his work I am a true fan of his. Bob is a real down to earth, and funny, man. I loved the book because Bob Young made a hero out of a looser. But what I loved most about the novel is the vivid details of navel life, which makes you feel as though you are a sailor. I hope that in the future Bob will write a sequel to this novel because I just can't get enough of Miles Derry! It's a great story by a great writer. END"},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I just finished reading &quot;One Of The Guys&quot; and have to say that I thought it was smashing. The little blurb on the front of the book describes it as a &quot;service comedy&quot; and I've read several comments by people saying how hard they laughed. To be quite honest, I didn't think of it as a comedy at all and only laughed once near the end but when I did I howled. I did, however, think that this story was full of irony and biting wit and those are the qualities that made it such a wonderful reading experience for me. There was so much truth in the story: the truth of human nature, the sad truths about the things humans do to other humans and then excuse those actions by dehumanizing the ones whom they abuse and the hopeful truth that even though a human being hits bottom there is always the possibility that he/she can begin anew and become a different person. Not quite the way Miles did it but as a metaphor it was the perfect plotline. And, contrary to what some extremist organizations would have us believe, I think it is important that people know about the terrible and unforgiveable things that are visited upon people in countries as poor as those cited as sex ports in the story. The only way to rid ourselves of immoralities is to look at them straight on and say that this isn't right and it has to stop. To stick our collective heads in the sand and pretend that such things don't exist is not only cowardly but it debases us all.I can understand why the Navy is upset by this book. It tells too much of a truth to be palatable to them. And to anyone who has ever had to deal with a 19 year old male, I say multiply that one young man by a ship's complement of 600 and try to imagine what you would get. I think, upon reflection, one would have to agree that you would get what is described in this book. To believe that the United States Military is what is portrayed in movies like Operation Petticoat is so naive as to be laughable. Perhaps in the real world things aren't quite as lax as described in this story but I would be willing to bet that Robert Young's account isn't too far off the mark.If I had to characterize One Of The Guys in one sentence, I would say that it is the story of a man who has been lost for all of his life who, despite running away from what is left of his life and discarding his identity, finds in himself the man he always wanted to be. This is one great story."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"Superb piece of modern American fiction, in the best traditions of the likes of early John Irving. The story suerbly develops the main (and subsidary) characters, and you really want to know what is going to happen at the end. It is both humourous, touching, bitter sweet, and yet has an edge and a newness to it, which makes it interesting"},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"This is a most unusual novel. You've got Miles Derry, who begins the book cleaning up the glory-hole video booths at a porn shop. He's an ex-addict, ex-drunk, a father of one child out of wednlock he has never really gotten to know, and has spent his whole life feeling like he is just not &quot;One of the Guys.&quot; Well, in one of said booths is a dead naval chaplain, who bears more than enough of a passing resemblance to Miles that Miles can assume his identity. Shipping out with the Navy as a Chaplain, Miles has what I can only call a somewhat surreal journey, which, regardless of a few bumps along the way, kept my interest throughout.Despite some really foul language (even I was blushing at parts), and a few very tired stereotypes (gay priests yet again, anyone?), the book was very good, and I enjoyed it. It is cynical, and in places outright repulsive in the vivid prose used to describe what is going on about, around, and to our pseudo-chaplain. I also have no grasp at all on the US Navy and its workings, but imagine that Young's representations were extrapolated: driven to an extreme to really show the sides he wanted illustrated. I'm above the 49th parallel, though, so I found a lot of the Navy rules, regulations, and acronyms stupefying, making it much easier to walk this novel hand in hand with Miles.I caution against reading this book too seriously. I laughed a lot, when I wasn't swallowing a wince or a queasy feeling, and even though I'm finished, I still can't decide how I feel about Miles. It's a thought-provoking book, if you can get past the coarseness and gore. I'd reccommend it, just beware the sea-sickness."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I was in the U.S. Navy for 22 years, stationed at Long Beach before I retired. I can say that this book is as accurate a representation of Navy life as I have ever seen. During my time in the Navy, I deployed to all of the places mentioned in this book, including Subic Bay (the Philippines) and Okinawa in Japan. This book is a realistic account of what went on historically in those places. Tho I also think that his book works on levels of symbolism too. Because what he's saying isn't true just about the Navy. It is true about life. Whenever you have an individual in an institution, there's a tension between that person's individuality and the needs and demands of the institution. It's unfortunate but usually the institution wins. I like this book because in this instance it's the main character who has the last laugh. I would highly reccommend this book to anybody. It is a great read just as a story, in addition to what it is trying to say about human society."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"As a woman, my initial concern that One of the Guys might be too testosterone-driven for me to relate to have turned out to be completely exaggerated. I have been reading this book and am every bit as engaged in the final chapters as I was on page one. Marvelous. Truly marvelous. I am enjoying this reading experience on SO many levels, with none of the complaints I usually have about the bulk of fiction out there today. Young writes beautifully, but not pompously. The characters he has created are fleshed out and every bit as complex and challenging as people you might meet face-to-face. Moreover, he gives his characters an actual PLOT to function within, and provides them with intriguing moral and social challenges to grapple with. Too much of fiction leaves me with this hungry, unfulfilled feeling, wondering whether the time invested in reading the thing was really worth it. This book leaves me wanting for nothing. If Robert Clark Young's unpublished novels are anything approaching this caliber, it is a crime that it took this long for one of them to be published."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"In what initially seems a downbeat first chapter we meet Miles, the 33 year-old protagonist, who's down. Down on life, down on his father, whose ever-diminishing expectations Miles fails faithfully to live up to, down on his luck. The only salutary note is his daughter, conceived out of wedlock, raised out of sight but not out of mind. Miles is the only living character we meet in this first chapter. A beginning Sartre or Camus would have loved.And throughout the story (which has been fully detailed in past reviews) we witness the fleshing out of the hollow man - his character develops as he &quot;grows into&quot; the shoes of the dead chaplain he replaces. As his worries of being found out, of not knowing the drill, the acronyms and the Methodist Sunday service are gradually allayed, Miles comed to terms with the lunacy of what he's witnessing at first hand: seamen whose emotional growth is institutionally stunted yet who surge into town on 24-hour liberty passes like testosterone terminators.The prose is as sparse and apposite as only someone who has (reportedly) received 600 rejections could make it. The author's &quot;take&quot; on every situation seems exemplary. Not one superfluous adjective can be found hiding behind the locker; Young's kit and caboodle are laid out proudly pristine for inspection. It beggars belief that someone who can write like this could have trouble finding a backer.Perhaps he multi-layered nature of the book is a clue to this. I read it straight through, pausing only to attend to bodily needs, then stupidly lent my copy to a friend. In the month following I mulled over the story, the satire and the symbols and now need a re-read to slake my thirst. It's very rare to find a first novel as complete, as competent and as compelling as this one. Two-thirds of the way through, you sense Miles is taking control of his own destiny and the surge of real pleasure you feel sets you turning the pages faster as the denouement approaches.OOTG is RCY's first published novel. If he follows the lead of his namesake and mentor NPY, his second will be an all-time masterpiece."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"One of the Guys is a deeply symbolic book masked by an outrageously funny tale about a guy trying to find good in himself and finally being comfortable with who he is.

The book has characters whose personalities seem familiar ie. the wacky officers on the ship! So read it with your tongue firmly in your cheek and remember it's all in good fun!"},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"ONE OF THE GUYS is a deeply symbolic, satirical novel that I don't think can be read just on the surface level. This is a book that's for people who are interested in the MEANING of a work of literature, not just the surface stuff like the plot or the &quot;vulgarity&quot; of certain recorded speech. If the Massachusetts reader thinks that the &quot;greatness&quot; of a work of literature depends on having a low incidence of 4-letter words, then she should go back to reading romance novels and not bother her head with a serious work ever again. This book is beautifully written, studded with stunning passages. Does it contain documentary descriptions of naval officers? Who cares? The Florida reader sounds like the kind of guy who would read &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and think it was about horses and pigs! He doesn't seem to understand that in the genre of satire, hyperbole and irony are used in order to make the author's points. I don't think the characters in this book are supposed to represent naval officers, I think the author is trying to say something about humanity and human organizations. But I don't think you'll understand all of that if you just read it on the surface level like some empty-headed Tom Clancy novel or something. Just my opinion."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I am a busy college student with not a lot of time for reading. However, I couldn't put this book down. It was eye-opening, inciteful, and touching. This book renewed my faith in reading for pleasure.

Robert Clark Young should have a promising literary future based on this first novel, which is a gritty, straightforward, compelling piece of work. I am not one usually to read an entire novel that essential takes place entirely on a naval ship, and some of the characters were a bit repellant to me. However, the story of Miles and his quest for any semblance of a true self was honest and believable throughout. The only thing that kept me from bestowing a 5-star rating on the book was my own personal disappointment with the &quot;too tidy&quot; ending. Other than that, the reading of this engaging novel was nothing less than a true joy."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"The story line sounded quite curious - and because I also spent 20 years in the Navy - I thought I could be an interesting read. Well, I must say the premise and execution of the tale is funny and very entertaining, although I did anticipate the ending. What detracted from the story was the gross misrepresentation of the officers and sailors of the Navy. While I cannot deny parts of the book are probably accurate and gleaned from first hand information, the blantant sexual sterotypes both in personalities and behavior were totally unreal. Young says he spent a number of years as a civilian college instructor on board Navy ships. If he's drawing these &quot;anecdotes&quot; from personal experience then that's one ship the Navy would best do without. He uncovered every possible sailor fantasy from lurid orgies ashore in the Far East to midnight rendezvous aboard ship. Drinking binges and other illegal behavior for anyone in uniform. And all this reportedly happened in the years following the Gulf War - - at the time the Navy was reeling from the Tailhook debacle and launching into severe policitical and sexual correctness. But all that being said, Young writes an entertaining novel. If you can swallow the inaccurate, atypical portrayals of the main characters, then you'll enjoy the book.

It means: an episodic style of fiction dealing the with the adventures of a rough and dishonest but appealing hero. Judging by the knee-jerk moralistic posturing aroused by the book, maybe it ought to have a warning right up on page 1: WARNING: PICARESQUE! NOT TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY--PROCEED WITHCAUTION!Young is a writer in a writer's most vital role: as one who calls the community to account for its hypocrisies and bad faith.

I'm wondering whether the reviewer and I read the same novel. Because his or her story synopsis--though replete with factual errors--seems to have some of the elements of the novel that I read, I must conclude that we did have the same book in our respective hands, but that we experienced it very differently. In the first place, the style of Young's tale is that of a satire. They say the purpose of the satirist is to expose human error to withering ridicule, often through the use of hyperbole and irony. Either the reviewer does not get satire or did not read this book. I suspect it is both."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"This odyssey through hell to redemption has all the authenticity and suspense anyone could ask for."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"&quot;One of the Guys&quot; provides us with hints and promises that we have a fine novelist in the making. As a reverse take on &quot;The Rake's Progress&quot; Young weaves a tale of self acceptance written during a time when such discussions are generally relegated to psychologist's offices or manic TV talk shows. Given the character Miles at the onset of this sprawling journey portrayed as someone who could easily be the chief player in a comedy of errors (and a rather unsympathetic one at that), Young manages to build his story well, pacing the episodes that remain related until the book's end. We end up caring for this self-made misfit in a way which leaves us with intospection as the last pages close. Some of the &quot;authenticity of time and place and language&quot; occassionally get tedious and suggest that the words were assembled for shock value. How many expletives and military acronyms do we need to &quot;get it&quot;? The character development is sound, and although the ending reels abit like a Hollywood movie, that may be intentional. This little novel should be considered for a run on the screen! In all, an enjoyable and well constructed tale of an antihero earning his wings. I look forward to this intelligent author's next book."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I am certainly in the minority with my review of this book. Very rarely do I read a book that is so void of any redeeming qualities. The premise in itself is preposterous. A down and out ex-druggie working at his job mopping up porn movie cubicles (yuk) finds a dead Navy chaplain and assumes his identity. These Navy people take years training to be in the Navy and Miles Derry is not only going to walk on the ship and become one of them (acronyms and all) but is going to know how to perform religious ceremonies at the same time. The foul language was more than disgusting and the stereotyping of all marine/naval personnel as sex-crazed lunatics makes me wonder about who's defending our country. Perhaps this is a guy's book. I was offended by everything I read on these pages. I was not one of the reviewers who were approached by the author himself to read the book. I was just someone who thought the cover and blurbs were interesting. I obviously didn't read it carefully enough. I was so very wrong with this purchase. The only other book I read last year that was as bad as this one was The Sopranos by Alan Warner."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"Robert Clark Young has written a throughly enjoyable book. Parts hilarious, parts sublime, often profane (of course one would expect profanity from sailors.....) in language and treatment of serious issues. While not monumemtal in scope, it never the less deals with the issues it touches upon with grace and style. While the premise sometimes stretches credibility, it does not do so to great extent. Never having been in the Navy, I probably did not enjoy it as much as one who has gone through the experience would. I recommend it."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot, and I thought it was very well written. The characters are very well constructed, and the descriptions are (I presume) very accurate, I could almost feel I was there on that ship too. It was also very instructive, the navy jargon at first was a little tiresome, but midway through the book I could understand almost all the acronyms without having to check at previous pages (although adding an &quot;acronyms' annex&quot; at a future edition could be a good idea). The accident passage was breathtaking, as were the scenes at the equator-line crossing (so those are the guys who are in charge of our &quot;new imperial world order&quot; army? Damn...) Some of the prostitution passages could be considered a little crude, but I'm sure reality is much worse, so they are justifiable by the context. I guess Philippines' prostitution scene is not that different from what we (unfortunately) have in poorer parts of others countries, there's a lot of child prostitution around here too. Finally, I was happy with the way the author ended the tale, I thought the story was going in one direction and it turned into another (I won't give details in order not to spoil it for future readers). I read that book about 3 or 4 months ago, I'm writing this message without having the book around (it's at home and I'm typing from office), but I still can remember a good portion of it (that from a guy who reads about 15 books a month) - I guess it means I liked it, and I sure did!"},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I found &quot;One of the Guys&quot; to be humorous ridicule, and a method by which he (the author) conveyed satirical criticism to expose follies and vices that existed long before Mr. Young ever set pen to paper.&quot;One of the Guys&quot; covers alleged 'taboo' subjects, to wit: the world oldest profession; i.e., prostitution, as well as porn shops and throw in a little homosexuality along with a nymphomaniac. Of course, he chose the United States Navy as the background for his satire which afforded the author great latitude in fiction. And remember, the genre is fiction!I must say for all the controversy over &quot;the book,&quot; it would have been a greater effort, on behalf of opposing contingencies, if they attacked the actual events evidenced in today's' headlines as aggressively as certain organizations attacked &quot;One of the Guys.&quot;I personally enjoyed the wit; the story; the writing and the serious side of the book. Mr. Young created very believable characters.Thank you Mr. Young for a very enjoyable work if fiction which I continually highly recommend."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"Forget the improbability of a man without military experience duping trained naval personnel into believing he is one of them. Remember Reader, that One Of The Guys is a work of Fiction. The protagonist, Miles Derry, knew, \\"Nothing was ridiculous: he could prove this to himself.\\" (page 7, One Of The Guys) And he does.One Of The Guys is satire at its finest. Satire is rooted in the everyday lives of the people who write it, read it, and experience it. It goes without saying that satire almost always contains an element of the fanciful. At the same time, a story that ultimately fails to connect with the world in which we breathe and breed - our mundane lives of jobs and bills and family hassles - isn't likely, in the end, to impress anyone. Readers of fiction need real people in extraordinary situations to plug into. Such, in any case, are my kind of stories, and Robert Clark Young's debut novel, One Of The Guys, has all the genuineness and suspense I had asked for.Really down-on-his-luck-former-drug-addict-recovering-alcoholic Derry just wants a \\"place in the world\\", a place with choices and opportunities and successes. He wants to fit in, to be One of The Guys. Where this novel differs from other tales of masquerade is the meticulous character detail and first-rate writing skills of the author, coupled with the highly readable and strong voice of Derry himself as he tells us all about it. You, Reader, are there along with him, plunging through the rolling seas on a tour of duty to Southeast Asia, astonished by the orgies in the Philippines and sickened by the horrors of war.Whatever symbolism you glean from One Of The Guys, so too will you find the tale entertaining and Young manages to give adventure reading a fresh respectability with his unique handling of fiction, fancy, and fun. Young blends humor, wit, intelligence, and passion seamlessly with fiction and comes up with a can't-put-it-down novel where small victories over life's vicissitudes have you cheering Derry on in his quest for redemption, and eagerly awaiting the next book from this author whose star is on the rise."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I have read through all of the reviews and Kirkus just didn't get it, nor did the woman who objected to the language. Ever work side by side with men? And be the only woman around? I have, and one of MY guys was an ex-Navy fighter pilot who used to regale me with stories of Vietnam combat and Navy ship behavior, and I found the book to be a satire of the military, yes, but also a believable account of life on board ship (and off ship during shore leave) during a 6 month deployment. I agree with all the other reviews and don't have much else to add except to say that I probably wouldn't have chosen this book to read unless the author's e-mail had not requested me to do so. The jacket illustration is manly, as is the title, and I would have thought that this was a Tom Clancy-like novel of little interest to me. Was I wrong!!! Miles' personality and his desire to leave his disenfranchised position in society and belong to something or someone, for once in his life, really grabbed my sympathy from the start. Those who want to belong so badly usually never can, just because it means so much to them that they can never relax and just &quot;be.&quot; Miles begins this way, agonizing over his deception, worrying about contradicting himself, and stumbling through ship board routine that is as confusing to him as the religious order of service he is expected to know. Yet when he starts to relax in his role, despite knowing that at any moment he could be discovered, he becomes &quot;One Of The Guys&quot; without even realizing it. Yes, the satire of the Navy (and of military service in general, really) is hilarious to me, and points out the ridiculous rules of pecking order that men have always lived by. The abuse of power, the absurd need for a hero, the ease with which someone clearly incompetent can get by without attracting too much notice -- these things are not only indictments against the armed forces, but society in general. What woman wouldn't love to see someone like Miles defraud the military, representing male dominated society? Who couldn't help but to be touched by his sincere desire to do right by his daughter? As a chaplain with not much to do except play computer games, he is capable of helping some of the men, simply because he WASN'T one of the guys for so many years. Who better to understand sin than someone who lived a life on the fringes of society? When faced with the horrors of war, he is affected,yes, but does not lose his sanity like the priest who was sent to the burned out village to administer last rites. Miles is truly a hero, and not in the military sense, because in the end, he finds that the truth is the most important thing to own up to. He cares about others more than about himself, and risks everything just to set the record straight. This book is entertaining and thought-provoking, on many levels, and I highly recommend it to everyone, men and women alike. There is something in this book for everyone! If you are afraid of colorful language and only want to read sanitized versions of life, then avoid this book. If you are interested in real life, then this book is mandatory!I can't wait to see what the author can come up with next. Wow! What a superb first book! I hope many more will follow."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"Bob Young is a brilliant writer! I think that he has been able to write such a great book from his experience! The relationship that as a reader you gain with Miles, the main character, is definately comparable to the relationship formed with the protagonist in such classics as &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; &quot;Slaughter House 5&quot; and &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot; BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"It's easy to understand why this author has such a strong cult following. This is a novel of highly intricate symbolic meaning, which addresses a range of issues which I've never seen addressed all in one place, and certainly not in any other work of contemporary fiction. This is a desperately important book. Yes, it is a hilarious satire. Yes, it is a stunning picaresque. But it's much more than that. The writing is wiltingly beautiful, and demonstrates a versatility that is nothing short of amazing for a first novel. The various styles include comedy, farce, tragedy, discursive philosophy, hard-boiled narrative drive, and a very wickedly sly satire that whacks you in the face unexpectedly. Thematically, a mad and mythical United States Navy is used as a symbol for the corruption of all institutions, and our hero, Miles Derry--a character worthy of Jonathan Swift or Thomas Pynchon--is a thoroughly modern Everyman, symbolizing the struggle of the individual to conform to an increasingly absurd and witless society. ONE OF THE GUYS is a harrowing excursion into the greed, stupidity, loss of faith, and loss of values in Western culture at the turn of the millennium, and no doubt will be read by future generations as definitive for our time. I don't want to write a Ph.D. thesis here, but, beneath the surface of the racing plot, you will find intricate symbolism on just about every page. One of my favorite pages is 73, wherein the author deftly demolishes religious hypocrisy in the figure of Father Ogleby, who, while inveighing against sexual sins, unwittingly reveals his avidity for each of the other seven deadly sins. I was stunned when I first read that passage, and I have reread it many times, trying to determine how so much could be said in a couple of paragraphs. When I read the book the first time, I kept having that experience over and over again, for 306 pages. I can't think of another contemporary novel that works on so many different intricate levels, and I do not hesitate to venture that there is something very much like genius occurring here. If Chaucer were alive today, this is the book he would write. Indeed, the epigraph is from the Canterbury Tales. That is what ONE OF THE GUYS is--a modern Canterbury tale, every bit as ribald, satirical, controversial, and meaningful as the work of the greatest medieval poets (indeed, much of the writing here is poetic, and could easily be set into verse...ONE OF THE GUYS is that rare accomplishment, a highly successful prose poem). Perhaps someday a concordance will be put together to explicate this book to the general reader. In any case, I eagerly await this provocative author's next book. We are witnessing the birth of a great literary career, and this is one of the few authors who make the new millennium an exciting era in which to be alive. I have an inkling that one hundred years from now, the work of Robert Clark Young will be taught in universities alongside that of Pynchon, Swift, Chaucer, and the other great satirical moralists of the Western tradition."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"Robert Young has just published his first novel, One of the Guys. An amazing book. He tackles two American institutions and shows that they both are Satan incarnate. The first one is pornography. It has its adult bookstores, with cubicles and glory holes. It has its prostitution circuits and routes, where a woman, or a man, is nothing but either a piece of meat, or a canibalistic customer. The tone of the author is there harsh, brutal, ruthless, and he shows how the money of the customers creates the customized goods those customers want and consume. Our sexual consumer's society reduces myriads of women and men, boys and girls to slavery, a degrading, alienating and neurotic slavery. A slavery of the body and of the mind to the most twisted phantasms of money-loaded customers, the form of the prostitution depending only on the amount of money the customer has and on the amount of money the prostitute of hustler can ambition to get. The second institution is essentially the US Navy, but also the US Armed Forces. There the book becomes a satire and is full of humour and irony, even if the subject is serious. He shows how these Armed Forces are divided in hostile and jealous corps. He shows how these Armed Forces are unfit for battle. He shows how these Armed Forces are totally based on alienating the free will of the soldiers or sailors in order for the officers to dominate them and manipulate them into doing what they are expected to do and do not need to understand. To boost up the morale of the troops, those officers use methods that are un-human, and that represent some kind of cattle herding policy, reducing soldiers and sailors to nothing but animals that are sent to the slaughterhouse of a battle, filled with hatred, alcohol, cheap sex and a little bit of fake religion. What's more he shows how the whole network of US military bases in the world are nothing but a cobweb where young girls and boys are trapped by the dollar spiders for the only benefit of the soldiers, the sailors, and their officers. It is by providing these with that big perambulating brothel that US Armed Forces are able to perform their supposedly patriotic and humanistic duties. The hero is the constant proof of that absurdity of a system that creates evil in the name of good, though that good is nothing but the interests of a few powerful people who pull the strings, be they politicians or anyone who has some interest in providing those Armed Forces with goods, including the rotten dictators here and there who accept a village to be destroyed by a lost shell in maneuvers, provided a fair number of millions of dollars can fatten their bank accounts here and there in some paradise that is not lost at all, even if it is prospering on the hell in which millions of people are forced to live. So, in front of such a powerful book, we can forget about the fact that Miles, the hero, has officially died in a fire at the beginning of the book and reappears - ressuscitates - at the end of the book, with no question asked."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"One of the Guys (1999), is somewhat reminiscent of Jerzy Kosinski's Being There, brimming with comedy, poignancy, insight, surprises, shocks, and revelations.One of the Guys is not for the prudish reader. The legendary profanity of the navy (or armed forces in general) is brought vividly to life throughout the novel. Profanity, colorful and creative, flows unstintingly from all-- Commanding Officers to lowly seamen. Body parts, body fluids and sex acts are all given prominent, lurid descriptions ala the frequently sexist, vulgar voices of men at sea. One of the Guys is probably not going to be read and discussed at too many refined literary social circles.Equally distressing for some will be the view of the military presented in One of the Guys by Young. The men, officers and non, prey upon each other in sickening, dehumanizing fashion both verbally and physically, celebrate the fact that taxpayers are paying for their visits to sexual Disneylands at port, become the ugliest of \\"ugly Americans\\" ashore, shrug off miscalculations by the \\"boom boom boys\\" that lead to the accidental bombing of a Philippine village and the burning deaths of its inhabitants (saying a little additional foreign aid will cover it up), and resist with every inch of their bodies and souls any modernization of the military which includes political correctness or any kind of equity. It is a throwback to a sexist, racist, uncivil, world-unto-itself military in spite of the story being set well after the Gulf War.Through it all, through the hell he observes and participates in both on the Harding and off, Miles begins to change. Accidents he makes which turn out for the good, deeds he commits without thinking, and lots of introspection all lead to a new man-- a man discovering himself for the first time, a man who dedicates himself to being more the old Miles Derry was ever capable of being, more than the chaplain whose identity he stole was, more than one of the guys. It is an awesome evolution to witness with an intriguing ending and an impressive first novel well worth the reading."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"An enchanting story whith one of the best plots I've seen since WATERSHIP DOWN. A must read book that is soon to be a classic. If you want a good book I would say you should try this book, because it is just inspiring. It is one of those books you can read again and again without losing intrest. So I would highly recommend this book to any serious reader, or any one who wants something new."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"After reading One Of The Guys by Robert Clark Young I have high hopes for future works by the author but only if he gets a new editor. An editor who is driven to nurture art and not just make enough spare change for a cheeseburger and the new Rolling Stone.While the story and Mr. Young's style have much potential One of the Guys falls disappointingly short since the author does not take the premise to it's authentic conclusion. The tale begins with Miles Derry as a janitor in a triple X bookstore/sexshop. Miles is tired of his loser life and when while performing his mopping duties he happens upon a look-a-like dead Navy Chaplin with orders to appear on ship, Miles jumps at what he hopes will prove that he life has dealt a bad hand and that given the chance he too can make something of himself.We follow Miles as he stumbles along learning his new role. One of the Guys doesn't fail to entertain with many close calls but misses the boat on searching beneath the surface of humanity. Even the simple revelation that not much has changed and in his role as Chaplin, Miles is still mopping up disgusting messes is not explored. I feel that the author held back and was not pushed to deliver.Over all a great way to spend an afternoon and just the sort of fluff that would make a good movie. Now that the author has his first published novel out of the way hopefully he will devote himself to taking the risk that his chosen profession dictates. Robert Clark Young is a fine storyteller and reporter. While many reporters can tell that the bell is ringing I hope Mr. Young matures into a writer that tells for whom the bell tolls..."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"This is an excellent first novel by Robert Clark Young. It's hysterical, serious, and keeps you literally on the edge of your seat. I was rooting for Miles Derry all through the book, wondering how he'd handle his different dilemas aboard the USS Warren Harding...and truly hoping he'd pull this off without hitch. Chaplin? Truly so, but more like Charlie Chaplin, Miles was an excellent character and a better man than I, Gunga Din.

I think it is a modern Canterbury tale. It's the kind of ribald writing that they tried to excommunicate Chaucer for--in other words, this is a hilarious romp, like &quot;The Miller's Tale.&quot; Indeed, the epigraph to this book is from the Canterbury Tales' &quot;Shipman's Prologue.&quot; Buy two copies of Mr. Young's novel, as you'll wear out the first one with rereading. I'm going to read it again because I think I missed some of the intricate symbolism the first time through--I always get more out of a book the second time. Let's just hope that the people with &quot;the automatic minds&quot; don't try to get this author to recant in his old age, as they did with Chaucer."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"Think of &quot;Catch-22&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and add a dash of Dante's &quot;Inferno&quot; -- then I think you are in the neighborhood of Robert Clark Young's dark and wry novel about an imposter aboard a modern US Navy vessel. Miles Derry, a recovering alcoholic and druggie, goes from a job in a porno store to unexpected heights of growth when he assumes another man's identity. It makes for compelling reading as Miles' odyssey carries him along on a voyage with what I fervently hope is NOT an average US Navy crew."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Miles Derry is a likeable character and one could relate to his desire to fit in. The depiction of the reality of life in the military is a bit depressing, but most likely highly accurate.

I can't wait for another novel by this author to come out."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"Although this isn't the best novel I've ever read, it is well worth the money I spent on it. The book didn't &quot;grip&quot; me until about 3/4's of the way through. At that time, for me, it became a real page turner. This novel's biggest asset is originality. I've never read anything remotely similar. I would recommend it. Especially to anyone who has ever been associated with a military life style. You will laugh out loud in spots. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"Robert Clarke Young's first novel &quot;One Of The Guys&quot; is a very funny book. Although very close related to navy talk &quot;One of the guys&quot; is worth reading, even if you never were one of the guys. The story seems to be funny in the beginning and has its comical phases, but nevertheless the author gives a fictional picture of the navy that makes you laugh and think at the same time. &quot;One of the Guys&quot; is a premiere novel that surely creates great expectations for further novels to come. I think that the novel is extremely well researched (as Young was one of the guys he undoubtedly knows a lot of details) and a real pleasure to read.

Few have succeeded. Those who have are the ones who have chosen to illustrate small parts of the larger whole, and selected the right parts. Margaret Murie comes to mind. But 16 years on, Coming Into the Country is still the best.I own and have read everything McPhee has written. I subscribe to New Yorker mostly for the annual or biennial piece by McPhee. I like the geology series very much, and parts of Birch Bark Canoe still make me laugh out loud, but Country is his best book.McPhee's many gifts including finding and understanding interesting, compelling people, and writing about them eloquently and non-judgmentally. He uses those people and what they say to convey his larger themes. Stan Gelvin and his dad, Willie Hensley and, of course, the folks in and around Eagle. He somehow wrangled a seat on the state capital relocation committee's helicopter. He somehow charmed the irascible Joe Vogler into candor. I talked with Vogler - who has since been murdered in a gun deal gone bad - about McPhee's interview, and he told me that McPhee took no notes during interviews over a week, and yet &quot;pretty much got it right.&quot;I've lived in Alaska most of my life. I've read the gushy stuff (Michener, for example), the political diatribes (Joe McGinnis, for example), and the gee-whiz tourist fodder. McPhee, instead of trying to paint the whole state, paints a series of miniatures which give you a much accurate glimpse than the writers and hacks who try to &quot;describe&quot; Alaska.Maybe it's that America's best non-fiction writer brought his special tools and skills to the right opportunities; maybe it's just luck. It all came together in this book. The last bit, his walk down to the river and the growing worry, verging on panic, that this is wilderness, that a bear could be around the next corner, that he is not in control and can never be in control; the eloquence and the message are what makes Alaska. No one has described it better.If you want to try to understand Alaska, its people, its politics and why I live here, this book is the best place to start. This book is a great writer's greatest book."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"In the mid 1970s, John McPhee turned his powers of description toward Alaska at a time when the &quot;Alaskan way of life&quot; was under siege. Alaska had been a state less than 20 years. The claims of natives to the land had been resolved by putting millions of acres in the hands of native corporations. The old &quot;tradition&quot; of immigrants to the land being able to plop down and build a cabin almost anywhere was disappearing under the burden of new regulations. Huge new national parks were designated, and at the same time the pipeline was being constructed, highlighting the old conflict between development and ecology, between preservation and self-determination.Sadly, the Alaska that McPhee wrote about no longer exists. In the first segment, he writes about the Brooks Range wilderness, and discusses the controversy around establishing the &quot;Gates of the Arctic&quot; National Park there. That park is now established. In the second segment, he writes about the aftereffects of the decision to move the state capital from Juneau to somewhere north of Anchorage. That move never occurred. In the third (and longest and most compelling) segment, he reports on the lives of the people of isolated Eagle, Alaska, a town that today boasts a fax machine.The third segment is where McPhee's writing really shines: I don't think anyone has ever conveyed the personality of Alaska and Alaskans as well as McPhee has. My favorite was the story of how one man and his son managed to get an entire C9 Caterpillar bulldozer into the middle of nowhere, clearing their way through 70-foot winter drifts, to set up a gold dredging operation. McPhee conveys the extreme beauty and wildness of the place, and the fire and determination of the people to belong to it.I was sad but impressed to find McPhee accurately foretelling the Exxon Valdez tragedy by predicting that an oil spill in Prince William Sound was the greatest threat to Alaska's environmental health. However, McPhee's account is remarkably balanced; if you're looking for polemic (either pro or anti-environmentalism, for example), you won't find it.In sum, I give this book five stars for the quality of the writing and the insight, but four for being somewhat dated. If you want to learn more about what Alaska was like, you couldn't do better than this, but if you want to know what it's like NOW, you might prefer to supplement this otherwise wonderful book with something else."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"In the late 1970's my mother and father were inspired by John McPhee's Coming Into the Country to the point of venturing out onto the open highway. I was but two years old, headed across America, from Georgia to Alaska, towards Eagle, the tiny community that McPhee discusses with a keen eye in the third section of his book. I spent my childhood in that community and it would not be until I was fully grown that I would actually read his book. Just a couple of years ago, when I was attending college in Georgia, I became homesick for Alaska and decided to read the book that had been so impressive to my parents. I was amazed by McPhee's way of seeing the truth in something foreign to him -- how he described the people of Eagle. I highly recommend this book to all those who wish to venture into the land of Alaska, whether in their actual travels or in their imagination."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"Again and again we hear it, but it's true: John McPhee can interest a reader in anything. He manages to combine a richly sedimented prose, which frequently rises to a level of virtuosity of which 95% of novelists would be envious, with a tangible involvement in the activities of the people he writes about. And he does always write, first and foremost, about people. 'Coming into the Country' is McPhee's longest single book and contains about ten capsule biographies (and quite a bit of modest autobiography, too) in addition to observations on the hibernation of bears, the various techniques of panning for gold, the advantages of sled-dogs against snow-machines, the failings of bush-pilots, and three-dozen other disquisitions.Without wishing to carp, I do think that the book is a shade too long -- the final section 'Coming into the Country' could profitably have been pruned of about forty pages -- but the greater length does allow the reader to see the effort McPhee goes to to provide his stories with an aesthetically pleasing structure. The first section, 'The Encircled River' deposits us, in medias res, halfway down a tributary of one of Alaska's northenmost rivers. McPhee and his companions travel downriver to the confluence of a larger river, and then we head back to the headwaters of the earlier river -- the story describes an encircling pattern. The second part 'What they were looking for' is a very funny record of a helicopter trip taken by a committee established to decide on a new capital for Alaska. Here the story skips around the theme as the chopper skips around proposed sites for the new metropolis. It's in the final section which gives the book its title that McPhee really lets loose, leaping from the present to the past, from those living on the river to those encamped in the small town of Eagle, back to the Indian village, on to a white mountain trapper and his Indian wife, back to the first goldrush era in the Yukon valley, all the time incorporating off-the-record views of Eagle townspeople, journal entries, his own observations of the breathtaking landscape. It's a tour-de-force. McPhee is the best journalist in the English-speaking world. Alaska is a wonderful place. The meeting of the two is something to behold."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"John McPhee is a writer who seems able to interest readers in anything that captures his attention. The range of subjects that his books cover is striking and his skill at involving readers in subjects that they might heretofore have thought uninteresting is, in my opinion, unique. This book, recounting a journey through Alaska - as a pretext for broader commentary about Alaska and its relationship with the lower 48 - is an excellent introduction to the state we only think we know. I read this during a long stretch of living and working in Alaska and found it to be the most insightful and interesting book on the subject that I had found. As is true with all of McPhee's books, this one satisfys on many levels, from the clarity of the prose to the fascinating subject matter. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"John McPhee is one of my favorite authors - his substantial \\"Annals of a Former World\\" sublime. Thus, it was with no small amount of anticipation that I began his narrated experiences of 1970's Alaska entitled Coming into the Country.Coming into the Country is written in somewhat desultory thirds. The first of which, describing a trip down the Salmon River in the company of state and federal wildlife officials, provides the better reading of the three. The second relates the aborted attempt of the state, flush with speculative oil money, to build a shining new capital in the bush thereby relegating Juneau to the remote backwater that many in the state already considered it to be.McPhee ends his book with a lengthy description of Eagle, Alaska and the residents therein. Alaskans, arguably the last of America's frontiersmen, continue to provide some measure of awe to us of the \\"lower 48\\". To his credit, McPhee uncovers some truly heroic characters, but a fair percentage are merely misanthropes whose appearance in outpost Alaska, though unquestionably providential, presents more an unintended and wearing parody than the serious subject matter McPhee presumably seeks.Still, Coming into the Country provides an intriguing if dated look at an American anomaly. Alaska remains an outpost where most Americans will never set foot. Though our 49th state, it seemingly exists a world apart from the rest of the country. Cruise ships may bring tourists to littoral rest stops, but how can any of us from the outside truly comprehend the scale of such a land? Coming into the Country provides at least a kernel of comprehension but, more importantly, a hunger to hunt for more."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"\\"Coming into the Country\\" is a classic that every visitor to Alaska should read. But the first two sections can be skipped by most people. Section one, \\"The Encircled River\\" is about the Kobruk River, and section two, \\"What they Were Hunting For\\" is a funny tale of the defunct effort to establish a new Alaskan capital city.Section three, titled \\"Coming into the Country\\" describes the people and region of Eagle, population 100 plus a loose scattering of rural homesteaders. The time is the late 1970s when Alaskan lands are being divided up into national parks, native american, state, federal and private lands. McPhee seems to have interviewed about everybody in Eagle to get a cross section of views -- most of them anti-government and libertarian. He probes deep into the Alaska psyche by simply recording what people told him.What of the homesteaders? I admire their individuality and hardiness -- but their bulldozers and airplanes seem incompatible with living simply in the woods. Someone once said that the greatest boon to homesteaders was food stamps; thus their lifestyle is more than a bit artificial and dependent upon there being very few people inhabiting large areas of land. On the other hand, do the \\"posey sniffers\\" (as they call environmentalists) have the right to dictate to Alaskans how they conduct themselves and what they do with their land? Would New Yorkers on Fifth Avenue resent Alaskan advice on the management of Central Park?The struggle between the environmentalists and the Alaskans continues to this day. In the little town of Wrangell last summer, the Greenpeace ship \\"Arctic Sunrise\\" paid a call and was promptly slapped with a summons for violating environmental laws. Greenpeace fled the scene, but was convicted of failing to have an \\"oil spill prevention plan,\\" which seems a serious omission by an outfit that protests oil spills for a vocation.I'd like to see an update of McPhee's book. What's happened to the homesteaders he interviewed? I suspect that most of them have long since abandoned their cabins and returned to civilization, possibly to be replaced by a new group seeking the solace in the wilderness that is the goal of both homesteaders and posey sniffers, each in his own way. This is a good book of objective reporting which both groups can enjoy.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"The only reason this book doesn't rate five stars is because the middle section, \\"What They Were Hunting For\\" (about the search for a new state capital) is a bit dated and can't really measure up to the rest of the book. But the first section, \\"The Encircled River\\" is an amazing piece of prose. This book was written 30 years ago, and when I re-read \\"The Encircled River\\", I feel like I've been given the gift of seeing with my own eyes, what was then one of the last untouched wildernesses in the world. The final section, \\"Coming into the Country\\", is absolutely fascinating, a story of people who have sought out and continue to search for a life that few Americans could even begin to imagine.McPhee is one of the great writers of our time. He can take topics that I might otherwise find dull, and transform them into page-turners. When given the subject of Alaska, he does better than that."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"John McPhee, it's often noted, can write about anythying and make it interesting, so when he tackles a subject as broad and fascinating as Alaska you know you're in for a treat.The book is divided into three parts; it begins in modern Urban Alaska, with the story of its history and contemporary society. From McPhee takes you to the remote villages and towns, a place still populated by Native peoples and rugged outdoorsmen (and women). The last chapter concerns Alaska's last frontier- the remote North Slope, and the men who drill for oil there.Like all McPhee books, the author seems to fade into the background and let the people and the land tell the story for him. Sometimes the reader feels as if or she, and not McPhee, is standing there on an oil rig.Alaska is a rich topic, and McPhee is a wonderful writer. A great combination."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"Having formed my impression of Alaska by reading Jack London stories and Into the Wild, I expected Coming into the Country to describe a harsh, brutish and often deadly land. Instead, it highlighted many of the virtues of Alaska--the diverse people who reside there, the unsettled countryside and sense of freedom. He doesn't avoid the topic of people who froze to death in their shacks or disappeared on flights through the bush, but these are just used as entertaining anecdotes to remind the reader that Alaska is still wild. This is a very well written and entertaining book and it does an excellent job of describing the complex politics and ecology of Alaska as well as the incredible beauty of the state. If you are hoping to travel to Alaska or simply want to learn more about the state and its residents who choose to live in the middle of no where in one of the harshest climates on earth, this is an excellent book. It is good pleasure reading as well, but perhaps not beach reading so much as a good bed time or lunch hour book."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"Want to read about the realities of the 49th state????Want to really learn something about this region???Want to get good visuals????????If NOT don't read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"Detailed account of Alaska moves slowly but beautifully crafted prose makes it a good read.

Great view of Alaska and the frontier it presents even today."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"We are planning a road trip to Alaska this summer and this book has given me insight into the people of Alaska. I only wish that it was more current. There is so much going on now."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"It is well written. I think you will enjoy this interesting account of a wilder Alaska written not too long ago."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"This book is phenomenally moving. It has enchanted me, McPhee's sparse language is incredibly layered and complex. His stories capture the spirits that dominate Alaska and will leave you feeling as if you have been to the Great Land yourself. Wonderfully Crafted."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"This book was difficult for me to rate, since it is really a compilation of three separate books into one volume. The first two books I would give 3/5 stars, while the third book (the one actually entitled \\"Coming Into the Country\\") is superb and deserves 5 stars. Thus, my averaged 4-star rating.I found the first two books very interesting and readable, but they tended to delve off into a more philosophical orientation describing the history of Alaska, which I deemed long-winded at times. The third book, however, kept my attention perked and was just what I was hoping for when I purchased this book -- a look into the life of an Alaskan bushman -- since it was told through stories of people the author meets along the way during his long stint in the bush, which complimented his writing passion.A good book and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"My wife and I like to listen to a tape while we read the book. We are rereading this book that way. It is a classic and a good introduction to Alaska, where we have lived and worked and touristed."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"Great book - as usual for McPhee. The best book on Alaska."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"McPhee lets the reader feel just how huge Alaska is-almost wider than the mind. From geological to political history Coming into the Country shows how it got that way. I picked this up at the airport in Fairbanks, and kept it in my pack to savor after returning to the wilds of Philadelphia. McPhee's sense of adventure and storytelling, his close interaction with the people and the land, make this the Portable Alaska."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"I bought this book as a way to get to know Alaska a little bit before a cruise this summer up the Inside Passage. While it is arguably a little dated - it was written in the 70s - I found the history, background and flavor to be fascinating and valuable. As I was flying over the Susitna River to Mt McKinley, I could see the geological features that made it an unsuitable but still desirable location for a new Alaskan capital.Alaska is, if nothing else, a big place, and this book, by examing three parts of the state, gives you a sense of the land and the people like nothing - except going there - does.John McPhee is a wonderful writer, and I would read - and recommend - anything of his. (Do yourself a favor, though, and stay away from Michener's \\"Alaska.\\" By the time I got from the moving of the landmasses up to the wooly mammoths and saber tooth tigers - still about 10,000 years ago - I was so bored I quit.)"},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"Mcphee's Coming into the Country is one of those rare books which provides the reader with incredible insight as well as being a darn good read. If you want to learn about the people, government, attitudes, and other aspects which are prevalent in Alaska, then I would strongly suggest you read this book. The author really did his research by staying in Alaska for a couple of years, and it really paid off. So, if you're thinking about moving to Alaska, pondering about taking a fishing or hunting expedition up North, or you just would like to know some more about the vast and enigmatic 49th state, then Coming into the Country is the book for you. It is surely one of the most interesting books which I have read. Period!"},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"I just finished what I think is one of the true books of Alaska, John McPhee's Coming into the Country. The non-fiction work breaks apart into three subsections, each dealing with an aspect of Alaska that many people who visit for only a short time don't see. Nor should they necessarily; it is clear through the book's 400 plus pages that McPhee, a man from New Jersey, has not only done his homework but gone to great lengths to find the \\"true Alaska.\\"The first section, entitled The Encircled River, follows a group of five men (McPhee including himself) as they travel down the Salmon River in the Brooks Range in norther Alaska, whose watershed is \\"wholly above the Arctic Circle.\\" The men are surveying the Salmon River for possible inclusion in the list of national wild rivers, which would set aside the river and its immediate environs as unalterable wild terrain. At the time of the writing, 1977, Congress was still considering the legislation.The descriptions of travel down the Salmon merge into a stream of conscious meditation on wildland conservation, the shortage of good fishing in Anchorage, and the native people who live in northwestern Alaska. This section presents the reader with a lay of the land, both physical and emotional, and defines the boundaries of the political, ethical, and moral dilemmas that challenged Alaskans in those pre-pipeline years and that still linger today.The second section, What They Were Hunting For, is a wonderful snapshot of the original movement in Alaska to move the capital from Juneau to a location closer to Anchorage. Juneau is ringed on all sides by mountains and ocean, providing access for state legislators and the public they represent only via oceangoing ferry or a harrowing and often unreliable plane ride. This isolation was seen as a burden to the represented, a boon to their representitives.McPhee accompanies the Capital Site Selection Committee as it tours by helicopter potential sites north of Anchorage, most notably near Talkeetna and Juneau. Among the committee members are such famous Alaskans and Arliss Sturgulewski and Willie Hensley. McPhee seems to have an uncanny ability to place himself at the center of the action.McPhee provides a lengthy history of the naming of Juneau and how the town was founded, suggesting that while its birth and existence may be credited to drunken prospectors' blind luck, this history is as Alaskan as any and justifies naming the town capital.Better still, McPhee provides some very telling descriptions of Anchorage (my home town) in its 70s heyday. As evidenced here:\\"Anchorage is sometimes excused in the name of pioneering. Build now, civilize later. But Anchorage is not a frontier town. It is virtually unrelated to its environment. It has come in on the wind, an American spore. A large cookie cutter brought down on El Paso could lift something like Anchorage into the air. Anchorage is the northern rim of Trenton, the center of Oxnard, the ocean-blind precincts of Dayton Beach. It is condensed, instant Albuquerque.\\"McPee appreciates the boom nature of Anchorage, the drive of its citizens to consume. But McPhee is quick to point out this development is not in a vacuum and gives us context in descriptions of the ring of mountains and ocean \\"stunning against the morning and in the evening light\\" that surround and cradle the town.But all of this is building material, foundation for the final and longest chapter whose name also graces the cover of the book itself, Coming Into the Country. The phrase is Alaska backcountry slang for moving into the bush. McPhee spends the bulk of this chapter himself coming into the country, living all four seasons in Eagle, Alaska, nestled in east-central Alaska along the Yukon River. Here, if any feelings of distrust have developed in the reader's mind from McPhee's disparaging remarks about Anchorage or his awkwardness with wilderness travel, all is forgiven. McPhee's portrait of the people who inhabit Eagle as a place and a time is magical. McPhee describes in the words of one Eagle resident the importance of Alaska as a location on the landscape of the American mind:\\"In the society as a whole, there is an elemental need for a frontier outlet, for a pioneer place to go - important even to those who do not go there. People are entioning outer space as, in this respect, all we have left. All we have left is Alaska, which, on the individual level, and by virtue of its climate, will always screen its own, and will not be overrun.\\"McPhee is fair with the local populace - allowing himself to be taken in by a miner's plea upon destroying the ecosystem around a creekbed that the mine is just a \\"cork in the sea.\\" After rationalizing the destruction in his own head, despite the meager gains of a salt shaker's worth of gold, McPhee declares: \\"In the ecomilitia, bust me to private.\\"MePhee also reconciles his fear of bears that manifested itself in the first chapter. Upon his first taste of ursa horibilis McPhee waxes: \\"In strange communion, I had chewed the flag, consumed the symbol of the total wild, and, from that meal forward, if a bear should ever wish to reciprocate, it would only be what I deserve.\\" In the hands of a less adroit craftsman, this sentiment would risk audience alienation by revealing the author's own still-unrecognized naivetee but McPhee is forgiven and admitted into the fold of his new more wild self.On such topics as the Alaska state flag, McPhee is equally generous and gives hints at the change Alaska has wrought within his own self.\\"The flag, as it happens, was designed by a native. It is lyrically simple, the most beautiful of all American flags. On its dark-blue field, gold stars form the constellation of the Great Bear. Above that is the North Star. Nothing else, as the designer explained, is needed to represent Alaska. It was the flag of the Territory for more than thirty years. Alaskans requested that it become the flag of the new state. The designer was a thirteen-year-old Aleut boy.\\"While McPhee's painting of the Alaskan soul leaves patches untended, and while the pre-pipeline boom attitude is beginning to feel threadbare at the edges, there is something in McPhee's account that touches bedrock. His myriad anecdotes, woven together with thoughtfully placed historical facts and enlightened yet spare commentary are more than the sum of their parts. There is a feeling upon leaving this book that McPhee somehow got it, got why we are here, and more importantly, what our hopes and visions may lead us to."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"We bought this book in Nome, Alaska on a visit there in 2001 (my brother owns a flying service there). I took my time reading it the first time. Coming into the Country is not a book to be read quickly, but, rather, one to be savored, taking time for the details to seep into the crevices of one's memory until they become part of one's knowledge base. Every page holds a vast amount of information that if read too quickly blurs to nothingness and is lost.McPhee's descriptions of the land, its rivers and mountains, its challenges, its beauty, and its people are thorough and draw the reader into the pages of his book. It takes a certain kind of person to survive in the Alaskan bush. I, for one, am drawn to its splendor, its starkness, its fearsomeness, but am sure I don't have the right stuff to live there long term. The river people and others, who thrive in communities like Eagle and Central (even Fairbanks and Juneau), have remarkable stamina and a strong determination to live the lives they choose in their respective settings, all of which are breathtaking in their beauty. McPhee also writes of the tension between the races (Indian and white)and the human dynamic among community members (the good and the no-so-good)that always accompanies the sharing of space and resources.Over the past five years, I've picked up CITC now and then to re-read parts of it. Most recently, I re-read the whole of Part III Coming into the Country. This is my favorite section because it focuses on the bush and its people, most particularly on Eagle, Alaska located on the Yukon River and just across the International Boundary from Canada's Yukon Territory. (Incidentally, the term \\"coming into the country\\" refers to the arrival of a person into the Alaskan bush with the intent of staying. I may move from Michigan to Ohio or New York or California, but, if I go to Alaska, they call it coming into the country. \\"Brad Snow and Lily Allen came into the country in 1973.\\" \\"Joe Vogler came into the country in 1944.\\" \\"John Borg came into the country in 1966\\" (and he's still there. Check out the Eagle site. Borg has worn many hats in Eagle and still sits on the board of the Eagle Historical Society and Museum. Borg's wife, Betty, is the board's treasurer).The original copyright on this book is 1976, thirty years ago. The growth in technology since that time has allowed almost every municipality to have their own website. Eagle is no exception. [...]Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"If you already love McPhee's work or are interested in trying him, Coming into the Country will fulfill any expectations. The completed book leaves one with a profound sense of having been there, as well as having recieved a considerable lecture on back-country living. McPhee's ability to wrap lessons, stories, personalities, cultures, habitats and countrysides into an intriguing package makes this book a must."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"In the summer of '81, Jane told me, &quot;You have to read this book!&quot; and meant to give it to me for a birthday gift. However, before she had a chance, I had bought the book and was 80 pages into it. Two summers later, I found myself walking along a desolate stretch of the Alcan Highway in Canada's Yukon Territory. I was hitchhiking to Alaska, a place I felt destined to visit having read &quot;Coming into the Country&quot;. I never did make it to Eagle (the village described at length by McPhee) but nonetheless remained &quot;in country&quot; until my money ran out five months later. Few books I have read yield such a feel for a place as this one does."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"I've read this book 5 times because it fills a huge hole in my heart that has grown wider due to urbanization. My favorite part is the bush and the characters living there. The feeling you get from these people being grounded to the earth literally is so refreshing yet life is hard and living in Alaska is not like looking at a postcard from there. Anyone needing a sense of spiritual uplift should check out this book."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"McPhee opens his three part book with &quot;The Encircled River,&quot; which doesn't describe a circular river or something simple like that, but rather is a very clever literary trick to illustrate a backpacking trip into the remote Brooks Range. The rest of the book is just as effective. McPhee's portrait of Alaska is highly literate and engrossing"},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"As always the writing draws you into the subject and you can't help but be amazed how his simple words bring a world to life. However, for me this book dwelling on the political climate of a now long gone Alaska is hard to become engrossed in. Where the book describes the nature and geology of Alaska, as usual, McPhee has no peer. Unfortunately (at least for me) that comprises only perhaps one third of the book. The remainder describes the politics and people of Alaska to an extreme detail. Perhaps in 100 years, this book will be seen as a detailed description of a then unknown institution much as Moby Dick's description of the Whale fishery describes that bygone institution today.As always, it's impossible to go wrong reading a book by McPhee, but I would certainly suggest getting through \\"The Control of Nature\\", \\"Basin and Range\\", \\"Oranges\\", and \\"The Curve of Binding Energy\\" first. The first two of this list are my personal favorites by McPhee, but all are among the best non-fiction I have read."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"If one were playing a word association game today, for better or worse, the subject former governor is the person most often linked with our largest state, Alaska. And tis a pity, that. (Just Google the state, and see what tumbles out.)John McPhee is a prolific writer, at times making \\"The New Yorker\\" even a better magazine. In the mid-70's, McPhee, who is urbane, and erudite, turned his attention, and keen sense of observation, to the state dubbed \\"The Last Frontier.\\" Alaska had been purchased from the Russians shortly after the American Civil War, for a bit over $ 7 million. It was called \\"Seward's Folly,\\" after the Secretary of State who authorized one of the ultimate bargains in real estate. It took almost a century for enough people to coalesce, and merit a couple Senators and a Representative to nominally defend their economic interests in far off Washington.It was McPhee who \\"introduced\\" me to the Brooks Range, eponymously named after Alfred H., the Geologist in Chief of the Division of the Alaskan Mineral Resource. Remote, difficult to reach, in the far north of the state, it has now become one of our least visited National Parks. McPhee also introduced me to the grizzly bear, \\"an opportunistic eater,\\" (nothing personal you understand) who needs \\"...for his forage at least fifty and perhaps a hundred square miles that are all his own...\\" McPhee describes a \\"playful\\" grizzly too, who, after emerging from his den, \\"...will climb to the brink of some impossible schuss, sit down on his butt, and shove off. Thirty-two, sixty-four, ninety-six feet per second, he plummets down the mountainside, spray snow flying to either side...just short of catastrophe....he flips to his feet and walks sedately onward as if his ride had not occurred.\\"The second part of the book covers urban Alaska, and he focused on the political effort to move the capital away from Juneau (which is still inaccessible by road from the US) to a more central location. He tags along with the \\"Capital Site Selection Committee\\" and records snippets of conversation, but you have the sense that his heart is not in the machinations. Instead, he seems all too often to be looking out the window, at the compelling scenery: \\"The mountain was a megahedron--its high white facets doming in the air. Long snow banners, extending eastward, were pluming from the ridges about twenty thousand feet.\\"The third and final part of the book, over half of it, lends its title to the entire book. McPhee goes to Eagle, the ultimate in \\"getaways,\\" yet still being in the States. It is nestled on the Yukon River, near the Canadian territory of the same name. And the true fascination of the book is McPhee's insights and depictions of the people who have decided to make Eagle their last refuge. The author (literally) claims the spectrum is larger than we can see: \\"In the spectrum of Eagle society, the fundamentalists are all the way over in the ultraviolet, beyond the threshold of visible light... (the) liberal(s), certainly in some ways lawless, are at the opposite end, deep into the infrared.\\" (A few years after this book was published, Joe McGinnis would publish his own observations on Alaska, entitledGoing to Extremes.) In depicting the citizens of Eagle, the word \\"idiosyncratic\\" would become as worn as a smooth pebble in the Yukon, but McPhee has a wonderful ability to see, and write each person's story afresh. Of the numerous characterizations, I particularly enjoyed the one of the \\"speakeasy,\\" and its denizens, worthy of the folks who inhabited Steinbeck'sCannery Row: (Centennial Edition)andTortilla Flat (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics).A la the Michelin Guide, any book that inspires a journey merits the top rating in stars, and a couple years after I first read the book, I did manage a visit to Alaska, in 1983. Alas, the Brooks Range, as well as Eagle, remained elusive. Perhaps there is still time. In the meantime, 5-stars for McPhee's account, of Alaska as it used to be."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"John McPhee's \\"Coming Into the Country\\" is one of those kinds of books that even though written in the 1970s, has an enduring quality. If this is the only Alaska-themed book you read, you will gain a lot of insight. As someone who was born and raised in Alaska--and still considers himself an Alaskan even after 10 years of living in the Lower 48--McPhee made me feel the pains and pleasures of recognition. As I read \\"Coming Into the Country,\\" I found myself chuckling, nodding, and learning something new.McPhee is a journalist, but he writes like a novelist. His choice of words, composition approaches, and point of view captures the heart of what Alaska is and who Alaskans are. This land and these people have always been \\"this way,\\" and even more than 30 years later continue to be \\"that way.\\"My father-in-law, who lived more than 40 years in Alaska, saw McPhee's book in my living room. He picked it up, browsed through it, and then asked to borrow it after I was through. Needless to say, it is in his possession now and he is reading it this summer while he vacations in, you guessed it, Alaska.Add this book to your library."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"This book is a wonderful relic, the last plausible vision of a living American frontier. In the mid seventies, McPhee went to Alaska to do a few pieces for the New Yorker. He met a lot of trappers, prospectors, and \\"river people\\" who'd built moss-chinked cabins and whose individualism, gruff hospitality, and happiness he admired. McPhee made a plea for democratic access to Alaskan land. He argued that land far from roads should remain fair game for homesteaders in perpetuity.It is odd to read an ode to Alaska's wild immensity at a time when islands are being evacuated in the Aleutians, polar bears are drowning, and the permafrost is melting. The question these days is not whether Americans can still choose to live in more or less untainted outback. The question is whether that outback will soon be transformed beyond recognition, not by oil drilling, but by climate change.What Coming into the Country offers the twenty-first century is escapism and nostalgia. McPhee's account of the political squabbles over the location of Alaska's capital has lost its relevance, but the rest of the book still comes to life. We meet a mix of clannish Christians, proud native people, and prickly bootleggers in the small, dry town of Eagle. McPhee's tale of a man's survival in sub-zero weather after a plane crash constitutes a minor classic of its own.The book reminds us how powerful the frontier fantasy remains in American psyches. Can it be harnessed as a metaphor? Can the dream of self-reliance on a private patch of woods help motivate us, indirectly, to cut carbon emissions? It has motivated us to go camping and conserve some wild lands even while ruining others. Still, I suspect that as the environmental movement shifts in response to global warming, we may have to jettison the frontier fantasy. It depends too much on a view of nature as more powerful than man. Whether or not we agree with Bill McKibben that we have arrived at the end of nature, we know that everything is responding to elevated temperatures. There is no untouched patch of land left in Alaska. The romance of a homestead sours when the flora and fauna are marching north past the log cabin, driven by coal and oil fires from all over the planet."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"I traveled to Alaska in 2006 but lived there in the early 70's. Why I delayed so long in reading \\"Coming into the Country\\" I don't know, but John McPhee has taken me back to that earlier day. Both his character and place descriptions are wonderful and make me long for the cabins, the ice break-up, the dogs, the bush planes, and the 55 gallon drums. The Anchorage of today is much changed, but the bush is still there -- Thank God."},{"Title":"Coming Into the Country","review":"John McPhee is a master at weaving many stories together into a coherent whole. Here he uses these skills to paint a portrait of the varied and often conflicting interests that co-habit today's Alaska. He shifts perspective, examining now the modern-day pioneer who seeks to escape the modern world, and then the representatives of that same world, the government agents and politicians who have their own agenda for America's largest state.

Better Off Dead is a carefully plotted, thrilling mystery populated by colorful characters, and the star, Casey Jones, is my idol.

It's a terrific read. The well-paced action keeps coming and the author writes in a sharp, breezy style. The rich humor had me laughing aloud and only Charles Willeford and Richard S. Prather have done that. There are other titles in the series I'll put in my TBR pile."},{"Title":"Better Off Dead (Casey Jones Mysteries #5)","review":"Casey Jones is a big, rollicking, smartmouth with a wicked sense of humor, and a jaundiced view of the world. Her view of the world applies particularly to personal human relationships. She's a lot like her creator. And she's a lot of fun to hang around. Her adventures are modern, important and well-worth reading about. Unfortunately, too often for this reviewer (and this may be purely personal taste) Casey has to rely on others to get her out of some really bad scrapes.Still, we read these adventures, and look forward to more, because watching Casey choose to take on certain cases, deal with her friends and colleagues, maneuver through thickets of evil and dangerous people, not to mention her often convoluted love life,is just a whole lot of fun.Casey Jones is an under-the-table private investigator. Because of an unfortunate past she's unable to obtain a private investigator's license in North Carolina where she hangs out. And she certainly isn't permitted to carry a weapon. But she has an accommodating partner, Bobby D., for whom Casey seems to do most of the work.This case concerns a professor at Duke University named Helen McInnes who was the victim of a particularly violent crime, including attempted murder. Although she never saw her attacker, she has accused a fellow academic of the crime. Her attacker is acquitted and the combination of the crime and the acquittal have so traumatized the woman, she has developed agoraphobia and cannot even venture onto her own front porch. And now, she's being besieged by evil and vicious mail and telephone attacks, apparently from the same man.Casey, of course, agrees to look into the case and the more she learns, the more inflamed becomes her ire. Into the case come her police contact, Marcus, her boyfriend Burly, her partner Bobby D, and his current girlfriend, Fanny, as well as some new characters. As befits noirish P.I. novels, this one is very plot driven. Nevertheless, Munger does an admirable job of bringing these many characters and their foibles to vibrant life.As one has learned to expect from Munger's writing, the pace is fast, the dialogue sings and the mordant humor is well-placed. This is a very well written novel, has been well and carefully edited and deserves a place on the bookshelves of anyone who is a fan of the hard-boiled P.I. novel."},{"Title":"Better Off Dead (Casey Jones Mysteries #5)","review":"........and hold it until the last page. Casey Jones may seem a little more rawboned then other female heroines, but she has the humor of a Stephanie Plum (albeit a little dryer) and men seem to see through her tough as nails aura and lust after the sexy persona that seeps through her &quot;don't mess with me&quot; attitude.She moves into the home of Helen Pugh, the victim of a horrible rape that has been so traumatized she can't make herself leave the home she has shares with an eccentric mother. Casey vows that the man who ruined Helen's life will not get off scott free for the second time. Thus opens up a chilling flood of incidents that are brought to fore of women that have met with the same horrific crime as Helen, but did not survive the attacks. Casey sets herself up in a gutsy charade in hopes of bringing an end to the monster that has robbed her client of living a normal life. In the process, Casey's sleuthing almost brings an end to her own life.This intense, suspense filled book was impossible to put down and was even more impossible (for me) to guess the outcome. Some mysteries tend to get thin and become anti-climatic near the end. This one was was a 'kicker' until the very last page. Thought I had it figured out. I was wrong. I didn't realize when I bought this book that it was part of a series. Thankfully it didn't harm the plot of the story or give less of a clue into the troop of characters by not reading the first in the series. What a great find this book was!"},{"Title":"Better Off Dead (Casey Jones Mysteries #5)","review":"I have read and loved all of the Casey Jones series by Katy Munger. They just get better all the time. If you have not read these books, start at the beginning and read them in order. Casey is a wonderful character, truly original and the books are hard to put down. Wonderful, lighthearted and funny!!"},{"Title":"Better Off Dead (Casey Jones Mysteries #5)","review":"This is the first book by this author that I've read. I wish now I would have started from the beginning so that I would had the background of the characters. I did enjoy how her main character solved the mystery with humor and guts. This book did remind me of the Stephanie Plum series. It's a very quick read and easy to get into. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Better Off Dead (Casey Jones Mysteries #5)","review":"I read the first one for free (and was surprised at how '90's they felt already, no cell phones at the ready til the end book....) and really liked the heroine. Be prepared to buy all the books though, and although they are \\"light\\" reads they are long ones, otherwise you'll be stuck wondering what happens at the end of each. I think when these were written, Casey was probably the first...and one of a kind! Nowadays, not so much, but kuddos to the author for her characterization of a self determined, headstrong woman."},{"Title":"Better Off Dead (Casey Jones Mysteries #5)","review":"Casey just keeps getting better and better.

The book is about a woman detective thatgets jobs no one else really will take.

She's smarter, funnier, sexier, more human, and just plain better-written. I've recommended Casey to all my mystery-reading friends, and they've all become converts to the cause. Ms. Munger, please -- where's the next Casey??"},{"Title":"Better Off Dead (Casey Jones Mysteries #5)","review":"Smart, randy, funny and big-hearted, Casey Jones is my favorite P.I.

Casey is fun to read, but makes you think."},{"Title":"Better Off Dead (Casey Jones Mysteries #5)","review":"I HAVE READ ALL OF THE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES AND LOVE EACH ONE THANK FOR GREAT STORY PEOPLE AND MOST OF ALL CASEY JONES."},{"Title":"Better Off Dead (Casey Jones Mysteries #5)","review":"I liked this one even better than Bad to the Bone.

In this one, you want to join the fight in finding the person, who hurt Helen.

It is available to order for [...]. Having accessed the website to look at what was available I found NO sample business plan specifically for restaurants under the restaurant side of the site. I had to click on his other book title in order to find a generic business plan, and I do mean GENERIC plan, that is there, and is once again, only a 10 day shareware product. \\"If you use BUSINESS PLAN MASTER to help develop your business plan and don't pay for it, you are already starting your business out on a bad note.\\" you will need to pay up another $44.00. The employee scheduling tool (also a 'pay me more' shareware) is so lame I laughed at it. I could build a better scheduling tool in Excel, and you should be able too also if you are considering starting a business, which would then give you the power to share with accountants and import/export data. The suppliers list is nothing special you could not find by a few simple web searches. Over all I am very disappointed in this purchase and am considering sending it back. There is nothing useful in this book you can not find for free on the Small Business Association website, or other helpful sites. if you cant find it free on the internet by doing a little searching you rally ought to consider waiting tables for a bit before owning and running your own restaurant."},{"Title":"The Restaurant Business Start-up Guide (Real-World Business)","review":"This is the best ... bucks I ever spent!I bought this book.

I found the tandem Web site to be very helpful (Note: you can purchase a CD of the Web site contents if for some reason you don't want to access the Web site online; however, I found going online easy enough). For example, you can find there the Excel business plan financial template that goes with the sample business plan in Chapter 4 of the book. It comes with a 3-year Proforma forecast, which includes: sales forecast, profit and loss statements, cash flow, and balance sheets. All with assumptions footnoted. Very nice. The Web site also includes three complete eBooks: 1) How to Get aTrademark 2) How to Get a Patent 3) Government Loan Resource Guide. There is also software for developing government required safety programs for:1) Fire Egress 2) Employee Illness and Injury Prevention 3)Workplace Hazard Awareness. What time savers. As a bonus the Website includes shareware programs that can be used to help run a restaurant. One that I really liked is, \\"Scheduling Employees for Windows\\". I've always been a fan of shareware.

Several of the sections were written for general businesses--not specific to restaurants. I got the impression that it was put together quickly using sections from other books. I should add that I gave up pretty quickly on this book and so did not read more than one-tenth of it."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"That's a harsh word, but I think I can prove it. In what I've read of this book, this is what I think is the best example of his unabashed idiocy: He states that (and I double checked what he wrote several times, just to be sure he had actually said this), in the Electoral College, Bush received a substantial victory, earning 274 electoral votes to Kerry's 258.Bush earned 286 electoral votes, and Kerry received 251 (one faithless elector voted for Edwards). His research is so mind-blowingly shoddy that the he doesn't even get very basic information that strengthens his position right.Here's another gem: he talks about going to see Fahrenheit 9/11. The film is over two hours long, and here are his gripes about it:1) The opening footage of Wolfowitz licking his comb is a cheap shot2) Moore was taking another cheap shot at Bush for reading My Pet Goat when 9/11 happened. He seems to believe that Moore thinks Bush should have run from the room screaming. Apparently, the prospect that Moore thinks Bush should have merely calmly excused himself is too much for Gallagher's pea-sized intellect.3) Gallagher believes Moore portrayed the soldiers in a negative light. If anybody rememebers the way the film ended, you know that's a bunch of hogwash.And, frankly, that's it. That's all Gallagher has to say about why Fahrenheit 9/11 is a bad movie: Moore took two cheap shots (he didn't) and didn't portray the soldiers too well (again, not true). And yet, he feels justified in calling Moore a \\"traitor\\" a couple paragraphs later. Does this make sense to anyone.Other things include:-His shameless hypocricy in blasting Michael Moore for calling McCain a loser, because McCain is a war vet and thus deserves more respect, but yet he has no gripes with the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, nor does he have a problem with the way McCain's own presidential campaign went down.-His encounter with John Zogby, in which he blasts Zogby for three pages about how Zogby went on the Daily Show and predicted Kerry would win without offering any proof at all that this changed how anyone voted or prevented people from going to the polls.-His claim that conservatives are more patriotic than liberals because a liberal woman he talked with was unwilling to unequivically state that she was proud to be an American, even though she said she loved America and would die for its ideals (which Gallagher never says, by the way).-His defense for the Iraq war is that our reasons for being there are so obvious, they don't need to be discussed (even my most lenient teachers would give me an \\"F\\" if I wrote something like that, yet it gets him a published book)So, in conclusion, Gallagher is an idiotic nut."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"As you can tell by the ramblings below, most of these \\"Idiots\\" have never read the book. In fact, it makes one wonder if they've ever bothered to read a book, especially an American history book.Mike Gallagher's book is meant to be entertaining and to make you think. It does both. He shines the light on liberal \\"Idiots\\" that are destroying our Republic (no, we're not a democracy) while injecting humor at the same time.Even if you don't like strictly political books, you will enjoy this one as long as you have a good sense of humor."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"Mike Gallagher hallucinates that America is just running amuck with leftists determined to make this into a communist state. He sees leftists around every bend, which is odd since there are only about 3 of them in the entire nation. However, in America, as in all nations, there are a fair number of people born gay, and Gallagher feels quite strongly that they should not be accorded the most basic civil rights. He never explains why not; he just seems to think it's enough to say that he's opposed to it.And he has the nerve to say HE is the one surrounded by idiots!Of course, he devotes great energy to saying that he's not prejudiced in spite of his prejudice, much like the slave owner who used to brag about how well she treated her slaves: \\"Why, OF COURSE they don't REALLY want EQUAL rights...\\"And Gallagher has the nerve to say that HE is the one surrounded by idiots!Gallagher quotes the lovely and homophobic Senator Rick Santorum at great length, suggesting that legal recognition of gay marriages will surely lead us licketty split to legalizing marriages between Uncle Pete and his hound dog Spot, as well as to bigamy, incest, adultery, and polygamy. It's all nonsense, of course, yet he loves using this as evidence that withholding equal rights from his fellow citizens is somehow bizarrely justified. Gallagher clearly has no clue of what he is talking about, and doesn't bother to search for any facts.Gallagher calls his own marriage the \\"single best gift God has ever given to me,\\" yet manages to think it's fine that he withhold that gift from gay citizens. Utter hypocrisy.Buy this book if Ann Coulter, coloring books, or other fact-free books turn you on."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"It's nice to find someone with the same value's as myself. Being surrounded by liberals, in these beautiful mountains that god created, it's nice to know, I'm not alone. Mike touches on real life issue's that should concern all of us. He gives both political and personal insite to what he believes. If you've read Sean Hannity or Bill O'Rielly's books, this is a must read. I've purchased books for some of my friends to show them that we're not the enemy. This is a light hearted easy read that all should read, regardless of what side of the aisle you sit on."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"The book arrived very late- about 3 weeks after I placed my order. The front cover was torn and there were some holes punched in it. Luckily the pages were clean crisp."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"I read this book. It did not take long. What is the problem with this book - it does not say anything! There is no point to it. Sure, it is entertaining sometimes, but there is no goal to this book. What was the author trying to achieve? He gives ramblings about why he hates certain people - much like the new book by Bernie Goldberg (which is pure trash) - but does not really say how to fix the problems he says these mostly celebrities create.We need to stop with all these right wing authors writing books with no point other than to slam the opposite party."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"As I write this, Mr. Gallagher is in Texas, playing dress-up with military costumes and launching verbal assaults against the grieving mother of a fallen soldier -- despite the fact that neither he nor his four military-eligible children have ever served.If this is your idea of patriotism, you're welcome to it, but make no mistake: as loony as the left can be, chickenhawk extremists like Mike Gallagher are not a rational alternative."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"More mindless drivel from one of the weaker bulbs on the right. Just spewing your 'gut feel' of how things ought to be is not political discourse.If you like name calling instead of reasoned arguments, this may be the book for you.A side note, as least as of now, it looks as if Mike's blatant plea for his \\"Army\\" to flood this site with positive reviews has mostly failed."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"Poor Mike Gallagher! I mean just look at the photo for his latest release \\" Surrounded by Idiots \\" Here he is all dressed up in his best suit, he's gone to the enormous trouble of losing 70 pounds, has quite possibly the silliest grin on his face ( perhaps its just gas ) yet no one is purchasing, much less reviewing, his new offering. A sad case of 'all dressed up and no place to go.' But whats a Conservative talk show host/neglected author to do? Well, for poor Mike the competition for that Conservative dollar is extremely difficult these days what with books being released what seems like every week from holier-then-thou Neocons. I mean, in the just the last two weeks we've seen \\" The Truth About Hillary \\" Ed Kleins remarkable hatchet-job released and Bernie Goldbergs \\" 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America \\" come slithering out of some dark forboding Conservative hole. Yes, its truly difficult getting noticed in an era where books such as these are descending upon us in such a rapid pace. Apparently even Conservatives/Republicans only have so much discrecinary spending on tabloid styled novellas such as this. I didn't think it possible but my poor bleeding Liberal heart feels a certain pang of sympathy for our forgotten, yearning author/radio host.But Mike all is certainly not lost. Lets go over one or two key ingrediants found in releasing a popular Neocon work of non-fiction and what is required. First big guy, you have to get a flag on the cover of your book. This is very important as Conservatives love symbolism. You know, the flag, Statue of Liberty ( Sean used that one onhis latest offering and see how well he did! ) or even perhaps the vast American heartland. Some guy names Beck just used that so perhaps we ought to wait. Anyway, you get the idea. Big pictures of America the Beautiful get those manly Neocons all 'warm and fuzzy'. Um, but in a 'real American' he-man sort of way of course. Not any of that 'gay stuff' thank-you very much! The other thing is try to get photos of despised Americans ( ie. Democrats of course! ) on the cover. Get a picture of Bill or Hillary, any one will do, as Neocons really hate those dastardly Clintons so you can't go wrong! Oh and remember try to be as judgemental and vicious as you can be. Readers love it when you tear into one of those Democrats/Liberal media types and accuse them of everything thats wrong with this country since the Second World War. Whew! Boy Mike I certainly hoped all this has helped. I mean if you want your Conservative fan base to open up those thick wallets then you need to start honing your skills as a real muckracker!Oh, as to the book. I really shouldn't bother if I was you. Clocking in at a rather slim 220 pages, and double-spaced to boot, Mike has precious little to add to the already screaming banshees that make up the Conservative mantra. If you've caught any portion of 'Fox & Friends' then you know where we're heading. Lets see if i can be succint about this...1) Bill Clinton...Satan!2) Hillary Clinton...see above remark3) Michael Moore...Godless Communist4) Al Franken...Neocons really hate this guy5) Dixie Chicks...ungrateful musicians/females ( an ' oldie but goodie ' )6) Liberals...hate Mom and probably apple pie as well7) Liberal media...why do those darned New Yorkers hate decent, God-fearing Americans?Well, dear reader. No doubt you get the idea. Its pretty much the same laundry list that we've seen dozens of times before from Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and the rest of the \\" We Love America and They Don't \\" Conservative playbook. Ok Mike, so this is your first Amazon review for your new release. I understand you might be getting lost in the recent stampede of Conservative diatribes so I'm doing my part to keep the dream alive! See...who loves you baby? P.S. Call Michael Savage's agent."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"I liked the fact that he was not exposing only liberals, but also conservatives, moderates and those who don't know where they fit in the scope of political occupancy."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"First I'll give you the good points to this book and there are many. It is well written and informative for what it is and if you suscribe to Gallagher's way of thinking you will probably give it 5 stars.I couldn't quite give it the 5 stars because though I enjoyed the writing, I do not subscribe to Mr. Gallagher's way of thinking which is everyone who isn't conservative must be an idiot. People that he cites as idiots do not represent the general population any more than Al Sharpton speaks for all African Americans. I know very few people in real life that subscribe to the way of thinking that the conservative talk show hosts attribute to the \\"liberals\\" of this country or anyone who thinks that going into Iraq was a huge mistake.That being said, if you put aside any criticism of Gallagher's bias, you can really enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"On his daily talk show, Mike Gallagher says that he \\"has no secrets.\\" Yet the BIGGEST secret of all - the one he wants nobody to find out about - wasn't even mentioned in Surrounded by Idiots.

He touches on what's important to him such as family and friends. He stands up for what he believes in, regardless of public option. Taking on the Dixie Chicks and what he has done with Gallagher's Army shows what a true american is all about. This book lets you get to know Mike without actually knowing him. He lets you know that he stands for what right, not what's politically correct. I'm glad to have read this book and anxious for his second. KEEP FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT"},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"After reading several books by celebrities and \\"so called experts\\", it was a refreshing delight to read a book by someone who actually sounds human. Even though some might disagree with Mr. Gallagher's politics, no one can take exception to his love of his family, country and friends. How great it is to read a book by someone who actually appreciates the gifts he has been given and does not sound like someone who expects to be handed laurels simply because of who he is. The book is very conversational and gives an insight into the radio and television personality that is endearing. Recommended highly!"},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"I've listened to Mike's show for a few years now and have been waiting for his book to be released....I'm not dissapointed. Mike - through his usual good humor and fairness - tackles the questions all families face. I love his way of sharing the ups and downs we all experience, yet not all of us can do it such an eloquent way. For the good of our nation's future -we need everyone reading this book!!"},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"Finally....a big time radio personality who doesn't take themselves too seriously. I appreciate Mike's way of taking serious topics and presenting them in such a way that all of us can understand and have a good laugh. Mike's realistic look at today's tough issues and acknowledging that both sides - republicans and democrats - can work together is refreshing. I say we need more books like this and plan to recommend to all my family, friends and co-workers."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"Mike is at his best in this book. It is entertaining, informative and not divisive at all. I would recommend this to all of my friends both liberal and conservative. Any American who loves his or her country and believes that we all must work together to bring about harmony should read this book over and over again."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"I find it amazing that people are now using the book review section of Amazon to post their political opinions. Even if they haven't read the book. \\"I skimmed this book in a bookstore just today.\\" All this reviewer did was skim the book and now they can form an honest opinion? Wow, I need this person to help me save time with term papers. No need to read all of the research material, I can just \\"skim it.\\"And this quote from a \\"reviewer\\", \\"I have not seen ONE book by a liberal or Democrat that shows the sheer vitriol and hatred that many of the conservative books do.\\" Obviously this reader has never heard of Al Franken, Clint Willis, or Molly Ivins.But I digress. This was a good first attempt at a book. A lot of what I read I was familiar with because I listen to the show. Some things were new and interesting. There were even times when I felt Mike was just expressing his views and telling us a few stories in a casual conversational tone. Not unlike some conservative authors who leave me angry when I read their books.Mike, get a little more in depth next time. I look forward to the next book. God Bless America."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"Mike Gallagher certainly tells it exactly like it is in his book. His down to earth book tells, in a truthful and honest way, just how the liberal lunatics have helped to put America in the 'Alice in Wonderland' world of today and how they are still at it. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"Mike Gallagher was never in the military, and neither are any of his 4 sons (all coming of age in the years of the war on \\"terrah\\"). I wonder why?Does this book answer that question? Does it discuss on what merits he feels entitled to refer to himself as \\"the general\\"?If Mike Gallagher feels that he is \\"surrounded by idiots,\\" then perhaps he should relocate to Iraq (in whatever capacity that he can serve), to fight for the cause that he is the so-called champion of."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"This is the story of how a guy has worked his tail off and has come to be a talk show star.He says Al Sharpton is very nice and funny - off camera. He has kind words to say about so many liberals. Anyone who read the exchange he had with Robert KKK Byrd knows what an incredible gentleman this man is.I was in Greenville, SC when his career began. It is nice to see where he is now. He presents one of the best an most balanced views of conservatism found.PS Two things to those above who mentioned him hating gays. One. You didn't read the book. Two. You might inspire him for a sequel."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"As the author states at beginning, \\"The Left is trying to destroy the pillars of our great country. Their targets: every value and standard, principle and idea, concept of God, family, honor, duty, country, and decency we hold dear\\". Its very clear: Mike Gallagher gets it. The greatest threat to our country? Al Queda? Iran? North Korea? Hardly! The greatest threat to our country are everyday homegrown Americans.We've all seen them. They may look and talk like real Americans, but make no mistake. They're not. They're liberals. The threat posed by Osama Bin Laden is small potatoes compared to the potential threat posed by a trio of country singers with big mouths. And what's the deal with that mother of a slain soldier? She's got a lot of nerve, interrupting the President's month long vacation. Her son made a noble sacrifice, so she should just shut up and bake cookies or something.I'm quite disturbed that Mike himself is married to one of these idiots. As he states in chapter one, his wife Denise is a Democrat! Can you imagine? What was he thinking? I shudder to think of the sick, perverted things she makes him do behind closed doors. She's probably cheating on him, too. As everyone knows, liberal idiots have no moral standards whatsoever (see Chapter 1). He claims that they're soulmates, but he must be lying. How could he possibly be soulmates with an idiot liberal scumbag??? Maybe he just likes slumming. He should divorce her immediately. He'll probably have to when they ship her off to the planned internment camps, anyway. Best to go ahead and do it now.Sadly, I must deduct one star from this magnum opus of pure genius because Mike Gallagher offers no real permanent solution to this problem. Sure, while its always a good thing for those in power to claim that they're being persecuted by those with no power (it worked out great in Germany), it simply is not enough in a post 911 world. THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH US SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK. We're at war, and we must take any necessary means to achieve total victory. You see, the enemy hates us for our freedoms. So if we empower our leaders to take our freedoms away, the enemy will no longer have a reason to hate us. Who can argue with that logic?"},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"Another right wing radio show host writes a book. Also another book by someone who has done nothing but flap his lips for a living. Must be something about being soft that allows the mind to go stale and become arrogant. Saw a picture of this man a few years back. He looked like he put butter on his cheese. He's trimmed down, and his sagging skinned body has produced a book.I'd advise people not to buy this book new, because it will soon be a major remainder, available in flea markets and shelved in the Salvation Army. You night get luck and buy it for a dime. Right wing listeners buy them because they feel motivated to do so. They don't read much, so they throw these books out because the covers are too far apart. That's why they lie languishing and unread a few months later in the charity bins.Poor thinking seems to be a criteria of right wing radio: US versus the liberal. Our side. Kooky liberal ideas. \\"Left wing consiparacy by the liberal media.,\\" is a common phrase. All that is wrong with the USA today is because of liberals, Mr G. declares. The one sign of a crank is absolute belief he has the answer, filled in with persistant neologisms and catch phrases.Let's see: in one chapter Mr. G. says he was in a restruant having dinner with his wife and a loud noisy kid interupted his enjoyment. Somewhere in his thought porcesses, Mr. G. envisions that this kid will grow up to be a whiney liberal.Eh? How's that jump in logic justified?AH Yes, Mr G. professes to Christian ideals. He had a section on his web site for \\"Pin head of the week.\\" Great Christian ideal. Name calling.A few days after the release of this pile of doodles, Mr G. got annoyed with the idea of silent prayer and protest for the remberance of the 60th anniversery of Hiroshima. Wasn't the dropping of the bomb supposed to have been good, preventing Americans from dying needlessly?Uhm, I think Mr G. forgot to read the stories in the papers further: what happened can not be eradicated from history. The protest was staged for the bomb not to be used ever again for the purposes of war. Poor thinking.As said, you can pick this book up in a few months in a Goodwill store. It'll be next to those unread copies of Rush Limbaugh's books.Remember liberals: they gave women the right to vote, freed the slaves, pressed for equal rights, fed thehungrey helped the homeless, helped reverse the great depression,... all true, solid, kooky ideas."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"Mike Gallagher is a proud conservative and he is not ashamed to say it. This book is a collection of personal stories about Mike's encounters with various Liberals. It is easy reading and entertaining. His down to earth logic and common sense comes through page after page. He is one of the few celebrities that is not shy from bringing his family and personal lives into the discussion. It is frank and refreshing. I'm glad he is one example where a staunch Conservative can get along with his Liberal spouse. Why can't the politicians in Washington learn a lesson? We can disagree on issues but still get along.

It's just another opinionated gas-bag blathering about how \\"liberals\\" are screwing up the United States.Too bad these right-wing shills are a dime a dozen, and it amazes me that people actually buy this crap. I've borrowed several books by pundits like Anne Coulter, Michael Savage, et al...and they're all packed with nonsensical, uppity, half-baked rhetoric that blames Democrats for everything. If it were up to them, I'm sure that Democrats would be blamed for the AIDS virus. If this is the best that the right has to offer, I'm definitely aiming for the left end of the spectrum the next time around.This is nothing more than glorified politics-porn for feeble-minded people who don't have the gumption to be as sharp-tongued as their beloved neo-conservative mouthpieces.

The Author is pathetic."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"Mike Gallagher is one of the lesser known of the national conservative talk radio hosts. He clearly plays a second fiddle to the likes of Rush, Sean, Gordon, and Laura. I picked up this book to learn more about him. His story is compelling but his analysis and reporting is in line with the second tier hosts. Gallagher lost both his parents at an early age but found his true calling at an even earlier age when he walked into a local radio station as a high schooler and was hired to fill in that night for a sick host. Mike paid his radio dues, travelling the country to pursue jobs at larger stations, holding unique events like an all-night Al Sharpton vigil, and falling in love with a woman who already had four kids. This book was written before Mike's bride was diagnosed with cancer and lost a short battle. The love between the Gallaghers is wrapped in every word Mike has for his better half, who ironically was his political opposite, a New Deal lefty.Like his hero Hannity who wrote a short and difficult to follow foreword to this book, Mike is a self made man and a true believer that the only role of government is to remove obstacles from the path of the entrepreneur. Gallagher has done a lot of good work raising money for wounded warriors, disabled veterans, and probably most importantly, their sometimes forgotten families. Like his predecessor Pat Robertson, Gallagher has an opinion on nearly every subject. In this book he even tells us how to lose weight based on his own experience. I did not get the insightful political commentary I was expecting here, most likely you are better off checking in with O'Reilley and Morris for that. The book is well written (now a bit dated) by an extraordinary man but it is not in the realm of Conscience of a Conservative."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"As a conservative it never ceases to amaze me that nationally syndicated talk show hosts feel compelled to write books. Obviously it is a testament to their inability to get their point across within fifteen broadcast hours each week. Gallagher's opus is no exception. From Sean Hannity's sycophantic forward with its grammatical faux pas to the closing self-deprecating remarks in the final chapter it is a mediocre read at best and fails to offer any convincible solutions toward \\"fighting liberal lunacy in America\\".This book is much like his show: considerable drivel about how things should be in his opinion and how those who don't share his philosophy are \`idiots'. According to Wilkipedia.org an idiot is defined as \\"... a person with a very severe mental retardation or a very low IQ level...\\" Mike's opponents on the Left are not idiots. Idiots, by the above definition, would be incapable of holding public office or maintaining successful careers in entertainment or academia.. The root cause of their lunacy is driven more by ingratitude to this great nation more than anything. Gallagher fails to grasp this simple fact.He writes: \\"The thrust of the book that you now hold in your hands is political\\". Gallagher himself has incorrectly assessed his own writing. It is anything but political. Bashing politicians, entertainers, and academicians who are left of center does not provide for interesting reading, is tantamount to childish name-calling, and is hardly a persuasive political strategy. Rather than harp upon the ills of society, comparing them with the \\"back when I was a kid\\" mantra, Gallagher would have been better served to focus on the political issues that have aided in the political and cultural decline in which we as a nation find ourselves. Sadly, Gallagher is incapable of such critical thinking. If he is, he has certainly squandered a golden opportunity to get to the core of the issues that his limited time on air prohibits. And should we be surprised? His book follows a format similar to his radio show. He touches on certain pet peeves, titillates the reader with a few anecdotes to invoke emotions, and then moves on. There's no expanding on an issue to provide a historical context as to why certain shortcomings ever came about and offers no solutions to the same.Ridiculing people because of their physical appearance is rhetoric echoing across high school campuses from coast to coast. Gallagher's profession demands a higher acumen of the English vernacular as opposed to calling overweight people \\"fatties\\". His reference as such lacks empathy and condescending comments like this are better left unwritten. Accept it, Gallagher. Some people are not as motivated toward personal weight control as you are. Kudos to you for your accomplishment. Don't use it as a soapbox to disparage others.Surrounded by Idiots is no more a political read than Mother Goose. It is a biographical retrospective written by a Rush Limbaugh wanna-be, who is one of the worst talk show hosts in the business and who has managed to convince enough of the right people that his opinions are worth syndication on national radio, but have little or no potential of making significant cultural or political change."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"Mike Gallagher is a liar. I was on hold for a topic and I was told that they already had enough callers with my opposing point of view. Three minutes later Gallagher says nobody called in to oppose him on the topic!! This liar believes he can get away with that stuff, and he often does. There are postings on the internet of Gallagher also committing blatant lies. Gallagher is a man who believes he is more intellectual then he actually is though. There are 12 year olds who are deeper thinkers then Gallagher.

He, Hugh Hewitt and Michael Medved were also coming to Chicago for a discussion of Obama's first 100 days in office. Since Gallagher was new to me, I'd hoped to learn something deeper than his radio show persona.While I thoroughly enjoy Gallagher's program, the book left me wanting. It reads like a transcript of his show. So much so, I could almost hear him reciting it. There was no real insight into the basis for his conservatism, no deep revelations from his life. More or less an extension of his show. I wanted every day Mike. I already know--and like--radio Mike.Mike wrote this before his wife contracted, and succumbed to cancer, making some of the anecdotal information unwittingly bittersweet. Otherwise, the book is rather dull, lacking inspiration or substative insight. Perhaps this is why there hasn't been another book.The upside: Mike Gallagher is a dedicated patriot with a heart for America as big as the continent. Skip the book and tune in your radio. You won't be disappointed there."},{"Title":"Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America","review":"After trying to read this new book by talk show host Mike Gallagher ( I finally did finish it) 2 thing became very obvious, someone who dispises liberals as much as Gallagher must be surrounded by like minded conservatives and spending his life surrounded by idiots is begining to have a sad effect on Mr. Gallagher, this book reads as if it were written by an idiot.I must admit I was pretty sure this book would run the same lines as those written by Mike's commrades, Hannity, Savage, Coulter. Hillary Bad, USA/GOP good. Social programs Bad, USA/GOP good. Liberals Bad, USA/GOP good. Surprise I was right!The bottom line is if you apply a talk show host approach to solving todays complex problems you would have a cure for cancer tomorrow, it's just not that simple.

Novak just walked off the set after uttering the second 'no-no' word. Well, Mike Gallagher has some fun. Kudos to him.It's a funny life. He doesn't express himself as a seer out to save America from itself. Yeah. He makes no bones about targeting liberals. I mean Bernie Goldberg targets \\"people who screw up America.\\" At least it's a little covert. But like Coulter, Gallagher puts on his gloves and makes no bones about who is in the ring with him.I do enjoy his humor. I am uncomfortable with parts of the liberal view. Apparently, a majority seem to be also. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean I want to arm my children and live in the basement and use my GranDad's WWII short wave radio.Gallagher has fun.

We Methodists are a cut above the Baptists but below the Presbyterians, and absolutely would not call anyone an idiot unless he really was one. Talk radio has no religion, mostly it attacks people and organizations without giving the other side a chance to fight back.He says that true idiots transcend political boundaries. For some of us, there are no boundaries, only corrupt politicians to offset those who make a point of using politeness as a ruse. Concern for others is lacking everywhere these days. Old people are considered as worth nothing and should not have an opinion. He's certainly opionated, and far from being as perfect as he'd like to be.The so called cultural revolution hasn't even gotten off the ground, what is he talking about? Some Republicans are as much idiots as the Democrats he is blasting in this book. When you loose faith in a Republican Mayor for telling bare-face lies, you don't go around calling him an idiot. He already knows he is one to be guided by this kind of logic.He has two homes, New York City and Dallas. That's big cotton! He make a bundle on that radio calling people 'idiots.'

This is a better way to learn about a foreign land and its people than, say, reading a guidebook.But for the lack of any action, Rosamunde Pilcher's writing is highly literate and very reader-friendly. She has a very detailed way of describing the scenery and atmosphere which strangely does not bore.If you enjoy modern English authors like Ian McEwan (Atonement) and like a British-sort of banter without suspense, peril, or action, then you'd like this.Although there was nothing much going on plot-wise, and none of the characters were ever in any jeopardy or peril....I still loved Pilcher's intimate descriptions of the daily minutae of Scottish life.This is my first Rosamunde Pilcher.

Pandora, who hasn't been home for years is coming to town with a very sad secret. Alexa has fallen in love with Noel, of whom Violet isn't sure she really trusts, and Henry, who has been sent to boarding school against his will and his mother's as well, runs away and comes back home.Another character, Lottie, has &quot;some loose screws,&quot; and was committed to a mental hospital. She is sent home after supposedly becoming stable however, and creates a problem for everyone.The book is all about love, betrayals, forgiveness and coming together.

It's basically nauseatingly romantic pap. It's not even amusing in the way that Harlequin romances or real bodice-rippers are. It's just dull. Most people would probably be able to intuit all this just from the cover design, but I thought I'd issue out a warning for those who sometimes like to \\"slum it\\" with a brainless novel in the W.C. - this book does not even measure up to W.C. level - unless you've run out of T.P."},{"Title":"September","review":"I had read this several years ago, but picked it up again as had just reread &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; and wanted to read about Noel Keeling and how he matured in this book again.

You were intended to sympathize with Penelope, her parents, and Olivia and be critical of Nancy, Noel, and Ambrose. And heaven help the reader who disagreed.Given that I saw much to sympathize with in Nancy's life and much to criticize in Olivia's and Penelope's, I found it irritating to be constantly reminded that my views of these characters were \\"wrong.\\"September gives the reader more freedom. Most of the characters are mostly portrayed in a positive way, although many have flaws, and some do things that may be regrettable. Here, Pilcher allows you to reach your own conclusions much more than in The Shell Seekers. You can decide to sympathize with Virginia, Edmund, Pandora, and others who make questionable choices or you can view their decisions negatively, and the story still works. Even Noel has become three-dimensional here -- a huge change from the caricature he was in The Shell Seekers.Although September lacked any characters who could be described as \\"middle class\\" and lacked historical interest because it was set in the time when it was written, I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"September","review":"September is the major work by Rosamunde Pilcher than I connect with least. The story spans a brief period of months leading up to the September season in Scotland, and the \\"at home\\" dance the Steyntons are having for their daughter Katy's twenty-first. Just these brief details show that although the setting is Scotland, the whole narrative is deeply steeped in English culture. The setting is the present day (or was when written), but September is filled with living anachronisms like the shooting season, boarding school for eight year olds, and \\"at home\\".Invitations to the shindig provoke all kinds of feelings in the guests. For the far-flung, it's an opportunity to return to Scotland at a festive time of year. The old reflect on past parties when they were desirable, where they now \\"look great for their age\\". The young think about coupling up with the one they're with or with one they haven't met yet.Little hints turn into cryptic discussions of Something that happened in the past, Something that drove the Steyntons and Balmerinos apart - Something involving the prodigal sister Pandora. There are all kinds of sub-plots involving romance between multiple couples, marital challenges, and so on.September is a very engaging story, but I could not connect with any of the women in the story or relate to the issues facing any of the men. Despite all the loving detail of the families and community, it's a miss for me. I can see how this could be some people's favorite book as it whisks you into a world of contemporary privilege that's very grounded in real life. For me it was too... dare I say it, elitist. Had it been set in the past I would have enjoyed it more. At least it met the literary challenge of teaching me something about myself, however unintended."},{"Title":"September","review":"I just adore &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; which I consider Ms Pilcher's finest book and indeed one of my all time favourites. So I picked up this book with a great deal of anticipation.I am pleased to say that this book is more than a worthy successor - if indeed successor is the right word. Of course there is the carry over of some characters, but it is more of a sideways step than a straight out continuation. It can genuinely hold its own if read without knowing &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot;.It is a fine novel, well written and with an interesting and constantly moving plot. I recommend it for a lazy weekend and a comfortable sofa!"},{"Title":"September","review":"Wonderfully written book. You don't see many written like this anymore. Be sure to read books in order.

What lovely books! The descriptive prose and the development of the characters left me feeling gently satisfied at the end and very pleased to have been a part of the stories. I don't know about the rest of Ms. Pilcher's books, but I do intend to find out. These are the kind of books one wants to curl up with under a tree or in front of a cheery fireplace and escape from the world. Thank you, Ms. Pilcher and thank you, Maggie!"},{"Title":"September","review":"Makes an excellent and enjoyable read. Pilcher's writing style is comfortable and strings together just the right words to form delightful sentences. The story has all the interesting plots of romance, intrigue, family disputes, and hidden secrets. None of these seem contrived or melodramatic. Pilcher also has a touch of describing mundane activities with warmth and wit - making a cup of tea or clearing a sinkful of dishes - actually sound exciting!Some readers comment that Noel Keeling has changed. I disagree, it is only that some of his burning craving to be a 'somebody' in high-flying society, has been assuaged by his quite sizeable inheritance and the steady sucess in his career. If Alexa had not had her weatlh and riches and Noel had not seen the obvious opulence of Balnaid - I doubt he would have given her a second glance let alone any serious commitment.Archie and Isobel are reminiscent of Nancy Chamberlain and George from Shell Seekers. Struggling to maintain a rambling house, son beign educated in an expensive school, and maintaining appearances when guests are on the scene."},{"Title":"September","review":"I received this book as a gift from someone who knew I loved The Shell Seekers.

I read it to the end, thinking it would get better, but it never did for me. I did not like any of the characters and therefore, could not connect or sympathize with them. I thought the book was boring. Every little detail repeated over and over again... \\"She opened the door. She walked through the door. She closed the door\\". I get it - let's move on. I think this book could have been condensed by at least 100 pages. The book had the potential to be moving, but wasn't. Each time you thought something climatic was about to happen, the writer jumps to another person's story. I felt all the characters in the book were B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just wish I didn't waste my time with this book."},{"Title":"September","review":"i read this years ago when it was first published. and i remember that it was a very good book.

This one was possibly my favorite. Her characters come so alive in a well written tale of an extended family in Scotland.

I highly recommend her style of writing to everyone who loves to read"},{"Title":"September","review":"Rosamunde Pilcher casts generous and loving light on the families of Strathcroy, Scotland, and brings us a tale of human nature in its variegated color. We treat with the chracters in a smorgasbord of failure and triumph, in situations real and recognizable. Pilcher's characters ring true, and the setting is given without compromise. The depth and strength of her characters drew me into this incredible plot, amazing as much for its realism and texture as for its honesty, but the element of surprise and the lack of trite romanticism made the novel the most satisfying read of months."},{"Title":"September","review":"I've read both The Shell Seekers and September and wished they wouldn't end.

This book is so wonderfully refreshing compared to a lot of novels today. It's a sequel of a sorts to &quot;The Shell Seekers,&quot; but the characters are different people than the ones that occupys &quot;The Shell Seekers.&quot; Only Noel is presented in this book and it's such a nice change to see him growing up into a real man throughout this book. If anyone can prove that they can redeem themselves, Noel is the best example of that!Be sure to read this book right after you've finished &quot;The Shell Seekers.&quot; That way, Noel and his tendencies are still fresh in your mind and you can see Pilcher at work intertwining lives of people in both books.Pilcher is an author I highly recommend to everyone to read. She's a clean writer, refreshingly so! Her descriptions of every day life in Scotland and England are vivid ~~ where you can see the loch in its glory on a fall day, smell the tea, see the rainy mists just outside the windows. She takes you with her on her journeys. And it lingers long after the last page."},{"Title":"September","review":"Pilcher does a masterful job at extending several key characters from &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; into this lovely book. While each story can stand alone, start with &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; and move onto this. The character of Noel is one I find so interesting and believeable- rather callous and self-absorbed in &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; and then growing and learning to understand and appreciate the world his mother created for him in &quot;September&quot;. Noel has a love interest in this book that starts in a most unlikely manner, but is richly satisfying as the book goes on. I won't give away the story, but even though the book is richly populated with Pilcher's usual lovable if eccentric folk, the emotional journey of Noel Keeling is at the heart of &quot;September&quot;.An unlikely hero, the changes we see in Noel gives us hope for ourselves and those we care about deeply."},{"Title":"September","review":"I'm an avid reader and this is, without a doubt, my favorite book of all time by my favorite author of all time.At the heart of &quot;September&quot; is Noel Keeling, a man sorely self-absorbed and with a life in disarray after a bitter fight with his mother and her subsequent death in &quot;The Shell Seekers.&quot; Noel is drawn into the life of London caterer Alexa Aird, whose family and their good friends, the Balmerinos, are the pivotal families in this rich tale of love, betrayal, loss, despair, and redemption on the moors of Scotland.You will meet Violet Aird, the aging matriarch rich in compassion yet fretful as she watches her son Edmund and his second wife Virginia grow apart over a disagreement concerning their son. When a former lover reenters Virginia's life, their son Henry disappears from boarding school, and a pathetic madwoman begins to dredge up the past, there is plenty to worry about. Add to the mix their good friends Archie and Isobel Balmerino, the lord and lady rich in titles but so short on cash they must open their family home to visiting American tourists. Their daughter Lucilla, a free-spirit who has been traveling through Europe with her Austrailian boyfriend, returns home with a most surprising guest in tow---Archie's sister Pandora who left twenty years ago over whispered-about circumstances and whose return changes lives forever.This is another trip into the world of Rosamunde Pilcher, one rich in family ties, unsurpassed local color of her beloved Scotland, and characters that will long be in your memory. If you're looking for an engrossing book to curl up with, one you will be hard-put to set aside, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"September","review":"September, by the beloved author of The Shell Seekers Rosamunde Pilcher, is another book in a long line by this author which most readers will enjoy thoroughly. Set in Scotland, this book focuses on several people gathering together to celebrate the 21st birthday of a local girl. While firmly set in the present through the use of flashbacks, we come to know these people and the events which bring them to this point in time.Among the various people gathering members and friends of two well known families of the village. Archie Balmerino is a major landowner of the area who is a Lord rather down on his income. During a military exercise he suffered a tragedy which has altered his chance for a livelihood once he left the military as well as leaving him emotionally fragile. Isobel his loving wife hosts tourist families during the season at their stately home while their daughter travels the continent trying to find a place for herself. And then there is Pandora, Archie's sister who left the family home at 18, and is only now returning after 20 years to be with family and friends before it is too late.The Aird family includes Violet, the 78 year old matriarch of the family and a woman reminiscent of Penelope Keeling from The Shell Seekers. Her prosperous son Edmund is married to his second wife Virginia although he has a secret he never shared with her which is now threatening to undo them. Alexa is Edmund's daughter from his first marriage who now finds happiness with an older man and Henry the progeny of the Airds second marriage is about to leave for boarding school at the tender age of 8 which upsets Virginia greatly. And seeing over this family is Edie who as Mrs. Aird's housekeeper cares for all of them as if they were her own. Added to this cast of characters are several others including Noel Keeling who readers of The Shell Seekers, will remember as Penelope Keeling's son.While preparations are made for the party during the summer months and then during the party in September, we learn about these people as if they were our friends and are also treated to vivid descriptions of the wonderful countryside of Scotland, the homes these people occupy and their lifestyles both past and present. What awaits readers is seeing how these characters sort out their lives as the book ends with a startling and unanticipated conclusion.September is the 13th book I've read by Rosamunde Pilcher and I am still as excited and enthusiastic about her books as when I read her first book in 1988. As this author has idonea in the opts, she envelops her readers in her world of people and places through wonderful characterizations and a love for the area where her book take place. While The Shell Seekers remains my all time favorite book by Ms. Pilcher and also one of my top ten all time reads, September takes it's rightful place along with The Shell Seekers as one of Ms. Pilcher's best books in my opinion.I do hope you will enjoy this author as much as I have in the past. With only two novels left to read by her, Coming Home and Winter Solstice, I do hope she will write another book which will keep me up nights reading till the very end."},{"Title":"September","review":"Like so many other readers, after the events of 9/11, I had a hard time latching on to a book that would hold my interest. At first I thought something in the mystery/thriller genre would do the trick although I made sure I stayed clear of anything spy or terrorist related. Finding no solace in that genre, I turned to an author who has never disappointed me and picked up Pilcher's book September, which had been sitting on my shelves for quite some time. This book called to me as the title was apropos for the month in which I chose to read it.The setting is vintage Pilcher in a small town in Scotland called Strathcroy and right away I'm feeling pleasantly calm. All the residents are gearing up for the 21st birthday \\"dance\\" for Katy Steynton and I'm wishing my own invitation would arrive in the mail. The idea for the dance is hatched in May and the book will follow the next three months that will eventually lead up to September and the gala event. As with most Pilcher books, there is the presiding matriarch of the family and, in this case, it's Violet Aird. Everything about her is reminding me of my own grandmother so I'm in heaven at this point.Every character in a Pilcher book is colorful and familiar - either like people you know or people you want to know. This book is no exception as it is filled with housekeepers and grandchildren and estate lords and extended family members and, of course, one resident troublemaker who will keep everyone on guard. This author is known for happy endings and, while some are heartrending, the feeling of hope and goodness is present on each page. By the time everyone arrives at the dance on that September eve, you feel as if you've played a big part in planning the festivities. Naturally the book follows the course of more than just planning for the party and it is chock full of twists and turns and the usual surprises as only this delightful author can write them. As in all Pilcher books, the potential for disaster always exists as she gathers all the players together in what can either result in devastating emotional turmoil or incomparable happiness. You'll have to go to the dance to find out what happens!So as the events of the real life September came to a close, my spirits were raised and my hopes for humanity broadened all because I went to \\"Dr. Pilcher.\\" Give her a try whether you're down and out or on top of the world - she serves it up right no matter what the ailment. As the famous song goes, \\"It's a long, long time, From May to December, But the days grow short, When you reach September.\\" We'll never forget September of the year 2001 and I'll never forget this book for helping me through that fateful month."},{"Title":"September","review":"September is the first book I have read by Rosamunde Pilcher, but I have to say, it will not be last! The families in this book are so mysterious and with such rich histories. Reading this book almost reminded me of watching an episode of Dynasty! I was not aware that &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; was a prequel to this novel, and I have no problem following the story line.Pilcher'd descriptions of Scotland were breathtaking. You feel as if you are there with the characters, in the Highlands. She is fantastic author and I can't wait to get a hold of her other novels!"},{"Title":"September","review":"This is a good sequel to The Shell Seekers, however... while it is better than R Pilcher's other novels, it still does not hold a candle to The Shell Seekers. It is nice to see what happens to at least one of The Shell Seeks characters afterwards, and Pandora and her family are very compelling."},{"Title":"September","review":"An incredibly marvelous read. Ms. Pilcher is one of our finest authors; her characters are all \\"real\\". Her books are always very hard to put down once started."},{"Title":"September","review":"This book is a sort of continuation from Pilcher's Shellseekers (another amazing book). While not as epic in scope as Shellseekers, September is still more than enjoyable. I've read it countless times over the years and am always drawn in by the lifelike characters.The only complaint I have (and it's a minor one) is the dialogue between male characters. It seems forced and unnatural. It seems Pilcher should have maybe talked with the men in her life more to see how their conversations flow.All in all, a great read! Definitely worth the price!"},{"Title":"September","review":"Pilcher's sequel continues with a book that rivals THE SHELL SEEKERS and stands on it's own merit. Her characters come alive amidst the pages, drawing you in deeper with every sentence. The book continues with Noel, the egotistical son of Penelope Keeling, as he searches for his misplaced sense of self. In Alexa he may find a joy and love that he is not quite ready for or capable of.As in all of Pilcher's books there is a plethora of characters, all as important as the next with stories that tie together and make you feel like part of the family. Love, death, loss, insanity, handicaps that interfere with life as it is, and most of all that sense of belonging to a family that she instills so easily with the stroke of her pen. I can never get enough of this author.

However, the majority of the books and films examined are not mainstream so really the essays can only be fully appreciated and understood by a small audience. Likewise, far too much time is really spent looking at bisexual women to justify the title &quot;Bisexual Men&quot;. Only the last essay by Marshall Miller, &quot;Ethically Questionable?': Popular Media Reports of Bisexual Men and AIDS&quot; is truly accessible to most people and it does a great job of discussing cultural preceptions of bisexual men. What would be wonderful is a book that actually examined the mainstream of American culture and society."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This is an heroic attempt by Scruton to summarize the entire philosophy of one the most important thinkers of all time.

Scruton does a wonderful job of making Kant clear."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Roger Scruton, I'm sorry for the two stars. This is a great book, and I will let the other well-written reviews attest to that.

Granted, I do not think Kant can be reduced to a \\"for Dummies\\" or \\"Very Short Intro\\" book - so this review may be a moot point.On to the (possibly moot) point of this review: a WARNING to would be buyers! Read the other reviews and understand they are serious that this book requires some intense digestion - it is not on par with other VSI books. If a person truly wants a simple overview of Kant's work, they will probably forever be disappointed - it doesn't exist. VSI Kant is a headache waiting to happen for the layman who wants to peruse VSI books and get a small overview of varying subjects.\\"Thinking Through Philosophy\\" by Chris Horner and Emrys Westacott briefly touches upon Kant's work and offers practical applications of his main ideas, and is a much easier read.If one desires an in depth study of Kant (there is no other kind) then this book is for them, but it is not on par with what I believe is the accessibility that VSI books are so well known for."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I love almost everything about the \\"Very Short Introduction\\" series.I find them easy to read (\\"easy\\" is relative with Philosophy books) and fun...The writing tends to be witty.I love the colors of the books.

Each run gets one a bit closer to the top.I now understand far more about Kant's philosophy than I ever thought I would thanks to the book. Roger Scruton has an incredible ability to unpack Kant's ideas."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I agree that Roger Scruton is a gifted writer. This alone is a great asset to possess when undertaking a very short book on Kant's major works. My complaint is that Scruton can't seem to control his urge to insert his personal opinions into his writing.He says at one point that the Red Army brutalized Konigsberg. That's true, but why? Could it have been because Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union first? Yes. Could the bombing of Konigsburg by Stalin have been in retaliation for German bombing of Moscow? Yes. The Soviet Union lost over 13 million civilians as a result of WWII according to WIKIpedia. The Soviet Union was allied with the United States during WWII. I know that you don't like communism, and I don't blame you for not liking Stalin because there is every reason to detest Stalin, but give us a little context please Roger. There is no reason to hide that the Nazis were ultimately responsible for the destruction of Konigsberg.The author also blatantly inserts his opinion at one point toward the end of the book when commenting on Kant's sexual ethics. He can't seem to resist himself. These points may seem minor, and I guess in this day of Fox News editorializing they are minor, but someone needs to call him out on it.So here we have a gifted writer in need of a good, strong editor to control his worst urges, but I don't know that Mr. Scruton would listen to a good, strong editor to begin with."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Kant is clearly one of the 4 or 5 most influential thinkers of the last half-century, however, the complexity of his ideas combined with an often difficult writing style (for modern readers) makes for a difficult study. In order to get the most out of Kant (or to get through him at all, for that matter), it is essential to read and study modern introductions and commentaries first. This \\"very short introduction\\" is an excellent example. It is concise, highly readable, and a good beginning for more detailed study. However, it is still not enough to allow one to tackle Kant immediately and I suggest further introductory study."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"\\"It is the greatest incumbency of a philosopher and becomes most seldom found anyway to be consistently ...\\" Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) wrote.

It's my dirty little secret. These short introductions provide one with a pocketsize, portable introduction to a wide variety of topics. With a light tone and a surface skim of the issues, these little guides provide one with the general overview one might expect in a small survey course. Naturally, there are downsides. Are these guides comprehensive? Heavens no! Do they take time to dig deeply into the issues? Not generally. But are they a good resource to use if you want to get your feet wet before you dive in? Yes. When used properly, these little guidebooks can allow what might start out as a casual curiosity to develop into a more in-depth research project. In fact, all of these introductions provide references and suggestions for further reading.Roger Scruton's _A Very Short Introduction to Kant_ tackles a job that most writers would completely shy away from: to try and produce a short, readable summary of Kant's life, work, and influence. He has succeeded marvelously, carefully explaining difficult features of Kant's philosophy while noting the disagreements that occur in the scholarly literature. I found this text to be extremely helpful, not only for someone who would be approaching Kant for the first time, but also particularly for a student of Kant's philosophy that desires to have a short work to help synthesize everything.After rehearsing a short, but interesting, biography of Kant's life and works, Scruton begins examining the ways in which Kant's thought can be seen as responding to the work of Leibniz and Descartes, exploring the possibilities of knowledge and the question of whether reality consists in subjective appearances or objective existence. Kant's arguments for synthetic, a priori knowledge are rehearsed in this section and the transcendental deduction is thoroughly reviewed. The next section concerns Kant's morality and his famous categorical imperative. A section on Kant's aesthetics follows and, finally, a chapter on Kant's political philosophy ends the book.While reading this introduction, the reader gains an appreciation for just how broad Kant's philosophical interests were and Scruton does a remarkable job at revealing how Kant's basic principles help configure the rest of Kant's thought (be it morality, aesthetics, or politics). The effect of this is that by the end of the work, the reader has had these principles driven home and can formulate Kant's thought from them. This work may be a tad above the grasp of a casual reader who is not dedicated to the task of understanding it, but anyone who has some knowledge of the subject (or is determined) will benefit from reading this introduction. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"These books are kinda hit or miss. This one hits. Bullseye. Along with the chapter on Kant in Will Durant's \\"The Story of Philosophy,\\" this is most thorough-but-brief examination of Kant's Philosophy. I can't even fathom how he did it. Scruton takes care to be as clear as possible when deciphering Kant's original but highly technical idiolect. If you read this book carefully, and then approach Kant's highly involved philosophy: you will see the difference. But. You have to be in for the haul. You may need to reread passages. Kant's works, even when condensed like this, are still foreboding and require much focus and concentration. But he is worth it. Modern thought springs much from Kant's ideas: his influence, not only on 19th Century Philosophy, German Romanticism, and Religious philosophy is ineluctable. I was hooked from the second chapter, wherein Scruton places Kant in his context and illustrates the evolution of his thought. Leibniz's and Hume's influence is dealt with in a fantastic way- a consideration of both thinkers is necessary for a greater understanding.I can't say enough good things. If anyone ever told me that a book of 135 pages of small print with good illustrations could deal effectively with a thinker of this magnitude and verbosity I'd laugh. And I'd have to eat that laughter. I'll say this, it makes Kant pleasurable. A pleasure to read and a greater pleasure to understand. I'd recommend this to anyone with any degree of interest in kant. As Scruton says in his preface, \\"Kant hope to draw the limits of human understanding; he found himself compelled to transcend them.\\" Scruton's V.S.I. is an excellent testament to that vision."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"There is no question that Scruton knows his Kant, and this book is a 5-star synopsis of Kant's major ideas, including some of the background and controversies surrounding them.That said, I don't think it will succeed as a first introduction to Kant for most people. If you already know this material, or have known it sometime in the past and want to brush up, then this is the perfect book for you. If you are looking to learn about Kant's ideas for the first time, you are likely to find this book too compressed and telegraphic. I don't doubt that Scruton made a great effort, but it just may not be possible to introduce Kant in this number of pages. For a true introduction, I'd recommend Sebastian Gardner's guidebook in the Routledge series."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Immanuel Kant is arguably one of the most influential, and yet most difficult to read, philosophers of all time. Roger Scruton does as good a job as it is reasonable to expect in this short introduction to Kant's work. The reader is given a bit of background to Kant's philosophy, and then is introduced to the transcendental deduction, the logic of illusion, the categorical imperative, as well as Kant's ideas on aesthetic and law. The booklet concludes with a few comments on the meaning and impact of Kant's \\"transcendental\\" philosophy. I must say that the section that gripped (yes, that is the right word!) me the most is chapter 7, \\"Enlightenment and Law,\\" where Scruton comments on the role Kant had in developing modern concepts such as human rights and even the idea of a league of nations. Kant was an anti-utopian, in the sense that he did not believe that an ideal political system could actually be realized in practice, and indeed despised the violence of the then recent French revolution. (He would certainly not have approved of Bush's war to bring democracy to other countries.) But he was a man of the Enlightenment in the sense that he thought we still ought to strive toward such ideals, to keep them in mind as a guide to our behavior and our discussions about what is right and just. It makes for much food for thought even in modern times."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"The book is good and Roger Scruton always has a free flowing beautiful style of writing. That said - almost the same content by the same author - plus three other philosophers, are in this book -German Philosophers: Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzscheand that is a better buy and would give a far better understanding of a bigger picture too."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Scruton is able to pull off a brief but highly enlightening introduction of Kant. For those who find the perusal of the unabridged &quot;Critique&quot; a folly lacking in pure reason, this pocket sized gem seems the perfect answer. The size is rather deceptive when it comes to the density of matter it contains... It will definitely take focussed reading and a good deal of time to do justice to this book. Personally, I feel I myself haven't done enough of justice to this compact, loaded book."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Kant is one of those modern philosophers whose presence looms large over much of what has been achieved over the past couple of centuries in modern philosophy, and yet he is not very likely to be read in most introductory philosophy classes. Part of the difficulty lies with Kant's highly technical and oftentimes convoluted use of language, which gave even his contemporaries who were native German speakers some difficulties. The philosophers and scholars have since had a chance to debate, oftentimes vehemently, the \\"true\\" meaning of Kant's works and it is unlikely that those debates will end any time soon. With such formidable baggage, it would be very difficult for an absolute novice in philosophy to just plunge into Kant's work and start reading it on its own. A good first exposition by an expert is invaluable and this thin volume serves exactly such purpose. It does a remarkable job of delineating the scope of Kant's thought and bringing this philosopher to life for the new generation of readers."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"It's a pretty good introduction, I'd recommend reading several introductions to Kant before diving in (he's pretty dense). I think Goethe said that reading Kant was like walking into a well-lit room, I hardly think he was talking about Kant's dry, scholastic writing style. The clarity of his thought, however, is pretty intense. I do recommend this book, merely because jumping straight into Kant probably isn't going to fare well. When, and if, you do choose to read Kant, take a look at Jonathan Bennett's website (a philosopher and Kant scholar), I think he translates Kant into more readable English. Early Modern Texts or something. I agree with some of the other commentators, that this introduction is kinda hard for a first time look into Kant. A history of philosophy book might be your best bet to read first. It is pretty good for such a short introduction though. Take your time and don't do it in a day. Digest it. Good luck all."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This book offers a clear and concise introduction to one of the most difficult philosophers. This book, and others in the series, are excellent preparation for an undergraduate class. Scruton is a little conservative in his analysis of Kant's work. The reader should be aware that he is definitely of the analytic strain."},{"Title":"Kant: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I have no background in philosophy, and was curious about Kant -- a friend recommended this book. It is very well written --the most clear parts of the text really change the perspective. At places where the text is unclear, the author points out that the argument in the original is unclear, vague or inconsistent. It is by no means a light read, but I recommend it for any beginner interested in knowing more about Kant's philosophy."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"This collection of stories from 1973 - 1989 are musty, tepid and just plain dull. I expected a lot more from this book. In my opinion, if you're looking for enjoyable travel stories pick up any book by Bill Bryson (except for I'm a Stranger Here Myself)."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"Terrible writting,This was the first time i bought a book written by mr Cahill.I recommend renting his book if you want to sample his writting but he is very hard to follow with stories that never seem to go anywhere.The book is compose of many short stories and I would have to say that less then 40% of the stories are worth reading."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"While Cahill is always very entertaining, his later books have focused more on the caving, scuba, climbing and flying aspects of adventure travel. In _Wolverine_ the stories include a broader variety of journalistic endeavour, taking him from Jonestown to a bizarre religious cult to encounters with mountain gorillas. This was the book that hooked me on Tim's writing.What makes it so good is, for one thing, that he's never so detached as to reek of smug pseudo-sophistication, but never so involved as to let his emotions and opinions interfere with the story. The balance between the two extremes is perfect. For another, Tim simply does and sees things hardly anyone else ever sees and does, let alone writes about. For yet another, he is often very funny in a dry, Montana sort of way. If you are new to Tim Cahill, you're in for quite a few hours of great reading."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"\\"A Wolverine---\\" is the second book of articles mostly taken from \\"Rolling Stone\\" and \\"Outside\\" magazine. The articles were written as far back as 1971 when Tim was a young man indeed. And it shows. Youthful high spirits prevail, and there is much cheery bravado interspersed with excellent journalistic essays that display a remarkable maturity.Ever wonder why people chase all over the earth to view a solar eclipse? Find out on a rollicking trip to find the absolute best place to get an unclouded view. Discover what all the shouting is about.I am used to Tim somehow bringing me back alive, laughing all the way from the wildest, strangest parts of the world. I have always credited him with fine introspection and lyrical prose that sneaked into whatever he wrote. The guy is just incapable of bad writing.The essays include a fine thought piece on the late Dian Fossey, the \\"Gorillas in the Mist\\" author who was murdered apparently by poachers. The essay on \\"reprogramming\\" of children who were enmeshed in cults is harrowing. Cahill has no use for the cults, but the rationale and methods of reprogramming are chilling. He infiltrated a California cult and lived there while developing his story. The living conditions (except for the leader who lived in a mansion on the hill) were unbelievably bad, yet the morale was high among the young converts. Tim presents a balanced, sometimes humorous, article that shows empathy for all except the leader.The premier essay, which should be required reading, was his on-the-spot reporting of the Jamestown Massacre that took place in Guyana twenty years ago. The immediacy and power of his word pictures, the horror of 900 dead supposedly suicides, the incredible remoteness of the site crush with a pervasive sadness and dismay."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"More classic Cahill, the Dave Barry of adventure travel. Cahill separates his writings into 5 sections, Jungles of the Mind, Visions of Terror and Paradise, Wet Work, Monsters and Hoaxes, and The Raggedy Edge. The stories incorporates a lot of material from his magazine work. Some of the material is recognized from his other book \`Jaguars Ripped my Flesh', although he uses it with a lot of new material. I found this book much more enjoyable than \`Jaguars Ripped my Flesh'."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"This is an excellent collection of thoughts and comments on the sheer edge of adventure. Cahill knows exactly how to describe the amazing stupidity of some of these adventure sports in a way that still leaves you interested in participating. Like his previous collection, Jaquars Ripped My Flesh, this book covers the gamut in place and sport, from extreme skiing in Montana to whitewater rafting in India. And while Cahill is a master at adventure writing, when he turns his pen to describing the cultures of some of the more exotic places that he has visited and the difference between their culture and our's, he's both hilarious and profound. This book is a selection of the Vintage Departures series, a group of books that I have found to be uniformly excellent."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"This stuff is terrific - can't stop reading it. I try to ration myself or the book will be finished before I can tear myself away. Cahill never fails to bring a new, irreverant, insightful view to his adventures. Read it for fun, but learn wierd things while you're at it."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"A Wolverine is Eating My Leg is a collection of the adventures of Tim Cahill, mostly from the early 1980's. They range from true travel adventure stories such as getting stranded in the Marquesas to darker stories, such as traveling to Guyana to report on the Jonestown massacre (the most interesting of all the articles).The stories are varied enough that there will be something for everyone in this collection, but since they are so different from one another, all readers may not enjoy all of the stories. Cahill's cockiness about his adventures felt a bit condescending at times, but this is offset by his great sense of humour and the fact that he is not afraid to poke fun at himself.An enjoyable read that had me googling a few of the articles for more information on the subjects."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"The only section that peaked my interest was the \\"Jungles of the Mind\\" which featured the author talking about how he infiltrated the Tony and Sue Alamo Christian Foundation in the 1970s where cults in California like Manson and Jones were still in popularity. I felt that the Alamo situation had gone flat with some retrospective views. I felt that he was just experimenting or trying to understand the followers but never did quite fit in. Of course, Tony Alamo is a cult leader and the members became indoctrinated into his church in an isolated area.The Jonestown Massacre on November 18, 1978 was visited and the images were somewhat clear but vague at times as well upon the discovery of hundreds of rotting, bloated corpses. If the author had investigated, he would understand that everybody was pretty much held by gunpoint and had little choice. Only a few survived at all. He doesn't mention that the only follower outside Jonestown murdered her three children and herself in the Georgetown headquarters of the People's Temple.Agan, I felt that the author doesn't offer much retrospective but I did appreciate his interviews with Odell Rhodes, Tim Carter, and others who survived the horrible ordeal.I really felt that pictures could say a thousand words especially with Jonestown and the survivors."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"I couldn't put this book down, I was intrigued at the detail and insight of the author."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"Tim Cahill's adventure travelogue, \\"A Wolverine is Eating my Leg\\", is a book of give and take as applies to the numerous subject matters he experienced and collects into this work.For me, overall, I enjoyed they book but I will probably not read the book in its entirety again. I will read sections of it just not all of it. Keep in mind, these are works that were written for various magazines over a period of 15 years. There is no smooth flow from one adventure to the next but rather sudden large leaps. It is almost better to rate this book by its sections rather than the book on the whole. Some parts were just more interesting than the others. Here's my run down:1. Treasure seeking in South America... lackluster - 2 stars2. Gorilla Country... interest is rising - 3 stars3. Tony & Susan Alamo Cult infiltration - even better, showing some interesting events that Cahill actually looked into, showing this \\"cult religion\\" to be much more voluntary and more of being duped than brainwashing - 4 stars4. Jonestown, Guyana - this is the peak of the book, very interesting and after seeing the pictures of the mass 'suicide' it has an even bigger impact. This is the best piece in this book - 5 stars5. The 'Terror of the Heart' section - Cahill covers things from public nudity, eclipse addicition, getting stuck on Marquesas islands, scuba diving around sharks, snakes, and sea lions. Nothing great here, meandering thoughts, kind of uninspiring - 1 star6. 'Monsters' - Cahill talks about bigfoot and ice fishing for giant pike. I liked the bigfoot section but the ice pike fishing did nothing and is slow moving - 3 stars7. 'Raggedy Edge' - Cahill covers surviving a walk in Death Valley, cave exploring, cliff skiing, and white water rafting in India. This was mildly interesting but was nothing spectacular - 3 stars.Cahill relates the stories in varying degrees of interest and enthusiasm, possibly changing of his writing styles over the 15 years and the various magazines formats may influence this also. Overall, mediocre, there's better travelogues. Maybe if Cahill did all this in 1-2 years continuously it would have had a better reception from me. The Jonestown coverage is well worth the read though."},{"Title":"A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","review":"A collection of magazine pieces by travel writer/thrill seeker Cahill that has its moments."},{"Title":"War Between Russia and China","review":"A great deal has happened in the world in the 40 years since this book was written. The Soviet Union is no more, Mao has died and the natural propensity of the Chinese to engage in commerce has re-emerged. Therefore, much of the tension between China and Russia has abated, making this analysis by Salisbury interesting as a historical retrospective.The book is also a demonstration of how geopolitics will triumph over ideological similarities and political incompatibilities. Down through history, nations that have governments and political positions that are complete opposites become allies due to the circumstances of their position and national interests. That is the primary reason why the primary actions of the Soviet leadership differed very little in goals from that of the Tsars. Salisbury does an excellent job in explaining the fundamental rivalry between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and how it has been active for centuries.Therefore, his thesis that a war between the Soviet Union and China is possible was not unrealistic, even though as of 2009 it has not happened. Nevertheless, the main points of rivalry still exist, and as Russia now moves to assert itself in what they refer to as \\"the near abroad\\", one of the natural points of tension is Mongolia and the border areas with China. If you want to know the reasons why a conflict between Russia and China is still a real possibility, read this book. Given the national interests of both countries, such a rivalry is inevitable."},{"Title":"The Future Factor: The Five Forces Transforming Our Lives and Shaping Human Destiny","review":"I have just read Michael G. Zey's The Future Factor, afascinating view of an emerging world of new technologies andscientific breakthroughs, and what effects they will have on ourlives.What drew me to this book in the first place was itsintriguing subtitle, &quot;The Five Factors Transforming Our Lives andReshaping Human Destiny&quot;. Unlike other books in this area,&quot;The Future Factor&quot; delivers on its subtitle in everyway. Once I began reading the book, I simply could not put itdown-&quot;The Future Factor&quot; is simply one of the mostoptimistic books about the future of the human species I've everencountered.Zey paints a convincing portrait of an excitingfuture--we will be living to 150 years or more, using robots andcomputers to better our lives, and travel at superfast speeds (evenperhaps approach the speed of light). According to Zey, we arealready using genetic engineering, cloning, and bionics to improve thephysical condition of the human being in a process he labelsbiogenesis. (Zey has invented a new vocabulary of sorts to describehis vision.) The author makes a strong case that this world of spacecolonies, skycars, and \\"smart machines\\" no longer exists only inscience fiction, but is rapidly unfolding during this decade.What Ifound truly original, and inspiring, about this book is Dr. Zey'svision of human destiny. He says that he synthesized many differenttheories to develop this \\"Expansionary Theory of HumanDevelopment\\". According to this theory, the appearance of humanspecies was almost \\"mandated\\" by the universe itself. Why? If Iunderstand what Zey is saying, humanity's ultimate destiny is toreshape the universe, maybe even save it from what most cosmologistsinsist is a predetermined Big Bang-style ending. He says that overthe eons we will transform the universe into something he calls the\\"Humaniverse\\". Zey turns Darwin, the Big Bang theory, and mostof modern cosmology on its head to demonstrate the importance ofhumankind in the grand scheme of things.This is the kind of bookthat over a period of months should gain a wide audience simplythrough word of mouth. (I've told everyone in my circle about thisbook.) I feel changed (for the better) by reading &quot;The FutureFactor&quot;, and I want friends and family to experience theexhilaration I felt as I pored through the pages. I think that overtime the ideas Zey presents in this book will be debated in the mediaand elsewhere...I rated this book a \\"5\\"-it's riveting,extremely well-written, and, to put it bluntly, has simply changed theway I think about the future and humanity's role in helping to createthat future."},{"Title":"The Future Factor: The Five Forces Transforming Our Lives and Shaping Human Destiny","review":"This book was less about the future of technology than I had hoped. Although it does bring up a lot of diverse topics from many different areas of science that will *eventually* effect the future of mankind, it's more about a philisophical argument between New Agers and Expansionists.. Zey being a strong believer in the expansionist movement (Not to mention a Ph.D in sociology). It does cite 19 pages worth of refrences, so this book could be valuable as a guide to more in-depth study of many of the technological topics introduced. Many of the moral questions it contains have been covered in &quot;STAR TREK: The Next Generation,&quot; and some of the events discussed stretch the bounds of rationality... Sure, someday our ever-accelerating universe will suffer entropy death, but why worry about that NOW?There is a certain beauty in being a futurist: Without giving dates, you will never be wrong.I rate this book a 4 because, even though it was not what I had expected, it did get me thinking. Hopefully it will help others to realize that we really are reaching &quot;Technological Critical Mass&quot; and that the world IS going to change A LOT within the coming century... And that's a good thing."},{"Title":"The Future Factor: The Five Forces Transforming Our Lives and Shaping Human Destiny","review":"Michael Zey has written a effective primer for what in other contexts would be considered Transhumanist or Extropian thinking about the human prospect, without calling it by those terms. Since his book adds several neologisms to our discussion about life in the future -- Expansionary thinking, dominionization, species coalescence, biogenesis, cybergenesis, Russian Cosmism and the Humaniverse, for example -- perhaps he felt that throwing in some other terms would overload the reader not already familiar with the large and growing literature (mostly now on the Web) about Transhumanist philosophy.Zey is particularly concerned about maintaining and enhancing human individuality when confronted with possibly quite invasive new technologies. Hence his criticisms of scientifically plausible notions that we are going to merge into some Borg-like &quot;global brain&quot; and nonsense of that sort. He's similarly critical of thinkers in the Transhumanist/Extropian camp, like Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil, who foresee the time when humans become subordinated to advanced artificial intelligences in the coming decades, pointing out that such scenarios are the flip-side of radical environmentalist and Neo-Luddite proposals to subordinate humans to other species or to the mystical &quot;Gaia.&quot; No, Zey's primary focus is on the long-term welfare of individual humans, including their radical life extension, as we &quot;dominionize&quot; more and more of the universe for our own purposes, not those of other entities.I can't give this book the highest rating, however, because Zey mixes his generally good analysis up with some questionable, if not controversial, ideas from physics, such as non-Big Bang cosmologies, a version of the Anthropic Principle and his theory that quantum nonlocality will keep human minds basically thinking in the same way no matter how much we diverge across space-time. Still, for people wanting to know what Transhumanism is all about, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Future Factor: The Five Forces Transforming Our Lives and Shaping Human Destiny","review":"I picked up &quot;The Future Factor&quot; after hearing Michael Zey describe his vision of the future on a radio program. I truly enjoyed The Future Factor and its optimistic message. This book definitely widened my vistas regarding the possibilities of technology and science--Zey claims that soon we will control the weather, live long and healthy lives, and inhabit other planets. Robots and other smart machines will become our species' partners in solving problems, curing diseases, and exploring the universe.While I personally found myself swept up in Zey's vision of human \\"destiny\\", I can see why some consider his views controversial, maybe even unsettling. He claims that humanity has a purpose, almost a mission, to change and \\"perfect\\" the universe. This is strong stuff-not for the pessimists (or perhaps these are the people that need this book most.). Zey definitely challenges the reader to \\"get involved\\" with helping make this new vision a reality.According to the blurb on the book jacket, Zey holds a Ph.D. in sociology, which might explain his concern over the social factors that will impact our future. Zey claims that various social groups are choosing sides in a growing debate in our society over the future of humankind. According to Dr. Zey, this \\"battle for the future\\" is between two camps, one which supports human growth, technology, and progress, the other an environmentalist/new age faction that feels that man must live in balance with nature. Supposedly, the outcome of this \\"battle for the future\\" will determine the fate of humankind and eventually the universe.I like the idea that you can go to his website, \\"zey.com\\", for more info on his book, news about technology, robots, the Internet, and politics, as well as \\"critical links\\" to other sites. The site also gives you info on the author's upcoming media appearances and lectures.I definitely recommend The Future Factor!"},{"Title":"The Future Factor: The Five Forces Transforming Our Lives and Shaping Human Destiny","review":"Zey says this book is for optimists and he is quite correct. Every technology he covers barely touches it's dangers while extoling it's benefits. He has little data to back up most of his claims. For a more realistic portrayal of where our current practices are taking us - i would recommend &quot;Naked Ape to Superspecies&quot; by David Suzuki. I only finished this book as he does reveal some interesting technologies - al beit one sided."},{"Title":"Handstitched Leonardo's Women Florence Unlined","review":"It's sometimes difficult to know until you hold a journal in your hands if its quality is worthy of your thoughts. Curious about this series of blank books, I located one in a Border's store so I could examine it closely, and was sold (though I actually bought several of various styles through Amazon due to the greatly reduced price and wide selection).Just wanted to reassure any curious journal-keepers that this is a very nice book for having paper binding. The surfaces of the front and back plates are silky smooth, taut and very pretty. The spine, being sewn with strings, is tight, yet allows the book to lay completely flat when open. The pages inside are very smooth, practically non-porous grain, and of a medium weight, thick enough for fine-tip pen-and-ink, but too thin for any other medium of drawing or writing element. I'm usually a fan of leather-bound journals because they're sturdier and more aesthetically pleasing to me, but as paper-bound journals go, these are among the nicest I've seen."},{"Title":"Official Splatter Movie Guide: Hundreds More of the Grossest, Goriest, Most Outrageous..","review":"This book, the sequel to McCarty's original \\"Splatter Movie Guide\\", covers movies released between 1989 and 1992, plus many older titles overlooked in the first guide. Like the first, it rates movies of the \\"splatter\\" genre, mainly horror, sci-fi, and action movies, with lots of blood and guts. The author even goes into detail about how much and what type of blood and guts to expect- whether it's an eyeball poked out, an evisceration or two, or beheadings, he's got it covered. Also included are plot synopses, actors/directors, and basically whether the film is worth your time or not.McCarty's writing is hilarious, and the book is fun to read even if you're not interested in the movies. His descriptions of the films are hysterical, pee-your-pants funny, so it's both fun to read and a useful guide for gorehounds. For example, his review of \\"Ministry of Vengeance\\" begins, \\"If you can accept the basic premise that 'Dukes of Hazzard's' John Schneider is a Vietnam-vet-turned-Episcopal-priest-turned-bloodthirsrty-revenge-minded vigilante when his wife and daughter are mown down by terrorists in an airport, then you're welcome to this bargain-basement Bronson crap\\".As you can see, he tells it like it is. And so do I: buy it!"},{"Title":"Fibre Channel, Second Edition: Connection To The Future","review":"This book is written by the Fibre Channel marketing team - it reads like sales literature. There is no unbiased discussion on the technology, no mention of any of the weak points and exhorbitant claims about Fibre Channel's ability.

In searching for some &quot;quick&quot; answers to how the museum I manage could answer some of these questions and how we can continue to be relevant to the community we serve, I read this book. It, of course, doesn't provide any quick solutions, but instead provides a heap of ideas and a strong philosophy to base activities &amp; programs on. I read it as a museum professional, BUT found alot in it for my role as a community member. I'd definitely recommend the book for anyone interested in strengthening their community or finding common ground between community groups. The book does not read like a &quot;how to&quot; book. It's beautifully written, but still practical. A quick quote from the book: &quot;Remembering confirms our attachments to each other&quot;."},{"Title":"A Place to Remember: Using History to Build Community (American Association for State and Local History)","review":"Historical societies and preservation organizations have proliferated in recent decades. This undoubtedly arises from a humanly-shared experiential depth, a depth that Robert Archibald, examines in this brooding look at the deeply interconnected relation between personal experience and community, time, and place.The narrative is framed around Archibald's return to his boyhood home of Ishpeming, Michigan where he revisits once familiar places: a store run by a 96 year-old woman, a nearby cemetery, an abandoned family camphouse, the shore of Lake Michigan, and others. These had helped to form him, and each represented a different insight into time and community.Professionally trained as an historian, his career has primarily been devoted to public history, in effect working with the public experience of history. This perspective forced him to question &quot;the mantle of objective distance&quot; that was demanded by his academic training. Reading widely he came to recognize the importance of memory in that &quot;[t]o be human is to struggle to make sense of our own pasts as a means of establishing identity and forming relationships with the world we inhabit.&quot; (p. 30)He returned to his home town to reflect upon the processes of his memory and the way in which his life had been formed by the events, people, and places that made up the world of his childhood. From this emerged his understanding that &quot;[t]he community we create is founded in shared remembrance and grounded in place, especially those places that are conducive to the casual associations necessary for emergence of shared memory, common ground, and commitment to the common good.&quot; (p. 24) Consequently, he decries our failure to see history and place as formative, in that past experience is &quot;the only guide we have&quot; (p. 113), therefore, &quot;[t]he point to the past will be lost and humanity imperiled if in our relativistic timidity we refuse to draw conclusions from the past and if we persist in the belief that the tens of thousands of years of human life on the crust of this planet have no guideposts to offer us.&quot; (pp. 120-121)Archibald proposes four &quot;core values&quot; as organizing principles for public history: memory, transcendence, sustainability, and mutual obligation. All of these warrant considerable discussion, which is unfortunately beyond the scope of this review.In the vast forest of publications, this book stands out; it is simultaneously wise, compassionate, prophetic, and a good read. It is a must for those involved in public history, historic preservation, and cultural resource management."},{"Title":"A Place to Remember: Using History to Build Community (American Association for State and Local History)","review":"A historian by profession, Dr. Archibald helps us to see that history is not just a summary of those moments that have already passed, it is also a sort of encrypted blueprint to the future.

Here is a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson:I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.

Its actions have likely exaccerbated both booms and busts throughout history because of the long lags between policy decision and effect. It's mission has been further distorted by the Humphrey-Hawkins act which gave it the dual mandate: one, price stability, which it has a major impact on both the long and short term trajectory, and another, full-employment, which is not in its power to influence over the long run, but which provides short-term political cover for politicians. However, rather than focus on the (negative)unintended consequences of Fed Policy, this book pursues the absurd logic that these consequences are in fact the goals of secret elites who want war and chaos, so that they can fatten their pocketbooks. Many of the author's chapters have no place in the book and would have been pruned by any good editor. His understanding of fractional reserve banking is simplistic, and his goal of a pure commodity money (not even the gold exchange standard of the late 19th century)detracts from his quite reasonable proposition to eliminate or reform the Federal Reserve."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I was warned about reading this book a few years ago.

I found the book as readable as a novel with all the drama and excitement of a mystery, but with the dispassionate citations of a careful researcher. My only concern, and it's a minor one, is that Griffin takes some liberties with the paucity of information about an inherently secretive organization (hard to blame him...it's a secret society). While this is excusable for an account of historical fiction, I think it tends to cast a shadow over scholar's consideration of this brilliant book as a pure, historical account...too bad.

This is absolutely the best book available to gain knowledge and understanding of the history of how the government handles/controls money and commercial banks and investmant banks. Thomas Jefferson warned about the banks taking over, and fought the investment banks with all of his strength back in the 1700's! Some things, like, GREED, never change.It was the banks that conspired to write the first legislation creating the Federal Reserve (1913)--- the American people and Congress were told it \\"would protect the people\\" ---- when in reality the con game was on such a high level (only Satan could have written more deceptive legislation), it actually turned out to enhance the investment bank's income! The outcome was that the banks privately own the Federal Reserve, meet in secret, set monetary policy, cause booms and busts, loan money to our enemies; basically do everything they can to make as much money as they can.The Federal Reserve has been loaning money to nearly every country in the world through the help of the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, which is the arm of the IMF to actually disburse the money to other countries. They don't even expect the loans to be paid back; the banks renegotiate and extend the loans, thereby making even more money; and if the banks get overextended---who guarantees their loans? THAT'S RIGHT! THE U.S. GOVERNMENT (read taxpayer here)!! Watch Greece: Greece is going bankrupt due to all the loans Goldman Sachs gave them back in 2003. Goldman knew Greece would go bankrupt---that's the beauty of the plan. NEXT MOVE: Watch for the E.U. to ask the U.S. for \\"financial\\" help to bail Greece out. After that, Spain is next....then financial collapse!!The book explains how over the years the plan is for the international banking cartel, the Fabian socialists and the multi-national businesses to gradually take over ownership of every country in the world working through the United Nations. After they control the distribution of food, guns, and the military (through the U.N.), the end for all liberty loving people will soon follow. The New World Order (one world government), and one world currency is also mentioned.

Mayer Amschel Rothschild was once quoted as saying \\"Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes her laws.\\" This basically means that he who has the gold makes the rules regardless of Washington.The countries financial and monetary system was hijacked almost 95 years ago by Rockefeller, Morgan, Warburg, Rothschild, and a select group of wealthy families. It's interesting that the only potential presidential candidate speaking about this was Ron Paul. The American dollar is not going to be around much longer as we will be evolving into the North American Union with the Amero as the new currency. For those that are in denial, there is plenty of information on YouTube and Google about this.This book is a MUST READ by anyone who is concerned over the recent Wall Street bailout crisis. In fact, every American should know this information. There would be a true revolution in this country if that were the case and not the pseudo \\"change\\" like the new President elect speaks of.

This book gives the clearest explanation of the basic problem facing our financial system that I have seen to date. It is written for the average person to read -- it's not packed with technical language -- and come away with eyes wide open. You will see things much clearer after reading this and you will know where your money has gone and what you may be able to do to prevent it's continued departure in the future.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to all U.S. citizens. We all need to know exactly how the system really works. Most are not aware that the Federal Reserve is NOT a government agency -- it is owned by the big banks -- yet it's actions are back by the full faith and credit of the United States. Think about that for a moment the next time the FED decides to bailout someone who makes mountains of rediculously risky loans that go bad, (Argentina, Brazil, etc.). If the big banks know that they will be bailed out by the taxing authority of the U.S. government on us citizens, why should they exercise any restraint on what they do. If it works out they make a fortune, if it doesn't they get bailed out. Bailouts, flooding the system with freshly created money out of thin air, artificially low interest rates are all ways to drain money from the many into the hands of the few. The sooner people realize what is happening and why, the better off we'll all be in the long run.Contrary to what the morons on Bubblevision are telling the public, this market has at least another 40% to fall from here over the course of the next few years.

It makes clear how the secretly formed cabal between the federal government, the nation's major banks, and the stealthy formed and secretive Federal Reserve continuously defraud American citizens. Anyone who wonders why Thomas Jefferson feared the power of banking institutions and why Andrew Jackson fought and killed the Bank of the United States will find the answer in this expose of the Fed, which is nothing more than a successor central bank to its evil predecessor. That bank existed, as does the Fed, to channel the nation's power and wealth to a permanent oligarchy to which common people always are subject irrespective of the fact that -- because of the success of the ongoing subterfuge -- most are not aware of, and do not recognize their subservience.

In 1913 President Woodrow Wilson passed into law the Federal Reserve, and once this banking cartel(part private bank backed by government) came into being it brought with it the seeds of misery and totalitarianism. Griffin will tell you a tale that reads better than any fiction novel about a private network of Central banks that plan to enslave the world through a one world currency and government. He documents everything he brings before the reader with congressional records, U.N. documents, and the words of the international bankers themselves. By the end of this book you will see the Federal Reserve for what it really is: A mechanism of our republics destruction, a mechanism of taxation via the hidden tax inflation, and one of the greatest threats to both our liberty and freedom.

Griffin gives you facts and analyzes with relentless, cold logic. It doesn't paint a very pretty picture, but it is very important information you need to be aware of. The Federal Reserve System is a legal cartel designed to create riskless profits for member banks, while simultaneously turning our entire financial system into the legal and moral equivalent to that of a Las Vegas casino.

If you have ever wondered what a true pyramid scheme looks you don't have to look far just look at the Federal Reserve, which only functions as long as debt is being created at an accelerating rate.I know for those who have been living day in and day out don't understand how money is really created. To many this all sounds crazy, but Griffin has backed everything up with just the facts. Now many may reading his material may be a little unconfortable with his conspiracy therory. But as Griffin himself says, if a group of people, operating in secret, create a system that explicitly benefits themselves at the expense of others, what else can you call it but conspiracy? It really can explain all the crookedness and incompetence behind all the wall street and corporate shenanigans of the last decade, doesn't it?You must keep an open mind while reading but I promise you, the best place to hide a conspiracy is to do it right in front of you.If you care about your constitutional rights, you will read this book today."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"When I first read this book - I had only just begun looking at the banking system and how it worked. My knowledge extended a bit past CNBC - but not much. I found it understandable and enjoyable. Since my original read (about 3 years ago) I have read it again and bought a second copy to loan out - I don't want to lose my original. I'm not sure Joe Average could simply pick it up and be enthralled, but if you have an interest in the banking system - this is a great book - even if you have little background in the subject."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"You can read the other reviews for synopsis and overviews. This is a must read and should be required reading for all Americans. It is a well researched and footnoted exposition on the Federal Reserve and far more. Griffin goes into fascinating asides regarding the origins of money and banking and the ways that bankers have instigated wars while supporting both sides. This book should be of great interest to those who enjoy either history, finance, foreign affairs, mystery or politics and answers many questions as to why the \\"world\\" is as it is today. The first 50 pages are a little slow and then it reads like a detective novel. It could even be argued that it's one's duty to read this book."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book has a very clear explanation of our money system, and the Federal Reserve in particular. Anyone can understand it because it is not cloaked in terms that belong only to the world of economic study. It also explains how our financial system has been greatly weakened by a small group of very wealthy people to their own advantage. The truth in it is undisputable. Any American citizen who votes should consider this a \\"must read\\"."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I have read several books on the problems that our economy and monetary system is going through today. This book takes you through the history of money and politics behind the Federal Reserve and The World Bank. If you want to understand how we got into this mess and how we should get out of it, this book is for you. A word of warning, it is going to scare you. The Creature is very engrained in our system and it is not going to be easy to get it out, if at all."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"It took me 5 years of independent research to arrive at the same conclusions. Could it really be possible? That practically the whole planet and everything on it (including ourselves) is owned lock, stock and barrel by a tiny group of people while the rest of us struggle our whole lives just to carry on filling their pockets? In the whole of that time, as I peeled away layer after layer of the truth, I thought I was mad or paranoid. What a relief to find my conclusions confirmed so thoroughly, not only by G. Edward Griffin but by the likes of Murray Rothbard & Ludwig Von Mises among others. Herein you will find the simple solution to all the world's major man-made problems; war, famine, social unrest, dishonest politicians and unjust political systems. How unfortunate that nothing will change until it's far, far, far too late, and how tragic that most people, when presented with this story, will automatically react exactly as they've been programmed to react: \\"Conspiracy theory!\\"\\"Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of a pen they will create enough money to buy it back again. However, take away from them the power to create money, and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear, and they OUGHT to disappear, for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money.\\" - Sir Josiah Stamp, former Director of the Bank of England.\\"We are grateful to the Washington Post, the NY Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But now the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards world government. The supra national sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries.\\" - David Rockefeller, at the 1991 Bilderbergers meeting, Baden-Baden, Germany."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"If you, like me, believe that the truth doesn't always makes sense, but the WHOLE TRUTH usually does, then you will appreciate and value this well researched, carefully written work by G.E. Griffin. Even so, this is just the tip of a much bigger iceberg, but for anyone who wants to know why the working class has to work so hard, just to go backwards, you will find out a very definitive answer in this book. This book is a must have for any TRUTH SEEKER fighting for facts in an age of profiteering deceipt. If you are new to economics, please read \\"Whatever Happened To Penny Candy\\" by Richard J. Maybury and Jane A. Williams first and you will know more than than most politicians.

Unfortunately the author misses the boat by blaming socialism. First he has no idea what socialism actually is. This could have been avoided by simply picking up a dictionary. And the failed \\"socialist\\" reforms and investments he references were actually frauds perpetrated on the receiving countries by free market capitalists. See \\"Confessions of an Economic Hitman\\" and \\"The Shock Doctrine.\\" The IMF and World Bank exist to give bad loans to developing countries so those countries will default and be forced to implement free market reforms and give up rights to natural resources. He also throws in a few references to the magic of the free market being able to fix everything but gives ABSOLUTELY NO justification for why that would happen.So in summary there is a lot of good information but this is the most naive author I have ever read. But either way the Federal Reserve, IMF, and World Bank need abolished."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"If you have always wondered why there are recessions, depressions, booms and busts in the economies of the world this book gives insight into what is going on behind the scenes. You will be told what you may not know about the paper money that we use- that it is essentially worthless. This book takes you back to the formation of the Federal Reserve System which put the United States economy under the control of a Central Bank and the taxpayers as the \\"lender of last resort\\" by having the citizens pay for the schemes of these Central Bankers with inflation. Although the author doesn't draw the parallel to what God in His Word predicted over 2000 or more years ago- a one world government and economic system which will give a coming world ruler control over every man, woman, and child, nevertheless this control over our money is going to make it easy for this to come about. See Revelation 13 for how this will play out."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I treat my books like they are my children- and I know you shouldn't pick favorites- but this is by far my favorite book that wasn't divinely inspired.Griffin is meticulous in footnotes and citations- which I verified a number of them as being accurate. Though the topic can seem intimidating- the book reads as easy as conversation- but not condescendingly.Between this book and \\"Tragedy & Hope\\" by Carroll Quigley- it should be quite obvious to the reader that strange things are afoot in our dear Republic.Griffin's predictions for the future course of the world- entitled \\"A Pessimistic Scenario\\"- is shocking at how close he is to what is currently happening in our economy today. In terms of bailing out banks & large corporations. Giving more power to the Fed- which has recently been discussed by the Obama admin. By giving more money to the IMF- as of last week they were given a few billion. The coming civil \\"opportunities\\" which will eventually turn into mandatory service of the young. ie- Read Rahm Emmanuel's \\"The Plan.\\"In other words ladies & gents- we're screwed and the tentacles have gone too deep. Hold on, the next few years are going to be a bumpy ride."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Thank you Griffin for explaining this to \\"We, the People.\\" If only our congress would read this book. The scary part is that we are all paying for the printing of money through inflation. This is a hidden tax that especially affects the poor and middle class."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"The information in this book, and the ramifications of that information, are literally mind-boggling. Griffin is a good writer, and the story he relates is on a par with Tom Clancy or Robert Ludlum. The difficulty lies in the fact that it is, most unfortunately, not fiction. What Griffin documents is unquestionably the most incredible scam in history. It is, at the same time, fascinating, enraging, and terrifying. Read this and understand why, in the middle of the Civil War, Lincoln stated that he feared the bankers more than the Confederate army, and why so many of our Founding Fathers warned about the bankers gaining control of our currency. If you want to know what's behind the curtain -- who's really pulling the strings -- read this book. Unless, of course, you value your sleep and your sanity."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Every American that can read, should read this book! If you think you know anything about history, politics or economics, you DON'T, until you read this. Jekyll Island is not a boring text book but a fascinating, easy to read explanation of how our govt. and financial system really works and why it must be changed. It explains the financial disaster we are experiencing, even though it was written decades ago. This is not a 'conspiracy theory' but a resuscitation of facts and historical events that are well know and easily ascertained anywhere.

It is revealing, informative, and describes in understandable terms what our politicians are doing to destroy our monetary system, because they do not have the backbone to make the tough,reasonable choices that would make us a strong economy/nation. Others (politicians) are more sinister and want to sabotage our democratic republic type of government (and the Constitution) to replace it with socialism,the same failed system in Russia, Europe, and China. In that system only those in the ruling elite do well; the common citizen is impoverished. One of the few truthful statements made by President Obama is that he wants to redistribute the wealth (as he said to Joe the plumber); we will all be taxed to equal poverty. His advisors are trying to collapse our present system by overloading it and creating their idea of utopia (socialism). The Fed is a consortium of private banks that operate for their benefit; it creates fiat money and devalues our currency. Inflation and reduced purchasing power will be the inevitable result. We are headed for economic disaster and this book helps to explain why.

Best money I ever spent."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book is far superior to any other book which I have read on this or any related topic. So much so, in fact, that I consider it to be one of the best books, if not the best book, of any kind that I have ever read. High praise indeed, but well deserved.The book is so profound, in fact, that I now find myself questioning virtually everything I was ever taught about America's political, financial, and economic systems; as well as its \\"leaders\\" both past and present. And, as a result of this book: I now listen to our so-called \\"leaders\\" and pundits with a new ear tuned to \\"deception,\\" since it is now clear to me that few of them have any real understanding what they are talking about, while those who do are simply telling the American people what they want them to believe.Virtually all other books which I have read on the subjects of this book begin with the immediate events leading up to the collapse of the housing bubble and the resulting economic crisis of 2008, and proceed to suggest what might occur after that crisis and what one might be able to do to protect him or her self. This book, originally published in 1994, but recently updated and now in its fifth edition and 28th printing, goes far beyond that. It gives its readers a historical look inside America's political, financial, and economic systems --- the systems which set the United States up for the crisis of 2008 and all its other crises down through the years. And, as you will learn by reading the book, these crises were by no means accidental.If you read the verbatim reprint of Chapter 25, as contained in this book and as originally published in 1994, (pages 537-564) you will also have to agree that, based on his understanding of America's political, financial, and economic systems, this author accurately predicted virtually everything that has happened in the United States since the turn of the 21st Century; including the crisis of 2008; the bailouts of the \\"banks too big to fail;\\" the impending collapse of the U.S. dollar; the ongoing environmental hoax; and the push for a one world socialist government, a new global currency, and a \\"New World Order.\\" --- and these, too, were no accidents.You will learn a great deal by reading this book: perhaps more than you may really want to know, since the book tells a frightening story. But if you do read it, and it is an easy read, you will then have a clear and precise understanding of exactly how this country---and, equally importantly, the Federal Reserve System (America's Central Bank)---operate and how and why they have conspired to destroy the United States of America as it was founded and have pushed and are pushing it, and the entire world, toward a one-world socialist utopia controlled by the world's great banking empires."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book should be required reading for every AMERICAN. Richard Nixon really screwed us when he took us off the gold standard and allowed the BANKS to control our monetary system. Even as far back as Thomas Jefferson, educated people were aware that it was not in the best interests of the country, to allow banks to control our currency. This book explains why!"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"J. Edward Griffin patiently takes the reader through the origins of trade, of the development of money, the development of Central Banking, the fight to keep the US from being controlled by big banks, the thrusts that preceded the Federal Reserve, the formation of the banking/government cartel we call the Federal Reserve System, the increasing power of the Federal Reserve, and the impacts that currency manipulation have had on our freedom, our economy and on the life expectancy of our country as a democratic republic. Griffin gives an excellent account of the story, together with many references that support his account.Every citizen who is at all concerned with the boom/bust cycles and ever-increasing deficits should read this. See also, \\"End the FED\\", by Ron Paul, \\"Secrets of the Temple\\" by William Greider, and \\"The Secrets of the Federal Reserve\\" by Eustace Mullins. Also, I have a blog, [...] for your continuing conversation on this and related topics."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Ed Griffin's style of writing is really what makes this book so great. He makes learning about a topic that seems very boring seem very interesting. The downside to that is you will learn how the system really works, and you will probably become so angry that you can't help but get involved to try to change things.The book seems long, but actually reads pretty fast after about the first 100 pages (when you first start reading it's like - ok, where you going with all of this?). How the world works is surprisingly complex (go figure), but this book simplifies it to the point that if you understand basic politics you'll be able to put the pieces together pretty quickly. It's funny how this book made sense of everything. Before I read it, politics was just a mess; it seemed like things just randomly happened and the govt. was working to make it right. Now I have very different perspective on things. If you're ready to turn your world upside-down, read this book."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"The author does a remarkable job on a subject which is tough to grasp. Although well annotated, one occasionally wonders whether Griffin's agenda is a bit overstated, but this didn't detract from the message: that is.... the deck has been stacked against the masses for a century. If you've ever wondered who really pulls the strings in America (or for that matter, the world) this book is a great learning experience. You'll never feel the same about bankers after reading this book. An article in \\"Atlantic\\" magazine recently discussed the subject of how the bankers came to the position of running the US government, but it didn't have the required depth for understanding. This book delivers, yet it makes one angry."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Shines a whole new light on war and the financial masters we fight it for."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This will let you understand money a lot about why the world is the way it is.

I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of how our economy developed into the state it is now as well as to plan for the future. It gives me chills to think that some of our greatest leaders could have commited the acts documented here. This should be required reading for anyone wanting to get out of the rat race.Why only four stars then? Even as an avid reader and fascinated by the material, this book is very, very long. I read it from cover to cover, and don't regret it, however a lot of people were intimidated by the size and subject just looking at it. Based on that, I recommend using the author's guidelines for getting the most from the material without being overwhelmed.Bottom line: If you don't like where the economy is or your role within it, you need to read this book."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This is a well researched analysis of the Federal Reserve Bank and the goals and motives of it's founders."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I have done lots of research on this subject and I think that \\"the Creature From Jekyll Island\\" is one of the most accurate, thorough, and informative books on the Federal Reserve topic. Most Americans still believe today that the Federal Reserve bank is a Federal Institution operated by their government. In order to dispel this deception, it is vital for every American to read \\"The Creature From Jekyll Island\\" and to learn about the people that control every aspect of their financial and economic livelihood. This book is a wonderful historical piece of evidence about betrayal, manipulation, greed, corruption, abuse of power, and narcissism. This book will educate the reader about the history of money, the birth of the Federal Reserve bank, and the beginning of the privatization of the United Stated financial and political institutions. This is not a book about conspiracy, but a research about facts and the legitimization process of the elitist power.

I'm no extremist, but I have to tell you, it could make you change your mind about how America really works, and it IS INDEED Extreme.If you can't take the heat, leave this one alone, if you want some serious information, READ IT, you won't be let down.I would like to see my entire family read this book."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Everyone MUST read this book, especially Americans. This book shows how the US Federal Reserve manages the US currency, which is the reserve currency of the world. It shows that a shocking reality behind the smokescreen of big words and lofty speeches. The short answer is that the US dollar has a fatal flaw - it is not backed by Gold, and history shows this ALWAYS ends in tears. It is a huge lesson in how currencies work.On the downside, Griffin reveals he has a big Right wing political bias. He talks of concerns about the enrivonment as based on &quot;doubtful evidence&quot;. He talks of social welfare as though it was some form of economic terrorism. He naiively thinks that the UN will takeover the US if there is a world banking crisis, forgetting that the UN will dissappear much faster than US banks if that happens.However, his political bias aside, this is a MUST READ book, especially the chapter on how money works.

The Elites who really run things are so wealthy and powerful that it's their world now. The system is so corrupt and entrenched that it turns my stomach. I am glad to be debt-free and that my husband and I will never make any more bankers richer; however, inflation is eating away at everything that we have and the government doesn't report the real inflation numbers at all.

However, at this point it will suffice to say that this book should be required reading for every high school student in the country.Completing a four year business degree in finance, as I did, does not begin to provide as full an understanding of our financial system as this work does in a brief 600 pages.Read this book, understand the way the world works."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"The $700+ billion financial bailouts by the Fed in recent weeks underscores the concerns documented by the excellent research of Mr. Griffin. While not the first to identify such trends, Griffin does the best job I've seen in clearly communicating the history leading up to the current fiscal/credit crises. As a practicing economist, I appreciate the the role banks and the fed play in a developing economy, but there needs to be regulations on money creation so that we are not slaves to imperialistic taxation and inflation, under the guise of democracy and capitalism. Are there any real leaders in America that understand or care where this ship of American Dreams is heading, or have all leaders been hopelessly co-opted by the System?

Without the sidetrips into his own political positions the author would have a more compelling book. These things may or may not be true (he does cite references for all of it) but the story would be easier to take in without them. The information presented on the main topic is important, and G. Edward Griffin has done a fine job compiling it. The research put into the volume was obviously substantial, and like many readers it has caused me to do further research into the topic of monetary reform.A more modern version of the story with much less ideological baggage can be found in Ellen Hodgson Brown's The Web of Debt, which is more recent (2007), is less scholastic in presentation style, and is mercifully more concise and an easier read. It presents a more compelling case with much of the same information but boiled down to eliminate some of the spurious details but is still a gripping read.WEB OF DEBT: The Shocking Truth About Our Money System -- The Sleight of Hand That Has Trapped Us in Debt and How We Can Break FreeA good overview of the history of money and its current issues can be found in Bernard Lietaer's The Future of Money (or El Futuro Del Dinero, if you don't want to spend $250+ on the English version).For a good proposal on monetary reform building on a more realistic and populist basis, see Michael Rowbotham's The Grip of Death.For those of you not inclined to plow through a book the size of Griffins', watch \\"The Money Masters\\" on Google video."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"THE CREATURE FROM JEKYLL ISLAND is a fascinating look into the history of the United States Federal Reserve system and the power brokers who created, funded and have profited from it. CREATURE reads more like a suspense novel than a history or economics tour de force. Griffin gives a riveting, behind-the-scenes glimpse into the people and politics of America's economy.Griffin details the history of the secret meetings, the dark conspiracies and powerful families who created and drove the federal banking system, manipulating the system for their own profit. Conspiracy theorists will regard CREATURE as their proof text. And this fellow makes many good points. You don't have to swallow everything he writes hook, line and sinker to learn a great deal from the book.Griffen defines money in four forms:1. Commodity money (silver coins or gold pieces)2. Receipt money (paper money backed by 100% by gold or silver reserves)3. Fractional money (paper money partially backed by gold or silver reserves)4. Fiat money (paper money not backed by precious metals and required to use by decree)In the United States of America, we are living in the age of fiat money. The American dollar has no intrinsic value. Our currency is no longer backed by gold or silver but is the recognized and required by the federal government as legal tender. In fact, our money is backed by no assets; it is backed by debt. The U.S. money supply is simply created out of thin air by the Federal Reserve for Congress to spend as it wishes with no regard for its value, supply, or repayment.The operating schemes of unlimited supplies of money, unlimited spending, and increasing national debt, suit the purposes of those who profit from it: the banks which sponsor and broker the activity. One wonders, then why taxes are necessary at all. Griffen maintains that taxes serve two purposes:1. To fool the public into believing it is paying for government spending and2. To enable social planners (socialists) to wage war on the middle classThe nature of evil is the impulse to power over others. And this struggle is all about power and control. At this time in history, the greatest problem is the growing dependence of more and more citizens on their friendly, motherly federal government. \\"When people can vote on issues involving the transfer of wealth to themselves from others, the ballot box becomes a weapon with which the majority plunders the minority.\\"The final piece of this long and fascinating conspiracy against the citizenry requires a central government unrestrained. This requires a war. The war of choice for the present leadership is the environmental movement. Several years ago, Griffen predicated that \\"fraudulent scientific studies\\" would fuel the politicians' appetite for an enemy. The threat of doom would empower the central government to seize the leverage it needed to socialize the economy and lead the public into a doomsday scenario. Couple with failing banks and bailout of private industries, the politicians and back-room power brokers would seize the opportunity to destroy the greatest asset of a people and free markets: their freedom. How could Griffen know this many years before the Great Recession of 2008 and Copenhagen 15?"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"The most powerful book I've ever read.

Finally a book that does. But more powerfully it's a book that uncovers some deep and, at many points, disturbing issues relating to the creation and controll of money. And without complicated maths or econometric-type diagrames etc - it is written for the non-professional.Some might wish to criticise the author for coming at things from a very 'right wing/conspiracy theory' corner of the board, but he makes it quite explicit he is doing so, which I appreciated, and it can be read with that in mind. (It's the ones whose agenda is hidden you have to watch).In my view, a must read for anyone working on Wall Street, in a bank, advising clients about investment, or anyone who cares to understand how the world we live in works.Lastly, even if the world of finance is not your thing, I particularly enjoyed the author's skill at unpacking an issue, laying it bare in easilly understood bite-sized bits, and re-constructing the elements in a logical, considered manner.

While most of us would argue that the \\"FED\\" has done a pretty lousy job of managing our money supply, the truth is that it has worked perfectly for the people who designed and those who now benefit from it. This is a great adjunct to \\"Economic Hitmen\\" and \\"Zeitgeist\\" for those who haven't yet caught up to the fact that the vast majority of Americans are effectively slaves to our present financial system.The only problem with this book is that while it provides an excellent understanding of how our financial system works, or doesn't work, depending on your perspective, it seems pretty obvious to me that the powerful elements who benefit from it will use all of their immense power to retain this tool of financial and political destruction.The world is in for a great deal of very tough sledding in the next decade.I do have some interesting ideas on how some of us can likely gain from what is happening which I will share with anyone interested.

Mr. Griffin weaves a convincing tapestry of information depicting how much of the world is controlled by a few ruling elite.

There are MANY reviews already written about this book and I doubt I can add any further insight except to say that I am infinitely impressed with the Author and his ability to make 500+ pages of a subject like finance, read like a non stop action mystery thriller. Unfortunately for us, it's NOT fiction and I don't recommend reading it during the holidays (as I did).

The wealth and power of these people are beyond anyone's imagination. They do not even appear on rich lists (Forbes, etc), as their fortunes would make Carlos Slim, Bill Gates or Warren Buffet look like hobbits. When one controls the means of money creation and owns most of the world's debt, the game is over. They own the gameboard and everything within it.Griffin provides a good historical perspective, going all the way back to the first US Colonies and their struggle for currency stability and how to curb inflation. The problem is not new! It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.Reading the book, one can finally understand the \\"Mandrake Mechanism\\" behind the US Federal Reserve monetary model and policies.The book was first written in 1994 and its predictions remained amazingly accurate.The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 was another case of History repeating itself, only with bigger and bigger numbers.

There's no doubt in my mind, that if the majority of Americans and even the majority of Congress members were aware and educated on all of the information provided by Griffin in this incredibly well-documented book, that heads would literally be rolling.Amazing account of how the creature happened, what the creature is, and how the creature has robbed everything the middle class has worked for creating the largest gap between rich and poor out of any country in the industrialized world.

Prompt mailing."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I believe all those things that were already within my knowledge and are recited here. I have no doubt that all money in the banking system is created out of loans. I know many examples of western countries maintaining a war only because paper money was available to them. I buy the argument that we are incapable of exercising monetary self-discipline in a paper system.But there is a huge amount of other new information and Mr Griffin's problem is data overload. Getting a sufficiency of his argument into my mind to establish the case he is making means this book cannot be read, even chapter by chapter. More or less every paragraph requires deliberation and, as the subject matter really requires a revolutionary response, its not a pleasant read.Its hardly surprising that Wikipedia has shot itself in the foot in trashing Mr Griffin - they simply could not handle the volume of data he supplies.In linking-up the history of the Fed, Mr Griffin has exposed himself to the accusation of being a conspiracy-theorist - its implicit in his hostile Wikipedia bio mentioned earlier. Real life is not like that. In my experience something happens and people recognise it creates an opportunity and take it. Its not precisely an endless conspiracy rather than an endless awareness of opportunity and, as money is our own creation, it is unsurprising that we recognise the chances that change offers. Perhaps Wikipedia Editors will think about that too.Mr Griffin is single-track in seeing monetary policy defining all government policy. Perhaps he is right - he has certainly amassed considerable persuasive data. He restates the old British misunderstanding of equality, the British principles argument in the wars with revolutionary France and Napoleon, which is, I think, unsupportable. His causes of WWI are too narrowly focused for my liking. And he asserts that several politicians publicly opposed the moneymen whilst actually supporting them - that is hard to swallow. These aspects may permit his critics to query his commitment to the whole truth.What he does make clear is that in any system of government, decisions are ultimately made and packaged by very few people and democracy has no remedy for that - one ultimately trusts that power-holders are \`fit and proper' chaps. We might reasonably call back the aristocracy to power - at least they were tutored to it and published the principles that defined their actions.This is one of those books that is likely to be hooted away by the pundits until historians throw it back at us decades later when the system it describes has unravelled. There is unlikely to be a world-ranking authority endorsing it. The economist Ron Paul promoted it but his Presidential campaign failure has diminished the value of that endorsement.We should try to be more straight-forward with knowledge, particularly unpleasant knowledge such as this book abounds in. There are no heroes here, excepting President Jackson. In their absence we have amusing writing - Chapter 22 is headed \\"The Creature swallows Congress.\\"I guess Mr Griffin has spent a huge amount of his time in preparing this work. There is much factual reporting that may be readily corroborated. He has ordered the information he has gleaned and provided summaries at end of each chapter. Its worth a couple of PhDs (history and economics) in my estimation.I wish Mr Griffin had not written the last two chapters - his pessimistic and realistic prophecies for the future - or at least contained them in an Afterword somewhat separate from the rest of the book. Any forecast of the future is bound to be wrong - we are incompetent at it. By incorporating these speculations in the work I think he overstepped himself.Nevertheless, I think Mr Griffin's work requires a response from central bank governors and Treasury Secretaries. It is an indictment of our monetary system and they should defend themselves. I should like to hear what the operators of our monetary system have to say. I hope they will not say the subject is too complicated for little people. Such a reply or the absence of any response will tend to reinforce my belief that Mr Griffin has got it right in broad terms."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book is not main stream. Its critics would probably call it the radical theories of a \\"gold bug.\\" A more \\"establishment\\" answer to the criticisms brought up in this book can be found in Galbraith's - Money, From Whence It Came and Where It Went.This book is structured very well. It is easy to read and very persuasive but if you are like me, after you finish this book you will have more questions than you have answers.The book makes some good points; on the other hand it promotes many fantasies.Mr. Griffin could be right on many things but his answers for the most part would not make things better - but worse in my opinion.The solution to the MONEY problem are more complicated than the answers that are supplied here. This book is a good book to buy and to read but one must read it very critically - very critically.Books written by Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I have no dispute with the facts in this book, but with its theory. Noble metals (gold and silver) to back currency are as much an illusion as anything else. Consider the example of having a chest of gold on board the Titanic - which is worth more, the gold and silver or a seat on a lifeboat?Now, let's put that into contemporary terms: which is worth more, gold and silver, or fresh water and clean fuel?Hopefully, this is simple enough to get the point across trenchantly. Don't be deceived by the \\"noble metal\\" illusion. These are all just commodities like anything else. Any good or service can be used to back up money because money is just a token for the exchange value of transactions. The total supply of money is worth exactly what you can trade with it - no more, no less.Now, let's look at what has been done with all the fancy instruments invented for \\"hedges\\". They boil down to a simple linear equation: y = ax + b. This is also the equation for linear regression of a set of data points with b equal to the average deviation, or error term. Traders make money by exploiting the spread. Derivatives are simply bets on bets. If someone buys a stock, they bet on success of a firm. If someone bets against the firm, then there is a zero sum game. Except, if the bets against the firm exceed the bets for the firm, then if the firm fails, who pays off the bets? That's when markets collapse completely. Go back and look at the stats - derivatives exceeded the value of underlying assets.Worse, exotic instruments were created to bet on the bets on bets. These are \\"derivatives\\" in the sense of calculus. In calculus, the derivative is the formula for the slope of a curve. It's a way to make volatility linear. Mathematically, you can substitute nonlinear factors into the simple linear equation to get the \\"instantaneous\\" result - which is a market transaction at a moment in time. High velocity trading simply does this even faster by going to second, third, fourth, etc. \\"derivatives\\". Meanwhile, the integral of the curve is the area under the curve (asset value) down to the abscissa (x axis). The error term \\"b\\" is also known as the y-intercept - that's where the linear regression line crosses the y axis. Smart traders know they can make money in up or down markets because the absolute value of the integral is what the game is about - just do \\"negative\\" transactions to counterbalance \\"positive\\" transactions (e.g., short sales).Hopefully, the message should be sinking in. These are sophisticated forms of the \\"theft\\" accomplished by simple inflation, which is the bankers' game as long as they can charge unbridled (i.e., \\"usurious\\") interest, as became the case after banking laws were \\"reformed\\" to eliminate the protections built in during the Great Depression. Now, my only point in this discussion is to make the point that gold and silver don't solve the real problem of money manipulation - and don't create value when there is no real social production of basic goods and services - the resources and provisions for social survival (see Bucky Fuller's Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth and his story of the Great Sea Pirates, along with his definition of \\"wealth\\").Look at what the real competition is over today: control of energy markets and access to fresh water. Money can be run as a \\"debt\\" instrument or an \\"asset\\" instrument - whether banking is privately owned (which is a violation of the explicit language of the U.S. Constitution) or publicly owned (the way it was supposed to be - but every President who seriously tried to do something about that died in office).So, my point is: read this book, but go beyond its analysis to the deeper truth. We could use the internet to create a completely alternate currency (exactly what is being done in some online \\"game\\" forums already), and that would work just fine - as long as the internet can be \\"trusted\\". That's just a higher speed form of Federal Reserve \\"trust\\" (or, manipulation, depending). But, since the internet - a government invention - is like the Federal Reserve - now privately \\"owned\\" - what do you think the prospects are?As for gold and silver - remember the Hunt brothers? Physical commodities can always be physically manipulated in markets. Remember the \\"Oil Embargo\\"? The Big Oil Companies played shell games on the high seas - trading in the fuels on-board ships without ever landing the product, until the price was jacked up enough - exactly like \\"flipping\\" in the housing market. Any commodity (including gold and silver) can be manipulated this way. Besides, what good would it do in a vault? Gold is key to electronics these days.The better long-run strategy for sustainability is to localize economies while globalizing currencies. Trade between collective entities externally. Internal economies have different scales of value - which is why purchasing power parity is a more important measure of a society's real wealth than GDP and similar measures. At the extreme, any society that can operate self-sufficiently is buffered against currency illusion. The economics show that total value can be increased through trade, but commonsense also shows that depending on potentially hostile partners for supply is stupid (like the U.S. buying helicopter parts for military planes from China).But, the public is kept ignorant, hostile to truth, and docile to exploitation. We reject \\"socialism\\" for instance without question - even when in specific cases it works. The point of any situation is to base it on reality, not ideology and illusion. Markets have their place - as in local groceries - but there are such things as natural monopolies - e.g., energy, medical care, and the like. By the way, medical care is not health care. Health care costs nothing but good sense (a scarce commodity), while medical care depends on mass production of things like pharmaceuticals controlled by large manufacturers. My grandfather, an old country doctor, pointed out to me years ago why he never prescribed what he called \\"patent medicines\\" (patented to control the profits). He was taught in the earlier days when doctors learned pharmacology to individually tailor dosages based on specific reactions of individuals, not statistical results of populations. Statistically, a lot of people will die in large populations due to the same linear equation used for money: it's a function of the \\"error\\" or distance from the line of regression that is either your health, or your probability of healing from illness.Hopefully, by now, you can figure out how statistics have been used as the instrument of oppression in the massification of the culture and economy. Go to school and get statistically stratified into social, occupational, and other forms of \\"class\\" by your IQ or other psychometric. Pretend this is valid. Accept it as truth (little \\"g\\" is \\"good\\" for you!). Now, apply statistics to all populations that modern management science can manipulate - for the buying and selling of labor, goods, services, and most of all, your freedom. Remember that banking is nothing but the buying and selling of money (there's a paradox). Money itself is the ultimate derivative because, even nominally backed by some commodity (it doesn't matter which commodity), in a \\"normal\\" economy, there will always be more money in circulation than commodity backing it. That's because money always has a \\"velocity\\" (the number of times it changes hands during any given period). Absent velocity, we're back to simple barter of actual goods and services. That's the pure level of subsistence and sustainability.I have, of course, simplified this discussion to ignore all of the bionomics of nature - e.g., greenhouse emissions and exhaustion of natural and other resources by over-consumption or mismatch of population, technology, and nature based on the cultural behaviors - but the point should be pretty clear. \\"The truth shall set you free.\\""},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book is about more than the Federal Reserve. It is about more than our banking system. It is about more than fiat money and inflation steeling wealth from the people.

Unfortunately the author misses the boat by blaming socialism. First he has no idea what socialism actually is. This could have been avoided by simply picking up a dictionary. And the failed \\"socialist\\" reforms and investments he references were actually frauds perpetrated on the receiving countries by free market capitalists. See \\"Confessions of an Economic Hitman\\" and \\"The Shock Doctrine.\\" The IMF and World Bank exist to give bad loans to developing countries so those countries will default and be forced to implement free market reforms and give up rights to natural resources. He also throws in a few references to the magic of the free market being able to fix everything but gives ABSOLUTELY NO justification for why that would happen.So in summary there is a lot of good information but this is the most naive author I have ever read.

The author documents how the Rothschild family and their Federal Reserve lackeys in America have bought off governments, started wars - while funding both sides of the conflicts THEY create and subsequently profit from these planned conflicts. These people ARE genocidal psychopaths who will do anything and stop at nothing so that they might make more money. These people are nothing more than bottomless pits of soulless shells who attempt to fill their empty existences with the money THEY create out of thin air money in order to make themselves feel better about their sick selves.

What about the UN? Why can democrats and republicans appear to be on different sides of many issues yet when one or the other gets into office some of the most important issues (many not even discussed during the campaign) march forward as if it didn't matter which one was elected? How bad is our currency, really?Who is to blame, bankers or government?Read the book and find out. This is truly an incredibly important read not because of the opinions expressed but because of the primary source quotes and annotations and the logical cohesion sewn into every chapter.It's one thing to express an opinion, write a book around it, and sell copies. This is not that kind of book. This book traces the history of banking and paper money starting hundreds of years ago when goldsmiths kept gold in their vaults for customers in exchange for paper receipts and continues through to the creation of European central banks, the Fed, and the Bretton-Woods Accord.But it's not a boring dry read filled with banker babble. It reads more like a horror story than anything (a horror story that is true!). And you won't walk away from this book an anti-capitalist. In fact, I am the most ardent capitalist I know (that's saying a lot) and I finished this book and almost cried. We have done some absolutely horrible things to our currency--the life blood of our economy. All we wanted our government to do was guard our liberties and leave us alone. We have lives of our own we'd like to lead. But our government and the world's largest bankers have taken advantage of our innocent nature--our blind eye to inflation and collusion at the highest levels. They have taken advantage of what little trust we have in them and have used that trust to destroy entire nations through influence, debt, and war all with our tacit approval. We are guilty because we allowed it to happen. We failed to watch every SINGLE move our elected officials made over the past hundred plus years. And while we weren't watching, while we weren't educating ourselves on the labyrinthine banking architecture being built right in front of our faces they inflated our wealth, our savings, and our future away. All of it. And they destroyed nations in the process. And the United States, being the most prosperous nation in the history of the world will crumble because we never saw it coming.But I must be wrong! We have money now, right? We can save now, right? We've made it through economic downturns before and we'll make it through this one, right?Time. Time reveals the lie that has been sold to us. Read the book and find the truth.Griffin has written one of the most excellent and accessible histories of the Federal Reserve System. He backs it up with stunning and sometimes appalling first hand quotes from original sources (not from sophomoric and professorial interpretations of sources). He gets them straight from the horse's mouth and compiles them in an easy to read tome and sews it all together with solid logic. This is the way the world works folks.All we wanted was to be left alone. But that is not possible now. You must read this book to find the truth because you won't find it on TV or in the main stream news or in a PBS special. When you finish the book you'll know WHY."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"It took me about an hour to read the convenient chapter summaries of this book, and then I was hooked! I went back and read the thing from cover to cover, taking extensive detours to check out the source materials. And the whole horror story appears to be true! Honestly, I had very little understanding of the banking system or the role of the Federal Reserve before I picked up this book, and it has been a revelation. I'm just hoping enough people will read this so that maybe we can put a stop to the Federal Reserve and all of their associates in the World Bank, the IMF, et al, in time to save ourselves from perpetual debt slavery."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I read a borrowed copy of this book. When I finished it, I had to have my own copy.This book is a historical account of the creation and subsequent operations of the Federal Reserve System. I had read other books that contained portions of this story. This is the first book I have seen that lays out the whole scheme from its conception to the present.While reading this book, I had to stop every twenty minutes or so because I became too angry to continue reading. The person from whom I borrowed the book had a similar experience. It is not a pleasant experience to discover that you've been had.The Federal Reserve Bank is not actually part of the U.S. government. It actually has no reserves. And it is not really a bank. But it is entitled to print currency. What you have in your wallet is a Federal Reserve Note, which is not actually issued by the U.S. government. The Fed actually does two things which Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution empowers only Congress to do: It borrows money on the credit of the United States, and it effectively coins money and regulates the value thereof.I won't spoil a reader's experience by giving away a lot of the details told in this book. Suffice it to say that the story is that of the response of Wall Street and the investment bankers of the western world to the Panic of 1907, which nearly ruined many of them.The United States has been through the same process before. The contest between President Jackson and Nicholas Biddle's Second Bank of the United States was about the same issues the Federal Reserve System poses for the country. President Jackson won that battle. We may not win it this time around.By the way, the act of Congress that created the Fed was passed in December of 1913 as Congress was rushing to adjourn for the Christmas holidays. Sound familiar?If you have read Ron Paul's \\"End The Fed\\", that book gives an overview of the same story told in \\"The Creature\\". You might want to read Paul's book before you tackle this one."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"The Creature from Jekyll IslandA ReviewThe recent release of G. Edward Griffin's 5th-Edition of this 600-page volume is a welcome addition to the numerous republishing of his work spanning several years. Updated to reflect conditions as we find them in 2010 this issue is as topical today as it was when first published.Unfortunately, few Americans and other citizens of the World have a thorough knowledge of the machinations that surround the creation and operations of Central Banks in general or the US Federal Reserve Bank in particular. In numerous instances, and in variable form attributed to various historical personages, the concept that whom-so-ever controls your currency controls your destiny. This is no less sanguine today than it has been throughout recorded economic history.The author hones in on the US Federal Reserve Bank (which is neither Federal in scope, a Reserve in any honest interpretation, or a Bank in the true sense of the word) and examines how and by whom it was created, for whose benefit to what purpose, and how it has destabilized the economy and lead to any number of unfortunate consequences. The United States has experienced at least four cycles of central banking dating back to pre-revolutionary time; all of which are examined by the author in minute detail. In all instances, including today's current Federal Reserve, this centralization of currency control has proven disastrous. Fiat (paper, counterfeit) money has historically only held sway for, on average, 40-years before it collapses into a ponzi scheme of devaluated worthless currency. Today's US Federal Reserve Bank is no less immune.There have been many volumes written on economic history. Some of which are illuminating but despite their author's best efforts are too abstract to gain the average reader's comprehension. Griffin sweeps away these abstractions and provides a clear-cut explanation of why central banking is a monstrosity that favors the few who are politically connected to the detriment of all others.Those who can be persuaded to extract themselves from a mindless pursuit as to which team has the football, basketball, baseball or hockey puck or who will survive the latest TV \\"reality show\\" Griffin's book is worth a reading.Highly recommended for those who don't have their heads completely stuck in the sand.--30--word count: 378"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. The little side trip into what money really is and how it is literally CREATED OUT OF NOTHING is well worth the price of the book.

For those wishing to understand modern monetary policy and the history of central banking, which is what our privately owned Federal Reserve System is based on, I recommend this highly readable book. One does not have to be an economist or political scientist to understand this thoroughly researched and easy to follow book.If you can manage a household budget you can readily follow this book, as there is no need to understand arcane economic theories or mathematical formulas. This book literally reads like a political thriller, while at the same time educating the reader on what is being done to us by the criminal cartel of private bankers and politicians running our nation. Perhaps the most important book one could read to prepare for what can be expected in the coming four years of an Obama administration. Mind you, Obama is not to blame; this has been going on for the last 100 years. Phony wars and phony foreign aid have been the necessary tools to keep this game in play and ensure that all real wealth is transferred to the top of the pyramid, and is the ultimate tool for furthering the globalist goals of a New World Order.

In reality it's nothing more than a cabal composed of the richest folks in the world who are doing nothing more than looking out for themselves! The author explains how the Fed got its start, how it manipulates the currency to benefit certain segments of the population while plundering the rest, and provides many examples of how the use of fiat money has led to ruin.

After a while I became convinced that the churning of money that went on there was of no value except to satisfy various political hacks. But, I couldn't figure out where the money came from to build the systems, many of which were not needed, or who benefited from the deficit spending needed to build them.So, I made a plan and left the military industrial complex thinking there was need for my skills in the lower middle ranges of the law profession. I became a lawyer. What did I find? In many ways it is similar to what I found in the military industrial complex. Even in the so-called non-profit sector I found politically controlled churning of money to satisfy political connections. And it was clear to me that after 50 years of a so-called war on poverty, the poor seem more dependent than ever before. But, again, I could not find out where the money came from, or who benefited other than politicians.Then I stumbled upon \\"The Creature from Jekyll Island\\". It presents a strong argument that points a finger at who wants all people kept in a state of slavery. You guessed it, the Federal Reserve.We are on a path (if we are not there already) to being serfs living on one giant world-wide plantation, managed by politicians, owned by the various international central banks, marching us towards a \\"new world order\\" of governments of the banks by the banks and for the banks, while we have become a people of the government, by the government, and for the government."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book should be read by everyone. It's amazing that something as important as MONEY is yet one of the least understood things in most peoples lives. Most people have little or no concept of what is is, where it came from, how it's made or why and when. They have it in their pocket, use it every day, treasure it, and sometimes rob or murder for it, yet don't have a clue what it is. This book will not only help you understand what money is, but will help you better understand the world that revolves around it.

I am a strong supporter of Ron Paul but I had usually failed to lack in my arguments due to my lack of information on the current central back (our 4th, 1 before the birth of our nation and then the two banks coined central banks and this one masked as if it were not one). The book gives plenty of examples on the abuses the Federal Reserve has made and ties many events in history (the many rises and falls of certain banks and governments, some wars caused by the Federal Reserve or other similar central banks).

Particularly if you are seeking truth through all the misinformation and distortions on every turn from the mass media and various interest groups. While some reviewers consider it leaning to \\"conspiracy\\" theory in a negative light, as Griffin states...reality supports that it is actually the norm and not the exception. If we can shed the social conditioning of the rosy, fuzzy \\"expert\\" justifications and realize that 1 plus 1 never equals 9, we are well on our way to turning the mess around. No need to be depressed but every reason to get off our tails and get busy. Even if one at a time, we can change this.In years past, had a hobby of poking around and collecting the oldest books I could find. Many facets of what Griffin has covered I have read across 40 years of old texts. Pieces, if you will, written fresh in their times pre and post creation of the Federal Reserve. Most refreshingly, Griffin puts a mountain of facts and details in the most understandable format and has cohesively joined essentially my life's study in the subjects. Once I got the book, I did not want to put it down until I finished. Don't let the 600+ pages scare you! It is well worth your efforts.

Edward Griffin.If you think Congress, the President and the Supreme Court are the main control of the United States think again.Its a big book (608 pages) obviously years of work by Mr Griffin. Finished it in 3 days. A compelling read. Some good pictures too. Its very depressing to see how people are destroyed by the creature. Entire Nations are controlled. Wars deliberately wanted to supply both combatants with supplies, bonds and money flow. Totally disgusting.Its 1910 and 7 of some of the richest men in the world( some say 40% of the worlds wealth) secretly take a private railroad car to Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia to hammer out a cartel to eliminate competition for banking control. We see how the US government becomes a partner with the cartel by congressional vote.Mr Griffin goes back and forth in time (examples the Civil War, the deliberate sinking of the Lusitania) and many more episodes in history to add to information about money flow, gold/silver ratios, inflation destroying everything,making money out of nothing, etc. I can see the reason why he skips back and forth in time to add information for us to understand the monstrous creature.Its a wonderful financial REAL mystery done very well but for me very depressing. I learned hundreds of useful facts. It was well worth reading. The last chapter tells a few things individuals can do to protect themselves and try to stop complete world control. Not much the individual can do. Mr Griffin stresses that large groups must rise up put pressure on Congress to get rid of the Federal Reserve NOW before its too late.A frightening mystery of a real financial creature that must be destroyed! I never have given a 5 star rating to such a depressing book with so many horrible despicable people in control of other peoples lives for profit only. Many had NO national affiliations and wanted war for profit. May these monsters enjoy their stay in hell.In conclusion buy this book. Hope you don't get too depressed reading it. Not a happy face book. Thank you G. Edward Griffin for the enlightenment about the Federal Reserve. The Creature from Jekyll Island a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This is a great book that tells the truth about The Federal Reserve - how it was formed; why it was formed; what it does. Read this and you will understand why our economy is such a mess!!"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"With over 200 reviews, most of what I would say has been covered. I read through all the negative comments, and found plenty of poor opinions but did not find anything with real validity. Many grievances centered around \\"conspiracy theories\\". The author does a commendable job of sighting the numerous sources that propel the story. It doesn't take much to continue the research if you are left with questions.I found the chapters dealing with the Napoleonic period, the Rothschilds, and the Lusitania to be very interesting. As to the whole socialism trip, some people need to get over it. There are plenty of books involving the mega-wealthy supporting or advocating Marx & socialism. And being another instrument of control, why wouldn't we find support in such circles?As to the conspiracy concerns, yes, they are present as they should be. Lets face it, people go into finance to make money. The richest people in the world are proud of achieving/possessing a grotesque and unsustainable imbalance with their fellow citizens, and conveniently label us as \\"consumers\\" or worse, consider us expendable. It attracts some of the worst characters and greed is common. If a group of them are sitting in a room and they see $1m for the taking, to what length would they go to take it? What if $100m was there for the taking? How about billions? It is unfair to be under the illusion that people won't conspire to steal these sums. This book unravels a very insidious plot to control money, and like it or not, the creation of wars is a component.While this is not a comprehensive history of banking, it covers quite a range and delivers it in a very user-friendly format. It is also a very good basic/intro lesson into central banking and reserve currencies. A number of reviews/comments I read seemed to imply the author merely states facts and does not offer opinions. Here I disagree. The book is loaded with great facts from good sources, but at times the author does present an explanation that clearly is based on opinion. Not a big deal.The real value here is the book sheds a lot of light into the world of central banking and currency manipulation. Since this is a complete mystery to most, the book is an excellent first step into understanding today's money game and why we are in such a mess."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Why is our government spending trillions and trillions of dollars on \\"bailouts?\\"If what Edward Griffin and other authors like him are saying is true, many things come clear that otherwise puzzle us \\"average people.\\" The evidence he presents explains:*why the government won't close the borders*why we spend so much in foreign aid*why it seems like we have a one-party political system*why we have inflation*why the media is largely biased towards big government and \\"population control\\"*why our government runs up huge deficits*what rich bankers have to do with wars*what rich bankers have to do with \\"global warming\\"If you read Griffin, it all starts to make sense.

First written in 1994, and reprinted numerous times since then, the second chapter is entitled, \\"The Name of the Game Is Bailout.\\" It is pretty interesting that this author was talking about bailouts long before this recent gigantic, bailout of all bailouts, where everyday we hear about more trillions being paid to banks, AIG, Wall Street,states, General Motors, the list goes on.

He quotes original sources such as Caroll Quigley, the Ivy League Professor and mentor to Bill Clinton who wrote the insider's book that got leaked to the press, \\"Tragedy and Hope.\\" Griffin's book is big, with lots of detail, but you can also simply read the summaries at the end of each chapter and get the main gist in a short length of time.Griffin, Ron Paul and others say we must audit and then abolish the Federal Reserve.

PERIOD. It Needs to be top priority from 5th grade and mandated a written essay in every grade until graduating as a highschool senior. But knowing what I know now, I KNOW this will not happen unless the PRIVATE Federal Reserve aka: The Private Central Bank of America, has been abolished. STILL it would need that much attention so it never happens again.President Andrew Jackson was the first to abolish the first \\"Creature\\" that already had control over Americas money. This one is literally a CREATURE out of control now and may have already eaten all it can!You can also get his Recorded audio presentation from 1994 if you look around (on that other site for very litte). Im sure the book is better. I am thankful to Mr. Griffin for this research and writing. He will write you back if you email him as well.If one finds it unbelievable (a few seem to have), it is for two rasons. 1, because you do not care about your personal money or this country at all. 2 Because you will not allow your mind to accept the truth when it is proven right before your eyes.It is NOT difficult once you get into it. Your eyes will remain glued to find out what happened next. When you get to the end, read it again, just incase you missed something. Not sure how that would happen though.Once you learn this hard, heart breaking truth, you need to watch the DVD... Freedom to Fascism. Next you should watch The Myths of 9-11 (DVD) by David ray Griffin (no relation I dont think). Then find the FREE Interview with Aaron Russo (its the only one that is 69 minutes long). Believe me, there are NO boring moments. Its as scary and real as this book. Then watch 'End Game' DVD. If you google End Game, you can watch it for free if you have cable. Or during FAP Free hours with satellite. Dont try to tackle it with dial up. The final two should be Bohemian Grove - Order of Death (DVD) and then \\"Martial Law\\" (DVD). There are others but with all those, you will understand more than you thought you ever knew. they are ALL documented, some is live footage. The truths behind these studies can NOT be denied as fact. Only if you do not allow your mind to let you accept it. because they are real. and time is SHORT!All these are a must. I think that sequence I mentioned is the correct path to placing everything into the correct perspective. but the contents of THIS BOOK, the Creature from Jekyll Island, certainly MUST be known about and learned FIRST.I hope it is not too late. If you are even CURIOUS. Please dont skip a step that I am mentioning, get this book FIRST! It is hard documented factual and undescribably scary that it has gone on this long without public awareness. It has gone on LONG enough! Kill the Creature! Before it kills you! It is hungry and does NOT stop eating until ALL IS DEVOURED.No matter what, Now that you have read this, YOU MUST TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW! THE SOONER THE BETTER!

I bought this book once the credit crisis became more apparent in early 2008 curious to acquire a different perspective on this secretive institution that was glorified by many of my \\"all knowing\\" finance professors. I read this book and something changed in me, this book without a doubt has changed my entire understanding of how the world works. Not only does this text present the truth about the federal reserve, but it will offer you a whole new understanding of history as well. This is the most shocking, all encompassing analysis written about the root cause of all societies problems, the federal reserve. These central bankers are behind every major war throughout history and as Mr. Griffin proves with overwhelming evidence, these men profit handsomely from these tragic events by funding both sides. With the fed in existence, the USA is no longer a country of the people, for the people, and by the people, it is a country of the institutions, for the institutions, and by the institutions. The largest and more powerful of which is the private Federal Reserve. Everyone on the planet should read this book."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Like all the reviews I agree this book should be read by everyone. Im a student of banking history and there was material here that was new to me. The author has done good homework. His argument that we are headed towards totalitarianism, via socialism, is no doubt correct. History confirms it as natural social/economic decay. But there are problems with his approach;1)The informal chatty style he adopts at times detracts. When he writes in the more ominous impending doom style, the book becomes riveting and much more believable.2)Some of his evidence to support his worldwide banking conspiracy is just plain wrong. Example: He cites Pierpont and Jack Morgan's comparatively small fortunes as \`proof' that they were merely Trojan Horses for the much richer European bankers seeking to embed themselves in America. In effect the Morgans were simply salaried \`fellow travelers' living on an allowance, their presumed fortunes Potemkin villages. This is nonsense. Pierpont spent at least $60 million on art and rare books in his life. That is why his estate was not as large as everyone expected. His son Jack left an even smaller estate. Why? The 1929 crash clobbered him as it did so many other bankers. FDR's income taxes did the rest. These historical facts conflict with two primary assumptions the author relies on to substantiate his case:a.This vast banker conspiracy was and is invulnerable. Then why could'nt they fend off something as petty as income taxes? Surely going broke could'nt have been part of the plan.b.The bankers were warned ahead of time of the impending crash and had time to escape. Then why were so many of them ( Morgan, Kahn, Stotesbury, Mitchell, etc) virtually wiped out?The author has clearly hunted and pecked for just the information he wants from his sources (several of which Im familiar with) and ignored countervailing facts present in the same works. This practice is the same as the environmentalists selective use of scientific evidence to support their claim of global warning and the author rightly calls them out on this. But if the author is guilty of the same offense in building HIS case then it becomes harder to support him (as much as I want to) either. Ironically the author missed the most relevant and convincing of all historical precedents to support his prediction of future feudalism. The Roman Empire in the 3rd and 4th century AD. The facts and history are incontrovertible. Any book on the economic and social history of Rome lays out like a roadmap the path we are on."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Jekyll Island was recommended to me about 5 years ago, and I had always kept it in the back of my mind as something I should read one day.I should have read it then, if not before.This country is on a path to ruin....that ruin was pre-ordained....and the banking cabal that ordained it will do anything possible to gain wealth and power at our expense. For as easy as it is to get involved with supporting one political party or another, and to see the differences between them, the banking interests who pull their strings are really controlling the outcome. These parties are different only in rhetoric. The substance of what they do is almost identical.I bought my copy of this book, and it impressed/scared me enough that I bought four others...one for each of my three adult children, and another for my brother. I have no background at all in finance or economics or monetary theory. And this book pulls all those together into a cogent explanation of the \\"whys\\" behind the chaos that seems to surround us.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. The only problem I have with it is that it is not available for the Kindle."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Who would have thought anyone could write nearly 600 pages about such things as fiat money, legal tender laws, securities and fractional reserve banking and make it darned near a page turner? This book is simply fascinating! It is also extremely educational, clearly explaining the nexus between banks and government, the ramifications of the national debt, how inflation works and much more that is highly relevant to understanding current events, not to mention the incredible things that happen to the money in your savings account. Be warned that throughout the book the author spins out a lot of conspiracy theory (e.g., Winston Churchill and Woodrow Wilson conspired to facilitate the sinking of the Lusitania by a German u-boat in order to provoke the American public to join WWI on the side of England, thereby ensuring the struggling Brits would win the war and be able to pay back the huge war loans they had received from J.P. Morgan and other New York bankers). Many readers will be skeptical of these theories, as was I. However, they were sort of interesting, some might even be true and - most importantly - they do not detract one bit from the meat of the book, which is to explain the mysteries of money and banking and the danger and damage the Federal Reserve and the American banking system cause the nation. Read this book! You will be very glad you did."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Think you know anything about the dollar bills in your wallet?Think you know who runs this country?Think that we live in a \\"free market\\" economy?Think again.Griffin piles up facts and analyzes them with relentless, cold logic. The picture he paints isn't pretty. The Federal Reserve System is a legal cartel expressly designed to create riskless profits for member banks, while simultaneously turning our entire financial system into the legal and moral equivalent of a Las Vegas casino. Yeah, you might get lucky for a while, but the house will always win. Our monetary system is a pyramid scheme that only functions as long as debt is being created at an accelerating rate.This all sounds crazy, but Griffin has the facts to back it up. The challenging part about Griffin's arguments is that he explicitly states that the foundation and perpetuation of the Federal Reserve System was a conspiracy. Whenever the \\"C\\"-word is mentioned, it is an unfortunate truth that many people get turned off. But as Griffith himself says, if a group of people, operating in secret, create a system that explicitly benefits themselves at the expense of others, what else can you call it but conspiracy? Heck, I guess you could call it a \\"peanut\\" or a \\"canteloupe\\" but it would still add up to the same thing--a system expressly designed to reward failure and punish diligence and honesty. Kinda explains all the crookedness and incompetence behind all the wall street and corporate shenanigans of the last decade, doesn't it?And if you keep an open mind and pay close attention to his arguments, you'll see that the best place to hide a conspiracy is in plain sight.If you care about free markets, and your constitutional rights, you will read this book today."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"What is The Creature From Jekyll Island? Well, first of all, it's uglier than The Creature from the Black Lagoon; it's more densely wrapped in deception than the Mummy is in cloth; it sucks the lifeblood of America more ravenously than Dracula does his victims; it reeks worse than the Werewolf; and it's stronger and more dangerous than Doctor Frankenstein's miscreation!The Creature from Jekyll Island is the PRIVATE Federal Reserve that holds America and Her People hostage with an astoundingly perverse and \\"criminal\\" economic system that is an evil beyond your worst monster-infested nightmare. But the Creature comes in a guise to mislead the people, like a Wolfman in sheep's clothing.Why is the system \\"criminal\\"? Because the U.S. Constitution proclaims itself to be the \\"supreme Law of the Land\\" (see Article VI), and Article I, Section VIII of the Constitution states that \\"The Congress shall (Constitutionally speaking, \\"shall\\" has been legally defined as \\"must\\")...coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures.\\" Why Congress? Because it is answerable to the People it represents! Remember, our Constitutional Republic was meant to be representational government! We're a long way from that now! The Federal Reserve is NOT Congress; it is unelected, meaning nonrepresentational, and being therefore unconstitutional, it is illegal, hence \\"criminal.\\"I first read G. Edwrd Griffin's magnificent study, 'The Creature From Jekyll Island' eight years ago. I had read plenty of political books prior to this one, and countless since, but Mr. Griffin's tour de force has yet to be equaled when it comes to educating the reader in wide-ranging topics that coalesce most of the geopolitical mysteries of our time into the diabolical scheme known as the Federal Reserve System.Don't make the mistake of letting the sophisticated subject matter drive you away as forcefully as the intriguing title beckons you. Despite the complexity of the topic, G. Edward Griffin masterfully organizes the material and lays it out, not only in a very readable manner, but he actually fashions a carefully researched, extensively footnoted nonfiction tome into a spellbinding journey that reads nearly like a page-turning mystery novel.In the process of explaining and demystifying the history, the stated goals of the Federal Reserve, and the real agenda behind it, Mr. Griffin necessarily enlightens the reader about myriad conspirators who occupy positions in a variety of social engineering organizations. Without this understanding, one could not possibly grasp the full scope of the problem, nor fathom how such a demonstrably evil entity could have remained cloaked and in power since 1913. (Indeed the thirteenth year of the Twentieth Century represented an unlucky number for America and eventually the world.)You will find some reviewers here complaining that Mr. Griffin has unfortunately polluted his 600+ page study with John Birch Society style conspiracy theories. What you WON'T find is where any of those same reviewers have proven any errors in fact committed by Mr. Griffin. They challenge the idea of a conspiracy, but not any of the abundant and overt evidence that clearly points to it. I myself don't like little yapping dogs, but I'm not prepared to say that they don't exist simply because I'd prefer not to even think about them. And I can hear those yapping quadrupeds as clearly as I can see the indisputable evidence of underhanded collusion in high and influential places when it comes to this country's monetary system.\\"You are a den of vipers!\\" President Andrew Jackson thundered at a delegation of supporters of the central Bank of the United States in 1834. \\"I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal God I will rout you out!\\" Jackson succeeded in ridding this country of the inherent perniciousness that a central bank levels on a nation. But President Jackson's hard-earned victory for his countrymen was sadly overturned in 1913, when a corrupt privately owned central bank was again foisted on the sleeping people of this once free nation in the form of The Federal Reserve cartel. As Griffin states on page 573, \\"The Federal Reserve is the world's largest and most successful scam.\\"I will tell you plainly that regardless of what you think you know about the political spectrum, Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, civil rights and corporate greed, socialism and capitalism -- regardless of how well informed you may think you are by reading mainstream news magazines and newspapers, listening to NPR and talk radio programs and watching political debates on nightly news TV shows -- until you have read and digested G. Edward Griffin's, 'THE CREATURE FROM JEKYLL ISLAND', you will never really understand contemporary American and global politics. But afterwards, the political puzzle will come together before your eyes, and never again will you follow the red herring into the brainwashing house of mirrors which is our current political milieu.If you're inclined to read only one political book, be sure it's this one, as it will make sense of your world like nothing else. 'THE CREATURE FROM JEKYLL ISLAND' belongs in the personal library of every American who truly cares about his or her country (regardless of political party affiliation); by rousing the people of this nation from the ignorance of deep sleep, it has the potential to be the silver bullet or the stake through the heart of America's worst monster! Read it now or the Wolfman's gonna getcha!"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Author G. Edward Griffin's book \\"The Creature From Jekyll Island: A Second Look At The Federal Reserve\\" is a most well researched and written historical text. Griffin presents the background with almost an air of mystery that the reader must peel away, like layers of an onion, to reveal the truth.The book provides, in great detail, the time, place, and manner in which the groundwork for the Federal Reserve was laid, and more importantly, the reasons why. Griffin explains why even the name is misleading. The Federal Reserve is not a federal or governmental administration, and it is not a reserve, such as a bank.Also provided is great historical detail about the commerce and industry in our nation during the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries. This book will not disappoint the reader looking to expand his or her knowledge of how the collective financial machinations of our country are run.I read this book during my undergraduate years and once presented the book in defense of a historical argument I had with one of my history professors. Needless to say the professor looked at my reference (the book is so well researched), acceded to my contention, borrowed the book \\"for his own enrichment\\" and never gave it back! I gratefully let him keep it so maybe he would soften his ascribed \\"socialist democrat\\" leanings. Unfortunately I am sans the book this day. Oh well, we march on.As the topic of Civics is not really taught in public schools, or even required in undergraduate studies anymore, this book will serve to \\"illuminate\\" the reader into the background of how private finances and politics are inseparable. My only criticism of this text is the highlighted aspect of a government conspiracy at work. Not that Griffin's arguments have no merit, they certainly do, as Lord Acton so aptly is quoted \\"Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely!\\" However, the mere aspect of \\"a conspiracy notion\\" is all the extremists on all sides need to \\"debunk\\" a truly great piece of historical research and writing.I rate this wonderful book five stars. It is well worth the money and deserves a place on the library shelf of every institution and the home of every student of history."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This was a truly fantastic book and receives my highest level of recommendation. I read this book in four days I couldn't put the book down it was too good. One of the best books I have ever read. One of the best overviews of the Fed and central bank structure, history, and establishment in one source. Superb overview of American Monetary history from pre-revolution up until WWI. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in economics, history, politics, or thrillers.If you do not know the meaning of the words Federal Reserve, fiat money, fractional reserve system, or money then you will have you will learn a great deal about money and banking in this masterpiece. This book details the fraud that the Fed is and how the Federal Reserve robs and plunders the American people and has put our nation at risk through the issuance of Fiat money. The book also gives a great explanation of how fiat money is an influencing factor for a nation to wage wars. You will learn how central banking is the single most powerful group in our world and you learn how they dictate and own almost every government in the world.The main topics in the book are: how inflation works, the evolution of central banking over the past 400 years, the role of central banking in history, the history of money in banking in America pre-revolution to WWI with the addition of the Savings and Loan Crisis, the responsibility of bankers of drawing America into WWI, the role they played in the Bolshevik revolution, the role of the Federal Reserve played in causing the great depression, the dangers of a fractional reserve banking system, the difference between Commodity Money (metal coins), Receipt Money (paper money with 100% commodity backing), Fiat Money (pieces of paper with no value but declared legal currency, current Federal Reserve Note and today's US Dollar), and Fractional Money (Paper money with a % backing of a commodity), the rise of the Rothschild family and their important role in history, the rise of the Morgan family, and the secrecy of the formation of the Fed and their players.Some side topics in the book are the plan by certain individuals and secret groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations and Fabians who wish to form a global government through the use of central banking and a common world currency. Also the author exposes some specific schemes of these groups such as crafting an environmental crisis which is not real. (ie global warming, if you wish to learn more about this topic I recommend Environmentalism: Power and Ideology by Donald Gibson which details the history and corruption of the environmental movement).If you liked this book I would recommend Thieves in the Temple by Andre Eggelletion and a DVD titled, the Money Masters by Bill Still. Off topic from banking but detailing how the world really works I would also highly recommend both Thy Will Be Done: The Conquest of the Amazon : Nelson Rockefeller and Evangelism in the Age of Oil by Gerald Colby and Battling Wall Street by Donald GibsonOverall this a fantastic book, I would have a hard time finding anyone who would not greatly enjoy this book and come away with a wealth of knowledge. If you really have no idea about the Federal Reserve and money then after this book your life will be divided into two time periods before reading Jekyll Island and after reading Jekyll Island as your whole perception of the world will change. I would suggest reading this book carefully and slowly especially if you are new to the topic. It is a large book 588 pages, I would suggest reading each section as a mini-book. If you read one section a week you can retain the information and tackle the book in 6 weeks. The book is organized very well and each chapter has an introduction and a summary. I would say that this is a book to own not just to read."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This is the most important economic textbook since Marx wrote Das Capital. Whereas Marx goes great lengths explaining all the problems concerning the *production cycles* of capitalism, Griffin explains the *money supply* side. And this ends up being even more disturbing. Griffin explains that money is created \\"out of nothing\\", worse even, out of \\"less than nothing\\", out of DEBT. Whenever the government is in need of money, they \\"lend\\" it to the Federal Reserve, which, by the way, isn't a government institution, but a cartel of private banks, invented by the Rockefeller and Morgan families in Jekyll Island in 1910 and established by Congress in 1913. This Fed \\"creates\\" the money the government needs in the form of government bonds, ultimately made out of \\"paper and ink\\". Government then spends this money (payment to contractors etc.) and this money ends up as deposits in private bank accounts, where it is used in turn to back up private loans. More money is created \\"out of nothing\\", since banks typically lend 9 dollars for each dollar they have in deposit ! As you can see, all money is created out of debt. Would all debts be paid, all money would literally... disappear... Money which is not backed up by gold is thus an illusion.Now, governments do all what is in their power to be indebted. Remember Bush and Obama rescued \\"Banks Too Big To Fail\\" (sic) and other Big Corporations, each time with more than 700 billion USD, without even raising taxes ! They even did better ! They lowered taxes at the same time ! Ever wondered how they perform this fascinating trick? Read this important book. Griffin shows that recollecting taxes isn't really necessary. But we DO end up paying those bills, every time government decides to \\"create money out of nothing\\". Don't be mistaken. Every time our governments expand the money supply, inflation goes up, and our money ends up being worth less. In 1966, when Greenspan was still a brilliant economist and not a corrupted chairman of the Fed, he called inflation a \\"hidden confiscation of wealth\\".The first edition of Griffin's book was published in 1994, and has very important historical explanations and references. If you - like me - heard once too much that the actual crisis is similar to the Great Depression of the \`30s, and always wanted to know what really happened then, then this book will sort it all out. As a *complementary work* in which the current crisis is explained in great detail, I would also highly recommend Kevin PhillipsBad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Here is a quick overview of how I figured out the monetary system to the point of being confident that my understanding is reasonably correct and being able to explain the basic scam in about 45 minutes.First I became convinced that if I am ever going to understand how the world works I should probably figure out an answer to the question \\"what is money?\\" Surprisingly, a search on Amazon.com did not return very many books on the topic. Like any good college educated liberal I chose the one book which garnered praise from all my favorite trusted sources such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. I didn't see how I could possibly go wrong spending $12.92 for the 800 page book \\"Secrets from the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country\\", which The Nation said, \\"May be the most important political book of the decade.\\"Unfortunately, after reading William Greider's 10 year, day by day account of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker's back and forth decisions on raising and lowering interest rates, I still did not have the foggiest clue as to what money is or how it is created. I'm sure most people would have given up at this point but I was not ready to throw in the towel. For some reason I was not convinced by the book's conclusion that it was critically important to maintain the money mystery because \\"Taboos uncoded lost their power to persuade...The mystery was necessary, therefore, to sustain social faith. Knowledge was disturbing. Not knowing the secrets was reassuring.\\"I needed another book, however the only ones that the New York Times seemed to recommend were all described as condensed versions of \\"Secrets of the Temple.\\" I had no choice but to bite the bullet and for the first time in my life order a book which was not recommended by the New York Times. I ordered \\"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve by G. Edward Griffin. At least Willie Nelson seemed to like it. Actually, I wasn't quite sure if Willie Nelson was wholeheartedly endorsing the book in his review which simply read, \\"Scary. It's the story of the world banking system. Enough said.\\"I was quite pleased that Jekyll Island contained a pretty good description of the money creation process. However, the book contained a lot more than that. All I can say is that I often see my life as divided into two main periods; before reading Jekyll Island and after reading Jekyll Island. I finally knew what Willie Nelson meant by \\"scary.\\"Now that I was starting to really get somewhere in figuring out how money is created, I needed to find more information to clear up some of the details. My wife even got involved in the search for truly academic and scholarly information. I will be forever indebted to her for discovering a free downloadable copy of a book entitled \\"The Mystery of Banking\\" by Murray Rothbard. This was exactly what I had always been looking for. It clearly explained the process without dumbing it down in any way or obfuscating the details in order to \\"sustain social faith.\\"That is essentially how I got started in learning about money. I have found this to be the most fascinating field I have ever encountered and I am very glad that I didn't take William Grieder's advise to remain blissfully ignorant."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"My high school history books interpretation of The Federal Reserve Act.\\"Wilson scored another triumph.

There goal was to maximize profits by minimizing competition and make it difficult for new competitors. Then they would use the government to enforce there private cartel at the expense of the people. They created a shared monopoly called the Federal Reserve to force the public to pay higher prices than they would under a free- enterprise competition system. This curtailed for a period of time bank runs and currency drains. When the inevitable disaster did occur they would shift the public blame from themselves to \\"economy\\", \\"exchange value of dollar\\", or even the \\"capital system\\". The Federal Reserve could shift the burden of fixing these inevitable losses to the tax payer. Since it's inception to stop crashes and recessions we have had the crashes of 1921, 1929, 1939, and recessions of 53,57,69,75,81, Black monday 87 plus the 2000 debacle. So the Federal Reserve is simply a legal private monopoly of the money supply operated for the benefit of the few under the guise of protecting and promoting the public interest.Pick up this book and read in detail how the wars are started, how the crashes are launched, how they rape and pillage the third world, and where the U.S. is headed and indeed the world - into the 21st century. It is knowledge that Jefferson wanted for the people and it is the monoplies he and Linclon feared the most. Those moneyed corporate interests would eventually cause the elimination of the middle class. Without the middle class: The Republic is dead.

Where does our money come from? What do banks actually do? Very few Americans - including (perhaps especially) our puppet political leaders - can accurately answer these questions. G. Edward Griffin skillfully gives you all the shocking answers in this book.Griffin writes very well and manages to make subjects as supposedly arcane as money and banking into things that any literate layman can understand. Besides the complete history of the Fed, Griffin also provides some general history of banking and money which puts it all in context. As a historian, I can tell you that his facts are mostly spot-on, as are his economic analyses. Griffin cites the sources and quotes people to back up most of his claims. Furthermore, to his credit, on the few occasions in the book when he does speculate or theorize, Griffin makes it clear that he is speculating or theorizing - unlike many other authors.This is not just dry history, though - Griffin clearly has a point of view, and it's decidedly anti-Fed. Here are his reasons for wanting to abolish the Federal Reserve:1. It is incapable of accomplishing its stated objectives (which are basically moderating the business cycle and maintaining a stable dollar - it has clearly failed on both counts.)2. It is a cartel operating against the public interest.3. It is the supreme instrument of usury.4. It encourages our most unfair tax (ie, inflation.)5. It encourages war.6. It destabilizes the economy.7. It is an instrument of totalitarianism.The things that are happening in our economy and government today may not seem to make much sense - until you read this book. Once you know the truth about the Fed, once you understand how you are being swindled and exploited, you will probably become angry and radicalized. Be forewarned: If you'd rather just stay asleep, then don't read this book. It would be very hard to read it and not come away as some sort of revolutionary.

He dispays the ability to bring together widely scattered data sources and present them clearly and (relatively) concisely. If you want some insights into how Governments create money and inject it into the economy, how the moneyed interests have driven US foreign policies for their personal gain, and how governments pay for their excesses through inflation and not taxation, this book is a must read. Griffin is apparently a believer in a variety of conspiracy theories, some which he expands on a length. I believe the book would have been better with these toned down, because there is a danger he may be classified by some as part of the conspiracy theory lunatic fringe, when in fact this book is an insightful account of the history of money, and a great source of factual information whether the reader accepts all of his conclusions or not."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"So, do you like the idea of your own money and investments being devalued so an irresponsible bank or multinational company can get bailed out?

Many who read a synopsis of this will think it's just another conspiracy theory, and they would be right. But, the author backs many of his points up with information from Federal Reserve pamphlets and documents. Another eye opener is the history of inflation through fiat currency. As Mr. Griffin puts it, the same ounce of gold that would get you a toga, belt, and sandals from a reputable tailor in ancient Rome will now get you a suit, belt, and dress shoes in modern America. The cash equivalent to that gold today is $1670.41. This means that the actual cost of a suit of clothing hasn't changed in over 1,000 years but the purchasing power of our money has diminished incalculably.

After reading The Creature From Jekyll Island, you will understand how today's depressed economy is a result of that meeting so long ago.

His detailed historical journey travels from the revolutionary war period thru the Napoleonic era to the modern day.The book's historical information on the struggle of the founding fathers, Andrew Jackson, and others against banking powers should be taught in every school in America. But, of course, it is not.Some have and will undoubtedly call portions of it \\"conspiracy.\\"Just remember all those who challenge mainstream history are always mocked in this manner.

It was for me."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Griffin's subject matter is very controversial, but he delivers the material in such a logically progressive way that it gives him outstanding credibility. This book reads as easily as a novel, while informing the reader with ample references and citations. This book is much more than just a mere history of the Federal Reserve System. Griffin begins with the story of the evolution of modern forms of centralized banking in Europe. The story evolves by elaborating on the politico-economic evolution of our own country, and the role that centralized banking played along the way. Griffin demonstrates that the evolution of this centralized banking system is only a limb of a larger global order. Griffin explains other ironies of history such as the alliance of high net worth 'capitalists' with collectivist intellectuals and left-wing politicians. Griffin demonstrates how a ruling elite has an intent to exert world-wide political change to re-structure modern societies into a network of financial collectivism and centralized power. Griffin alleges that the ruling elite wish to use developing collectivist political ideologies and central banking as a sort of patsy system to preserve their current position of power and influence. The facts presented in this book are difficult to ignore and will leave any reader musing, regardless of personal political persuasions.I consider myself a libertarian politically, an objectivist philosophically, and a classical liberal economically. Those who don't share similar political persuations as my own may not like this book, and make even consider it paranoid trash. I myself typically find the assertions of conspiracy theorists a little too hard to swallow and take it all with a grain of salt. Personally I believe that our world suffers more from what one could call conspiracies of default, rather than the sort of premeditated puppet-master new-world-order grand master conspiracies imagined by such authors. Griffin manages to avoid such paranoid rants, and more objectively focuses on his arguments.Banking, economics, and money supply are complex topics and Griffin is a journalist primarily and an outsider to the finance world. I found some of his conclusions a bit far-reaching and negative. His critique of the banking system is insightful, and perhaps informative to a novice of the subject. But many of his interpretations are tainted by his personal ideological persuasions.However, despite some of my reservations about the book, the evidence of Griffin's arguments is compelling. And the book is very well written, and an entertaining read for anyone with an appetite for this subject. Ultimately, Griffin predicts a rather grim global politico-economic future with further erosion of civil liberties and economic freedom, planned economies, and centralized governing on a global scale as we all haplessly and unwittingly allow ourselves to be engulfed in the bowels of collectivist ideology, directed by a minority of wealthy self-interested elitists intent on maintaining their global plutocracy through a system of fascistic socialism."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Most people believe that the Federal Reserve System is part of our government. Once you read this book you will understand that most of your education has been to support this sytem so that Americans would buy into this concept of a central bank and fiat money (the American dollar). I could only read a few pages a day because the information inside would make me angry about what we have been led to believe is for the good of America, and of course, it is not. It is for the good of the bankers who run the Federal Reserve System. Read this book and tell others."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"The Creature from Jekyll Island presents the idea that the Fed is a product of the banking cartel working in cahoots with internationalist politicians. The author suggests that we should return to the gold standard.Well, we've been off the gold standard since the 1930s, and the results are mixed, although I'd say the post-WWII era went pretty well in retrospect. However, I think the recent mortgage melt down was triggered by the Fed keeping interest rates too low in the years 2001-2004, which created a housing bubble.But even the gold standard is not perfect, as evidenced by Winston Churchill's actions as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 1920's, when England went back on the gold standard and Churchill overpriced the pound relative to gold, causing English goods to become overpriced. This stifled English exports and contributed to the Great Depression ([...]). Griffin discusses Churchill in the book, but he left out this detail, probably because it goes against his main thesis.The author presents many interesting facts (e.g. John Maynard Keynes, the founder the the stimulus school of economic thought, was a Fabian socialist, and the Fabian socialists emblem was a wolf in sheep's' clothing), and I love the way the book puts summaries at the back of each chapter. You can read the summaries and then refer to the chapter for details. At 600 pages, this is a merciful way to organize the material. Even at that, I only made it halfway through.In summary, I'm not a cheerleader for the Fed, crony capitalism, nor massive bailouts, and neither is the author. But going back to the gold standard is not the answer either. My favorite economist, Milton Friedman, did not advocate for the gold standard. But in 1992 when asked about pressing economic issues of the day Friedman replied, \\"One unsolved economic problem of the day is how to get rid of the Federal Reserve\\" ([...]).Again, in the words of Milton Friedman, \\"Any system which gives so much power and so much discretion to a few men, [so] that mistakes -- excusable or not -- can have such far reaching effects, is a bad system.\\" ([...])The problem is that the Fed is a necessary evil, because we don't have anything better to replace it with. But recent events have made it clear that the Fed needs to have some controls put on its massive power if we are to prevent future bubbles and meltdowns.I felt like this book brings out some interesting facts, even though I disagree with its conclusions, and it had a touch of nut-case extremism to it. For example, the author devotes a chapter to the Rothschild banking family in Europe. What does this have to do with the Fed? The author claims that he includes it to make the case that bankers and money have a history of influencing politics. Duh. I think the real goal of this chapter was to connect the alleged Jewish banking conspiracy to the Federal Reserve. But the majority of Fed chairpeople have been non-Jews, as are Henry Paulson and Tim Geitner, and all of our Presidents. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a recovering CPA, MBA, and CFP; the only banker I know personally is a Catholic; and I'm half Jewish -- but you'll have to guess which half ;)"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"THE CREATURE FROM JEKYLL ISLAND is a fascinating look into the history of the United States Federal Reserve system and the power brokers who created, funded and have profited from it. CREATURE reads more like a suspense novel than a history or economics tour de force. Griffin gives a riveting, behind-the-scenes glimpse into the people and politics of America's economy.Griffin details the history of the secret meetings, the dark conspiracies and powerful families who created and drove the federal banking system, manipulating the system for their own profit. Conspiracy theorists will regard CREATURE as their proof text. And this fellow makes many good points. You don't have to swallow everything he writes hook, line and sinker to learn a great deal from the book.Griffen defines money in four forms:1. Commodity money (silver coins or gold pieces)2. Receipt money (paper money backed by 100% by gold or silver reserves)3. Fractional money (paper money partially backed by gold or silver reserves)4. Fiat money (paper money not backed by precious metals and required to use by decree)In the United States of America, we are living in the age of fiat money. The American dollar has no intrinsic value. Our currency is no longer backed by gold or silver but is the recognized and required by the federal government as legal tender. In fact, our money is backed by no assets; it is backed by debt. The U.S. money supply is simply created out of thin air by the Federal Reserve for Congress to spend as it wishes with no regard for its value, supply, or repayment.The operating schemes of unlimited supplies of money, unlimited spending, and increasing national debt, suit the purposes of those who profit from it: the banks which sponsor and broker the activity. One wonders, then why taxes are necessary at all. Griffen maintains that taxes serve two purposes:1. To fool the public into believing it is paying for government spending and2. To enable social planners (socialists) to wage war on the middle classThe nature of evil is the impulse to power over others. And this struggle is all about power and control. At this time in history, the greatest problem is the growing dependence of more and more citizens on their friendly, motherly federal government. \\"When people can vote on issues involving the transfer of wealth to themselves from others, the ballot box becomes a weapon with which the majority plunders the minority.\\"The final piece of this long and fascinating conspiracy against the citizenry requires a central government unrestrained. This requires a war. The war of choice for the present leadership is the environmental movement. Several years ago, Griffen predicated that \\"fraudulent scientific studies\\" would fuel the politicians' appetite for an enemy. The threat of doom would empower the central government to seize the leverage it needed to socialize the economy and lead the public into a doomsday scenario. Couple with failing banks and bailout of private industries, the politicians and back-room power brokers would seize the opportunity to destroy the greatest asset of a people and free markets: their freedom. How could Griffen know this many years before the Great Recession of 2008 and Copenhagen 15?"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Long, detailed, sometimes hard to follow but it is the truth revealed.

If you are an investor, you will wish that you had read this book years ago. Following the financial advice enclosed could have made you a fortune. However, it is not too late to profit from this book by understanding the way that the ultra-rich elite control the world's wealth. Don't waste another second-order this book now!"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I gave the book 5 stars even though the book is a little too long bc the subject matter far outweighs the execution.This book will keep you from being deceived from every trick in the book the bankers will try to steal your money. It exposes the corruption of our banking system and therefore opens your eyes to how you can protect your wealth from being stolen.If you can read this book and not feel compelled to educate people and fight the current banking system, then you're either a zombie or a banker."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book was written several years ago, and updated since it was first written. It is very interesting to read it today and see how the things that are discussed are happening right before out eyes.At first glance the premise of this book seems very far fetched. However, as you read the quotes from the players in the book, and look at the actions that have taken place historically, and that are taking place today, one can't deny the validity of what the book presents. It may not be that everything in the book happens exactly as it says it will, but based on what is happening today, overall it seems to be right on the money."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I've read books about banks, finance, and the Federal Reserve before, but none that I've read have been as illuminating and educational as this book. I look at the government and the banks from a new perspective now.Now when I see a new article about the latest bailout program being proposed, I understand what is really going on. The bailouts are always touted to help protect \\"the public\\" or \\"the economy\\", when in fact their purpose is to protect the bankers from losses, and all at the expense of the taxpayer.Read the book if you've ever wondered about various events that have taken place in the U.S. which didn't seem to have adequate explanations. For example, how was it that the U.S. got into World War I when our government had pledged neutrality at the time? Why did we give away the Panama Canal, with all of its revenues, to the government of Panama?Another consequence of reading this book is that you'll stop getting so upset with Obama, Bush, or any other president who happens to be in office. They want us to focus on the president, just like the stage magician who tries to divert our attention away from the real action and thereby fool us. Read this excellent book and you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book contains information every American needs to know. It should be required reading in our schools, but, of course, that would defeat the purpose of those who support what occurred."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"The Creature from Jekyll Island is devastating book to read-especially when this is the first time you have been given a full picture of the world and who is in charge here. Fantastically researched. I only wish I had a brain that could hold all this info so that I could go out and spread the word with intelligence and references that I could use to debate the shallowest of mind."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Ordered a brand new copy for a friend. I have already read this book and recommend it to anyone interested in how the American economic and monetary systems work. This book also covers some conspiracy theories which may turn some people off (depending on how much faith you have in our various governments and media), but even if one were to skip over those sections an abundance of important information would be left. Everyone should understand why the money in their pockets and bank accounts has value, this is just one book that covers that subject."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Do you wonder why the US is fighting in Iraq and Afganistan?Do you wonder why congress rubber stamped trillions in bailout money in Fall 2008?Do you wonder why Republicans and Democrats alike fail to keep reform promises once elected?Do you wonder why politics in the US seems like a giant game of two-card monty?When you digest this book, you will feel like a person who didn't realize how much their eye-sight had degraded and has been given glasses to restore 20/20 vision. Seeing the political stage through the lenses provided by The Creature is a mind bending experience. I am questioning all my deepest held beliefs about the political parties, the corruption of our Constitution, the way the US has implemented \\"free market\\" economics, and my very commitment to the rat-race we live in. I'm two thirds of the way through the book, but felt compelled to comment already. This book is second only to the Bible in its impact on my life. For all you Bible believers out there - Revelation confirms the One World government - it is an inevitable march that we are on towards the unfolding of God's plan for the end of the world. Be among the redeemed - claim the gift of Christ's sacrifice on the cross and enjoy the peace only God's forgiveness can provide.

You will see that the bankers in the upper strata are following their plan to the letter. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Bottom Line: Half of the information in this book is fact, mixed in with half fiction and falsehoods. The author has a degree in speech and communications, not economics. He has some very wild ideas and states them with no justification and quotes people out of context to support his crazy theories. Some of the info is good, but this book is an example of why our electorate is becoming more polarized and less educated about how things actually work. I have an undergrad in physics and a masters in international security and economic policy and have taken many undergrad and graduate economics classes. If you have taken these classes as well you know many things the author says are completely false."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I found this book quite interesting until the author began ranting about a quarter of the way into it that the whole thing was a fantastic plot to establish World Socialism. The idea that a cabal of the wealthiest men in the world, greedy capitalists all, would hatch this fantastic conspiracy to bring about World Socialism is just plain stupid. Unless the author really means National Socialism (Nazism), which is more like Corporate Socialism, or fascism. That is far more believable, and likely. Nevertheless, once the author got on his rant he lost all credibility with me. The ruling elites are far more likely to want to bring about World Fascism than World Socialism and if the author is unable to see the distinction then his analysis is so fundamentally flawed that the book is not worth reading."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Yes, the Fed is all the things it's accused of being, except for one thing. In 1913, when the story begins, one fourth of all the world's wealth is putatively in the hands of seven men. That's under the gold standard. We got rid of the gold standard and life has been very good. Not for everyone, you could claim, but the fact is that the standard of living for Americans is vastly higher -- even for poor Americans -- than has been experienced by any but the wealthiest, most privileged human beings since the beginning of time. So...final analysis, say what you will, but WHERE IS THE EVIL? Sure, there are people making a lot of money off the system, but the system provides a fiscal stability never before seen in the world. Well, I shouldn't say that -- back when Great-grandpa and Grandpa and Son and Grandson and Great-grandson all lived basically the same life, i.e. barely feeding themselves, subject to the whim of disease, the weather and whoever was currently the Boss in the area, you could say there was stability. Wages didn't change during the Middle Ages, for centuries, and all but a small handful of people lived like animals. When there were oversupplies of this or that, or the labor force was decimated by plague or whatever, there was no understanding of economics, nor any way to flex the economy to compensate for change or shore up weakness. Then the Modern era came along, followed by the Industrial Revolution, and economies suffered because there was no way to expand their money supplies. Gold was moved around between developing economies by political forces more than economic forces and the pendulum swung between relative prosperity and wretched penury without rhyme, reason or warning. The last big debacle was in the U.S. in 1907 -- tens of thousands of businesses and farmers went broke. Unemployment was astronomical. Money was worthless. JP Morgan stepped in and acted as a central bank, pulling us back from the abyss none too soon. The history of man is a history of dislocation, disease, confusion, a bit of feast and mostly famine. That's history as I see it, and that's a good part of the reason the Fed was invented. You can call it evil, just as some call booze evil and movies and sex and a few other things evil. But the fact is, the Fed has given us the best times ever enjoyed by the greatest number of people on this planet. Is someone taking advantage? Sure. Do they screw up sometimes? Sure. But until I'm shown a better way, I'm sticking with central banks. Using precious metals or anything else of a finite nature is like rubbing two sticks together to make fire: yeah, you'll never burn your house down with that method, but you'll also freeze your ass off."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"A friend recommended this to me because he knows I'm interested in economics as a general subject and that I like to know how things work. However, from the get-go, this book's tone came off less like a textbook and more like a conspiracy theory. The validity of this theory is still in question, and I must admit that I quit reading about 20 pages into it because of the writing style. The author paints a vivid picture of a very secret meeting between the financial giants of the time and then turns around and uses hearsay (and hearsay reported sometimes long after the event itself) to support his assertion that the contents of that meeting can be reliably reported. I've written many an academic piece in my time, and whether the author's conclusions are valid or not, his writing style undermines them before he even explicitly lays them out.I was completely bewildered until I looked at the back cover to see where this was all going. I didn't find a synopsis as I expected, but I did find that the book reviewers of note are Ron Paul and Willie Nelson, two people who certainly have my respect but are a little too far out there to be completely trusted in their opinions on such a subject.So, in a nutshell: as exhaustively researched as this book may be, there are things about it that make me skeptical of its conclusions."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I purchased this CD thinking this was the entire book version on CD.

BUY THE BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book is 15 years old, a top 10 seller in the 'finance' topic Amazon, and has 160ish glowing reviews. Why is it that when I google it, I can't find a single published review?I did find a wikipedia background of the author, and will share some of that.\\"In 1974, Griffin wrote and published the book World Without Cancer,[16][17] and released it as a documentary video... In the book and the video, Griffin asserts that cancer is a metabolic disease facilitated by the insufficient dietary consumption of amygdalin, a view which has been rejected by the medical community. He contends that \\"eliminating cancer through a nondrug therapy has not been accepted because of the hidden economic and power agendas of those who dominate the medical establishment\\"[18] and he wrote, \\"at the very top of the world's economic and political pyramid of power there is a grouping of financial, political, and industrial interests that, by the very nature of their goals, are the natural enemies of the nutritional approaches to health\\".[19]\\"(He also wrote about a theory on the location of Noah's Ark, results that he was unable to reproduce.)Now, I'll be honest, I haven't read the book and don't intend to. That may make me as disqualified as some other reviewers who I doubt have read it as well. The point is, his consistent publications of conspiracy theories, and lack of mention in the publishing or academic community, lead me to seriously doubt this book's credentials.This book seems to be another product in a long line of libertarian-based marketing. The only books that seem to have nothing but vague glowing reviews come from the same reviewers, and it bothers me that Amazon allows information marketing agendas to such a large extent. If you are a discerning skeptical reader, as I imagine would bring you to this book and review in the first place, I hope you take this information seriously as I imagine it will be rated negatively."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I have no doubt that the Federal Reserve was developed to serve the interest of bankers.That being said, this book is not worth the paper it is printed on. It reads like one long random stream of consciousness, with frequent tangential digressions for no apparent good reason. It is written at about the eighth grade level, and the author's grasp of economics is also at about the eighth grade level (I found frequent mistakes in his description of how our banking/economic/monetary system works). I have no idea why so many people have given this book five stars, unless there is a large cross section of America that is into crackpot theories written by people who have just enough educational background to string their random thoughts together in print form.It is telling that the people listed on the back cover as heartily recommending this book are no-names.

I did listen to Mr. Griffin's lecture and it is good that someone is bringing this to the fore again (hence second look). The Lost Science of Money by Stephen Zarlunga and the Secrets of the Federal Reserve by Mullins along with many others tells the same story only decades before this book. The American Monetary Institute has been fighting this problem for years. This book is a recycle of the work of many others who have been sounding the alarm longer than Mr. Griffin has been on the planet.

Unfortunately, the author is extremely sloppy in his argumentation, and it is impossible to tell from one sentence to the next whether one is reading something that has a hope of historical foundation, or just more anti-banking and anti-banker rantings and ravings. The author is so unfair to his subjects, it is difficult to read this book without developing sympathy for the institutions and individuals he most wishes to criticize. One sided rant from start to finish.Even worse on monetary fundamentals, which apparently escape the author's comprehension.

If you want to know who runs this country and how they do it, as well as how long they have been doing it, then this is the book that will enlighten you.

An institution that is not part of the Federal Government but a private bank that is owned by the largest banks in this country as well as those from abroad. there are so many enlightening facts of the history of how this country is run that are uncovered by this book, that it really is a must read for everyone above the age of 18.

The book looks and feels daunting, weighing in at 5o lbs. (well, not literally) But G. Edward Griffin gives a guide at the beginning, suggesting to read the chapter introductions and summaries at the end of each chapter to get the whole substance of the book, then going back and seeing the story unfold with the context in your mind. I overlooked the \\"How-to\\" guide and was a third of the way into reading when I realized, \\"Hey, I could read the intros and summaries to get the gist of everything I'm reading.\\" Then I realized that's what Griffin had suggested. I kept going anyway. What seems like a daunting task becomes more familiar, once you understand the premise.Indeed, a cartel of power brokers calls the shots. In this book, you'll see how shadow banking prints money without backing to pay government debt and loan to financial institutions, how such practices and regulations drive inflation, and how the Fed has no accountability to the government or people for practices that could well ruin the economies of the world, and indeed, is intended to weaken the dollar in anticipation of a global economy to replace sovereign governments. Global crises, wars, and environmental activism all are tools the cabals use to weaken markets. It all looks helpless, but Griffin also provides prescriptions of what can be done to un-empower the grip the Fed has on markets.A heavy read, but if you're looking at Jeckyll Island, you're likely to be the kind of person who wants to know what's going on. Ignorance won't save you from the manipulations of the Fed. Knowledge is power.

And every dollar the governent spends - that it doesn't have - comes out of our pockets one way or another. Yes, they can print more money, but that make the money we have worth less & less. I've seen pictures of Germany after WW1 where they were taking a wheelbarrow full of money to the grocery store to buy food. Thankfully we have debit cards so it won't be as obvious. Have you noticed the prices creeping up on just about everything. As long as the government keep spending like there's no tomorrow, prices will keep rising - and our pay will not.Maybe they know something we don't?

I stumbled on it online a few years ago when I began to be aware that this country was in big trouble. It was a gnawing, undefined feeling that was in search of realization. It was a feeling that I wasn't getting the truth from the mainstream media...or, from anyone else for that matter. A feeling that things were spinning out of control and we were all just busily arranging the silverware in our guest rooms on the Titanic.Well, guess what? I wasn't wrong. We are sinking. And if you'd like a primer or jumping-off point for discovering how we got into this mess, I can think of no better place to start. Mr. Griffin writes with an ease and lucidity that make you not wonder, but understand, why these things haven't been explained in this manner before now; for if they were, the \\"jig,\\" as they say, would be up.The Fed is not the be-all and end-all of world corruption...but it ain't a half-bad place to start. You'll be amazed at what you'll find as you wind your way down the rabbit hole. Hold onto your hats and fasten your safety belts, cause it only gets worse.I hate to say that I feel it may be too late for this country to right the wrongs that are leading to our demise, but even if that is the case, it is prudent to know your enemy.

Reading this book chronologically has not worked for me. After reading the first few chapters (to get a firm basis of understanding of the subject matter), I skipped to other chapters that I was curious about.

Edward Griffin's book reads more like a mystery novel than an economic essay. It is wonderfully replete with historical facts about many of the players and about the actions that have led up to the present state of America and the World. Even if you don't agree with some of the author's conclusions -- and I don't -- this book is worth reading.Some reviewers have complained that there are too many conspiracies in the book. Since the players are mostly bankers and politicians, the conspiracy theories are mostly believable. On the other hand, manipulation of public opinion (Public Relations) and manipulation of politicians (lobbies) are all too common and not restricted to money politics. I would not read too much into these conspiracy theories.This book is wonderfully researched except where it is not. The author went to great lengths to get the story about the principal players. On the subject of money he relies heavily on John Kenneth Galbraith and his fascinating volume \\"Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went.\\" But for the supposed downward moving standard of living in America there is no proof, no statistics, no references worth mentioning, just the opinion of the author. This is sad indeed because it undermines the author's thesis that the Fed is evil and that it causes hardship. It is easy to see that the average American is better off in 2008 than his counterpart was in 1913. The technological and medical advances of this century have more than made up for the damage caused by the Fed. I suppose it would be too hard a task to prove the evilness of the Fed if in reality life is better now than in 1913. One can even argue that certain bubbles have been beneficial because they have created and left behind useful infrastructure such as the railroad bubble which left us the roads and recently the telecommunications bubble which left us the optic fiber infrastructure. The big losers in these bubbles were the speculators who did not exit on time and the big winners were the users of these infrastructures, i.e. the common man. The 1929 bubble and tulipmania do not share this beneficence.While I'm in agreement with the author on the need to curtail the Fed and the Congress, and while I agree that fractional reserve banking is a giant legalized Ponzi scheme, I do not agree with the return to a gold or silver standard. Prices are stable while the availability of money is in sync with the availability of products and services. The author states correctly that any amount of gold and silver will do because prices will adjust accordingly. What he fails to mention is that while the perceived advantage of these metals is their scarcity and constant level, the economy and the availability of goods and services is soaring, specially as the less developed nations finally take their place in the economic world. If the amount of gold and silver don't keep up with the availability of goods and services, the result must be deflation. Interestingly enough, in India people wear their money on their bodies in the form of silver ornaments. Maybe there is silver enough after all. This is another important area of research that is missing hence the conclusion that going back to a silver standard will be beneficial is not based on research but on ideological opinion.But the above argument is incomplete because money is not a fixed amount of silver any more than a river is a fixed amount of water. If the river stops flowing it is no longer a river. For good reason money is called a circulating asset. Here is a good definition of circulating assets: \\"Accounts receivables, inventory, work in process, cash, etc., that are constantly flowing in and out of a firm in the normal course of its business, as cash is converted into goods and then back into cash.\\" The faster money can change hands the less of it you need to match the availability of goods and services. It should be easy to see that in the 19th century when you had to physically exchange metal disks for merchandise the speed of money was a lot slower than in the 21st century when a click of the mouse can buy and sell the same merchandise at electronic speeds. We need a lot less metal for the same amount of goods and services now than before.While the book does not say it explicitly, Griffin is in favor of unfettered competition and in an ideal world it would be an ideal system. But capitalists hate competition and they use all sorts of mechanism to reduce it, many of them perfectly legal such as brand names. John D. Rockefeller hated competition and anyone who dared compete would get \\"a good sweating.\\" In practice this means that in addition to a government dedicated to protecting \\"life, liberty and property\\" it must also regulate commerce to some extent to protect the weak from the strong unless you are perfectly happy to let some sectors of society starve. While I do not think that people have the right to be fed and clothed, they do have the right to be protected from abuse by the wealthy.Griffin comes out in favor of private insurance in place of government sponsored FDIC. Had his time machine lingered in 2008 he would have seen that the private insurance of bonds turned out to be a total fiasco, witness the state AMBAC, MBIA and the other insurers find themselves in. The fiasco had nothing to do with insurance being public or private but with the fact the risk was poorly estimated. The bond insurers relied on the bond rating agencies (Standard & Poors, Moody's, Fitch and Duff & Phelps) who are paid by the bond issuers. Do you see the conflict of interest? The only collective benefit of private insurance is that the tax payer might not be saddled with the losses.At the end of the day it is not fiat money that is evil but the people who manipulate it to their own advantage as is shown page after page in Griffin's book. Proposing a gold or a silver standard does not go to the root of the problem, it simply aims to erect barriers that the evil money changers supposedly cannot overcome. A gold or a silver standard is not the solution, at best it is a palliative."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book opened my eyes and pissed me off more than any book I ever read!

I immediately thought of guillotines and that perhaps there was still a need, not for royals which are pawns, but for the bankers with their world government control fantasies.It is time for the Federal Reserve System to be dismantled.

I am not a conspirator or activist of any kind but I do have an open mind & have learned in this voyage of life not to just fluff things off because they could be intruding into my comfort zone. In my group of friends we have a word for people that believe everything the media throws at them as gospel truth , that word is \\" Sheeple \\" as in people being led around like sheep by the media along with corrupt politicians , businessmen , etc. making headlines in the newspapers, etc. Summing over what I've read in this book, a pattern & pieces are all coming together as in a police investigation.

BUT , the book just makes too much sense to ignore, the facts & proof are here, witnessed in everyday life regardless if you believe it or not. Every move you make in a big city or virtually anywhere is monitored by cell phone record ( including built-in GPS ), a credit card transaction, a traffic camera, your debit card ,etc. It is indeed \\" Scarey \\" as to the direction North America is leaning , our future , our children's future.

Edward Griffin on the subject of his 1994 book, now in its 4th edition--and soon to be in its 5th, The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve. The talk was given at the same time in Los Angeles. I, like many others, studied the Fed as part of Finance or Economics. I was therefore not sure what I was about to learn.It seems like the Fed is neither \\"Federal\\" nor does it have anything to do with \\"Reserves.\\" The Federal Reserve is also not a \\"Bank,\\" though we think we have a dozen of them throughout the country. Our current monetary system is not what maybe the majority of Americans believe it is. It is not a \\"savior\\" to protect us from economic disaster.Rather, it is the largest source of taxation in our land, though it is \\"hidden.\\" It is the major source of inflation, the cause of our \\"booms\\" and \\"busts,\\" and possibly the misunderstood foundation of government growth.Edward Griffin describes the secretive creation of the Fed, which is sure to surprise you if you have not heard of it before. He shows the manipulative and deceptive steps that enabled the idea of such a system to be approved by Congress. He details how a special purpose \\"cartel\\" was formed by the richest people in the world at the time, which would be to their great advantage as it would to Congress and its lust for limitless spending.Griffin calls it \\"Mandrake\\" for its magical ability to create money from nothing, and its ability to pass on this peculiarity to its \\"partner\\" banks. This might be the single-most factor that triggered the current economical climate, plus dozens of others since its creation.Congress does not need to pass laws, get our approval, or raise taxes to obtain spending money. It does not matter if there is money in the US Treasury. No, Congress simply has to go to the Fed, which will write the check, fill the Treasury and let the spending continue! It's a \\"hidden tax!\\" No one talks about it. Few understand it.Did you ever wonder why banks keep lending money on Credit Cards with seemingly little interest in getting payment on the principal? They just want the interest! When you can lend out unlimited cash, which costs you nothing, the important thing is to make whatever interest you can on it. Any interest is a winning situation. 15, 17, 19 and 21% is certainly a windfall, if not corrupt usury.Not sure you want to read the book? Buy the Audio talk on the book and then make your choice.

The book was given the highest rating because all statements within are backed up by references to news articles, quotes from those who were involved in conspiring to create a worldwide cartelized banking system, a list of those who participated at the Jekyll Island conspiracy, including an influential US Senator (Aldrich) and how these relationships intertwined to disadvantage all who have been forced to live under systems of fiat (counterfeit) money, and the incestuous relationships of those at the top of the central bank pyramid. There are those who still, after these many years, support this corrupt banking cartel stating that it can be \\"fixed\\", if only the Federal Reserve would stick to its mandate to moderate the economy, thus preventing boom and bust cycles, and point to the fact that the \\"Gold Standard\\" has also had its problems. What they don't say at the same time is the deterioration of the counterfeit government issued US Dollar to a mere 3% of its value from the time of passage of the Federal Reserve Act, and then lie about the inflation rate. With the huge deficits currently existing there is no chance that it will ever be paid back without bankrupting everyone, if taxes were the sole method employed.The book points out many historical examples that demonstrate that NO government issued counterfiet (fiat) money has EVER survived the test of time, while at the same time pointing to historical examples of ones that did survive as long as the medium of exchange had real value (gold or silver). One of the examples cited is that of the Bezant (from the Byzantine Empire), which lasted for 100's of years,and was widely accepted internationally because it represented honest value to those who used it. These critics also point out that fiat money has existed from time immemorial, as if that makes it legitimate. After you read this you will be innoculated against those who speak out of both sides of their mouths on the issue, which only means they are attempting desperately to justify corrupt monetary systems as ones who wear sheep's clothing but underneath are bankster agents.Join the many undetermined numbers of people who have bought and read this book. Total sales are unavailable, but the ratings on websites visited all provide the best ratings."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"The author in this book hates both inflation (hidden tax) and unemployment (disaster for most people). As is well known, there is a trade off between inflation and unemployment, that is, you cannot keep them both low! So, when in situation of high inflation and low unemployment, the author blames the hidden tax by government, while in low inflation and high unemployment, the author blames the bankers don't care about the life of people. However, the reader can always reverse the argument to praise the government and bankers.Apparently, the author is a hard-core bullionist and there has been a debate long ago back to 1800.Anyway, it is an interesting fiction!"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"I bought this book after reading about it in Robert Kiyosaki's (Rich Dad, Poor Dad) latest book. Kiyosaki - and others - have referenced it as a substantial book about the creation of the Federal Reserve and fiat currency.As soon as I began reading it, I noticed something odd: continuous references to socialism, communism, and world government. Turns out the author Griffin is a John Bircher - a member of a group that believes the world is secretly controlled by socialists. Sure enough, he brings out a host of bogeymen - CFR is continually mentioned; the Trilateral Commission makes an appearance. \\"Fabians\\" like George Bernard Shaw and Bertrand Russell; capitalists like Rockefeller and Morgan (a secret Brit!) - they have all conspired, throughout the ages, to bring George Orwell's novel to reality.Griffin does tell a compelling story about the creature created at Jekyll Island (the Federal Reserve), and he explains well the nature of money - what it is, where it comes from, and how our present currency is essentially based on nothing - all true. But you have to take some of his facts - maybe a lot of his facts - with a grain of salt, because he is so wacko with some of his beliefs. The fall of the Berlin Wall? Just a \\"Great Deception\\" he says.Throughout the book, Griffin occasionally acknowledges that greed is involved. At one point he puts \\"socialist\\" in quotes, and says a tyrant doesn't care about socialism, capitalism, fascism, or any \\"ism.\\" He just wants money. Exactly. But just as quickly, the author slips back into his conspiracies. Here's a weird quote near the end of the book: \\"A dramatic encounter with aliens shown on network television - even if it were entirely fabricated - could be used to stampede all nations into world government, supposedly to defend the Earth from invasion.\\" By this point in the book, my eyes have permanently rolled into the back of my head."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"The title of the book refers to the US Federal Reserve, the American bank of last resort created by a handful of powerful bankers on Jekyll Island. The book begins with a recount of the meeting, and then spends most of its pages showing how US and English bankers have manipulated world events by various ways for profit. The author argues that war is probably the greatest profit-making venture for banks, and that many of the wars in Western civilization over the past 300 years have been instigated by bankers either disguised as public servants, or by national leaders upon the advice or lobbying of bankers. Maybe the best, recent example is the US involvement in WWI. Here, the author marshals a quantity of evidence to show how J.P. Morgan and the Rothschild banking empire were profiting from WWI, and then connived with the British government to sacrifice the Lusitania in order to draw the US in.It is in the final interpretation of history that the author goes wayward. He argues that the final goal of the bankers is a global government run by the UN. The mold of this government is socialistic, essentially a complete welfare state without any money, where everyone has a role in the giant cog known as society. Utter baloney. I agree with the author that the world is seeing the rise of an all-powerful organization. And it is not the UN; it is the US military-industrial complex. Look at any crisis situation that have UN troops present, whether it is in Africa, Latin America or some Pacific island; UN troops are always outgunned, outnumbered and often kidnapped for ransom. Meanwhile, the US government has consistently flouted requests made by other nations in the UN. Probably the best example is Israel. Numerous UN resolutions dealing with the Israeli - Palestinian conflict have been killed by the US. Another good example is the treaty to ban landmines. One nation, the US, almost singlehandedly derailed this accomplishment. Take as another example; the presence of US military bases in over half of the world's countries. US troops, and US-backed militias are essentially running the drug wars in Latin America. So when the author makes predictions about the rise of an international government hostile to the US, he is full of crap.The book also makes a subtle attack on the modern environmental movement. Basically, the author states that extremely wealthy tycoons such as the Rockefellers are bankrolling the environmental movement as a way of gaining control over the world's resources. Again, utter crap. Yes, the Rockefeller family donates millions to environmental groups. But J.D. Rockefeller also donated money to colleges to subsidize the education of minority students, one of whom was Martin Luther King Jr. Does this imply the Rockefellers did this to gain control of African-Americans. I doubt it. Likewise with the support of environmentalism by wealthy people. This is not a back-handed way to control the world's resources. Extremely rich people, just like extremely poor people, and those in between, have causes they believe in and are willing to put money into without ulterior motives."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Firstly, I would like to begin this review by stating that I have the utmost respect for Mr. Griffin. I appreciate all that he has contributed in the struggle against the criminal elite. However, there are several misconceptions that need to be cleared up. Several of the banking concepts in the book are mis-placed. For instance, when a customer borrows money from a bank, the bank does not create money out of thin air. The loan is financed by demand deposits. I explain this with further detail in \\"THE FRAUD OF MONEY & BANKING\\".It is time that we come correct at all times. When truth comes, falsehoods must perish!If we are going to win this war against the criminal elite, we need to be sharp as a tack.Jose M.

He just got it and can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"In this book, the author argues that the entire modern financial system - that is, fiat money, central banks, fractional reserve banking, and so forth - is, in fact, a vast centuries-long conspiracy aimed at the formation of a global socialist government.In spite of the apparent absurdity of this premise, I read the book. To be fair, I will grant that the author has researched many of the topics well, and at times makes some valid observations about the consequences of poor monetary policies, both in the US and abroad. That being said, he also (in the tradition of conspiracy theorists everywhere) selectively ignores all evidence that contradicts his theory. For example, he attributes that fact that the overwhelming majority of economists dismiss his claims as being due to their \\"indoctrination\\" in graduate schools controlled by the conspiracy.The author also invents impressive-sounding terms - the \\"Mandrake Mechanism\\" and the \\"Rothschild Formula\\", for example - which appear to add nothing to his argument, save for the veneer of academic credibility. Unfortunately, anyone versed in economics will quickly see that there is nothing magical, hidden, or revolutionary in any of the ideas that the author has \\"discovered\\".One thing I found particularly irritating about the book is the author's apparent fascination with the effects of inflation - he seems to believe he has discovered something incredible in that an inflating currency loses purchasing power with time. In addition, he seems to regard this as a fundamental crime against humanity, and spends much of the book ranting about it. He does not, however, seem to give any thought to the economic effects of *deflation*, and seems to think that a perfect dream world of absolute price stability would occur if only we embraced his ideas.In summary, this book is somewhat entertaining, but written by someone with little grasp of modern economics, and is filled with selective data omission and logical fallacies. Like most conspiracy-theory cases, it sounds credible on the surface, but crumbles under real scrutiny. The real danger of books like this is that persons unversed in the nuances of the topic may embrace these ideas blindly, and make poor decisions - both as individuals and as voters - as a result."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"G.E. Griffin explains perfectly the creation of the US Federal Reserve by a tiny private financial oligarchy, but he fails to understand the real implications of the continuous greatest hold-up of all time (money is a means not an end). Moreover, the system he proposes is conservative (for the haves), reactionary (against the have-nots) and undemocratic (a small government controlled by the entrepreneurs).His analysisThe author's diatribe is an attack against the cartels (the FR system, the Rotschilds), the inflationary money printers and the government whose regulations disturb the free market.E.g., the S & L disaster was provoked by too much government regulation, not by financial liberalization, and not by the representative of the FR cartel, Paul Volcker, who drove interest rates into the stratosphere. Many S & L institutions went bankrupt and their clients were offered on a plate to the members of the FR cartel.For the author, the FR should be abolished because it is a catalyst of war. But, war is also only a means, not an end.His solutionThe world should return to a Gold Standard. Why gold? Because it guarantees price stability (for the haves) and is the enemy of the Welfare State (of the have-nots)!About gold, one should remember the astonishing dictum of H. F. Oppenheimer, the late chairman of the greatest gold (and diamond) mine in the world: \`people buy gold out of stupidity (and diamonds out of vanity.)'For G.E. Griffin, Social Security and other regulations should be totally controlled by the private industry in a system of free enterprise: no compulsory social safety net (and for those who lost their job?) and no environmental regulations (the scientific doom studies are fraudulent).He doesn't need the government. But, the governments all over the world had to save the worldwide financial system in 2008.Overall appreciationThe author doesn't understand the mightily important message of H. Kissinger: \`If you control the money, you control the entire world.' The aim of the FR cartel was (and is) full spectrum world dominance, politically, economically, financially, which it achieved after WW II when the dollar (printed by them and not interest free) was promoted to the only world reserve currency. But that was still not enough. The aim of the UN foundation was the formation of a world government, with one representative of the FR cartel as president.For the author, however, it doesn't make a difference whether the Fed is government or private: \`we don't want to merely abolish the Fed and turn over its operations to the Treasury.'The geopolitical, economical, financial power of the FR cartel and its implications for the history of the world are masterfully explained in \`Gods of Money\\" by F. William Engdahl.I cannot recommend G.E.

Such a wealth of reading, analysis, and grasp of history is condensed, summarized, and articulately arranged by the author for a reader's comprehension that one can largely feel only grateful for the author's generosity and intelligence.In regard to reading about this \\"creature\\" known as the Federal Reserve, while one learns of a few heart-warming actions taken by America's leaders, such as Thomas Jefferson's eloquent and passionate warnings to us against the banking industry and Andrew Jackson's fight to stop the institution of a central bank before his administration came to a close, most of what one learns is heartbreakingly bad news: the Federal Reserve began as a devious means of getting around the Constitution's explicit ban against the government printing money and using paper instead of gold and silver as the monetary standard; the destructive corporate cartels of the North against the South that caused the Civil War and helped the growth of the banking industry; the conspiratorial sinking of the Lusitania and the deliberate loss of American lives so as to allow the redistribution of American wealth to England; the deliberate machinations of international bankers that swept the U.S. into the Great Depression.The author characterizes those who instigated the institutionalizing of the Federal Reserve and who now protect and preserve it as amoral international accountants who are unafraid of playing both sides of an issue so long as profits continue to be gained.While the history of the Federal Reserve is only sketchily drawn after the Great Depression, we are led to conjecture safely and soundly that the events of World War II, the Korean War, the War in Vietnam, and all other wars America has participated in to the present hour have been and are special monetary projects for and of the Federal Reserve.The last 180 pages or so are the most disappointing in that they are more speculative, theoretical, and opinionated and, thus, are not necessary to an historical account of the Federal Reserve.This reader was disappointed, for instance, to learn the author asserts that industry sadly leaves the United States for foreign lands when it finds itself confronted with \\"regulations\\" over that industry's toxic waste, as if to say (in that childish and Libertarian sort of way) all industry should feel free to dump toxic waste where it lists without any responsibility for its excess because it should remain free as long as it is produces in an economy that supports industry. This reader was also disappointed to learn that the author's real and only solution to the destructive powers of the Federal Reserve on our economy is his suggestion that we return to the silver and gold standard of our Founding Fathers and the Constitution. While a return to the silver and gold standard is a reasonable alternative to a compete financial holocaust -- should we somehow rid ourselves of the Federal Reserve and stop the printing of fiat money, the author can provide little practical advice as to how that might be accomplished politically.The disappointments with this book are small and few, however. The overall perspective is and should be appreciation and gratitude for the grand and magnificent (I did not want to use the adjective \\"fantastic\\" a second time) scope of the author's historical context which is well-analyzed and clearly written such that even an intelligent 14-year-old girl or boy can learn. What history teaches here is, however, too horrible for an adolescent's comprehension. It's plenty scary (and disillusioning) stuff for the adult mind."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Griffin say that the Federal Reserve System is a giant conspiracy created to inflate the money supply in order to make the bankers rich, keep the politicans supplied with enough cash to get reelected, lower the American standard of living, and buy off foreign dicators. Then when everything gets real bad, the internationalists at the top will step in and \\"fix things\\" by imposing a world-wide socialist regime. The most disturbing thing is that it all seems true. Marx had it wrong--inflation, not private property, is theft."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This is a scary book. Once you start reading, you realize how troublesome our current system is. I would love to go to the gold standard. It's certainly the best way to avoid the problems we see today. The issue is going to be how to convert our current system back without chaos. Maybe there's a book that addresses this but I'd like to know more about the top tier of the banking system and what it does with the money. Are these people simply sociopathic inbreeds that keep the money and power within their own families, etc.? What can you possibly do with a gazillion dollars that you can't with a few million? Why visit pain and suffering on the human condition in the world via wars/recessions/depressions to generate money? What is the profit for? Where does it go? What do they spend it on? I certainly don't begrudge them making as much as they can in a free-market system (not that it exists necessarily) but the methods laid out in this book seem immoral due them centering on getting governments to give favor to one group over another via subtrefuge. Good start."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Do you ever wonder how the financial system really works? What money is? Where it comes from? You'll find answers here. Just be careful to distinguish between historical fact and the author's opinions, the lines between which he intentionally blurs.I was fascinated enough to trudge through all 608 intense pages and have learned a lot. Griffin is not a great author but he is a good one and certainly capable enough to spice up the relatively dull subjects of wars, economic cycles and inflation with some of his documentary film-maker flair. At the very least I now think I understand how the US government is able to suddenly spend a billion dollars a day to wage war without it ever having been sitting around before. They can, after all, print the world's currency, and that, as you'll see, has enormous global consequences."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"Quick review: This is a great read - just be prepared to be upset if, like me, you believe the sworn duty of our elected officials is to uphold the God-given rights written in the Constitution and no more.

If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.\\" Thomas Jefferson, our 3rd PresidentI sit before you tonight with a great deal of concern for the future of our nation. In 1913 President Woodrow Wilson passed into law the Federal Reserve, and once this banking cartel(part private bank backed by government) came into being it brought with it the seeds of misery and totalitarianism. Griffin will tell you a tale that reads better than any fiction novel about a private network of Central banks that plan to enslave the world through a one world currency and government. He documents everything he brings before the reader with congressional records, U.N. documents, and the words of the international bankers themselves. By the end of this book you will see the Federal Reserve for what it really is: A mechanism of our republics destruction, a mechanism of taxation via the hidden tax inflation, and one of the greatest threats to both our liberty and freedom. I can not put into words the impact this information has had on me. A well researched and thorough book not only of our Federal Reserve system, but of all the torment that has and will someday come with it; some of which you are starting to witness now.

Books on the \\"power elite\\" have been available for many decades, and I have no problem believing that the world's bigwigs collude as necessary to keep their power and fortunes intact. The author's commentary about the Council on Foreign Relations sounds particularly credible to me.

Griffin simplifies the banking / money system so anyone can understand the basics as related to the book.For those of us trying to make sense of the craziness going on in our political system, this book connects many dots from prior research and study of the American political / economic system in the 20-21st centuries. For those \\"inquiring minds that want to know\\", this will make sense of the seemingly senseless. Thinking back to business school days, the Money and Banking class never covered (or uncovered) what Griffin has communicated.Griffin documents his proclamations by quoting others in their own words. Chronologically, we look at a history of money and banking going back to the Revolutionary War looking at cause and effect. For example, monetary policy dramatically shaped the events of the Civil War; a far different history than most of us studied in school. Do you think that international finance had much to do with the creation of the Fed? Again, more eye opening history. Which individuals sponsored the UN and for what purpose? What is the relationship / ties between the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund; how does that impact the average U.S. citizen? How does the Council on Foreign Relations fit into the picture? Most importantly though, do we really understand the Fed's involvement in inflation and how that impacts the political process and ultimately every one of us? These questions and many others get addressed.\\"Follow the money\\" was the concept we learned from Watergate as described in \\"All the President's Men\\". When we look at banking history and its key players we see their impact on our American history and the irony of democracy. When we follow the money, we can connect many of those dots that didn't make a lot of sense standing on their own.I was disappointed that the 2008 meltdown was not covered in detail in this 2010 (5th) edition. Although a topic for a new book, the Griffin could have spent more time on the subject. I get skeptical of authors / publishers who float a \\"new edition\\" without adding value to the last release.I always look at the negative book reviews to get better insight on anything I missed. Griffin was and probably remains a member of the John Birch Society and has Libertarian views. Is he a conspiracy theorist? Does he have an anti-socialist agenda? The presentation of the material was professional and well cited. Each reader is tasked with discerning fact from fiction and validating opposing viewpoints. Thanks!George"},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book is educational and long but a very great enjoyable read just the same. This book should be read by all Americans who truly care about the issues facing our nation as it provides a perspective that none of our politicians or the media are addressing. It discusses the impact that the Federal Reserve and their economic policies are having on our nation and the world. It provides a great history of central banks up to the creation of this current version of a central bank we have in place now. It further details their destructive policies which actually accentuate the boom and bust financial cycles even though their stated purpose is to minimize them. Further it discusses the fact that the Federal Reserve enables the government to waste our resources and limit our freedoms. I first read this book about one and a half years ago but lent my copy to a friend and never got it back. I just bought it again because I want to read it again and I think it needs to be permanent part of my library."},{"Title":"The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve","review":"This book should absolutely be on an \\"informed citizens' must read\\" list. The author goes to great lengths to successfully break down and explain what is purposefully made to be an extremely complicated issue. For doubters, this book is also very well sourced.This book could not be anymore relevant than right now. Behind the current economic crisis is the Federal Reserve (which is neither Federal, nor a reserve). If you're at all interested in understanding the current economic crisis, where our American money actually comes from (hint: not from any conceivable dimension located on this planet), how the Fed is the head of a decaying, corrupt system, and how the Fed impersonates an official Federal agency, you should not hesitate to purchase this book. Give it to a friend when you're done reading it, too. The more people that know the crimes of the Fed, the better. Especially now in the haze of the Occupy Wall Street protests, people need to be awoken to the true enemy (hint: it's not Wall Street [yes, they're part of the problem, but they aren't THE problem]) and how the Fed has been destroying our country since its inception in 1913.Think we live under a true free-market system?

I had a lot of stuff to get through before I picked up this book, the 5th Edition, and I was intimidated by its size. I like 250 page books, bigger than that and I often do not finish them. So, I followed the advice in the front of the book, I read the summaries and the introductions of every chapter. Before long I had plunged into the meat of this documentary that often reads like a 'who done it' novel. I know enough about history, economics, and politics, to recognize the truth and precision of the author is his analysis of the creation of our monetary system. This is fascinating, and I could not put it down. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BOOKS THAT MUST BE READ BY EVERY THINKING AMERICAN CITIZEN. I have been studying our Nation, economics, politics, history and society for 4 decades, this is the most important, practical book I have read given our current situation. You can go to the other reviews to examine the content, so I will not review it here.

(He is from the same school thought as the famous Austrian economist, Ludwig Von Mises.) If you want to know more about the Fed, how it came to be, how it operates, what causes inflation, and what a sane money system would actually look like, this is your book. As a boy of 12, I once lost a dollar on the way to a local mall, and wondered what impact this would have on the economy. I wondered how a piece of paper with no intrinsic value could matter to me and how its loss perturbed the system in which I was participating. Answering those questions gave me the ability to recognize people who knew what they were talking about in economics--and here's a hint: It's not Paul Krugman, the famous nobel-prize winning socialist.

How awful, then, it is to realize that in \\"Little Match Girl\\" fashion, the Tie Man's \\"miracle\\" is his death. Even worse for the children in the story to understand that they have unwittingly wished for--and caused--this. To think that for decades all the Tie Man wanted to do was die so he could \\"reunite\\" with his family is a message of despair, not of hope.Survivors of the Holocaust and other family-destroying tragedies have found strength to create new lives for themselves and to make a positive impact on humanity, not just to mark time until they die; why the Tie Man is portrayed as incapable or uninterested in doing so is the central tragedy in this book.The anguish I felt for the title character was replaced by anger at the manipulative text. The pictures are engaging and the title and beginning of the story are deceptive. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a good book to read to your children."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"I first read The Way of the Traitor several years ago and found it quite interesting. Now, as I write this review, I am sitting in a computer cafe in Nagasaki.Rowland's plot is quite good. Sano has found himself essentially exiled from Edo by his unintended rival the Shogun's Chamberlin. He is given the task of \\"inspecting\\" Nagasaki which is just about as far from Edo as you can go and still be in Japan. Given the state of transportation systems in Japan during the Shogunate, it is possible the chamberlain was hoping Sano wouldn't survive the journey.Nagasaki is Japan's window to the world and it is tightly guraded and only open a crack. The only authorized westerners in Japan are the Dutch and the are kept on a small man-made island in the harbor. Origianlly the concession was given to the Portugese who along with trade brough Christianity and this ultimately lead to the banning of Christian teachings, the expulsion of the Portugese and the persecution of Japanese Christians. The Dutch have filled the void left by the departed Portugese becasue they aren't interested in spreading the gospel, just@making profits on their investments. They can't leave the island unescorted and no Japanese can enter except on official business. To even go on the island one is required to take and oath against Christianity and desecrate Christian icons. The penalty for not adhering to the oath is severe - death.Sano's arival coincides with the disappearance of one of the Dutch trading mission from the island. It is this investigation which Sano finds himself involved with that almost cost Sano his life in several different ways.The plot is well set out. The are a large number of potential suspects ranging from@the surviving Dutch traders to a Chinese religious leader to corrupt local officals. It is not an easy trail for Sano to follow and Rowland makes the sidetracks and false leads quite intriguing. The conclusion to the investigation is excellently done.I have read this book several times and have found it just as entertaining now as when I first got it. Now reading it in Nagasaki it is almost like being in a time warp. Looking at the Nagasaki of today, it is easy to not see the houses clustering on the hills around the city and to see it as it was in the late 17th Century. It is a hot, humid and foggy night as I sit here writing - just the right conditions for a stranger to the city to look for a murderer who might be any one of a number of people.Rowland is an exceptional story teller. Sheweaves an exceptional tale of the very narrow meeting point between Japan and the rest of the world. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes history interlaced with their fiction."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"Sano is a detective who is torn between a world, which is attempting to maintain its identity and at the same time deal with modernity. Sano's character embodies the conflicts between these two worlds, however, his true master is the quest for the truth. Similar to the Shinju, Rowland's earlier book, Sano has to overcome overwhelming odds in order to solve a murder however this time finds himself uncovering governmental corruption. Rowland has mastered the art of historical accuracy and suspenseful foreplay."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"Ever been set up by a middle manager that wants to make you look bad to make himself look better? Well imagine that the consequence is beheading instead of a write up. That's what the hero face in this exploration of predjudice, paranoia and murder. Fun story, good detective work and good action spice up this book of value exploration."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"Of the three Samurai mysteries I've read so far, this is the most satisfying. It is amazing how one can put familiar, tried-and-true mystery plot elements into a fresh historical setting and make it that much more interesting. By toning down on the tawdry, deviant erotica and developing her supporting characters more (i.e. Hirata), Ms. Rowland has made her story more &quot;mainstream&quot; when compared to her two earlier novels. If you're looking for a quick read over the weekend, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"The third in the Japanese historical series, this one takes Sano Ichiro from Edo to Nagasaki on an inspection. It's 1690 and Nagasaki is the one place where barbarian traders (the Dutch East India Co.) are permitted to come and trade. Sano is quickly embroiled in investigating the death of the head of the Dutch trade mission, which spins off into smuggling and possibly an illegal Christian underground. As usually, there is a lot of interesting history and social custom imparted in the course of the whodunit, which is good, 'cause Sano's inner conflict and the actual mystery aren't all that compelling in and of themselves."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"This is the latest book in the continuing series of Sano the samurai detective, and in my opinion the best. Each of Rowland's books continue to outdo the previous ones, and Way of the Traitor is no exception. The plot is full of twists and turns and is brilliantly written. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"I was very impressed by Rowland's work after reading The Concubine's Tattoo. I felt she had a real knack for drawing complex characters with believable motivations. I was completely drawn into the world she portrays, and I found Sano an interesting character with some very believable problems. My one criticism of the novel was its melodramatic ending. Then I read Shinju and had much the same reaction.But The Way of the Traitor is melodrama through and through, unredeemed by any of the depth of feeling that marks the others. The author's attempts to flesh out her characters by the use of flashbacks to their earlier lives fails badly, and the plot is like something out of Enid Blyton, with mysterious lights and smuggler's coves. By the time I got to the last couple of chapters I no longer cared about any of it, least of all who the guilty parties were."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"Just didn't do anything for me. The &quot;mystery&quot; was transparent, the characters cardboard."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"These series of novels are all pretty good.

Again, not the greatest but certainly enjoyable"},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"This novel picks up where Rowland's last Sano Ichiro novel left off: once again, Sano is the victor in the battle against crime, but loser of the war that rages within the Shogun's household. And, once again, his enemy is the Shogun's favorite, Yanagisawa. Sano finds himself essentially exiled to Nagasaki, the only port in which Japan allows foreigners -- closely watched, of course. A Dutch trader is murdered, and Sano offers to unearth the murderer, a seemingly impossible, and politically suicidal, task. Will Sano persevere? Since this is a series of novels, it's pretty obvious he will solve the case. However, I don't think I can take much more of Sano and his associates constantly beaten, wounded, and almost assassinated! The most interesting part of the book, in my opinion, is the picture of foreigners Rowland paints in the book: they are, to Sano and other Japanese, dirty, smelly, and almost completely uncivilized. The fact that Sano needs one of the Dutch delegation's help challenges his detective and physical senses to the extreme. Rowland is historically accurate in her depiction of the xenophobia present in Japan, and the fears that foreigners will somehow pollute the purity of Japanese culture, something that James Clavell did so well in 'Shogun'."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"As the third book featuring Sano Ichiro, I was anxious to read it once I picked it up. The politics in Bundori whetted my appetite, and I was ready for more.The story takes place a year-and-a-half after Bundori. Sano has not yet married, still mourning the loss of his love. He has also found that there is little he can do to change the corrupt administration of the government and is despondent about the corruption. Strangely enough, Hirata, Sano's chief retainer, is despondent over his service to Sano as he does not seem to want to be protected and takes unnecessary risks. If Way of the Traitor does anything, it solidifies the relationship between Sano and Hirata, setting up their companionship for the later books.Sano is sent to Nagasaki where he has to unravel the mystery behind the murder of the head of the Dutch East India Company. As the story progresses, the stakes increase, and Sano takes more risks, putting his life and reputation at stake. Through the course of the story, he uncovers corruption in the administration of Nagasaki, develops camaraderie with the Dutch doctor and is convicted of treason himself.In the end, Sano lives, and he returns to Edo (the series would be very different if he did not). However, it is the lessons he learns that makes the story important in the development of the character. For that is the purpose of the book in the overall series, developing Sano to deal with the challenges in the later books.Now my complaint is since the story takes place in Nagasaki, I have the feeling that I will not see most of these characters ever again. As such, the politics were less pressing. I like the world Rowland is developing, and Nagasaki is on the edge of this world. Now, I hope I am wrong, but I will not know until I push farther into series.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has read the previous ones. I am less likely to recommend this book on its own since it builds so much upon the events of Bundori."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"This was a letdown after the entertaining Bundori. The meeting of east and west, however, was an intriguing glimpse of how foreigners were treated and thought to be like. I also found the ending rather dull.

I bought the hardcover and really regretted it."},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"Laura Joh Rowland has me hooked on 17th century detective, Sano Ichiro. While telling an intricate tale of murder, treason and political intrigue, she has deviously educated me in the ways of feudal Japan. The rich tapastry she lays out will keep your mind awashed in a temporal painting of your mind. This book is a page turner. I literally could not put it down. I had to know what would happen in the next paragraph, the next page, the next chapter . . . and now that I've finished, the next book. I'm truly sorry I did not become aquanted with Sano Ichiro earlier but I plan on picking up the previous two books in the series Shinju and Bundori. GREAT READING!"},{"Title":"The Way Of The Traitor","review":"The Way of the Traitor was okay. It had it's twists and turns and the suspense, but it lacked the punch that I liked in Rowland's previous book Bundori. The main character, Sano, had to leave Edo so none of the characters whom I loved to loathe wasn't in this book. Also, I wanted the author to have done more with the sidekick, Hirata.

One of the fine things about Rq was in my opinion that it gave you a unique world to adventure in, (many games do that I know) but what made Rq stand out for me was the fact that Glorantha was so well thought out and detailed. So you had as much info as you could need to set your own tales and adventures in.I have a group getting ready to play in this classic setting right now and we can't wait to dive into the rich detail this (and I know many other) Glorantha set Rq pack has within it.The last thing I'd like to praise is the fact this book despite having a paper binding is put together with tough paper and stitched bindings!

Kunstler: The Most Hated Lawyer in America","review":"I don't support many of Kunstler's views, outrageous statements and his representation of many of his criminal clients. The courage of civil rights movement lawyers was beyond powerful and Kunstler got involved with the Freedom Rider's case which ignited his fiery passion to be a radical lawyer . Author David J. Langum is a smart story teller because I was entertained when I wasn't being shocked. I had to laugh when he writes about the amount of mail the Chicago 7 received including a letter with some pot which Kunstler and his clients smoked together. Kunstler had unconventional boundaries with clients and Langum has some interesting theories on why. This book did not turn me into a Kunstler admirer but Langum made me think hard about \\"conveying a message/education to the public\\" using \\"movement law\\". I live in the East Village and we have been mega dormed to death by NYU and even NY Law with a zone busting mega dorm \\"with balconies\\" for law students on 3rd St. and my point is these law students seem to care more about their balcony views than what is going down in the communities that are being gobbled up by their Universities. I would like the zone busting part of NY Law dorm removed and everyone of those students to do volunteer work for the evictions and struggles caused by their Universities and other greedy landlords exploiting our neighborhoods. I doubt the NY Law students would do so and those balconies are more enticing but it would be interesting to hear what Kunstler might have said about all this since Langum mentions that he taught at NY Law and William M. Kunstler, I am guessing, also loved our neighborhood with all the texture and characters (although we are losing both every day). I would like to think he would have tried to help. P342 Langum does write, \\"Kunstler worried especially about the young people, their materalism and lack of social activism.\\" I would add \\"institutions of higher learning\\" like NYU and NY Law with their community crushing mega dorms are encouraging anything but students with passion for social activism.I am surprised Oliver Stone hasn't made one of his three hours long films from this book but I wouldn't go see the film; the book was enough and \\"fair\\" with lots of grey tones that would not make it into the movie version. There are many ironic notes in this book and for me the most ironic is the back cover which says New York University Press."},{"Title":"William M. Kunstler: The Most Hated Lawyer in America","review":"Stand-up comedy is not in the index of this book, but it gets mentioned. Along with a list of Kunstler's film credits is a note that when he tried a comedy routine, he got his biggest laugh for a lawyer joke. I was interested, a long time ago, in what Chapter 6 of this book calls Circus in Chicago. Back when I was contemplating what I might like to do in a career in law, I would have enjoyed the opportunity to generate the number of laughs that are contained in this book. Then I actually found a case that said &quot;Resort to the courts is futile.&quot; That was such a change from my expectations that an element of humor creeps into my appreciation of the outrageous nature of that truth. As evidence that the author of this book is aware of the potent nature of that form of humor, picture this: &quot;Kunstler objected. The United States attorney jumped up and argued, 'This is outrageous. This man [Kunstler] is the mouthpiece for these defendants. The Government protests this man's attitude.'&quot; (p. 124) I thought that the best legal point in the book was that Bobby Seale could not be retried on the conspiracy charge after the jury found that the other seven defendants were not guilty of conspiracy. Seale hadn't been charged with anything else, so further proceedings in his case would have been pointless. If there is a fine line between legal logic and the quirks of the system, check this book for the side of the line where the quirks are, and maybe you have already seen bits and pieces of this story on TV. It sure made the newpapers when it was going on."},{"Title":"When Eight Bells Toll","review":"\\"The Peacemaker Colt has now been in production, without change in design, for a century.\\" An inciteful beginning to MacLean's first tale in three years, after Lawrence of Arabia: A Biography (he also released Ice Station Zebra in '63). This sentence is a perfect example of the humor (you'll know it's humor soon enough) MacLean writes into our hero's personality.While I've noticed MacLean's first-person narratives contain fair amounts of his dry wit, When Eight Bells Toll is the first book of his that has made me laugh out loud on several occasions. My favorite part was when Philip Calvert, the hero, is running through trees in a heavy downpour, and he can't see where he is going, so he keeps running into trees. His thoughts as this is happening is simply a delight to read! A British secret service agent with a sense of humor.Of course, MacLean's book is not all laughable. Calvert and his boss must figure out why ships and their crews are disappearing - and each vessel had been carrying valuable cargo. I enjoyed reading Captain Imrie's doppelganger (he's a far nicer character in Bear Island).MacLean isn't afraid of killing off characters. And he throws in the usual dash of twists to toss the reader off his seat, although it has fewer than some of his other books. The book is also loaded with exposition. I found myself dragging my eyeballs over some of the pages, unfortunately.While the book kept me guessing to the very end -- and you're guessing about an extraordinary amount of things -- I didn't feel it was MacLean's strongest work. This is on a sliding scale, of course, as I feel MacLean's tales are more complex in design and more realistic than many modern books published today.The title refers to seafaring vessels and crew who keep track of time by ringing bells. Eight bells represents six different hours of the day, one of which is midnight. Of the time-span each chapter represents, I noticed chapter six (8:40 pm - 10:40 pm) is the only chapter that takes place between the three bells and six bells of the first (evening) watch, meaning eight bells never \\"toll\\" during this chapter. Unrelated, but interesting to note, is that a Christian church will ring a bell nine times for the death of someone.Mr. MacLean also slightly rewrote the story for the 1971 film with Anthony Hopkins."},{"Title":"The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon, 1967-1976","review":"This book by Professor Farid Khazen is a good read and is well-researched. However, it is an attempt to articulate in academic mantle the Right Wing view in the Lebanon War that the Palestinians were largely responsible for the decay of the Lebanese state, supported by radical Arab states and the Soviet Union. Prof Khazen moves then to a meticulous refutation of Lefitst views of the war, denying that sectarian divisions led to the war or that there were legitimate social and economic grievances among the Lebanese (as the leftists were syaing). Despite the length of Prof Khazen's book, I don't find it satisfying as an account of what happened in Lebanon in the period 1967-1976, nor does it cover adequatley the destructive role played by the Lebanese elites in these tragic years."},{"Title":"The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon, 1967-1976","review":"A good reference book -- but only if you really need the details, otherwise this is deffinitely a biased account of the war.

Read this book before delving into all the assorted information out there-- you'll get a good idea of the concepts, rituals, meanings, and what direction you want to go on your own spiritual path without having to wade through the author's agenda, no matter how well-meaning they might be.--As for the printing: This is printed from a copy of the original set. The text is crisp and looks good, but the images are too dark and look like an obvious reprinting of some guy's copy.

In fact, as I started to read it, I told myself that I would finish the pack I had just bought and then try to stop smoking for a week or so. Then, as I neared the end of the book, I threw the pack away. I was literally anxious to become a non-smoker.

It was the easiest and most enjoyable way to quit smoking, no lie. You can't describe the feeling of the \\"Magic Button\\" being pushed untill you experience it yourself.Six months ago, I started smoking again. I read the book again and it didn't work. The button just wasn't there. I was too filled with self-disgust, fear and foolishness to let the book work for me. With the added tedious nature of reading the full length book for the second, third and forth time (without the elated \\"Magic Button\\" feeling), it just wasn't working.This morning I read The Little Book of Quitting and I felt that button pushed in my mind. I know I have quit smoking again, once and for all. It sounds crazy, but I just know.I think the big difference is that on my second and subsequent attempts I expected the book to work magic without really letting the content sink in. My advice would be to read with no expectations. Don't think about how it's going to work, just let it work.I would reccomend The Little Book of Quitting for people who were in my situation.

He set about saving his crew and himself. They made their way to a small, desolate bit of island shore, from which Shackleton and five men journeyed 800 miles in a 22-foot open boat across the most dangerous sea in the world. A trek through miles of snow-covered mountain wilderness finally brought rescue. And everybody survived! Shackleton's is an epic tale of true adventure and derring-do, and he tells it with the straight-ahead momentum of an ice breaker diving into the pack. He sees beauty in the Antarctic, and he carries a touch of poetry (Browning, anyway) in his soul. He is also a detail man, and his flights of descriptive eloquence bog down amid facts, figures, wind speeds and diatomous striations. But this piling-on of minutiae proves riveting in the action sequences (most of the book). We feel like we are there. Having told his own party's tale, Shackleton gives a useful if anticlimactic account of the Ross Sea wing of the expedition - a story with its own generous measure of adventure, heroism and poignancy."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"This review refers to \\"South - A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage\\" - Ernest Shackleton-(unabridged audio/Blackstone Audiobooks)read by Geoffrey HowardIf I was just rating this book for myself, I would give it 5 stars. But as a reviewer making recommendations, I have to say that this personal account of Shackelton's important and historic expedition - destined for Antarctica- may not be a great read for everyone.As a lover of the sea, sea adventures and voyages combined with historical journeys of exploration, I became addicted to this book. However about one third of the way through, I realized that had it not been for my knowledge of nautical terms I would not have known what he was talking about half the time. The reading would have lost me early on. It may seem also at times a bit monotonous to those seeking a great adventure story. Ernest Shackelton was a great explorer and mariner, the story is one fraught with peril and survival,but his personal account of the voyage is a bit matter of fact,even dry.On the eve of WWI, Shackleton and his crew took on this ill-fated journey with high hopes and high moral. Prepared for the worst was not enough though. They met with the most horrific of conditions, losing their ship,much of their essential supplies, their much needed team of dogs, and much more. They spent months on months literally living on the ice. Making it to Elephant Island, a handful of men including Shackleton formed a party to search for help and once again were to fight the elements for months on end. The account also includes the story of the Aurora and her crew that also fought the climate trying to bring supplies to the Shackleton crew.The read, by Geoffrey Howard(about 9 1/2 hours) helped quite a bit in putting some emotion into this memoir and had me wanting to find out what happened next. So my recommendation on this book would definitely be for the audio edition. And at that I would say, it is for those who love anything to do with the sea voyage. For History lovers I would suggest checking out some of the other books written about \\"The Endurance\\" and these very brave men.Cassette edition:South(the one I read)There are some great memoirs of explorations out there. One I would highly recommend, isThe Essential Lewis and Clark Selections CD(see my review for book details).Happy New Year To All...Laurie"},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"Synopsis: British explorers head to Antarctica in 1914, get stuck in the ice of the Weddell Sea--\\"the worst sea in the world\\"--, watch their ship crushed and sunk, and then over months make their way miraculously to safety in three open boats through crushing ice, blizzards and orcas, across hundreds of miles of South Atlantic ocean, with all hands rescued. And the other party, on the other side of the South Pole, loses three men to disease and folly.\\"We had pierced the veneer of outside things...\\" So summarized Shackleton as he emerged from the months of cold, hunger and pure misery.If you're going to get into the 1914 Shackleton Antarctic expedition, the wreck of the Endurance and the ordeal and eventual rescue of its crew, arguably the greatest true tale of hardship overcome ever recorded, this is where you should start. This is the real deal, directly from the man who did it, the hero himself. But, there are elements of the story that I expected but were not offered in depth. In the end it seems Shackleton is providing a shrewdly crafted homage to his resourcefulness and leadership, while cleverly not addressing the fundamental lapses in planning and judgment that led to the disaster.Reading the opening chapters, and already being familiar with the basics of the story, I kept asking: If Shackleton had devoted the depth of planning, resourcing, leadership and unflinching singleness of purpose to the entire expedition before it began that he displayed once his men and ship were in peril, maybe none of this would have happened. He offers as the book concludes only that the problems were not a lack of organization, but \\"overwhelming natural obstacles\\" and the Weddel Sea weather. He ascribes their tragedy to luck: \\"...there seemed no reason to anticipate then that the fates would prove unkind.\\"Shackleton comes across as a relentless leader and manager only once things got truly serious; this, after all, saved his crew. But before the expedition started, to my reading Shackleton was too consumed with coordination, communication with sponsors and well-wishers, securing ships, crew, funding and resources to really contemplage where he was going and how the entire undertaking could go south on him, which it quickly did. It seemed the only time a Plan B was even considered was when the time to develop one was forced upon them.The overall undertaking, the first ever crossing of the Antarctic continent, \\"the last great adventure in the history of South Polar exploration,\\" of course was about hardship, adventure and discovery in the name of King and Country, and personal glory. The narrative is very imperial. It's all \\"pup-pup\\" and \\"cheerio,\\" with the men breaking into song in a freezing gale on the open ocean, jocular as they slowly freeze and starve. Complaining and whinging are absent from all, and I do not recall even reading either of these words in the book. Shackleton's account offers a vision of a crew highly cohesive and united, which in the end is what saves them. There is only one mention of Shackleton having to \\"use rather drastic methods\\" with despondent or unmotivated men, who go unnamed. There must have been massive morale issues, and I wanted to get into this aspect of the situation. Sadly, these are almost completely absent. This is not to say Shackleton is puffing himself up; he constantly takes the lead in all risks, as a leader should. I wonder if this was compensatory behavior for having gotten them into the predicament to begin with.The book climaxes at about the 2/3 point with the rescue of the Endurance crew. Then comes the tale of the Ross Sea party, and their three deaths from lack of preparation and simple folly. The implication is stronger leadership would have prevented the losses.A major flaw in this book is the absence of any maps that would situate the action. There are a few hand-drawn diagrams of bivouac sites and trekking routes, but nowhere in this book are any maps or charts showing the regions in play. With so much of this book taking place across large areas of both land and sea, in areas with which the reader likely is unfamiliar, the omission of maps is a staggering editorial oversight.Another major frustration are the photographs. There are quite a few of them, but they are completely out of chronological order and their placement in the book best described as happenstance. A far better choice would have been one or two central plate sections, in which the photos were offered in chronological order.The story is dense with facts about the sea and ice, many references to geographic position and weather, but still reads quickly (374 pages total). It drags in a few points, such as the time between the Endurance becoming stuck in the ice and when the adventure begins. There is a lot of day-to-day, which becomes a bit tedious.There a couple of appendices, Shackleton's way of saying the doomed expedition wasn't really a failure, that there were meteorological and scientific advances. The appendices are dull and dry, offering interesting tidbits, but are far too short to prove Shackleton's assertion. There is also a scant index, covering only the broadest subjects and most important individuals.There are five or six distasteful instances of direct and unflinching racism, from Shackleton and the crew. Of course, when this was written in the 1910s, such a notion was unfathomable to them. These are words reflective of imperial times, but deft editing could communicate the same information and avoid unpleasant terms.Bottom line: In the annals of survival leadership, this is probably the greatest story of them all; Shackleton brings every single man home. But, it remains unexplored how he came to be in this situation in the first place."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"I really think that this was the best book I ever read. The story of how Shackleton surmounted impossible odds to save all of his people when they were stranded in the Antarctic is the best inspirational story of leadership I have ever encountered. I can't imagine not enjoying this book."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"Poor Shackleton. In all his life it seems he allways came late or second, allmost made it or, as in this story, did not reach his goal at all.Most amazing in his last expedition is that no lives were lost, though probably encountering the worst circumstances of the expedions I know of.Most remarkably are the stunning photo's by Frank Hurley. The negatives were either transported over ice and sea, or (no book provided me with that information) were allready developed on the ice. In my copy of this book (printed probably around 1935), but not found in all later editions, one of these negatives is in good quality full-colour, made in 1914!"},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"Very few had the courage, fortitude or persistent determination of leadership as Sir Ernest Shackleton in the pursuit of new knowlege, and the survival of his entire party, in the completion of their expedition in reaching the South Pole.

It's a riviting read and amazing story."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"This book is written by a man of his time. It has few embellishments and could be described as being written in an understatement. Do not look for character developments or a sense of the privations and living conditions during this period.Two other books (to my knowledge) were written by Shackelton's companions and I would commend both to a reader. Worsley's book is a more readable account of this journey; while &quot;Shackelton's Argonauts&quot; (by the photographer Frank Hurley) covers similar ground and includes an account of those who stayed on Elephant Isle."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who manages people.It is a very intense book that is long on bravery and short on cowardess."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"I want to dispell a couple of myths that seem to be pervading a handful of the reviews for this book. First, this book is NOT a cure for insomnia. This book is unbelievable exciting, and if it puts you to sleep so quickly, then your attention span has obviousley been severely warped by television or some other dumbing-agent. Secondly, the language, though written 80+ years ago, is not that challenging. I'm no linguist, but I didn't notice a difference between Shakleton's phrasing and word choice and the writing of today's writers. The fact that it was written so long ago does not make it boring. I think his book has aged quite well.Was it the MOST exciting book I've ever read? Of course not! (That award likely goes to Helter Skelter) But Shakleton was not aiming to create an edge of the seat thriller (although he did come close!). He was only trying to, as acurately as possible, tell his heroic tale of survival in as much detail as he could provide.The book's only shortcoming: I wish it included a much more detailed set of maps with which I could follow Shakleton's moves. I was constantly referring to the basic map at the beginning of my book only to be dissapointed by its lack of detail. There were countless references to islands that were not marked on the map in my book."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"If you've read about and were fascinated with Ernest Shackleton and his band of Anarctic explorers, it's a real treat to see the adventure through his eyes.What an incedible story of attitude, character, perseverance and fortitude! Shackleton tells the story so matter-of-factly that you can sometimes forget that he and his men were experiencing one of the harshest climates on earth with little more than their own inventiveness to keep them alive. That all 28 men survived this ordeal with &quot;reindeer skin&quot; sleeping bags and &quot;sledging rations&quot; is amazing. No Gortex, Polartec, Hollowfil, freeze-dried food or GPS.Shackleton's writing style is not the most engaging, but the story itself is so amazing that it kept me turning pages. Getting 28 men through an experience like this is a testimony to the power of his leadership, although he takes little credit himself.Read this in front of a crackling fire!"},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"Ernest Shackleton is little known today, yet during the early part of this century was one of the leading figures of Antartic exploration. In modest, self-deprecating terms Shackleton describes the ordeal of his crew as they struggle for survival after being stranded in the Antartic after their ship is crushed by ice.In an era without reliable long distance communications, or modern equipment, 28 men managed to survive nearly two years in the frozen Antartic. Even more amazing, Shackleton and 5 companions crossed over 800 miles of some of the worlds roughest ocean in a 22 foot boat to bring help for the rest of the party.Having read Alfred Lansing's work &quot;Endurance&quot; this personal memoir by Shackleton also includes a description of the southern party, which was waiting in vain for him on the other side of Antartic.Shackleton and his party of 28 accomplished one of the most amazing examples of man's fortitude and indomitable courage. Somebody please make a MOVIE!"},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"As a fan of literature that captures the truly heroic and sometimes incredulous accomplishments of man, I read Shackleton's account of his attempt to cross the South Pole with utter amazement at the ability of a group to overcome not only the physical exhaustion of such an effort, but to survive the mental anguish and ennui of being isolated and trapped amidst a frozen sea. While reading this book, an attempt to cross the South Pole is currently underway by a group of men using the latest technology- GPS, sails for their sledges, satellite communications, thermo clothing- and in watching their progress, daily mileage, and physical ailments, their attempt pales in comparison to the expedition of Shackleton's ill-fated journey, and the efforts of their support team. Never again can I complain on a cold day in good conscience!"},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"I was very disappointed when I received this book. I had ordered the hard cover edition at a premium price expecting to get a quality reproduction of Sir Ernest Shackleton's classic book. The original book published by Heineman had many plates of photos taken by the photographer who travelled on the voyage. This version published by North Books had no photos, was on cheap paper and had a fairly basic hard cover. I sent it back and managed to source a second hand copy of the version published by Heineman."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"I've noticed numerous people complaining about how Shackelton seems to be neglecting character development in his narration. This isn't a work of fiction, the people involved are not characters Shackelton just pulled out of thin air and could mould to his choosing. They were real, flesh and blood human beings, and to say that one man no matter how well he knew them could actually put their thoughts and personality to paper would be not only incredibly foolish, but also woefully inaccurate, and seriously can you honestly picture Shackelton dragging various members of the crew out onto the floes and sitting them on a snow band before asking, \\"How does that make you feel?\\".Of course it's not going to be the most exciting piece of literature you've ever read. The book is written as a journal and journals tend to cover the day to day dealings of the person whom is writing in them. Longitudes, latitudes and the general functioning of the ship were Shackelton's daily concerns.It's amazing how many people overlook the enormity of the task these men undertook simply because the authors writing style tended to focus on the here and now and the little details of daily life rather than some hugely embellished fantasy designed simply to make a profit. Anyway.To those of you whom appreciate this for what it is, you have my applause."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"This is a great adventure book.

Although the voyage was laden with problems, Shackleton portrays the voyage as one, not of dispair, but of never ending hope."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"In matter-of-fact terms, that are not great literature, Shackelton describes his ill-fated trip in 1914 to the Antarctic. Instead of leading his party across the continent, he mounted a rescue operation for them when they were marooned on an unihabited island after the expedition's ship was trapped in ice and eventually crushed. Shakelton's trip from Elephant Island to the whaling station on South Georgia Island in a 22 foot boat through the roughest seas on the planet and by foot over an uncharted mountain range covered with glaciers, is an unparalleled tale of leadership, courage, human endurance, sustained Providence, and good fortune."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"It's tough to criticize a book written by the man himself and say that other books are somehow better, despite the fact that these writers did not participate in the journey. But unfortunately, that is the case. If you're a real Shackleton fan, you'll want to read this book only as background after taking on works by Caroline Alexander or Alfred Lansing.In comparison, 'South' has the following shortcomings:1. The writing style is impenetrable &amp; stilted. It has not aged well in the 80+ years since it was put down on paper.2. The misuse of Frank Hurley's photographs is annoying - they're out-of-focus, oddly chosen and misplaced in sequence in the book. See Alexander's book for a revelation of the power and majesty of Hurley's work.3. You only get Shackleton's point of view here. Lansing and Alexander pull together the journals of many particpants and you get a real flavor of the men that comprise the crew. Here, you get only Sir Ernest, dispensing some kind words about each member, last name only, no background info. The other books tell you quite a bit about flawed characters like McNish and Lees."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"Shackleton's diary and his first hand account of the Endurance journey are the basis of this work. While the other published works on this incredible voyage are also excellent, this book differs in that Shackleton many times speaks of certain subjects (food provisions,ice conditions,weather,etc) in whole, without regard to the story's timeline. This allows the reader to understand the thoughts and reasons behind the actions which were taken. However, I found it does take two readings to fully climb inside Shackleton's head, and this &quot;whole subject&quot; approach can be a little difficult to follow. This non-linear timeline and the fact that the pictures do not correspond to the text are the only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five. As a captain of small ships myself, I take heart in the abilities and courage of those aboard the ill-fated vessel. My problems on my own vessel seem much more manageable, after reading this account, as will anyone's, on land or sea. I did not find the comment of &quot;our faces as black as nig....&quot; to be racist, but a discription of facial color darkened by frostbite and countless days of cooking in enclosed areas. Even if you have other books on this same journey, BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"Who needs fiction when you can read this account of Sir Shackleton's incredible journey! This is better than the best fiction! Please remember, the &quot;author&quot; is a sea captain/explorer/adventurer, not a professional writer; don't expect &quot;character developments&quot; and &quot;storyline&quot;! What you get is a straight-forward adventure, a variety of obstacles, courage, and comraderie under the harshest of conditions which today are virtually unimaginable. All this is even better if you prop a good quality atlas in front of you so you can follow along. I would suggest you read &quot;Endurance&quot; by Alfred Lansing first...it will surely prime your appetite for learning more of the in-depth details of the expedition. You should also remember that this took place in the early 1900's; attitudes and vernacular have changed greatly since then and we should not/cannot go back and change certain words that today are rightfully acknowledged as offensive and inappropriate. The use of the N-word makes me wince as much any decent person but it does not diminish the accomplishment of Sir Shackleton in my eyes. Ignorance and racism can and should be separated.When I'm having a bad day at work, I snap myself back into reality by reminding myself of the trials overcome by this crew and I realize that whatever piddly problems I'm dealing with at that moment, it surely beats being wet and frozen on a crumbling ice floe, eating my favorite sled dog!If you love a good adventure, you will love this book! I'm kind of glad Hollywood hasn't bastardized this story yet!"},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"This a story of a &quot;failed&quot; cross continental expedition and its aftermath. It gives a continuous account of the unbelievable experiences of Ernest Shacleton and his crew of 27 men from the time their ship, the Endurance, is frozen in pack ice until their final escape some 20 months later. This unbelieveable feat was accomplished without a single loss of life!The character and leadership abilities of Ernest Shackleton are impressive and facinating as he and his crew are pitted against forces of nature beyond the experience of most mortals.I found much inspiration for dealing with life's everday experiences and challenges from reading this account. I have also read Frank Worsley's account of the &quot;open boat&quot; escape and a biography of Sir Ernest Shackleton. I will continue to expand this list of readings as I am able to find more accounts on the subject.The lure of the Antartic and the study of these extrodinary adventures grips me as no other topic has for a long time."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"this story is not a novel, its not about character development and its not fiction...its about how a man finds himself and his comrades in a desperate position...stuck on an ice floe...thousands of miles from the nearest human habitation and deathly temperatures of -30f...no ship...all his sledging dogs dying...very little food and vastly under-equipped...and how he managed to get these men off the floe and to safety without a single loss of life...and when shackleton watched his ship crushed and sink below the ice...he faced this task without outward emotion and gave all the men hope.. my great grandfather was on this journey...he was the carpenter 'chipps' McNeish..so this book hit a chord especially with me.."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"Ernest Shackleton has always been one of my heroes. The story of the Endurance and how the Shackleton Expedition kept body and soul together and made it safely home after losing its ship in the Weddell Sea ice pack is one of the most heroic episodes in the annals of human adventure. Hollywood could not write a more compelling epic.I bought the book because I wanted to read a first-hand account of the Expedition, despite being somewhat afraid of its being bogged down in technical details. It was not. Once the scene was set, what the reader gets is a fast-moving, easy-to-read, and very gripping tale of the attention to duty, the guts, and the undying optimism it took to overcome what must have seemed like insurmountable odds. Shackleton's wry sense of humor and his willingness to take calculated risks and make hard decisions undoubtedly helped to inspire his men to work as a team.You will sit on the edge of your seat as you read of the harrowing voyage in the tiny dinghy across the raging seas as Shackleton and a chosen few set out from Elephant Island in a desperate attempt to reach South Georgia. You will feel the weariness and the agony of his party as they seek to find a way to the other side through what had been considered inaccessible territory. And you will feel the sense of relief and triumph as the party stumbles into the whaling station where it was able to organize a rescue for the comrades left behind on Elephant Island.That is really the climax of the story. Some readers may find the second portion of the book a bit anticlimactic, and it is, but that does not take away from the main story. The second part merely recounts the trials and tribulations of the other half of the expedition. The story of those men and their ship is interesting in its own right and is included here only because Shackleton, as overall commander of the expedition, included their story in his journal.Sir Ernest Shackleton's story is an inspiration to me. His heroism shines in a world that produces too few heroes. I highly recommend this book to all who like a good story. Perhaps you will be inspired too."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"This book is one of the primary sources for &quot;Endurance&quot; by Alfred Lansing. The latter is a distillation of these writings plus the actual diaries of Sir Ernest.I read &quot;Endurance&quot; first and so I was primed for this book. One aspect of the voyage that is not encountered in Lansing's work is the fate of the Aurora, the companion ship to the Endurance whose job it was to lay up the depots for Shackleton on his way across the continent once he reached the Pole. This was an ill-fated journey on which three men died (Shackleton himself didn't lose a man). The Aurora was also locked in the ice and drifted all the way to New Zealand leaving a portion of her crew stranded in McMurdo Sound.It's a great book with tremendous appeal for those of us interested in these fantastic voyages.EKW"},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"i recall a radio interview with andrea barrett from a while back... it went something like &quot;other explorers may make you famous- shackelton will get you home&quot;.told in a very victorian matter-of-fact way, with a slight self effacing humor, shackelton was no great author. but he and his men were part of the intelligent, sensitive generation of young men destroyed during the great war. they'd even offered to give up their mission and serve in the impending conflict, but churchill told them to go ahead with their efforts.mixed with the minutae of coordinates, temperatures and depth soundings are beautifully poetic descriptions of an almost unreal landscape, of hallucinatory optical illusions, midnight football games, penguins, seals, and an obsession with all things ice.ultimately ice does claim the endurance, and shackelton admits he'd anticipated it for months but been powerless.the most heartbreaking part of the book is the men's feelings about having to shoot their beloved pets and sled dogs (some of who end up as food).shackelton must have been a truly amazing man- to keep his crew sane and alive through years of the most inhospitable and dispiriting conditions, to travel vast distances by land and sea with the most pitiful of provisions, and finally to write of it with such modesty and grace is truly a great accomplishment of a more daring time."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"I will recommend this book to all adventure and outdoor lovers.

It a fantastic true story of human endurance and will power."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"Shackleton's memoir is a treasure - an on-the-spot account of a great adventure. However, the book, for reasons that I cannot explain, lacks a map. From nearly the first page on, the text discusses the journey by presenting direction and distance from key points in the antarctic. Why would the publisher not put in a simple map so the reader does not have to go to another source while reading the book. I suppose one could just read the book as an adventure story and not mind where it is in the world, but why, when a map would add much more to the fun and interest. Since Shackleton refers to the race to the pole, the map could also show Scott's and Amundson's routes. It would not really have taken a great effort to provide it,I would think."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"I had two boyhood hero's.Scott and Shackleton.

The story had little character development and had way too many boring details. I found that I was reading about latitude and longitude markings along with ice drifts over and over within the first 30 pages. Pass on this book if you like story development instead of journalistic details."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"I was very eager to read this book because of the wonderful survival story, but from the beginning pages I was hopelessly lost in the tedius, and often boring details of this journal-like writing. * too much detail of latitude and longitude - without a map you have no idea what's going on * too many &quot;technical' terms used - the author assumes the reader knows all about boats, the sea, etc. * dates were given, but sometimes they were not chronological - what's happening when? * poor character development It's obvious Shackleton is not a writer, and too bad, because his story is really intriguing."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"&quot;South&quot; is an extraordinary story of leadership, dedication, perseverance, ingenuity and survival. It is difficult to accept that the book is a non-fictional account of an Antarctic exploration. Time and again, the men of the expedition exhibited superhuman strength and a tremendous will to live. It's ironic that the Endurance, Shackleton's ship, could not endure the cold, ice, snow and wind of Antarctica but her crew could. In an age before Goretex (R), Polartec (R) and Thinsulate (R), all of Shackleton's men survived.The tenor and cadence of the book changed significantly when the story of the Aurora and her crew was told. The change was likely due to the fact that Shackleton was relying upon the accounts and diaries of others. It is obvious that he was not writing out of his own experience and pain.As an African-American, I must say that I lost a great deal of interest in Shackleton after reading his comparison of the soot-covered faces of his men to the faces of &quot;niggers.&quot; And he was not refering to &quot;Nigger (dog)&quot; listed in the index. I find it disappointing, but not unbelieveable, that given all of his physical and mental suffering that there was a place in his mind and body where racism could comfortably and warmly survive. It speaks volumes about him and the nature and endurance of racism."},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"I really hate to give this book such a low rating, because it could have been so good. I agree with others, however, who described it as &quot;super boring&quot; and complain about endless pages describing latitude and longitude positions (like we care!) or the thousands of words devoted entirely to recording the subtle changes in wind direction, air temperature, movement of the ice floe, etc... I would much rather have known what these sailors were thinking and feeling. We get almost none of that. No character development. I couldn't tell one sailor from another, except that their names were different. The basic account of the voyage is interesting, but too bad only one word in fifty was necessary to tell the tale. This is the kind of book that can cure insommnia. May be valuable to historians, but not to anyone just looking for an engaging story. If you want to read a really great account of adventure at sea, try Hyderdahl's Kon-Tiki!"},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"The first thing to remember about this book is that it was written in 1919. Secondly, it is not a story per se, but a recounting of an expedition (albeit gone horribly wrong) including the obligatory longitude and latitude references and long passages about the weather. That said, even though there were some wonderfully droll passages*, i found this book rather hard going. My husband, who had read it before, told me it improved after the first few chapters, and it did. But when the first expedition was over and we move on to the disaster of the Aurora, it gets very hard to stay awake again.If you are an avid fan of Antarctic Adventures, you have to read this one, as it is a classic. Otherwise, you might find this a little 'hard going'. * I really liked this line about the Killer Whales spotted around the camp - &quot;Shipwrecked mariners drifting in the Antarctic seas would be things not dreamed of in the Killer's philosophy, and might appear on closer inspection to be tasty substitutes for seal and penguin.&quot;"},{"Title":"South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage","review":"This book was great becasue it was great stroy about survile and perservericne"},{"Title":"Tucker Peak","review":"I have been reading the Joe Gunther books ever since I started Ragman's Memory, and have read all of the books in the series. Being from Vermont, I can relate to the location that the books are featured in. I have also had the liberty of meeting Archer Mayor at a signing.Tucker Peak is the latest book in his Joe Gunther series, set at a fictional Ski resort in southern Vermont. There, a series of robberies and crime have occured, bringing Joe and his southern VT VBI team into the picture. They begin with a simple robbery case, and end up with a homoside one, reaveling that there is much more to the book than what meets the eye. Even from the last portion of the book, Mayor gives no indication of who is guilty and who is innocent.Mayor sets the setting, characters and plot beautifully, capturing the image that is just so close to reality that some authors struggle with. Because he is also a Vermonter, he has the chance to research for his books easily.He sets Tucker Peak very well, exposing the 'true' Vermont. Tucker Peak is a fictional ski resort, but it is real enough so that I can invision skiing down it's slopes. The towns, roads, cities and area are all familier to me, and that makes the book so much better."},{"Title":"Tucker Peak","review":"Archer Mayor is like a master artistic puzzle builder. He takes a little bit here, a little bit there, weaves this into that, and what starts out as a seemingly straightforward and relatively innocuous (if crime can be innocuous) crime ends up being a complex labyrinth of events, motives, characters, and decisions that lead inexorably toward the climax and resolution. A mark of a good mystery writer is that the reader is left wondering almost until the last page, but when the answer comes, the reader says, &quot;Of course, it fits perfectly! I should have seen that!&quot; Mayor is one of the best at accomplishing this difficult objective. This skill also lends a sense of reality to his stories that few other mystery writers attain. That is, the complexity of his work shows how much each of us, our lives, our work, our unthinking reactions are intertwined with others - how, for example, in this story, a harmless ad for a watch on E-bay leads to the destruction of human life and paradoxically allows series regulars Kunkle and Sammie discover their need for each other. Tucker Peak is not for mystery readers who want a simple story unfettered by reality solved in 22 minutes (not counting commercials). It is an immensely satisfying read for those who not only want to escape the banality of daily life for a few hours of fiction-more-real-than-real, but who appreciate an intellectual and emotional challenge in the process."},{"Title":"Tucker Peak","review":"When I first picked this up in the store, it was great to get my hands on it. I was waiting for it for so long to come out and to read it, that I thought that I was going insane. I live in Brattleboro myself, and the places that Mayor tells about are places that I go to all the time. It was much better then &quot;The Marble Mask&quot; which was not as well done because it didn't take place back in Brattleboro. Though, I was happy with the end, and the re-uniting of the characters. I would have liked to see Gunther return to the Brattleboro Police Department or have J.P Tyler and Ron come up to VBI. But this was a great book, and I recomend it to anyone who wants a good piece of reading."},{"Title":"Tucker Peak","review":"Though Vermont's TUCKER PEAK is popular in a small way by the ski crowd, the owners of the resort know they must expand or declare bankruptcy. The announced plan quickly runs into an environmental nightmare as protesters arrive to stop any further development of the pristine mountain.At about the same, a series of crippling robberies push the TUCKER PEAK ownership closer to shutting down the ski lodge. However, the state knows the importance of tourist money especially from the ski industry. So when the local law enforcement asks for help, the Vermont Bureau of Investigation sends its best, Joe Gunther, to investigate the felons. Joe quickly determines the identity of the thief, but the individual is missing and his girlfriend murdered. Joe concludes that several of the environmentalists could not care less about hugging a tree let alone a mountaintop as they have something else in mind that could kill the dedicated police officer.TUCKER PEAK is a hard-boiled detective story with the added twist that it occurs on an isolated Vermont mountain. The who-done-it is solved rapidly and easily only to lead to another who-done-it and several why-done-its. Joe feels out of place in this backdrop, as he seems more like an inner city blue collar cop, but that adds layers of personality to the tale as Archer Mayor has done in his previous Gunther novels. This is another winning story in a series in which all the novels are worth reading.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Basic Statistical Ideas for Managers","review":"I bought this book thinking that it contains all answers for the problem.

However, I had forgotten it all. This book takes you along very slowly, and teaches you everything you need from music notations, to musical note values, and, of course, musical notes themselves. It does it one lesson at a time. You simply learn one thing to do for that lesson, and then build on it, one thing at a time. It letters the notes in the beginning, and then slowly, one note at a time, begins to show them without a letter value. In time, you will learn the notes themselves, and will not even be aware of the fact that the letter values are no longer there. This book also plays songs that you know, and thus you want to keep playing more. The DVD that came with this book is very helpful in showing you how to play each piece. The only problem I saw with the DVD was how to skip over the beginning piano piece that plays, and get to the menu. Normally, you would go to a root menu. However, on this DVD, the root menu is that musical piece. Instead, go to the top menu (look for the top menu button on your remote), and it will bypass that three minute long piece. Other than that, it is wonderful. :)"},{"Title":"Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Piano (Book & Enhanced CD) (Teach Yourself Series)","review":"This book with the DVD does an excellent job of explaining how to read the music as well as play. The learning pace is high tempo so you're not wasteing weeks on playing the same song. The music has helpful reminders at the begining of the pieces to remind you which fingers go where. The music is written in large print so you do not have to squint to read the music. The only thing I wish they would have done differently is to offer up some longer pieces to help build the muscle memory. The tunes are fairly short so it is easy to memorize the order of the keys to be played before you memorize the musical notes. Otherwise an excellent purchase. I would recommend this over paying large sums of money for piano lessons."},{"Title":"Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Piano (Book & Enhanced CD) (Teach Yourself Series)","review":"This book is great for people just learning to play piano. I have a keyboard at home that I practice on. It takes you step-by-step through each phase/step, and one lesson builds on the next. I m learning a lot with this book- highly recommended."},{"Title":"Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Piano (Book & Enhanced CD) (Teach Yourself Series)","review":"My son received a electronic piano for christmas so I thought I would buy this to try to relearn keyboard music. I hope to help him if he needs some down the road. I haven't played for over 30 years and with the help of this dvd I have made great progress after my first 2 hour session. I was able to already play a couple simple songs and look foward to continuing through the rest of book and dvd. I highly recommend this if you are a person who can learn through reading and practicing on your own. I put the dvd on and follow through the lessons in the book. The dvd is a great compliment to the book and would find it hard to do without it."},{"Title":"Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Piano (Book & Enhanced CD) (Teach Yourself Series)","review":"This book really works!!

This book is perfect for that!!"},{"Title":"Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Piano (Book & Enhanced CD) (Teach Yourself Series)","review":"This is a good book/DVD package! The last time I played piano was about 25 years ago & I only took lessons for less than 6 months, so my knowledge is pretty minimal. The book is easy enough to follow & has a nice progression through the process of learning the piano.I initially started through the book, just to see how it was & I made it through the first ten or so lessons & I thought I understood what was written. Then I put in the DVD & realized I was missing a lot, by my ignorance of music. The DVD puts the polishing touch on the book & really explains (the why) of what is written!The only negative is the menu of the DVD is not the most user friendly of quickly finding & referencing to a location in the book.

In 1 1/2 weeks they were playing the one handed songs perfectly and progressed from there. Now they both can play a few songs (2 handed) and have even began to experiment with creating their own songs, they are still on the schedule but needless to say they play a lot longer than the agreed time and love it.

Forgot almost everything. One thing I like about this book is that it teaches you about chords right at the beginning. So you get to know about harmony of notes and coordination of hands fast. It also has tips on how to memorize names of keys and music knowledge that you should know as a starter. However, I don't think it is very helpful to those who have zero experience about piano and sheet music whatsoever. And if you want to get it for a child, he/she needs adult guidance. I don't think any self-teaching book can do that. So if you are like me, who still have a little bit techniques and knowledge on the back of my mind, you should get this book. I don't think the CD is a must. I got it anyway just in case. Overall, I like the book but I don't think it's the right tutorial for a child. I downloaded the Kindle edition on my iPad.

Our family for Christmas bought a keyboard. I don't really have the time to put toward official lessons so I bought this book based on recommendations from friends who both play and teach.Overall, I like this book. I was able to breeze past the first part of it until dreaded Jingle Bells! That took me a while to get through. Now I'm struggling with some of the more &#34;advanced pieces&#34; in the book such as Brahms Lullaby & Joy to the World. I found the book fairly easy to follow although I have found some holes in the instruction, especially when it comes to finger positions. I have had a hard time getting the fingering right when my hands need to move up & down the keyboard and I don't really feel the book does a great job explaining it.The part I'm disappointed most in is the DVD. I would like to have more instruction on it rather than just showing how to play a piece in real time. I feel the DVD could have made up for the lack of instruction in the book at times. It also would be nice to break the DVD chapters up better and show in the book which chapter of the DVD it relates to.But again, if you're trying to learn piano on your own, I've found it helpful overall."},{"Title":"Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Piano (Book & Enhanced CD) (Teach Yourself Series)","review":"This book provides a good starter to piano playing, I have ordered another one for my colleague who is learning with me."},{"Title":"Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Piano (Book & Enhanced CD) (Teach Yourself Series)","review":"Always wanted to learn how to play the piano, This book has the best way to learn, I just wish I could understand it more."},{"Title":"Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Piano (Book & Enhanced CD) (Teach Yourself Series)","review":"received what i ordered and on time love amazon.haven't used it yet but hopefully will be playing piano and singing at church soon."},{"Title":"Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Piano (Book & Enhanced CD) (Teach Yourself Series)","review":"This is an excellent way to learn the piano.

The value here is that author Powers makes you the Reader feel in a close personal relationship with You, Powers, and the Subject in understanding thoughts and motivations of Twain in his time, with the influences of his time, rejecting and scoffing at all the pseudo psychological \\"interprtations\\" that have marred other biographies. Reading Powers is a unique experience."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"I read this book for information, but got so much more. It is very entertaining. A friend started the book and put it down because she felt that the author was trying to emulate Twain's writing style. I feel like it is natural after making a lengthy, detailed study of an author to pick up some of his habits of expression. As long as it is done well, then I have no objection."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"This book is an astoundingly granular review of the life of Samuel Clemens. The character who emerges is a complex dynamo who becomes the interpreter of the Gilded Age. Certain thematic threads pull Clemens along...the wistful longing of eternal youth; the lifelong preoccupation with sealing the deal that his father and brother never could, and that eluded him until the end; and the ghosts of love and loved ones lost. Powers is sometimes ham-handed in attempting to equate Mark Twain with a modern-day media darling, but that is thin gruel as stylistic faux paux. Likewise, the case is made for growth in this southerners social attitudes, but again the facts don't substantiate the claim. Overall, though, as a substantial work with a broad scope, the author is most successful when he presents Twain in the context of a rapidly changing nation. Examples overflow, from the changing modes of transportation, to the technology of communication, to illumination, and illustration, among many. The ultimate beauty of this sketch is that a strong case is made for the motivations that underpinned Clemens' prodigious output. Mark Twain is the ultimate Horatio Alger story writ large."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"I've read several biographies of Twain over the years, none more beautifully written than this book. It reads like a cultural history of the US during Twain's lifetime. I highly recommend this book to any serious student of Twain's work."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"While reading this copy of Power's biography, I kept checking back to the customer reviews that I read before purchase. Most reviews were \\"glowing\\" for many reasons. Frankly I purchased because the reviews were most favorable from a large number of other Twain biographies. I am sorry that I did.The detail is fine but there is strong failure to tell the life story associated with the detail. Very limited cover of Sammy's youth & developments. Mr. Power is also a fanatical wordsmith. There are a huge amount of words (mostly adjectives)that you will never encounter again in your lifetime."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Born Samuel Clemens, this lad grew up to be known throughout the world as \\"Mark Twain.\\" His life was a rollercoaster, with great successes and great failure. His personal life underwent much tragedy, as he lost two of his three e daughters before his own death. His creative well went largely dry in his later years, while he continued turning out manuscript page after manuscript page.This book does a nice job tracing the arc of his life from childhood, most famously in Hannibal, Missouri, to his effort to create his own career (for a time as a riverboat pilot), to his abortive career as a soldier in Missouri, to his trip west to make his mark, to. . . .His life was rich and full--even as he experienced failure (some of his speaking tours went bust, whereas others were grand successes; he wasted a fortune on failed inventions--going bankrupt, in essence, later in his life). He was beloved by many, made friends with major figures of the day--but could easily insult people, lose his temper, and turn his back on associates.His wife, Livy, was his partner for many years. This book also suggests very briefly here and there that Isabel Lyon and Laura Wright (later Dake) had little known roles in his life. The latter sounds innocent. The former? So little is mentioned here that that story remains in the shadows.The story of how he created his works, from Tom Sawyer to Huck Finn and so on, is well told. The book describes nicely the early years of his writing career, as a reporter, then as a humorist, and then the evolution toward a major author. What makes this work especially interesting is the exposition of Twain's somewhat mercurial nature and his interactions with those around them. He could be hard on people; he could also be the most loyal of friends.His last years, rather sad at that, are well described. All in all, a fine biography of an American icon. . . ."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Powers used three voices of the Samuel Clemens to tell this story. He used Sammy, the young man with his heart still in his youth; Samuel, the writer and family man and Mark Twain, American celebrity and icon. He molds these three distinct aspects into a rich vibrant human being whose greatness is tempered by his many faults.What makes this biography so readable is that so much of it is told my Clemens. Powers extensively quotes from Twain's letters, diaries, memoirs and novels. By the time you finish this book you will have the voice of Mark Twain in your head and you'll come away with and understanding of the man and his age."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"I thought it was, and this is my third or fourth Mark Twain biography. It has more detail and contains a synopsis of each of his major works. Nor are his minor writings ignored but the factors that relate them, one to the other, are discussed and analyzed. Twain's family, his friends and his associations are examined and the facts laid out for the reader to decide whether the great man was a great friend or a bit of a rascal (he was both).Bring along your Webster's Dictionary: Ron Powers has a command of many adjectives I needed to look up. I deemed the exercise beneficial even when the list of new vocabulary words grew quite long. Being challenged by an author is one of the reasons we read these long tomes, isn't it?So be forewarned, this is a very long and very detailed biography but if you are interested in social history, as I am, in which you have the pleasure of learning what it was like, day to day, to live Mark Twain's life, you'll like this book. If a 700 page read with notes is intimidating you may want one of the other Mark Twain biographies I've read. If you're frightened by new terms this book is not for you. Powers is not for everyone. At this writing there are three two star reviews which cite these issues and his supposed interjected political views (I must have missed that part) as reasons for not liking the book. I find when an author challenges through context or ideology I learn something beyond the mere factoids biography lends itself to occasionally.I'm giving this book five stars because I enjoyed reading it, the author displays a fine sense of irony from time to time, and because Powers ability to carry the narrative page after page kept me interested even when the events in Mark Twain's journey were off putting. It's well written, clearly well researched, has fabulous detail and plenty of style."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"If you've read Twain's autobiography, you will be a bit disappointed. Mr Powers effort is actually very good at depicting the circumstances of Twain's family, birth, developing years, friends, influences of others on his ideas and later writing. This provides an extra parameter to envision the man in his habitat and point of history. But perhaps noone can reproduce Twain's wit and perspicacious understanding of humanity as much as the man, himself."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"\\"Mark Twain: A Life\\", by Ron Powers and published in 2005 is a highly and widely praised biography of Samuel Clemens, and it deserves every syllable of that praise.Clemens' life began nearly 200 years ago and biographies of him have been written for at least a century. This one by Powers is likely either the Best or one of the Top Five.The reader will see quickly and clearly that Ron Powers is a thorough researcher, an expert on the nature of the Nineteenth Century, an accomplished and accurate Historian, a premier Clemens/Twain scholar, and a very gifted writer. You will find yourself liking him just like the high-brow New England snobs found themselves liking Mark Twain whether they wanted to or not.The most important thing Powers does is give the reader \\"Mark Twain\\" and his times and his life as they were - not as measured against 20th Century socio-political mores and agendas or neurotic psycho-babble or the pseudo-intelligentsia of Narcissistic Literati.Clemens is commonly described as intense, complicated, mercurial, volatile, dark, irascible, hilarious, ingenious, humiliating, mysterious, serendipitous, vitriolic and irreverent, among other things - all of these terms often presented as \\"pieces\\" of an inscrutable \\"whole\\".Powers doesn't take that cop-out. He gives the reader the \\"whole\\" Sam Clemens simply ditching the paparazzi approach and presenting Clemens as his ownself. Powers lets the reader see Clemens as like a budding virtuoso and his life as an intricate, difficult, beautiful musical composition. The story is the virtuoso's learning of the music from his first awkward noises through all the discoveries and improvements to the final refinements. Clemens spent his life finding and learning and honoring Life. Powers distills all those \\"pieces\\" into the \\"whole\\" beautifully by showing the reader that Clemens' overriding view - his \\"guiding light\\" - was that Growth is Life, Stagnation is Death, and Sam Clemens chose Life regardless of its' tendency to be intense, complicated, mercurial, volatile, dark, irascible, hilarious, ingenious, humiliating, mysterious, serendipitous, vitriolic and irreverent, among other things. Mr. Powers' splendid work : \\"Mark Twain: a Life\\" will put the beloved Mark Twain in one of the chairs on your front porch for you. Enjoy !"},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, I need to say at the outset that I'm a lifelong admirer of the subject of this lively, witty biography. Born and raised in Missouri, Clemens' home state, I, like many country boys of my generation, dreamed of floating down the Mississippi on a raft. I even tried to build one; it sank, which was likely for the best. But I digress.Ron Powers evidences great sympathy for his subject without coddling or sugar-coating the crusty curmudgeon with the wild white mane. His prose is appropriately tongue-in-cheek at times--as Twain would have wished, I think--and his research is scrupulously thorough without adopting the plodding pace that plagues so many scholarly biographies. He allows the reader to marvel at the Sage of Hannibal as he glitters in all his brilliance... and as he curdles in his own self-centered blindness.Best of all, Powers illuminates to great advantage Mark Twain's pointed social satire and political commentary, uncovering what was, for me at least, the important and previously unknown record of Twain's scathing critiques of U.S. expansionism and colonialist exploitation in places like the Philippines during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Steaming upriver against the popular currents of the day, Twain anticipates by decades--and, in some ways, lays the groundwork for--the rhetoric of dissent that would become prominent in the 1960s.For Twain junkies like me, or for anyone interested in the rise of the uniquely American literary voice before and during the Gilded Age, MARK TWAIN: A LIFE is a better find than the loot stashed in Injun Joe's cave."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Ron Powers book on the life of Samuel Clemens, a.k.a. Mark Twain, is a well written portraiture of the man in his times. Twain is perhaps America's most recognized literary figure. Twain was among the few writers of his time who wrote in the vernacular of the common person. Powers gives us a full picture of Mark Twain, both the good and the bad, while properly putting him in the context of the years he lived. To the author's credit, we almost feel like we're accompanying Twain on his life's journey.By just about any measure, Mark Twain lived a full life, with all the ups and downs that come with the territory. He left his childhood home at a young age and made it out into the world on his own. His childhood had been marked by the financial problems and challenges that he tried all his life to avoid, though not always successfully. Like his father and later his brother Orion, Twain was prone to jump to an idea that offered a get-rich-quick scheme, even though these schemes often failed and created more debt. Powers never lets us lose sight of this trait and the effects it has on him.From his newspaper days to his writings and lecture tours and the attention he attracted, Mark Twain became a force to be reckoned with. His own establishment as a literary figure on the East Coast was helped by William Dean Howells, who would become one of Twain's closest and life long friends. One of the great aspects of this book is that we get to see and learn about so many people in Twain's life, both those he liked and those he didn't. Powers shows us the many aspects of writing and publishing that encompassed his most famous works. I found his travels onboard the Quaker City and the fodder he gathered on his tour of the Holy Land and other points along the Mediterranean to be quite amusing, all which became central to his book the Innocents Abroad. There are many sections of this book that will make you laugh out loud and you'd be awfully hard pressed not to.Twain did achieve the national and international attention that he relished. Powers goes so far as to call him our first rock star. Twain hobnobbed with the rich and famous including presidents, world leaders, and other major literary figures. Perhaps the leader most associated with Twain was Ulysses S. Grant. Grant, with Twain's assistance, was able to publish his military memoirs to give his family financial security before his own imminent death.We read of his wife Livy, his children and their time together, especially when traveling in Europe or at one of their several residences in the Northeast. But this also becomes a source of much sorrow for Twain as he must live to see the death of two of his adult children, his wife, as well as his own siblings and many old friends and acquaintances from years gone by. There was a bitterness and anger that developed and became a central force in Twain's life, as Powers discusses with great insight. These episodes throughout his life are indeed quite sad and help us see more deeply into Clemens and his attitude towards life, his fellow man, and his harsh views on religion. Twain's humanness comes across quite clearly in this book.In summarizing some of the major aspects of the book I'm leaving out quite a bit. Power's book will be a must read for any devoted fan of Twain's as well as those like me who have read some of his works like Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn in school or who are just interested in finding out more about the man. I found the last chapters to be a bit abbreviated, although this is a substantial book. In terms of sources consulted, Powers relies on many of Twain's letters as well as acknowledging the books and works by other authors. As Hal Holbrook mentioned on the back cover, we feel like we're following along with Twain on an almost day by day basis. A good read."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Mark Twain is most likely the most written about American author. All of his works are in print after a century and countless books have analyzed and documented his life. Two of the best works are Twain's own \\"The Autobiography of Mark Twain\\" (400+ pages), edited by Twain scholar Charles Neider, and the Pulizer Prize biography by Justin Kaplan, \\"Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain\\" (500+ pages).Ron Powers has contributed another biography with his \\"Mark Twain: A Life\\" (700+ pages). He has taken a \\"just the facts\\" approach to the details of Twain's life and avoided Mr. Kaplan's interpretive/psychoanalysis of Twain's Missouri youth, later depression and family tragedies.What book should the reader chose? Well, Mr. Kaplan's book is still the Gold Standard, if for no other reason than its brilliant writing. Mr. Powers has researched a more detailed and traditional biography of Twain. But, for sheer fun, Mark Twain's own words (accurate or not) are among the funniest and most satirical he has ever written, while the closing chapter on the death of his daughter, Jean, are the most haunting and heart-rending you will ever read."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Mr. Powers leaves every other Mark Twain biographer in the dust. This work is not only beautifully detailed and researched; it is a constantly engaging 'page turner.' Beyond all that Mr. Power's own gift as a writer is extraordinary...his words literally leap from the page. One of the best reads I have had in a long time."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Powers gives us a terrific chronology, densely packed information, charming and insightful prose, plenty of great Twain quotes and anecdotes, empathy for the tragedies of Twain's life and twitting of his oddities when called for. I found it quite remarkable that the book could be so factual and also so readable. There's an excellent index, solid background references, and many laugh-out-loud moments. Adding to the pleasaure of this reading experience are some delightful and - new to me - photographs. Strongly recommend this outstanding biography."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"This thorough and well-written biography of a gifted indivudual leaves one with the feeling of having known Mark Twain, Samuel Clemmens, personally. The book offers two additional values: One is getting a glinpse of what life was like during the late 19th century. The other is what it meant to experience the Civil War from a state so far removed from the action that the war seemed to be going on in another country."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"I hadn't thought about Mark Twain in a while and picked up this biography somewhat at random. Then I thought it might be interesting to read about his days working on a steamboat on the Mississippi River. I couldn't put the book down, read it in two nights. I'm still thinking about it a week later. One of the best biographies I've read."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"This book provides important insights into Mark Twain and his life and times. It should part of the reading list in any course that spends time on Mark Twain's writings."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Mark Twain: A LifeThe most consummate biography of Mark Twain ever-- as the back cover reads, \\"[Twain became] the king of the eastern establishment and a global celebrity as American became an international power. Along the way, Mark Twain keenly observed the characters and voices that filled the growing country, and left us our first authentically American literature. Ron Powers' magnificent biography offers the definitive life of the founding father of our culture.\\"Ron Powers does a superb job of bringing Twain to life in front of our eyes. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Admittedly, I have read little of Mark Twain's work. But I love reading biographies, and he seemed like a fascinating man. And this book proved to me that he was.It was interesting to learn about his marriage, his home life, his experiences as a youth, and how his books came about. He was truly a funny and loving man. I am no great scholar or anything, but this is a great read."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Ron Powers' biography of Mark Twain is simply one of the best on this versitle man. Powers captures the essence of the man with great detail without getting bogged down with minutia. He keeps you interested and wanting to turn the page, while painting what I belive to be the true picture of Clemen's life. It will be interesting to compare Powers view of Twian to Twain's own view of himself with the recent release of the first Volume of Twain's autobiography. From my first scan of Twain's autobiography I find Powers' book a great deal easier to grasp who Clemens and Twain really were. I would reccomend to any reader to first read Powers' book to get to know the development of Clemens into Twain before trying to digest the recent release of the autobiography."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Little to add to the other fine reviews, just another vote for the best biography of America's greatest writer."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"I wished I had read all of the reviews because I would not have purchased it. This statement from another: \\"This could have, and should have been a five star review, but the author could not help putting his own views on politics, and social commentary.\\" and this made the book trying and unenjoyable."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Mark Twain, famous for his pithy observations, may have had this to say about biographies: \\"Biographies, like revenge, are best served cold.\\"Author Ron Powers, however, serves up a very warm and frothy biography of the American humorist, writer and all-purpose rascal. His detailed scholarship is fogged by starry-eyed cheerleading and earns this book three stars.A biographer must be respectful of their subject's literary and cultural alchemy while not being seduced by it. Powers seems spellbound, however, essentially dismissing Twain's racial, sexual and personality conflicts as well as his more controversial and less popular writings later in life - none of which detract from Twain's overall contributions to American life or letters.These omissions, though, mightily detract from this work.Twain's voice is remarkably and admirably present, but unchallenged in this work giving Powers' book a very one-sided, almost autobiographical feel.Twain said, \\"An autobiography that leaves out the little things and enumerates only the big ones is no proper picture of the man's life at all....\\" The same can be said of this biography."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Ron Powers does what a good biographer is supposed to do - place Twain in his historical context, explain the formative experiences of his youth, and critically examine Twain's place in American literature and culture, and do it in an engaging and fluid prose style. Kudos."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"You don't need to be incredibly familiar with Mark Twain's novels to follow this biography. In an apparently un-Twain-like linear fashion, Powers discusses the sources of Sam Clemens' stories while describing the formative years of his life. He then references these early experiences in later chapters when discussing the motivation behind each of Twain's works. He goes into great detail about the writing process, how manuscripts can begin vigorously, be set aside for a decade, then finished when enough inspiration has accumulated or enough memories have congealed to round out the story.I don't think I've ever read a biography of an author. But Sam Clemens' lead a hectic life outside of literature. Powers covers everything from Clemens' boyhood adventures to his myopic business ventures, from his glory days as a Mississippi steamboat pilot to his failure as a Nevadan silver miner. Once his personal life is fleshed out and his acquaintances are described, it's easier to see how the writing of Mark Twain became the copyrighted American voice of the late 19th century.My only serious complaint about this biography is the vocabulary. How many times can you drop the word \\"absquatulated\\" in a book and not sound pompous?"},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Ron Powers' MARK TWAIN contains a great deal of valuable material. It is unfortunately marred by Powers' writing style and his unfortunate tendency to compare 19th-century Twain with various 'rock stars'. I don't know if he's trying to popularize Twain with a 'hip young audience' or what, but these anachronistic references were like pickles in a Charlotte Russe. They just don't belong there.It's a pity since there is so much other amazing information on Twain here. The annoying asides have made it very difficult for me to finish the book. I keep putting it aside in disbelief.No, Mark Twain was not a rock star. Got that?"},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"This could have, and should have been a five star review, but the author could not help putting his own views on politics, and social commentary.Mr. Powers you are a very talented wirter, and biographer. However I am not interested in your opinions on these subjects. If I wanted a book (but I dont) on Ron Power's opinions on everything, I would have bought one.This same thing also effects movies. Some directors cannot help doing the same thing. Let me see how can I put this......IT'S REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, ANNOYING!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Overall this is a decent biography, not great but readable.The author seems to have a problem as to whether he is writing about Mark Twain or trying to imitate Mark Twain and I find his numerous \\"humorous\\" side comments irritating.Also it is evident that he tries to put Twain and his work in the context of the time, but he does so in a very superficial way.He is too much of a cheerleader as another reviewer said and his book reminds me too much of a a Hollywood biography than a serious study of his work and life."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"This biography is a well written, comprehensive account of Twain's life. What is missing is a coherent, compelling life story or insightful interpretation of Twain's creative process."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"An excellent biography marred by gratuitous left wing political commentary. I don't know why Mr. Powers decided to sprinkle those little gems throughout the text, given that they add absolutely nothing, but I wish he'd respected his subject--and his readers--enough not to intrude. If I'd wanted Powers' political views, I'd have sought out a book about him. If you can ignore the author's trespassing, it is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"This book COULD have been great. Biographies are my favorite genre and I've read a bunch of them - this one falls pretty flat. The author's biases are so clearly obvious he's almost a presence in the book himself, which is distracting even if you agree with his views, and irritating if you don't. Forget Mark Twain's religious bias, the author's anti-Christian stance shines through even stronger, such as the statement that Mormons were just waiting for the Union to dissolve so that they could rise to power - and he sticks it to the Presbyterians just as badly, even misrepresenting Job from the Bible. His anti-capitalism, left-leaning political opinions come through just as clearly.The book gives us a nice picture of the times and events in the places Sam Clemens lived - New York, San Fransisco, Carson City, etc - which is interesting in itself. But even those glimpses into American life at the time are tainted by the author's opinions. A good biographer doesn't make himself obvious in his books; he shouldn't intrude at all. Ron Powers is not a good biographer and I will not be reading any more of his books."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Mark Twain (Samuel L. Clemens) was born in Florida Missouri in 1835 to John Marshall Clemens and his good wife Jane. Clemens grew up in Hannibal up the river from St. Louis. Times were hard on the hardscrabble frontier. His father tried many professions from Law to various failed busines ventures never succeeding inany of them, His mother raised a large family giving young Clemens love and support throughout her long life.Clemens was a man who tried many paths to riches. He was asteamboat pilot on the Mississippi learning this trade under theinimitable pilot Horace Bixby. He was a printer,jounralist in Neveda and in California and even served a few weeks as a Confederate Soldier. Twain grew up hard, was complex, profaneand eager to get rich. He was also a genius of the written wordwho wrote such classics as \\"Tom Sawyer\\"; \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" \\"ThePrince and the Pauper\\" and several other works. His writing was uneven being weak in plotting but strong on humor and the sageuse of accurate dialect. Twain spoke for the common person in the Gilded Age of big money and the power of the giants of industry such as Carneige, Rockerfeller, Gould and JP Morgan.Twain married the wealthy Olivia Langdon living in luxury ina succesion of homes in Buffalo, Elmira NY and most notably inHartford, Conn.His wife was frail and died at 57. His son died after 19 months of life. His oldest daughter Susy and youngest daughterJean predeceased him. Only his middle daughter Clara outlivedTwain who died in 1910.Twain is known for his humor but was a religious skeptic witha dark vision of humanity. His cynicism, anti-imperialism andbad temper are rarely mentioned or known among the general public.Reading this book is a wondeerful insight into the peripateticlecturer Twain as he and his family traveled thousands of mileson tours living in Europe for years to avoid bills and generallyknowing everyone worth knowing in the nineteenth century world of politics, literature and the arts. Twain's friendship withUS Grant seeing to the publication of his memoirs is a movingstory. His petty jealousies and mistreatment of his older brotherOrion is not pretty.Twain's deepest friendship was with fellow midwesterner William Dean Howells who edited the Atlantic, Cosmoplitan andalso was a famous author of such classics as \\"The Rise of SilasLapham.Twain was a complex and often difficult man who could be rudeand ungracious. His foolish quest for weath led him to invest and lose fortunes especially in his backing of the Paige typesetter.He had many admirable traits such as his deep love for his family and friends. Mark Twain represents America and his loveof democacy is commendable.Powers writes in a witty style which is very detailed makinguse of the newly discovered papers on Twain availabe from the Mark Twain project.His work is not as scholary as the recent biography by Fred Kaplan but is a joy for anyone wishing to know the great American Mark Twain.Readers will be informed, entertained and be asked to thinkabout their own views towards life as they read Mr. Twain whosepen was warmed up in hell and whose mind was as busy as a beein the starchy and prim Victorian age.Excellent!"},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"I was disappointed by this biography of one of the most interesting and popular figures in American history and letters. Unlike so many of the other reviewers I found this biography to be excruciatingly long and boring. It takes quite an effort by a writer to make as fascinating a person as Mark Twain dull, but the author succeeds. The writer kept throwing in his personal asides in an effort to be clever, but instead was merely annoying. The writing style is awkward and stilted and it takes a real effort to push through to the end. The author seems to be trying to direct attention to himself as much as the subject. This style makes the 722 pages seem twice as long."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Mediocre biographies are medicore for the same reason that boring histories are boring: they list facts and dates while providing little context that brings the subject to life. But good biographies bring the emotion, the context, the why behind the what, that brings you into intimate contact with a vibrant human life. Ron Power's Mark Twain is of the \\"good biography\\" sort. Indeed, it proved far more fascinating and readable than I had reason to suspect it would be when I bought it on a lark. Mark Twain comes through in clear colors. One can easily imagine the impact this wild fellow had with his drawl, rolling walk, and incisve humor. In addition, one comes away with an understanding of how Mark Twain was woven into the fabric on 19th Century USA. The relationship between Clemens/Twain and his time is as interesting as the man himself.Power's biography was refreshing and interesting on every page. Honestly, there was never a dull page. He effectively weaves into a coherent whole the life experiences of Samuel Clemens, the shaping forces that stimulated the growth of Mark Twain the writer, and the life those books had in 19th Century US as a whole. This tri-fold story is woven together seamlessly and dynamically. One comes away learning so much about a remarkable American icon as well as the nature of the times he lived in.Obviously, I really liked this book. It has piqued me to re-read Twain, and read some of Twain's works that I have never read. I would think that anyone interested in writing, literature, and American history would enjoy Power's biography as thoroughly as I did."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"At last! A rational, reasonable, but above all readable account of the man who gave the United States its most realistic voice. Biographies of Mark Twain are ranked along the shelves. From Paine through De Voto to Lystra's scurrilous depiction, Twain has been the subject of idolisation and iconoclasm. The Kaplans severed him and sutured him, but Twain has survived them all. Powers does more than simply restore Twain's reputation. He provides a picture of Clemens the man. More importantly, Powers gives us Clemens the observer, recorder and writer. The result is a robust work that will outlast its predecessors.The past generation, tainted with \\"deconstruction\\", Freudian, feminist and anti-racist analyses of who Samuel Langhorne Clemens was, leaves many wondering why he should be venerated. Accusations of \\"crude\\" and \\"unlettered\\" still drift though writings about him. Powers lays these to rest with gentle, if firm, dismissals. Like any man, Clemens had his faults and foibles. His failures at business are the stuff of legend, but it was an era of freebooting capitalism. No vaccine had been developed to inoculate the innocent, and innocence was considered a virtue in Clemens' time. Powers carefully relates how \\"Sammy\\" who wanted to live forever on the Mississippi River, was snatched away from a life of absolute power - no-one dared challenge a steamboat pilot - to partake of an era for which he had no briefing.From the childhood on the River, dominated by his austere father and religious mother, Sam Clemens moved across America to avoid the conflict he had no taste for. The escape to Nevada and the Comstock opened many opportunities for discovery. His own Mother Lode turned out to be people. Powers follows Clemens on his prospecting for personalities. The mining ventures, the reporter's role and world travel each produced their own literary nuggets. In a time without jets or SUVs, Clemens' voyages seem almost astonishing. Yet every trip and their stops provided fresh nuggets he would refine and reproduce for our delight. Powers shows that the portrayals are far more than just \\"reporting\\" on the Western way of life. They are harbingers of what was making the United StatesPowers' view of his subject avoids the popular form of \\"deep\\" analysis. Instead, he demonstrates how far-reaching Twain's views proved. He found his nation's imperialist ventures abhorrent, and Powers' presentation of it is subtly topical. He uses Clemens' voice for his own - \\"he made a book of a Paige\\" referring to the aftermath of the bankruptcy would be a perfect Twain aphorism. Powers carefully analyses Clemens' writing prowess, noting both strengths and weaknesses with professional candor. \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", considered by many to be the greatest of the novels, takes a sharp turn in Powers view. The \\"break\\", he says, follows the \\"Wagnerian aria\\" of Huck's damning himself for protecting Jim's identity. Following that event, the biographer condemns Tom Sawyer's \\"evasion\\" scheme as anticlimatic to the vitality of this outstanding work.Having produced a \\"life\\" that reads with an easy familiarity, Powers should be applauded for restoring Clemens as a human being, a literary icon and as the voice of the United States of his day. Clemens successfully broke the patterns of both Boston Brahmin intellectualism and the frequently disdainful view of Victorian commentators. Powers manages this without speculation or judgement, simply offering Twain's expressive words in their context. Having produced other works about Clemens' youth and environment, he's capped the \\"set\\" with an outstanding biography. Anyone wishing to learn about Clemens should start here.

A second advantage is that it does this by giving a detailed description of the time and world in which Twain lived in. It takes the reader through the wandering Twain's adventures in America , and as an innocent abroad. It relates turning point moments in Twain's life in a dramatic way, as for instance his meeting with William Dean Howells in the Atlantic's office in Boston, a meeting which not only open a forty- one year old friendship but pave the way for Twain's acceptance by the New England Literary culture which dominated American Letters.Powers also gives insight into the unique genius of Twain. There is a wonderful paragraph in which he describes the child's gift for hearing and seeing in unusual ways. And how this gift would totally transform American literature bringing into the colloquial voices of so many different American worlds.There have been other very good biographies of Mark Twain but this one in its most detailed reading of the life is a real contribution to our understanding of America's greatest comic writer."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Imagine if you will someone who is a mixture, on the one hand, of Voltaire and Nietzsche, and, on the other hand, of Andy Rooney, Steve Martin, Woody Allen, and Will Rogers, and you will get some idea of Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), \\"the Wild Humorist of the Pacific Slope\\" and \\"the Lincoln of American Literature,\\" a man known as Mark Twain.In Mark Twain: A Life, Ron Powers, a Pulitzer Prize-winning and Emmy Award-winning writer and critic who has studied and written about Mark Twain for many years (his published work includes Dangerous Water: A Biography of the Boy Who Became Mark Twain), has written a top-echelon biography of \\"the representative figure of his times.\\"Powers' project was to write a narrative of Twain's life and works that explains what bound Twain and his half of the American 19th century so closely together, and to explain the liberating personal magnetism that Twain possessed that moved his contemporaries to forgive him for traits and tendencies that biographers of a later time have found deplorable.\\"Twainian critical literature from 1920 onward,\\" writes Powers, \\"has been dominated by theory, rather than interpretive portraiture. His biographers have tended to evoke him through the prism of Freudian psychoanalysis. In that way he is seen as an interesting, if not terribly self-aware outpatient--a walking casebook of neuroses, unconscious tendencies, masks, and alternate identities.\\"Drawing heavily on the preserved viewpoints of the people who knew him best, Powers seeks to rediscover Mark Twain the human being, as he lived, breathed, and wrote. With the assistance of the Mark Twain Project at Berkeley, he has drawn on thousands of letters and notebook entries, many only recently discovered.Powers' expertise in the field of literary criticism is seen as he describes the conception and execution of Twain's major works (listed here in their order of publication): The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches; The Innocents Abroad; Roughing It; The Gilded Age (with Charles Dudley Warner); The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; A Tramp Abroad; The Prince and the Pauper; Life on the Mississippi; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court; The American Claimant; Personal Reflections of Joan of Arc; Tom Sawyer, Detective; Following the Equator; Eve's Diary; and Letters from the Earth.Powers points out that Twain characteristically used the narrative technique of a frame story--a main story that seeks to organize a set of shorter stories, each of which is a story within a story. Twain's strong suit as a writer, he asserts, was not tightly organized plots with logical connections and transitions; his genius lay in a free-flowing style that carved out new islands of prose, much like the wild. wide-ranging Mississippi River that periodically overflowed its banks.Although Twain lacked formal training in rhetoric and literature, he was a voracious reader, knowing the Bible better than many men of the cloth, and knowing Shakespeare almost as well as the Bible. Powers raises an interesting question: \\"If he had been schooled in the formal requirements of literature, would that have suffocated the divine, anarchic spontaneity [and serendipity of his narratives] that provides the greatest pleasures in his work?\\"Twain's early works established his reputation as a \\"mere humorist.\\" These tall tales and genre send-ups are filled with language parodies, hoaxes, quaint customs, deadpan drolleries, sarcasm, and zany, antic \\"snappers\\" of the type beloved by stand-up comics. His mastery of platform gimmicks, especially the dramatic pause, typically sent his audiences into convulsions of laughter. \\"Mark Twain,\\" writes Powers, \\"never met a genre he didn't like to lampoon.\\"And yet Twain had a darker, more serious side. \\"The line between humor and sorrow,\\" writes Powers, \\"was thin, tending toward nonexistent, in Samuel Clemen's mind.\\" Twain himself wrote, \\"The secret source of humor itself is not joy, but sorrow. There is no laughter in heaven.\\" His satire, turning skeptical and cynical, contained barbed stings.Twain told his friend, the Rev. Joe Twichell that he did not believe in the \\"divinity\\" (divine inspiration) of the Bible, and that it was arrogant and presumptuous of humans (insignificant microbes in a vast cosmos) to believe in a providential God who intervenes in world events and answers prayer.Having a \\"personal hatred for humbug,\\" Twain lashed out at pious pretensions and patriotic flimflam with the fury of an Old Testament prophet. The radar of this \\"moralist in disguise\\" (his self-description) was keenly attuned to detect hypocrisy and mendacity.Powers devotes much space to Twain's relationship with his family--his wife Olivia Louise (\\"Livy\\") Langdon, and their children, Langdon, Susy, Clara, and Jane (called \\"Jean\\"). Langdon died as an infant, Susy died of spinal meningitis, and Jean was an epileptic whose death also preceded Twain's. Of his immediate family, only Clara survived Twain. Powers also describes Twain's lifelong friends, William Dean Howells and the Rev. Joe Twichell, and Twain's disastrous pursuit of a will-o'-the-wisp, the Paige typesetting machine, which promised to make him filthy rich, but which instead drove him to the verge of bankruptcy.The writings of Twain's last two decades were especially filled with anger. Although he approved the United States' intervention in Cuba, he soon parted company with the imperialism of a new \\"Manifest Destiny.\\" The American expansionist policy of seizing the Philippine archipelago aroused his fury. Powers points out that Filipino losses would total twenty thousand soldiers and more than two hundred thousand civilians against 4,200 Americans dead.\\"I am an anti-imperialist,\\" thundered Twain; \\"I oppose putting the eagle's talons on any other land.\\" Reading these words a century after they were written, one experiences an eerie sense of deja-vu.\\"The newspapers heralded [Twain],\\" writes Powers, \\"as a prophet, or something larger than a prophet'; the soul of the nation personified.\\"Twain's dark fury also turned more intensely to religious humbug. \\"I have a religion--but you will call it blasphemy. It is that there is a God for the rich man but none for the poor.\\" His scathing indictment of jingoistic patriotism, \\"The War Prayer,\\" was so potentially offensive to conservatives that his editors refused to publish it. Also, Twain ordered that his iconoclastic work, Letters from the Earth, be published posthumously, so as not to wound his pious wife, whom he adored.Of Mark Twain: A Life, Ken Brown writes: \\"No one understands the complicated American the world knows as Mark Twain better than Ron Powers. Finally, we have scholarship and writing worthy of the man. Powers's prose is insightful, elegant, and gets to the center of Twain's life, humor, tragedy, and outrage.\\"Hal Holbrook writes: \\"Ron Powers ... gives us the steady progress of Twain's intensely personal existence, the human side of Twain's victories and failures. With lightning-bolt images Powers illuminates the explosive strength of America's homegrown literary voice.\\"\\"Twain demonstrated, as no one had before him,\\" writes Powers, that humor and thematic seriousness were not incompatible.\\" The same is true of Powers' Mark Twain: A Life. Well-researched and well-documented this work of solid scholarship is a serious biography. But it is also a work containing much humor, spiced as it is with Powers' bon mots, zingers, and snappers.For many years, Ron Powers has communed with the greatest of American writers and has absorbed much of Mark Twain's spirit. With superb writing, he brings Twain to life. Buy this book! It's a masterpiece.Roy E. Perry of Nolensville is an advertising copywriter at a Nashville publishing house."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"I can add nothing to the other reviews here. I would add, sadly, that Powers' excellent biography of Mark Twain would unlikely to ever appear on the list of a university press, at least without a lot of editing. Scholarship is not the issue. Powers puts himself into the book and makes comments that no university press would tolerate. Rather, they would insist on bland prose."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"I have never been exposed to Mark Twain, but I do enjoy reading biographies. So when a friend gave me Mark Twain: A Life by Ron Powers, I couldn't resist.Mark Twain is a mammoth work, and Powers goes to great lengths to explain this 19th Century icon to 21st Century readers (Powers calls Twain America's first rock star). Twain had a circuitous route to fame, and the author starts with his childhood and the history of the Clemmens family. Twain first became a printer's assistant, switched over to steamboat pilot and then had a very short career as a Confederate soldier in the Missouri State Guard. But Twain's first love was writing, and he became a successful newspaper writer for two Western papers. This gave him the platform which launched his career as a humorist, speaker and novelist.Powers gives us lots of information about his relationships with his family and friends. Clemmens was a prodigious writer, and is said to have written from 50,000 to 100,000 letters. He also kept dozens of notebooks, which help give us a window on Twain's thought processes. It is mind-boggling to think that Twain's social circle included Thoreau, Emerson, Longfellow, Henry James, Ulysses S. Grant, Henry Ward Beecher and William Dean Howells.But while Powers gives us everything we ever wanted to know about Twain (and then some), he skimps on Twain's early years, as well as his old age. Powers claims that the Hannibal years of Twain's youth were the \\"ten most imaginatively fertile years of his life.\\" Yet Powers only spends one chapter (13 pages of a 722 page book) discussing these formative years. Powers dedicates only two chapters (29 pages) to the last ten years of his life. Instead of facts, Powers has a tendency to over-analyze Twain's writing. The chapter on Huckleberry Finn reads like a doctoral dissertation. At the end, Powers leaves us hanging when Twain breathes his last, and there are many unanswered questions. Where was Twain's funeral? What was it like? Who eulogized him? Where is he buried? Does he have any descendants? Who reaps the financial benefit of his writings today? When and how was his Hartford house turned into a historic site? And what ever happened to his father's Tennessee land? After finishing this book, I discovered that Twain had his wife's remains cremated. Why didn't Powers include this fact in his book? Such information is interesting--especially for the times.Still, Powers is a wordsmith and he is obviously smitten with his subject. His descriptions of Twain's talent are first rate. \\"Mark Twain's baton began to mute the Anglican symphony and strike up the rhythms of American jazz....Any language to him was a form of music. Even the slightest misuse of his native tongue grated on his ears like a false note--unless it was in dialect, which had its own laws.\\" Powers claims that Twain suffered from \\"typographical Tourette's Syndrome\\" when he worked as a Western news writer. This is good stuff. But unlike Twain (who valued brevity), Powers loves a dollar word when a nickel word will do.I definitely enjoyed Mark Twain: A Life and it has piqued my interest to read more of and about Mark Twain. I may even take a ride to see his home in Hartford CT. But I feel that Powers fell short of having a truly magnificent biography."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Mark Twain and his volatile life have often been microscopically filleted until one literally can't see the whole man for the particular interpretation of him. This is certainly an understandable scholarly approach with such a wealth of material to deal with. But now in Ron Powers's holistic Twain book we see the parts finally coalesce into the whole fascinating fellow.Twain was impish, outrageous, sentimental, crass, heroic, vituperative, venal, generous, vain, insecure, self destructive, self regenerating, almost mystically prolific and uncompromisingly brilliant but above all passionately human. Thanks to Powers's watershed book, we can see just how human. The many letters from which he has quoted contain Twain's trademark yin yang of self deprecation and hilarity. The narrative is so seamless that there are times it is difficult to see where Twain's writing leaves off and Powers's begins.Most are accustomed to the beloved Twain of both white suit and hair (and occasional red socks) featured center stage, spouting quotable humorous yarns, culminating with the zinger of truth. In Powers's book, Twain is still in the spotlight, but now the house lights have been turned on to reveal the rest of the cast. What a cast, and what a stage America was! Twain starts strutting America's proscenium in the mid 1800's when the country traveled by horse and buggy or river steamboat. He goes from preteen unpaid cub typesetter and nascent reporter to Mississippi riverboat pilot, then carouses through the gold pixilated West, making his bones as mining town reporter where facts were meant to be flexible. Later he starts his lecture circuit, eventually becoming as famous and apparently as temperamental as the most worshiped of our contemporary rock stars. Mark Twain as chick magnet. Who knew?Back East, he finds his mentor and eventual life-long friend, editor-critic William Dean Howells; writes his first smash hit, the comic travelogue \\"Innocents Abroad,\\" then meets, woos and weds his dear aristocratic Livy. He travels, publishes more books, pens \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" and much later his masterpiece \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\"Twain criticizes but personally revels in the wealth of the \\"Gilded Age\\", (which he named in a novel of that title), throws lavish parties and rubs shoulders with writers, generals, presidents, and robber barons. Eventually he even turns publisher of Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs, rescuing the dying general's family from bankruptcy. All the while he is writing letters by the basketful to family, friends, and foes. Somewhere In the process of traveling to write travelogues and lecturing to repay debts, he becomes world renowned. In the end, despite losing a fortune and most of his dear family, and having to lecture to repay his almost infantile business investments, he never stops observing, writing \\"appearing\\" and critiquing his 19th century even into on into the nascent 20th century. Twain endures.In addition to his humor, Powers highlights Twain's revolutionary literary voice; his unique take on \`our' particular American voices. In an age characterized by \\"polite\\" Victorian prose, Twain wrote in the American vernacular, not to ridicule, but to capture and popularize the cadences of ordinary people for the first time. The voices of Huckleberry Finn and Jim explode the myth of the contented slave in a time when people still hung on to the concept of slavery as divine right. There are other voices in the book. The voices of Twain's contemporaries as seen by Twain pop to life in his correspondence and are further lovingly delineated by Powers. Of course there is the actual written or spoken voice of Twain as lecturer, letter writer, critic, and occasional mock rube. Again, the voice. It's his humor, his humanity, his self deprecation and his passion for life that we hear.If you are used to dry biographies, throw away your pre-conceptions. This book has been written by someone with a unique voice. It is scholarly, but graced with wry humor, it's informative, but above all, it is wildly entertaining. Twain is never ever dull. He could not have chosen a biographer with a voice more suited to his work.Joan Hibbard Ryan"},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"Ron Powers's \\"Mark Twain\\" is one of those rare treats: a biography where the subject and author are so perfectly matched that the result is a fascinating, compulsively readable book, one that proves perfectly worthy of the subject it covers. It will certainly become the gold standard of Twain biographies."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"I wouldn't presume to add anything to the reviews of this book, even if I could. But I didn't find any comments on the quality of the recording, which is worth a note.The reader is the author himself, Ron Powers. He is very easy to listen to. I find myself drifting off less than I usually do, and getting a lot more of the meat of the book. Powers manages to suggest by his voice when the subject changes or a recurrent theme appears and he clearly pronounces the punctuation that he no doubt sweated over. His imitation of Twain's voice isn't quite what I expected after Hal Holbrook, but it works to make the transitions to and from quotations very fluid, and I have begun to think of it as the voice of Twain.All in all, I liked Power's reading as much as those of professional readers. If the book sounds good to you, I am certain you will love the audio CD."},{"Title":"Mark Twain: a Life","review":"An interesting biography of Mark Twain aka Samuel Clemens, a journalist and a writer.Although he had no formal education, Mark Twain was arguably the best English language writer since Shakespeare, with his greatest contribution to the American literature being the novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.Mark Twain traveled around the world, and had a great sense of humanityHe was a patriot who loved his country and the 19th century. But he condemned his American society for its hypocrisy. He was anti-colonial and anti-imperialist. He condemned the US for the invasion of Cuba and the Philippines, and the annexation of its neighbor, Mexico."},{"Title":"Education and Japan's modernization","review":"The book came out in 1983, when Japan had gone thru heady decades of spectacular modernisation. The book looks at the role that its education system played in raising a highly literate and educated workforce. We get a history of education that well predates World War 2. In fact, most of the book is about education in the prewar period.After the war, we see the structure of the primary, secondary and tertiary components. There is no discussion about the severe workloads and pressure often incurred by students in primary and high school. Granted, the system worked wonders. But there was indeed a human cost, including suicides, that the book completely ignores."},{"Title":"Tornado Jones","review":"As you read of the adventures of Tornado Jones and his family you are transported back to a simpler time.

I really did like this book ... and have passed it on to other family members who have also enjoyed it."},{"Title":"A Tree Full of Angels: Seeing the Holy in the Ordinary","review":"Macrina has done a wonderful presentation of prayer that relates to real people's real lives. Many of us believe that prayer is for &quot;holy&quot; people, and the discovery that &quot;holy&quot; is all around us is a miracle of revelation for many.Particularly helpful for me were Chapters 3 and 5. Chapter 3 deals with finding nourishment in those parts of our lives that aren't obviously rich and joyful. How do we &quot;gather the crumbs&quot; from both everyday and difficult times to find enough to eat and be nourished?Chapter 5 has been very helpful to me in teaching others about Benedictine spirituality. The richness of Macrina's development of &quot;lectio divina&quot; and its place in her prayer life is both supportive and instructive for those who read her work.I'm looking forward to her next work!"},{"Title":"A Tree Full of Angels: Seeing the Holy in the Ordinary","review":"This book touched me at a very deep level.

She is definetly worth it! I'm going to read it again. It's been ten years ago that I read it. Sometimes in your life it all depends where you are at spiritually.

Her language is easy to understand and invites one to enter into the process of finding oneself in and through the journey toward knowing God. There's nothing complicated to get bogged down in, and one feels comforted, and encouraged to \\"become present\\" to life.I am so glad that a friend introduced her book to me, and am currently reading it the second time.What's amazing about Macrina is how she is able to help people focus on themselves while at the same time they are focusing on God--it's not either/or; you don't have to feel that you must \\"hate yourself\\" in order to pursue God, because it's a dance between two beautiful, beloved \\"creatures\\".If you feel that you need healing from damaging \\"religion\\" you had forced on you in childhood, I think you will find this book very safe, and greatly facilitative of healing--I did!"},{"Title":"A Tree Full of Angels: Seeing the Holy in the Ordinary","review":"This book by Macrina Wiederkehr, \\"A Tree Full of Angels\\",is a keeper.

As Fowler intended, Barrymore emerges from this book not as a hell-raising, womanizing alcoholic who was also an actor, but as an artist of real merit and significance whose life was by turns quixotic, hilarious, tragic, the man himself an authentic genius (as can still be seen in some of his film performances) doomed by self-destructive alcoholism. And yet, as Fowler states, &quot;...his spirit remained essentially young and unconquered.&quot; Highly recommended for any readers interested in writing as elegant as a Fred Astaire dance number about a great, misunderstood man and actor."},{"Title":"Good Night, Sweet Prince The Life And Times Of John Barrymore","review":"Very interesting book about John Barrymore and any Barrymore family fan will enjoy it!

I would have been disappointed if I paid that amount."},{"Title":"Female Homosexuality: Choice Without Volition (Psychoanalytic Inquiry Book Series)","review":"Although steeped in psychoanalytic jargon, and obviously intended for the professional, this book is remarkable for its groundbreaking, revolutionary view of the dynamics of bi/lesbianism, and tells a fascinating story.This book reports in graphic, sexually explicit language the case histories of 6 adamantly committed lesbians referred to Dr. Siegel by their lesbian support group who became fully and permanently heterosexual upon treatment!This clinical result is even more impressive when you realize that Dr. Siegel treated a total of only 12 lesbian referrals from that same lesbian support group--so that fully one-half of the test group became fully and completely heterosexual, at which point the lesbian support group angrily stopped making referrals to Dr. Siegel!The key to successful treatment, as outlined exhaustively by Dr. Siegel, is that these 6 women were ultimately able to identify with her as a strong heterosexual mother, something that all had lacked as children. In doing so, they were able to successfully complete their psychosexual development with her and become fully and exclusively heterosexual.Since her own successful countertransference with all 6 patients was itself the essential element, in effect this discovery and clinical observation could only have been made by a female psychoanalyst, such as Dr. Siegel, which in itself makes it a truly remarkable story!Dr. Siegel further outlines her view that today's sex industry is also uniquely a bi/lesbian phenomena. Her sociological research conclusively demonstrates for the first time that female sex workers are in fact predominantly bisexual and lesbian.She details many other aspects of each patient's histories, including each parent's role and other novel, determining psychoanalytic factors that she believes contributed both to their original lesbianism and to her own successful treatment.Again, the only weakness of the book is that Dr. Siegel must translate each observation into tedious and laborious psychoanalytics, which detracts somewhat from the book's fascinating and unique content and popular appeal.The book is groundbreaking in that Dr. Siegel's successful treatment is unique, unsurpassed, and, in my opinion, itself a phenomena worthy of study."},{"Title":"Female Homosexuality: Choice Without Volition (Psychoanalytic Inquiry Book Series)","review":"Elaine Siegel has written a book in which she openly presents her negative countertransference toward her lesbian patients as a clinical modality to change their sexual identities. What is most amazing about this book is that the author is so open about her contempt for her lesbian patients."},{"Title":"Female Homosexuality: Choice Without Volition (Psychoanalytic Inquiry Book Series)","review":"The intractable controversy of nature vs nurture continues as modern science tries to understand whether homosexuals are born or made, and what evolutionary adaptation is served by homosexuality. In the final chapter of this book, (&quot;Parental Profiles&quot;), Elaine Siegel spells out the subtle dynamics of reverse dominance hierarchy, as expressed in the pre-oedipal familial forces which worked together to create 6 female homosexuals: The pre-oedipal(maternal)forces which she describes in these families operated in all 6 families to undermine and reverse the pathological and emotionally non-nurturing Oedipal(paternal)dominance.From an evolutionary viewpoint, such powerful pre-oedipal forces defy Oedipal male dominance in favor of the weaker, smaller and subordinate mothers and other females. In point of fact, this clear-cut pattern of offspring siding with the mother and other female family members against the father consistently emerges in the case histories of all the sexual perversions: For example, homosexuality, by retaining the primary feminine identification with the mother, effects reverse dominance either through maternal alliance(in the case of sons), or through sexual alliances with an alpha female(as in out-migrating bonobo females). Sado-masochism has its roots in powerless deception in anticipation of punishment, while fetishism, transvestitism, voyeurism and exhibitionism employ deception and stealth to defuse the threat of castration by dominant males. Such employments of deception pose ongoing &quot;security risks&quot; and thus effectively monopolize the attention of alpha and other dominant males, so that mothers and aunts successfully gain an advantage, and can artfully achieve reverse dominance through the employment of such strategies.Female out-migration is an incest avoidance mechanism that evolved to prevent mating with unidentifiable fathers in humans, bonobos and chimpanzees. However, when out-migration is not possible and generational captive incest does occur, mothers defensively create and employ pre-oedipal alliances with offspring in an attempt to drive out the offending, dominant males. Generational captive incest is thus the explicit evolutionary precursor of pre-oedipal reverse dominance hierarchies.Theoretically, the precarious balance of female versus male power(and pre-oedipal sexuality), in both human and primate societies, is ultimately driven environmentally by levels of prenatal maternal stress, and developmentally by the effect of distant or absent fathers. Maternal stress, in turn, is modulated by its own hierarchies of genes, hormones, and environmentally-driven sex-typed behaviors."},{"Title":"Ringstones","review":"A young girl takes a summer job caring for some rather odd children in an isolated old house in the North of England and then...The everyday world of Sarban's characters is itself a little strange to 21st century American readers.

His characters remain virginal and there is no splatterpunk.In this one the buildup is slow and insidious and you have to tolerate a story-within-a-story with digressions and feeble jokes until the tension builds up to the weirdly fascinating climax.Incidentally this Ballantiyne paperback, the one pictured by amazon, only contains \\"Ringstones.\\" He also wrote \\"The Sound of His Horn\\" and \\"The Dollmaker\\".

In time, he discovers the root of a twenty year old mystery, gains a girlfriend, and solves the mystery of why Anna's yard was chosen as the final resting place of Richie Harraday... and one of Jonathan's old friends.This book has quite a good plot, including many amusing things... such as the main character being a bookstore owner, and a mystery fan as a grandmother. Really, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this book, except for the dialogue. It was all rather stilted, and featured some completely unbelievable characters. For instance, Anna is a fan of complex talk... but how many people have ever heard a person mention the word &quot;garish&quot; in common place conversation?

In those days, the way writers built up their characters was so different from present that it is very hard to adjust to. James tells us what his characters are like, whereas most modern writers prefer letting them speak for themselves. Moreover (and this is, of course, because of the formal Victorian habit culture), the characters seem to be always pretending and hiding something. All this makes even Isabel a pretty distant figure, more words than flesh and blood.All these problems make it for me, a modern reader, very hard to really enjoy the story, which in itself is quite nice. In its own age, the book has probably said a lot of human nature. For me, it doesn't say very much. It's just a story. But I must admit that in the end James made me really feel for the characters, care about their destiny. The open ending seemed to be the most modern single feature of the book - I liked it."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"This is the first book I have read by Henry James and I was really impressed. I chose this book for my junior AP English research project because I thought it sounded interesting. When I realized how long the book was I thought I would regret my choice. Once I started reading, it was a little hard to get into because the first few chapters were really slow but after I got past those chapters the plot got really interesting and went by really quickly. I really enjoyed this novel because it dealt with a woman's struggle for independence in the 1800s and has strong characters. The novel tells the story of Isable Archer, a young American girl who had nothing, whose expatriate Aunt, Mrs. Touchett, comes and takes her to Europe so that she can become known in society and find a husband. While in Europe Miss Archer meets many people and has many suitors but struggles to keep her independence. The characters play an important role in creating the story. Henry James did a wonderful job of developing them to such depth that at some times I even felt like I actually knew what the characters were thinking. The characters are very complex and every few chapters there is a twist and the reader is completely deceived which is what makes the novel so unique. I also like the characters because they really seemed real, not just fictional and I know people who are like the characters. The novel is well written and filled with similes, metaphors, light imagery and color that contribute to the ironic tone. I recommend this book to every woman but I don't think that men would find the subject as appealing."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"This novel is certainly in the top 100 ever written.

Henry James knowledge of the human condition is incredible. His subtlety of thought and ability to express himself in words is trully glorious. What a rare adventure in the world of mind, heart and soul! I love this book."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"When you pick up a book fully expecting the literary equivalent of beets or spinach, the result can be a self-fulfilling prophesy of mind-numbing boredom. Or you can be surprised by the interest and entertainment you get reading it. This provided more the latter than the former, if not to the point of real enthusiasm.Isabel Archer is a young American woman living alone after her parents' deaths. A chilly but sympathetic aunt takes her to live with her estranged husband and their sickly son, Ralph Touchett. Ralph develops a special friendship for Isabel; he enjoys her spirit and wants to see her embrace life's possibilities. \\"You want to drain the cup of experience,\\" he marvels. She demurs from this frank appraisal, but winds up quaffing down a particular noxious formula for lifelong misery. Can she see the error of her ways, and act accordingly?Henry James is not my kind of writer. He likes long descriptive passages featuring much repetition and little plot. His focus seems narrowed to a privileged few.Here those tendencies are leavened right away by the array of extraordinary characters we are introduced to. Other reviewers say \\"Portrait\\" is a good read once you get past the first 100 or so pages at Gardencourt, the Touchett estate. For me, the opening was the best part. We meet such characters as Mrs. Touchett, an openly selfish but duty-bound not-quite ex-wife; sickly but game Ralph; the radical nobleman Lord Warburton; a hilariously chauvinistic and dogged journalist, Henrietta Stackpole; and Isabel herself, who defies any simple characterization. Watching these people come together is a bit like a car wreck, though the most genteel car wreck imaginable.The rest of the book is where things grew more tiresome to me. Isabel makes one of those life decisions only feasible in the realm of Victorian fiction, and the result is both predictable and drawn-out. James interestingly if frustratingly chooses to tell this part of the story in elliptical fashion; i.e. entire years fly by in the course of single paragraphs, and we are told of estrangements and miscarriages in almost second-hand fashion.\\"The Portrait Of A Lady\\" derives the power it has from the notion of social order as iron-bound contract, of life \\"ground in the very mill of the conventional\\" as James writes. Some critics read a feminist message in this 1881 novel, of a woman struggling to break the bonds of male domination. But the bonds Isabel struggles with are of her own making, and she is surrounded by a raft of empowered females, one too many in fact.\\"Portrait Of A Lady\\" has its fans, and I can see the attraction of this deep-dish novel. If you are a fan of the period, or of James in particular, you will probably enjoy it more than me. If you aren't a fan of those things, you could be pleasantly surprised all the same. YMMV, as they say."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"To me this book is worth reading just for the wonderful romance between Isabel and her cousin.

That word is overused but this book deserves it. I'm not good at hollistic reviews, so I'll break it down.This book is about the strength of the human spirit. Isabel Archer (the protagonist) is a hero. Though she has some flaws which temporarily inconvenience her, she doesn't give up.The writing's delightful. It is full of wit, and while reading it you may come up with your in. Portrait is the first book I've read with this kind of humor, and I'm glad I learned it.The writing can be jilted. Very important plot points are just jumped over. Twice I found myself reading backwards, wondering when I missed something. This can be extremely aggrevating.Possibly because of its paeanage to individualism, Portrait strongly mirrors Rand's to largest books, Atlas and Fountainhead. Though this was doubtless unintentional it was extremely interesting. Isabel is strongly similar to the lead of the latter, while Osmond's character repeatedly had me mutting &quot;The Man Who Belonged On Earth.&quot;I think the reason that some other reviewers and I disagree on the tone (some say it is disenhartening) stems from the unique ending.

I thought she conveyed much snobbishness to her childhood friend by not assisting him when he desperately pleaded with her for her step daughter's hand. He was madly in love and she rather turned her back on him. Isabel was also a very, very poor judge of character, much due to her young age and falling into oodles of money left to her by her uncle. She could have had anything in the world, including her freedom or the love a good hearted man. Through her poor choices, she ended up miserable. She would have been much better off staying poor.

It starts out with a girl named Isabel Archer who goes with her Aunt Touchett to England. Isabel is portrayed beautifully by James in the novel as a curious, independent, intelligent lady. She arrives in isolated Gardencourt where she meets her uncle and her cousin, Ralph Touchett. Soon, she is proposed to by Lord Warburten portrayed as a polite, wealthy, radical gentleman but rejects him because her curiousity expects another, better suiter. Caspar Goodward, her other lover, fallows her to England and is determined to marry her. The two men come in even further in the novel when intrigue and scandel take place. Isabel travels all through Europe but is eventually entrapped and decieved. Drama and intrigue take the stage then. By that time it may sound like some domb soup opera, but really he refines the situations and makes them realistic but still dramatic unlike most stupid soaps. Some parts may seem long and dull because he explains himself so explicitly with huge paragraphs about one subject but it's worth it when your finished. The characters are done superbly with wonderful description. There is much irony, too, but if you immiedietly think irony is funny like some people its not in this novel.

She has been very fond of her liberty in America. In this other part of the world, Europe, Isabel meets all Osmond's requirements for his type of marriage.

And Isabel's relationship with his daughter is shattered. And her idea of marriage is reversed.

Through various circumstances (none of which are particularly credible), Ms. Archer inherits a fortune and manages to induce drooling, slavish adoration in every man who meets her. Isabel falls under the spell of Madame Merle--a distinguished older woman with a mysterious past who wields a svengali-like influence over her. Madame Merle introduces Isabel to Gilbert Osmond, a self-centered dilettante living in Florence who collects beautiful women as he does Etruscan urns. Isabel Archer marries Osmond, comes to recognize him for the vile scumbag he is, and resigns herself to a lifetime of unhappiness. &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; would be well-suited for a Merchant/Ivory style movie: plenty of old English lawns and drawing rooms, Italian pensiones, and beautiful young adults exchanging furtive glances. But it's not a movie (I'd be more enthusiastic if it were); it's a book--and a mind-numbingly slow one. Admittedly, the last 100 pages are quite interesting and contain a few surprising plot twists. The book ends with a rather provocative kiss (calling into question both Isabel Archer's sexuality and/or Henry James's), but I'm not sure it's worth slogging through 750 pages to get to it"},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"Henry James has truly outdone himself with this book. While it is no longer my favorite James' novel, I still think it among the best novels written in the English language. The character of Isabel Archer is an indelible part of literature. The story begins with an American woman, left parentless and penniless, being discovered by an expatriate Aunt. The Aunt convinces her to go England with her so that she might meet her cousin, Ralph. Isabel eagerly agrees. She is idealistic and has always wanted to see Europe. Her aunt agrees to pay for the expenditures. Once there, Isabel falls in love with their house, Gardencourt, and grows to enjoy her frail, sweet, ironic, and funny cousin. Before Isabel knows it, she has become ensnared in a one-sided love affair with a handsome English nobleman, Lord Warburton, little knowing what to do. Despite the urgings of her aunt, Isabel rejects his proposal in the desire to wait for something better. Soon, her elderly uncle dies, but not before she charms him with her intelligence and subtle beauty. Ralph insists that his father leave Isabel a substantial fortune, so that she might be able to live as she wishes. When the uncle dies, Isabel is left with 70,000 pounds, or about 200,000 dollars. From here is where the true story begins. I will not reveal more of the plot, which unwinds slowly and with assurance. James, being a master of prose, knows how to manipulate a sentence in a multitude of ways. His lilting, ironic, verbose writing style lends class and charm to Isabel's ultimately tragic tale. Some modern readers aren't able to handle James' subtle style. Unfortunately, many of us have had to fight the effects of shortened attention spans. Reading a slow-paced and brilliantly conceived tale like this will surely help cure short attention spans. Once you begin the story, it grows on you and affects you greatly. James is difficult getting used to, but he grabs you with his excellent descriptions of passionate people. Finally, the brilliance of this book lies in its tragedy. Even though many readers can predict early on where Isabel's confidence and naivete will lead her, James makes the journey bumpy and fascinating. He also slowly injects the story with dread, as we begin to sense the true malevolence of Madame Merle's and Osmond's vicious plans. Their acts are pure Machiavellian glee. Only in the final third of the book does it become clear of the true nature of the scheming M. Merle's plans. James also leaves several important plot points until near the end of the novel. All of this leads to a long, engrossing, and sad story of a young woman &quot;affronting her destiny&quot;, as James puts it. Rarely has so romantic or so devastating a book been written. The ending is the final kicker. Unlike the happy ending we suspect, James leaves readers with open interpretations and many possible questions regarding Isabel's TRUE feelings about men. It also most vividly presents her sexual repression and fear that dominate the entire book. James knew the reserves of the time dictated that such topics not be discussed, and he cleverly uses this theme discreetly. However, he also uses it as a sort of indictment on the times, with their lack of passion and sensuality. Many readers expect a conclusion to the story, but, as with real life, stories simply go on. The ending is perhaps the most modern thing about the book. It also makes certain readers know that Isabel's life will never be one of happiness. This is an exquisitely haunting masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"The best thing about 19th century novels is that they take so long to unwind, you know that you are guaranteed a long and satisfying trip into a story. I initially bought this book after seeing the Jane Campion film, (which I actually wasn't too crazy about)but I always think it's a good idea to read the source material. After a few false starts (warning: one needs to devote all their attention to James in order to enjoy him)I finally got into this book, and couldn't put it down. From the great settings of the novel, to the variety of fascinating characters (the liberated Henrietta Stackpole, the sinister Madame Merle, the beloved Ralph Touchett, Ralph's eccentric mother, the flighty Countess Gemini, the deadly Gilbert Osmond, and of course, Isabel Archer herself... James gives characters great names as well) &quot;Portrait&quot; is a great novel not only of self discovery, but self deception. How many of us in this world have liked to have thought ourselevs as free to make our own chocies, and were excited by a future full of &quot;possibility&quot; only to allow something (or usually someone) to get in our way and make us realize just how quickly we can lose our freedom and be in a cage that we need to get out of. (Pardon my bad grammar.) Those of you looking fora Jane Austen type ending, this may not be the book for you, but I think this book is more of a spiritual cousin to Austen than we may think. It all comes down to making choices, and teh effects of those decisions. Throw off any reservations that you may have because this book was written over a century ago, it's as fresh, funny, tragic and riveting today as it was then. (And hey, buy the film soundtrack which perfectly captures the mood of the story for accompaniment..that was a plug!)"},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"Henry James is one of my favorite authors and The Portrait of a Lady is one of his greatest works. In it, he creates a unique and unforgettable heroine, Isabel Archer, and then proceeds to let her make all the mistakes the young are capable of making. In fact, Isabel is so sure of herself that, at times, I found it difficult to have much sympathy for her poor choices. But one thing I never felt for Isabel Archer was indifference, all to James' credit.The Portrait of a Lady is truly 19th Century literature at its finest, but that means it also contains elements that might be distracting for the modern reader. There are lengthy descriptions, the pace is rather slow and James never lets us forget we are reading a book. He makes liberal use of phrases such as &quot;our heroine,&quot; and &quot;Dear Reader.&quot; While all of this was expected in the 19th Century, some readers today might find it annoying.Those who don't however, will find themselves entranced by a beautiful story of love and loss, unforgettable characters (there are many more besides Isabel, most notably the enigmatic Madame Merle) and gorgeous description, all rendered in James' flawless prose.Anyone who loves classics or who wants a truly well-rounded background in literature cannot afford to pass this up."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"Henry James is not known for his swift pace in world literature; instead, along w/ his psychiatrist brother, Henry James never fails to frame the fragility of human spirit with an elegant touch, weaving the psyche into one continuous stream of thoughts. In this stunning achievement of his, James portrays a young, ingenuous American heiress, Isabel Archer, who comes to Europe looking for ways to escape commonality of her old life. Intelligent and rebellious, Isabel soon finds herself entrapped in a society where one might not soar as high even with an impressive fortune as the one she has inherited. It is her wish to avoid the common lot that leads her astray: first refusing a good nobleman, then bestowing herself on a mysterious stranger for the sake of &quot;tasting reality&quot;. Not knowing the consequence of such a fateful entanglement, Isabel refuses advice from her earnest but sickly cousin and eccentric but wise aunt to consent to a devious dilettante, seducer who hunts her down with the appeal of a poor man in want of sympathy.This is where James so skillfully masters the art of psychology--in one aspect the readers are drawn to share in Isabel's subtle fall into an abyss of shapeless pain, in another apsect, we as readers cannot help but denounce Isabel's pompous intelligence that leads her further away from the truth which her pride prevents her from seeing. The moral of her tragedy (which includes further entanglement with an American beau, her cousin, her step-daughter, an all-American girl-friend, and a dark motherly figure whose relationship w/ Isabel's husband remains a mystery for you to discover), is that in a process of seeking happiness through pain, through seeking out suffering to justify her wealth, Isabel loses sight of a reality that may be ruled by one thing and one thing only--fate."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"Henry James - The Portrait of a LadyHenry James stands between the traditional and the experimental novel , his work having brought an important contribution to the development of modern fiction .

This contrast between American and European values, vividly dramatized here, is a consistent theme in James's novels, one based on his own experiences living in the US and England. In prose that is filled with rich observations about places, customs, and attitudes, James portrays Isabel's European coming-of-age, as she discovers that she must curb her intellect and independence if she is to fit into the social scheme in which she now finds herself.Isabel Archer, one of James's most fully drawn characters, has postponed a marriage in America for a year of travel abroad, only to discover upon her precipitate and ill-considered marriage to an American living in Florence, that it is her need to be independent that makes her marriage a disaster. Gilbert Osmond, an American art collector living in Florence, marries Isabel for the fortune she has inherited from her uncle, treating her like an object d'art which he expects to remain \\"on the shelf.\\" Madame Serena Merle, his long-time lover, is, like Osmond, an American whose venality and lack of scruples have been encouraged, if not developed, by the European milieu in which they live.James packs more information into one paragraph than many writers do in an entire chapter. Distanced and formal, he presents psychologically realistic characters whose behavior is a direct outgrowth of their upbringing, with their conflicts resulting from the differences between their expectations and the reality of their changed settings. The subordinate characters, Ralph Touchett, Pansy Osmond, her suitor Edward Rosier, American journalist Henrietta Stackpole, Isabel's former suitor Caspar Stackpole, and Lord Warburton, whose love of Isabel leads him to court Pansy, are as fascinating psychologically and as much a product of their own upbringing as is Isabel.As the setting moves from America to England, Paris, Florence, and Rome, James develops his themes, and as Isabel's life becomes more complex, her increasingly difficult and emotionally affecting choices about her life make her increasingly fascinating to the reader. James's trenchant observations about the relationship between individuals and society and about the effects of one's setting on one's behavior are enhanced by the elegance and density of his prose, making this a novel one must read slowly--and savor. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"The idea of reviewing this novel came to me when reading the comments of 14 year old Camille, whose comments I consider to be extremely honest and justified. This is a difficult novel that cannot be uplifting for anyone who uses the English language - Henry James is a craftsman who with every phrase renders thoughts we struggle to grasp in our own minds, and who thus belittles our diminished, 21st century linguistic abilities.It is ironic that a man so insightful can be so turgid at times, yet that criticism of his writing is accurate, inasmuch as he can go on and on. But, and this is a highly personal comment - I loved every single word in this book, the way they were placed, the way they sounded when read aloud, the way they made me exclaim with wonder every so often - &quot;oh!&quot;.Honestly. His characters are larger than life, because they carry the burden of a simple tale rendered into a novel. But they are also true - the sick old Touchett and his son Ralph; the &quot;too-perfect&quot; gentleman Warburton; the fiery, love-her-hate-her Henrietta; the two polished, sinister allies - Isabelle's husband and friend; and of course, Isabelle herself, &quot;too darn conceited&quot;, yet a heroine of the first order, in whom there is something for everyone.All the characters should remind you of people you know, though they all possess more of those same qualities you recognise - everyone is more accomplished than in real life. But, the narrative remains real by rendering everyone as partly flawed. It is in fact a novel that opposes completion (in death or marriage) or perfection - it suggests a search, thrives on the love of hope, the joy of what tomorrow brings. Which is why at the end, you feel unfulfilled, yet know that the novel had to stop at some point. It is an unfinished tale...the completion is in every turn of phrase, every character analysisAnd, although James, not necessarily unintentionally, belittles us, he bears along with his flaw of linguistic self-love one more uplifting thrill - a compassion for the human spirit and a love of life. Read it again when you are older, Camille, and see how much of Isabelle there is in you.mrovich1@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"One of the most over looked themes of the novel is the amount of freedom Henry James has given Isabel Archer to make her choices. She thinks it is romantic to suffer in being emotional abused by Gilbert Osmond. By allowing this to continue she has fallen into the trap of many battered wives who even when given the choice of leaving stay because it is a power battle between good and evil. By not going back she would of been giving in to Osmonds intimidation in her mind. Isabel has to be in control and can't cope with anyone who gets too near. She lacks the ability to cope wth the realities of real love and the sterile world of Osmond is a haven.Perhaps Isabel is as sterile as Osmond as she shows very little affection to her friends or gratitude when they try to rescue her from his influences and she is prepared to sit back and allow his dominance of Pansy to take place.Goodwood is kept hanging on and even Henrietta encourages him to not give up' just you wait', she echos as the loyal friend with hope for Isabel to change. Isabel may well leave Osmond but whether she has the emotional ability to live a happy life is very doubtful."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"About a year before deciding to read James' Portait of a Lady, I watched the movie version of the the novel. At the time, I thought the movie was sort of slow, but fairly decent. However, after reading the novel and realizing what a truly amazing work of art it was, I was completely disgusted by the novel. while the movie dragged over its two-hour time span, the novel was magnificent. I stayed up and read the entire thing in one night. With this novel, James proves that he is a master of the psychological novel. (Wings of the Dove and The Golden Bowl are even better!) It appalls me that some movie directors think they know better than geniuses like Henry James, and they change the scripts to sensationalize them for Hollywood.

I tried it and it worked fine with no annoying sounds but I did have to adjust the balance a few times until I got it just right!

Isabelle Archer, the heroine of this book, has beauty, wealth, above average intelligence, and a coterie of wonderful friends who actively take a interest in helping and advising her, yet she manages to self destruct all the same. The heroine is as self absorbed as her antogonist, and hurts as many people. If you wish to read a book about a truly remarkable young woman, I recommend Middlemarch by George Elliot. That book fufills it's hype as this book does not."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"Lets begin with analysing the book by its mail character.First ther is Isabel Archer. She is the snobbish type. She is not in love with anyone but herself. Actually she is in love with the image of herself. She thinks very highly of herself and had some prejudiced notions of liberty and love and moral character. The only good aspect I believe is her firm tendency of sticking to her notions. Although she doesn't know that she owes her fortune to Ralph, the way she treats him and her aunt and almost everybody is high-handed to say the least.In Ralph, we have a person who really is likeable and its sad that he has to die in the end. The only flaw in his portrayal is his falling in love with her beautiful but little proud cousin. In all other aspects he is what a man should be.Madame Merle is one very good character. But the way she has been accused of forcing Isabel's match is little unfair. Osmond did want to marry her for money and Isabel did want to marry him to justify her image of noble girl to herself.Osmond is definitely a villain and a typical one too. Almost perfect picture.Then there is Casper. He is what a young man should be minus his slight selfishnesh. One would have expected him to pursuade Isabel to not to go back to Osmond even if she didn't want to turn to her.Then comes Henrietta who is supposed to be typical US girl. Well if that is the case, one gets the impression that US girls are very prejudiced and extremely self-righteous. It just convey the widespread image of America as a HOLIER THAN THOU country. But all in all she is a lovely , caring woman though a bit interferin.About Isabel's aunt nothing much can be said. She never was more than a side-character and is a typical some good-some bad lady like the CountessRalph's friend, the English peer is somewhat of a casanova. The way he falls for the little girl of Osmond is disgusting.On the whole, it leaves much to be desired and the author does not look very sure as to what he wants to convey and what kind of virtues does he want in an ideal person."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"Some fictional works retell the stories of other fictional works but from a different point of view. The retellings may occupy roughly the same time as the story they are retelling. Examples are John Gardner's novel Grendel (Beowulf), Tom Stoppard's play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (Hamlet), and M. Z. Bradley's novel The Mists of Avalon (King Arthur). The retellings may fill in a bit of fictional history that the original story only touches on. Examples are Jean Rhys's novel Wide Sargasso Sea (Jane Eyre) and Haire-Sargeant's H: The Story of Heathcliff's Journey Back to Wuthering Heights (Wuthering Heights). As a subject of such treatments, Portrait of a Lady seems ripe for the picking. Surely Gilbert Osmond and Madame Merle have their own story to tell apart from the events in the novel, and most likely they have their own version of the events that they share with Isabel Archer."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"Since the beginning of time, man has fought for his country, his people, and his honor. While one man exhibits loyalty, another illustrates bias views for the love of his country. James Henry, a writer of early literature, portrays these arguments in his profound novel, The Portrait of a Lady, as well as many others. Within his own narration and the dialogues of several characters, he uses sarcasm and hasty generalizations to express the arguments of the superiority of America and Europe. Henry's extensive sarcasm boldy states ones bias views towards another country. He presents these remarks within the dialogues of several characters. Isabel Archer, the key role in the novel, retorts to Lord Warburton, an &quot;Englishman&quot;, that if she had known how kind he was &quot;to the poor savages&quot;, she would have brought her &quot;native costume, war paint and feathers&quot;. This sarcastic remark ridicules the Lord for his inane cliche of the American culture and his lack of insight. Yet, another quote was addressed to Lord Warburton by an old friend of Miss Archer's, Henrietta Stackpole. Lord Warburton's sister had just requested to leave, where after he refused. Henrietta explains that, &quot;in America the gentlemen obey the ladies&quot;. The cocky remark is thereafter followed by Lord Warburton's obedience to leave. Henrietta, pleased, exclaims that she had hoped he &quot;would resist&quot;. She &quot;wanted to see what Miss Molyneux&quot;, Warburton's sister, &quot;would do&quot;. Her statements ridicule Warburton's and England's chivalry towards women. Henry's use of hasty generalizations also play an important role to produce opposing views towards one another's country. Mrs. Touchett, Isabel's aunt, states that most American girls think they know a great deal; &quot;but like most American girls&quot;, they're &quot;ridiculously mistaken&quot;. This generalization is an assumption made by Mrs. Touchett based primarily on her own personal opinion. We can assume from this statement, that she does not feel the same towards English women. Lord Warburton also makes a remark about Americans; &quot;they are grossly superstitious&quot; out &quot;of all the people in the world&quot;. James Henry skillfully employs sarcasm and hasty generalizations to create logical arguments of superiority. These areguments, presented by Henry, create the image of one's respect and loyalty towards his/her native land."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"Maybe three stars would be a more fair rating....After all, who am I to &quot;rate&quot; a classic like Portrait of a Lady. We read what must have been an abridged version (Norton Critical Edition) in my freshman English class at college and I hated it. All that I could see was that Isabel Archer was this free-spirited person whose soul was being crushed by a pretentious, snobby Englishman. Unfortunately I have reacted to other Victorian fiction that way too, but I'm trying to improve.....Several months ago I made the monumental attempt of reading the novel again(unabridged) and it didn't seem quite as awful this time, but I still couldn't bring myself to read the whole thing. Two thirds through the book I began falling asleep every time I'd pick it up.

Really, how juvenile!This is a melancholy tale of a strong young woman whose youthful liberty spoils in the improper refrigeration of a loveless marriage, leaving her bitter and stunted. As far as that goes, it is perfectly passable high-brow soap opera.What lends this book greater import is its reification of the cultural calumny fomented at the interface between the U.S. and Europe. Mr. James gives a delectable account of the calamities that befall these interminglers. He's never heavy-handed about it, but at every turn our fiercely independent heroine runs afoul of the encrusted mores of the more traditional cultures in which she seeks her fortune.While today's players on both sides of this well-trodden frontier are very different than they were in the 19th century, the conflicts are eerily corrolary. Each time G.W. Bush bumbles and stumbles into the ire of his continental counterparts, I can't help but think of Isabel Archer, falling into the deeply grooved patterns of the Europe of her day, despite her best efforts to sidestep them."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"This book made me want to scream, or cry.

Although James shows she's not perfect -- she's naive and somewhat conceited -- it's still pretty easy to fall in love with her. You look forward to seeing what great things her life will bring.And then it all falls apart. After 200 pages of building her up, James marries her to a scoundrel and spends the next 300 pages suffocating her, one liberty at a time. Others have described this book as &quot;uplifting&quot; and spoken of Isabel's strength and courage; I honestly can't see what they could mean.

For despite his strong and resolute character, I am convinced that the man did have emotions.Nevertheless, I think the story is a timeless classic and, the way things go between sexes in America, with romance having degenerated into needless games of power, its message is even more applicable in our era.It is a book for every man and woman in this country to read and heed its message which is relevant even in the late 20th century when the United States has replaced Great Britain as the leading power and the meaning of the expression 'to make love' could have Henry James shuddering in his grave."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"A haunting, complex story of love and hope, manipulation and meddling.

Why? Could anyone relate to Isabel Archer's smug richbitch--I haven't a clue and couldn't care less--attitude regarding the grim realities of the world when the book was first published? Can anyone relate to it now? So, who ever was its adoring audience? Who voluntarily paid cash for this stifling exercise in one inane woman's whining weltschmerz? Factory workers? Charwomen? Scullery maids? Miners? Union organizers? Anyone gainfully employed? Or was it then, as it is now, English Lit. professors buzzing effetely around the sheltered groves of academe who foisted the entire corpus of the ponderous Mr. James' work on the world?In closing, I'll qualify this rant by mentioning that I liked both Washington Square and The Turn of the Screw.

The characters, plot, and dialogue of the book reads much like a script for The Young and the Restless. Except, it must be said, most soap operas present more interesting characters, plots, and dialogue than what's found in this book.This book centers around a character named Isabel Archer. She is a young American woman who moves to England and meets her rich uncle, who is dying. He is immediately enchanted with her and changes his will so that she will inherit a huge fortune when he dies. And he does die shortly after her arrival, so Isabel becomes rich.Meanwhile, a young man from America, who is in love with Isabel, travels to England to propose marriage, but she rejects him. Also, Isabel meets an aristocratic Lord who immediately falls in love with her and proposes marriage, but she rejects him too.Isabel then meets an older woman, who the author attempts to present as slightly mysterious and sinister. But to readers, this character is just weird and puzzling. This weird older woman eventually acts as a matchmaker for Isabel by introducing her to a widower. Unfortunately the man is a fortune hunter, but Isabel falls in love with him anyway and they get married. Then the story fast forwards several years. The marriage turns out to be unhappy and Isabel becomes disillusioned with life. The end.The whole plot is just silly and unbelievable. The character of Isabel is presented as a limp, cold nitwit, yet the plot has men falling in love with her left and right. And the women characters are all enchanted with her. The whole thing is just amateurish and annoying and incompetent story telling. Most of the text consists of tedious dialogue between characters about their petty feelings of anxiety about love and hate toward each other. The narrator also makes long petty observations about the character's facial expressions and mannerisms and the supposed meaning and significance in them.How an incompetent writer like Henry James ever gained prominence is a mystery. The man was clearly an untalented bore, yet his books are widely available and school children are forced to read his work. Perhaps the fact that school children are forced to read Henry James books is one reason so many people dislike reading, and consequently, so many people are poorly educated. If someone associates the experience of reading a tedious Henry James novel with reading in general, it is indeed understandable they would develop an aversion to reading. His books are awful, and this one is a prime example."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"I read this novel about nine years ago, and I still find myself dealing with and sorting out various images and snatches of conversation from this razor-sharp work (literary post-traumatic stress disorder? the novel had THAT much of an impact on me!)The best Henry James novel I've thus far read, and one of the best three novels I've read in my life. It changed the way I read forever. Forget the movie - this is the real thing."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"\\"The Portrait of a Lady\\" was published in three volumes in 1881. The masterpiece of the first phase of James' career, the novel is a study of Isabel Archer, a young American woman of great promise who travels to Europe and becomes a victim of her own provincialism. James began the novel without a plot or subject, only the slim but provocative notion of a young woman taking control of her fate. The result is a richly imagined study of an American heiress who turns away her suitors in an effort to first establish and then protect her independence.Isabel Archer is a young woman who reads German idealist philosophy in the locked office at Albany that occludes a view of the street; an overly theoretic, though wonderfully fresh and earnest self-realizer. Unlike Daisy Miller, Isabel Archer is booked to grow up, and on that development James stakes his epic attempt to write a novel that will be a great work of art. Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" is the basis for James' attempt. It should suffice to say that this is a novel of \\"felix culpa\\", the fortunate fall, much like the Genesis story and even more like Milton's rewriting of it. But just as in Milton's poem, everything is pointed towards a definition of freedom. The novel certainly concerns the unexpectedly far-reaching consequences of a character's inadequacies of perception, and in that it is wholly reminiscent of \\"Daisy\\". But here alone we have a full development of necessity and freedom, circumstance and free will, in which each may take on the appearance of the other. The novel's Edenic Gardencourt is a declining, drowsy Eden. Isabel renews the vitality of this fatigued Eden. But for Isabel herself, once she struggles to an understanding of Gardencourt's high values, she will have to transform the lost place into an aspect of her spirit and have it inform her actions.Isabel is in a league with the tradition of heroines in the British realistic novel, all of them remarkable but self-deluded, in need of an encounter with the real. Isabel's final choice to return to her old life is her triumph. Intelligent readers should understand the logic of a fortunate fall. She no longer sees giving herself completely as \\"the deepest thing\\", but understands the sense that life would be her business for a long time to come. This new formulation is a huge advance, as it is no longer self-referential, but acknowledging a world in which the self participates. Her decision has nothing to do with resignation nor with duty. The self is understood, with Hawthorne and against Emerson, as a result of accumulated experience. Isabel must return to Osmond, as Hawthorne's Hester finally must return to the Boston that victimized her, to affirm her identity amongst her awful relatives. This is where her life has taken place, and anywhere else would mark not a fresh start but a dissolution. And with her return come a cluster of Miltonic allusions, turned on themselves: \\"The world lay before her - she could do whatever she chose\\". Isabel discovers \\"a very straight path\\", home to her struggle, her business, her life. Earlier, she had envied a watery death, and mistaken the devil for an instrument for expanding freedom. But now she sees the danger of false Edens. Instead, Isabel chooses to make her world. The novel embodies the national myth: an ideal of freedom and equality hedged with historical blindness and pride."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"Isabel Archer is a pretty, kind, intuitive, and quite intelligent young American lady, who through circumstance and fate is brought to London, then to Rome, and to a stifling marriage that proves to be her undoing. Before she meets the deviant Gilbert Osmond, she is followed by suitors, attended to by her sweet-natured and protective cousin Ralph Touchett (a literary character who everyone would want in their real lives) and assertive confidante Henrietta Stackpole. Once the surreptitious Madame Merle and Osmond get in the picture, however, niceties and childish feelings of peace and enlightenment are destroyed, and Henry James' talents come to the fore as he tells the absorbing story of social propriety ruining the passionate sense of self that our protagonist was heretofore driven by. Isabel's own passion deteriorates the further she gets within the decaying cities of Europe; the metaphor is skillfully told. This is a big messy entertaining phantasmagoria of a novel, daunting in its length as well as the depths of Archer's gradually crushing psyche that James guides you through with his acute artistry. Each character is razor sharp in their descriptions and motivations, the arc of the story is told gradually yet ever detail and rambling paragraph seems just right. This is classic, thought-provoking work, a bulwark of world literature, and must be read."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"James is indeed the master of psychological characterization. I admit that such a statement is nearly a cliche. Yet, after almost fifteen years, I have come back to read this novel for a second time, and I have found the cliche a truism. Several adjectives could describe James's portrayal of such characters as Isabel Archer, Gilbert Osmond, or Madame Merle: light, fine, exquisite, ambiguous, tantalizingly discreet and uncertain, Chaucerian. A more heavy-handed analysis of character motivations, as in Faulkner or Dostoyevsky (admitted masters of such characterization), would only spoil the effect. This novel serves as the classic of James's early period and a worthy predecessor for the pondering of the psychologically more obscure characterizations of the late masterpieces-- &quot;The Ambassadors,&quot; &quot;The Wings of the Dove,&quot; and &quot;The Golden Bowl.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"This novel is like a fine, gorgeous old brocaded tapestry: so many themes, levels of meaning, complex characters w/ complex relationships to one another are woven through it by James that it will be a different novel each time you read it. It begins very slowly -- I gave up on it about Ch. 2 for years -- but if you keep reading it will be like coming out of a dark path into a meadow colored with the most lush &amp; exotic blooms. The central character is both maddening and pitiful, the minor characters are all worthy of Dickens in their complexity, and it boasts one of the most Iagoish &quot;villains&quot; you will find in literature, a really evil fellow! It is my favorite novel, for its lyrical tragedy &amp; sad romanticism, and one of the best by any definition I have ever read!!"},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"The great power of Henry James's work is that he is intensely compassionate and unwaveringly tough-minded; he creates complex and dimensional characters and allows them to make the worst choices possible. Best of all, he doesn't lapse into melodrama or let his characters off the hook for their lapses in character or judgement. That's the beauty of his work; instead of a cheap redemptive payoff, he shows the range of human experience, woven into a tantalizing and totally involving narrative. Isabel Archer is charming, irritating, self involved, charismatic, and tragically shortsighted. Her fate is all the more tragic because James allows us to travel the entire, rapturous distance with her, signalling the bloom of every camellia, kiss, or withering blow to the spirit."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"This is the first Henry James book I read and it isn't the type of book to be read in a day. Instead, this book is one you bring on vacation, for example, to savor and sink your teeth into as you lounge at the pool and spend your time between hitting the pages and either swimming laps or walking on the beach. Some books are real page-turners that you can't put down. To me, this novel didn't have that type of suspense yet it is nevertheless engrossing enough to keep you coming back for more; that is, after you have had time to properly absorb it in bits and pieces so you can appreciate the themes, ideas, and expressions it so flawlessly expresses.James' prose flows as smooth as silk as one page after the next brings you deeper into the lives of his characters, who are all by the way very convincing as real-life people. The fun thing about this book is that you can read (sort of) into what you think is going to happen to the characters. James' narrative style keeps you guessing until you know for sure, but his reasoning for this to have you analyze the heroine, Isabel Archer (the \\"lady\\" in the title), and witness, from a bird's eye-view, how her human follies, impertinence and pride get in the way of her happiness, freedom, and fulfillment of life. You want to call out a warning to her and say, \\"oh no, don't do it!\\" I think we can all relate to the characters in the book in some form: we can either see our own selves in them by recalling our own forays of making the same mistakes, or we see in them people who have come into our lives and made huge differences either positive or negative. While reading the book you'll probably cringe thinking about how one-too-many outspoken Henrietta Stackpoles have invaded your life.One aspect of fun in the book turned out to be James' witty opinions (often jabs) expressed by his characters at things British and also things American too. James, having lived in both countries so long, gained ample experience and came to know the culture, customs, and peculiarities of both countries well enough to where he was qualified to make the many tongue-in-cheek remarks, which I happen to find quite amusing.While I mentioned the story is not a fast paced adventure, it is a true literary beauty that unfolds one page at a time to show various aspects of our humanity: the caring, the wicked, the selfish, the kind-hearted, the deceitful, the foolish, the persistent, the pushy, the capricious, and the vain. These are all packed into this powerful novel that I highly recommend. Although I reserve five stars for novels that to me are such riveting tales that I couldn't put them down, I still enjoyed this book tremendously and gave it a well-earned four stars. I will definitely make it a point to read many other novels by Henry James."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"Henry James is one of my favorite authors and &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; is one of my favorite books. James is the only author who can begin a sentence and still have my complete attention when he finishes it two or even three pages later.&quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; is filled with the long, rambling sentences for which James is so famous, but, as in his other books, these sentences remain interesting from the first word to the last. This is, however, definitely 19th century prose and the book is filled with sentences that begin with, &quot;Dear Reader,&quot; or &quot;Our heroine.&quot; While this might be very tiresome to some readers, in the hands of a writer as skillful as James, it has never bothered me one bit.James loved to write about the wealthy people of the world, more specifically, those who needn't bother working for a living. He loved studying the way in which an excess of free time affected the choices they made. The characters created in &quot;The Portrait of a Lady,&quot; are excellent examples of people who, perhaps, have too much time on their hands. Isobel Archer, in particular, makes some very questionable choices, then does nothing to correct them. Although likeable, she seems to be a character possessed of an ennui that's virtually unshakeable. Isobel not only refuses to to take action to correct her mistakes, she refuses to take responsibility for them at all. It seems as though the more time (and money) James' characters have, the less they make good use of either one.If you're a reader who's not discouraged by 19th century literature and all its intricacies and convolutions, I think you'll find both Henry James and &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; fascinating.

In fact, there is a lot of \\"action\\" - yet confined to the emotional landscape of characters.James' literary style is very dense and requires a measured pace of reading. If this becomes frustrating (as it did to me occasionally), it's best to read it in spurts. The richness of the novel demands leisurely consumption, like an elaborate French meal, to be appreciated piece by piece.Here is an example of typical sentence construction:[QUOTE] Like his appreciation of her dear little stepdaughter it was based partly on his eye for decorative character, his instinct for authenticity; but also on a sense for uncatalogued values, for that secret of a \\"luster\\" beyond any recorded losing or rediscovering, which his devotion to brittle wares had still not disqualified him to recognise. Mrs. Osmond, at present, might well have gratified such tastes. The years had touched her only to enrich her; the flower of her youth had not faded, it only hung more quietly on its stem. [END QUOTE]Despite its density The Portrait of a Lady is more accessible than James' later novels - includingThe Ambassadors (Oxford World's Classics)- and is a good place to start with this classic author.The main delight of the novel is in the characters - they are all exquisitely crafted and richly draped. They each have their own set of vocabulary, nuances, visual imagery and body language - from the sharp tongued Henrietta Stackpole to the obedient and docile Pansy Osmond. The novel also has great moments of humour, thanks to James' alter ego Ralph Touchett.My only critique is the heavy handed analysis at times, which slows down the pace of the novel, as well as James peculiar aversion to paragraphing - the author will often cluster entire timelines, conversations and observations into a single paragraph which spans several pages without interlude.Ultimately, however the novel is a masterpiece of human characterization that touches on themes of duty versus independence, social custom versus freedom. Despite the lack of plot - or \\"architecture\\" as the author calls it - James is an extraordinary storyteller and the ending packs quite a punch.This novel is best enjoyed without prior knowledge of the plot - so skip the summary on the back and dive right in!8/10A NOTE ON EDITIONS: I really enjoyed the Wordsworth Classics edition. The introduction is not as long and heavily academic as the Penguin edition, and contributes to the enjoyment of the novel (read it AFTER the novel though). Also, the explanatory notes on the back are short and helpful, and don't interfere too much with the reading process (other editions publish long winded footnotes which are very taxing)."},{"Title":"The Portrait of a Lady (Bloom's Notes)","review":"I read this, my first H. James novel, on the recommendation of a friend while I was commencing a trip to Rome. It was an excellent choice. I must say I was not entirely on board in the early stages of the book, set in England. Marraige proposals were happening too fast for my taste. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised by the witty repartee, which reminded me much of Wilde. The wit diminishes and the intensity increases on the continent, especially in its Roman locale, and it was here that I found myself much more interested. The book has a soul. Its characters are richly painted and became interesting--I enjoyed them all. The novel also has a beautifully symmetric construction. In its early stages I thought James was trying too hard to perfect his European literary colleagues; by the end, the novel stood on its own. So, despite some minor growing pains, I can recommend and will likely read another by HJ. Peter Washington's introduction in the Everyman edition (James' New York version) is an added benefit."},{"Title":"Beyond Obsession A Chilling Account of Love, Abuse & Murder","review":"In 1987 a Glastonbury, CN, a woman was found murdered. The victim was Joyce Aparo, a woman who is described in the book by acquaintances and psychiatrists as a bi-polar, histrionic, narcissistic, borderline personality. She is also described as having been a demanding and physically and emotionally abusive parent and a \\"soul-killer\\". The soul she killed was that of her daughter, Karin Aparo.The information presented by Richard Hammer in his true crime work, BEYOND OBSESSION, paints Joyce as unbelievably cruel. As an example, she had dreams of Karin's becoming a concert violinist, a dream Karin bought into as doing so provided her with a common bond with her mother.Karin \\"was slated to play a solo at ...a recital, but (her teacher) wasn't satisfied that she was quite ready to perform this difficult piece and gave it to another child. After the performance, in the midst of the crowd of parents and friends, Joyce grabbed hold of Karin and shouted, \`Listen, everybody. Karin can play that solo as well as anybody. Listen while she plays the piece.' She forced Karin to play, to Karin's mortification and the embarrassment of everyone else. When Karin finished, Joyce looked around with obvious satisfaction and pride and proclaimed, \`There, didn't she do it better than the other one?' It didn't end there. Joyce advanced on the other child, snarled at him, \`See Karin could have played it better than you.' Then she began to curse at him and his parents.\\"Karin was 8 years old.When Karin was 15 she formed a relationship with a neighbor boy of 18, Dennis Coleman. Coleman, a weak, needy, clinging young man soon became obsessed with Karin, who had learned the art of manipulation in order to survive here mother's lunacy. Karen actually seemed to love Dennis for a while, but - in the way of most teenage romances - began to be interested in other men, particularly a young Russian violist name Alex Markov, with whom she rapidly developed a sexual relationship. Her devotion to Dennis waned correspondingly, of which Dennis was aware. But the fact that she was cheating on Dennis and lying about her affection toward him did not prevent her from requesting that he buy her jewelry, expensive clothes, and dinners. And the needy Dennis, convinced that it was the only way he could keep Karin, did whatever she asked him to.The couple had been discussing killing Joyce for over a year, and finally, in the ultimate act of devotion, Dennis did so at Karin's increasing insistence.In short, Karin played Dennis like a swinette.Dennis confessed to the murder in short order, but the legal question was whether or not Karin had any legal responsibility in her mother's death.Hammer is an outstanding, intelligent, and professional writer. The Coleman-Aparo story is written reportorially, with no filler, no stupid attempts at \\"creative writing\\", no melodrama. His handling of Karin's trial is outstanding - perfectly summarized without the all too often inclusion of boring transcripts.His research is extensive and provides exceptional background on Karin, Joyce, and Dennis so that the reader gets a real understanding of their emotional and psychological makeup and consequently of their behavior.Hammer is a great writer, and his book meets an one of my main criteria: that while reading, the reader is aware of how well the book is written and at the same time be unaware of the personality of the author.BEYOND OBSESSION is an outstanding true crime, and I can't imagine a fan of the genre not loving it."},{"Title":"Entre DOS Lunas (Walk Two Moons) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book about the mixed up life stories about Samantha's best freind Phebee, while she is also trying to get her life staight.

It is an exercise in self-promotion for a mediocre musician who is using the subject of birdsong to effuse about the \\"wonders of nature\\" (and himself). There are much better books on this subject -- get \\"The Singing Life of Birds\\" by Donald Kroodsma instead."},{"Title":"Why Birds Sing: A Journey Into the Mystery of Bird Song","review":"This book is a hoot, a tweet, and a cheerup!David Rothenberg has interwoven a personl journey of playing music with birds with a comprehensive history of bird song studies - from their poetic beginnings to their present scientific analysis. Because of his diverse talents, he is the perfect guide through these intellectual and musical forays.Why do birds sing? There are many answers, but none are as satisfying as the relentless questioning in this book. I enjoyed it immensely and found it impossible to put down. I am sure you will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Why Birds Sing: A Journey Into the Mystery of Bird Song","review":"Rothenberg writes with an easy intimacy, but if one takes him at his word, the intimacy that means most to him comes not by means of words but of music, and less by means of music as such than by an improvisatory exchange between, usually, himself on his clarinet, and someone else on whatever instrument the other person is using.Given this driving urge, it seems inevitable that Rothenberg should want to cross the barrier between those most musical of creatures, the birds, and those with the most productive curiosity, the humans. His own curiosity leads him first to the birds and then to the human experts in birdsong. He gives vivid descriptions of these researchers' extraordinary devotion to their work. I especially enjoyed his description of the ability of the composer Olivier Messiaen to hear, transcribe, and whistle the complex songs of a bird he had never heard before.Although, like a few of the researchers - Donald Kroodsma, for example - Rothenberg believes in the innate pleasure birds take in their song, he checks his intuitive sense of their muisicality by carefully summarizing what is scientifically known about their abilities and ways of life. Yet even though he takes to heart the criticism that the romantics \\"listened to birds and heard only themselves,\\" he recalls that science, too, is fallible, and he plays on the ornithologists' conclusion that not only is each species of birds unique, but so is every individual bird.\\"Why Birds Sing\\" ends in the climactic scene in which Rothenberg and a friend go to Australia to hear, see the dance of, and try to enter into a musical dialogue with the lyrebird named George, the only member, he says, of his elusive, musically gifted species who can stomach the sight and sound of human beings. The bird lights to sing just a few meters from Rothenberg's tape recorder. He hears that the lyrebird's song is composed but alien, in a human sens crazy, music. After he hears a full cycle of the lyrebird's music, he joins in, dancing, not to copy the bird's song, but to play music, in and around the song, that is worthy of the bird's acceptance. The bird seems to respond to the clarinet, dances, and disappears. Rothenberg develops this last, climactic chapter, which he calls \\"Becoming a Bird,\\" with thoughtful eloquence. He feels he has given his gift and made his human offering to an animal of another singing species. But his gift is also to all of us who read him."},{"Title":"Why Birds Sing: A Journey Into the Mystery of Bird Song","review":"In this slightly meandering but sincere book, musician and philosopher Rothenberg shows us that there are qualities to birdsong that transcend what science can tell us. Part of that transcendence is their emotional involvement with their songs, and Rothenberg can be counted among earlier authorities--including Len Howard, Charles Hartshorne, and Alexander Skutch--who believe that birds enjoy singing. His enthusiasm is most apparent when the discussion turns to music, and as an amateur musician I also enjoyed perusing the musical scores and sonograms of various feathered songsters.Rothenberg hits the mark with his observation that \\"bird songs are a genuine challenge to the conceit that humanity is needed to find beauty in the natural world.\\" Another conceit is the disturbing laboratory experiments he describes, in which singing birds have their brains pierced by wire electrodes and are later killed for dissection.Readers get a bonus CD of the author's music with birdsong and other nature sounds."},{"Title":"Why Birds Sing: A Journey Into the Mystery of Bird Song","review":"Great book, references scientific research as well as aesthetic qualities of many song birds and non-song birds bringing the two realms of reasoning to somewhat of a compromise. I would definetly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know why birds sing."},{"Title":"Why Birds Sing: A Journey Into the Mystery of Bird Song","review":"David Rothenberg's lovely book, WHY BIRDS SING: A Journey ThroughThe Mystery of Bird Song, is an impressive achievement.

Mr. Rothenberg's study completely validates my belief."},{"Title":"Why Birds Sing: A Journey Into the Mystery of Bird Song","review":"This book and CD are simply wonderful.

Mulling over the whole business, I just thought an alternate title might be: \\"what should humans sing?\\" And next most useful advice, to paraphrase you: \\"Take a tip from the Mockingbird.\\" There's enough chock full in both those snippets to keep me creatively scratching my head."},{"Title":"Why Birds Sing: A Journey Into the Mystery of Bird Song","review":"With such an inspiring subject this should have been great book, but it's not. Reading this book was like watching a lava lamp - moving (turning pages) but going nowhere. I only read 40 pages before I couldn't bring myself to pick it up again. Good writing grabs you and compels you to continue - this doesn't. Singing birds are inspiring - this book isn't. The CD that came with it closed the lid on the coffin for me. The birds aren't allowed to star here but the author himself. He fails to communicate with the birds who provide great motifs for improvisation - only recall one time on the CD where the author generated a musical idea based on the bird songs. The book and CD are pretentious."},{"Title":"Why Birds Sing: A Journey Into the Mystery of Bird Song","review":"Rothenberg is a New Age writer and musician that enjoys playing music to birds and jamming their singing with the sound from different wind instruments. Surey lots of fun. However, it is from this perspective that he attemps to understand why birds sing. To be true, he does review some scientific papers and provides a not too bad coverage of the findings of the scientific literature. But Rothenberg enjoys exposing the shortcomings of this research (rather pretentiously by the way) and coming up with unscientific ideas of his own based on his feelings about why birds should spend so much time singing. He seriously believes that his empathic method of blowing desceding fifths and chromatic scales with his clarinet to singing birds can take him a long way into understanding the misteries of bird song. Good luck to him."},{"Title":"Portrait Sculpture Simplified","review":"Victoria Stautzenberger- bas-relief portrait sculptorIn just under two hundred pages this book has replaced a small library on portrait sculpture instruction.

I was out of town, without any access to books when someone gave me a copy of \\"Cast a Bright Shadow\\" to read. My favourite fantasy writers are Feist, Brooks and Hobb, so I found Lee's style of writing somewhat obscure, yet refreshing at the same time.Set in a winter world, Lionwolf, the son of mortal Saphay and the god Zezeth, unites a variety of races to destroy his mother's city of Ru Karismi. Along the way Lionwolf is accompanied by his \`uncle' Guri-a living ghost who survived his own death when Saphay's abduction by the Olchibe goes awry. The plan, organised by Vuldir, Saphay's father, is intended to cement an alliance with the Jafn, without payment ever being made-such if the disdain they have for the Jafn that they would conspire with another enemy.Lee's white world is colourful in its design. A myriad of races, cultures and belief systems accentuate an almost limitless amount of fantasy and magic. There are no constraints; Lee writes it as if it's all possible. Intertwining stories lead to a somewhat weakened ending, yet it is a trilogy, and I welcome the break from tradition, and look forward to reading the following volumes."},{"Title":"Cast a Bright Shadow (Lionwolf 1)","review":"So this was strange. I really liked it at first. The ice barbarians thing was great. I hadn't seen that done much and only Tanith Lee would take it to the next step and talk about Ice Jungles. I'm still trying to figure out how that would work because she never really described them. Guri was my favorite character but most of the other characters I didn't care about at all.Still it kept me interested enough to read for 500 pages. So it's definitely not the Flat Earth series (one of my all time favorites) but still pretty good. Some of the stuff got a little surreal and I still don't understand it. But I am curious about the 2nd book (since I already own it). So I'll probably read some reviews on it before I make a final decision to read it or not.One final comment. Every once in a while she would slip into this kind of 2nd person writing and it was really jarring.(made up example)\\"We walked along the parapet.

Beautiful as well as intelligent and strong, she's been the one that has kept the family of 3 boys and one girl (the stunning and talented Louise Dorsey) together, and \\"stood by her man\\" through thick and thin. Popea writes a portion of Chapter Fifteen with gritty honesty, and explains how, and why, she withstood the many women, the paternity suits, and all the paparazzi that hounded them through those many years of notoriety.The women, as Engelbert explains, were an \\"occupational hazard\\", certainly not helped by his years of lonely nights and hard drinking on the road, and the many females who would make themselves exceedingly available.Engelbert comes off as an extremely complex individual, but very likeable. A perfectionist in his work, living life to the fullest, and discovering in his later years that he has the gift of healing; this assertion I believe, as I find that the sound of his voice can have curative effects.There are portions that are laugh-out-loud funny (like the UFO story in Chapter Seventeen), and adding to the charm of his writing style is some of the \\"Brit-speak\\" slang, with expressions like the now rarely heard \\"grotty\\" (a favorite word of mine coined by George Harrison in the '60s).The book has two sections of photographs, from the age of 17 on. Favorites of mine are the one with Muhammad Ali, and a lovely family shot taken by the pool in one of their USA homes, affectionately named \\"The Pink Palace\\".The final 12 pages are devoted to a UK discography, and include chart positions.This is fast reading, and riveting, so walk the dog, feed the cat, turn off the telephone, and make yourself a big cuppa, because once you open this book, its going to be very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Engelbert- What's In a Name: The Autobiography","review":"after being an engelbert humperdinck fan for close to 40 years/i thought nothing could top everything the greatest singer in the world could do.i was wrong.this authorized autobiography of humperdinck is a must read for humperdinck fans everywhere.and for the man who has the largest fan club in the world.they are everywhere.too interesting and indebt to get into any certain chapters.all i will say.is that once you pick it up you wont be saying release me anytime soon.jack major.providence journal buelltin."},{"Title":"Engelbert- What's In a Name: The Autobiography","review":"I received my book, Engelbert: \\"What's In a Name?\\" the autobiographyWOW !

Hard to argue with that."},{"Title":"The subjection of women (Political science study series)","review":"The Subjection of Women is an often overlooked classic by one of history's greatest minds. Published at the end of Mill's life, The Subjection brings together all of Mill's most important views on liberty, utility, human nature, and society. It paints a far more accessable ethic than more famous works, such as On Liberty. Mill uses his philosophical views to reach conclusions that were long ahead of his time, and in many ways continue to outpace our understanding of gender and society. This work is arguably the best feminist writing ever, and the best commentary on morality and social evolution.Today, Mill's work continues to provide us with a framework for understanding social movements such as the gay rights and animal rights movements. Mill shows us how just institutions are vital to the happiness of both society and the individual, as these institutions are central to the formation of our characters. He shows us how both the oppressor and the oppressed are harmed by unjust institutional arrangements, such as gender inequalities in the family. In sum, Mill's The Subjection of Women is perhaps the finest piece of social and political philosophy produced in the modern era, and should be read by all interested in social justice, feminism, or ethics."},{"Title":"The subjection of women (Political science study series)","review":"A founding document of modern feminism by the granddaddy of libertarian thought.

I believe that the subjection of women is one of the best arguments for equality of genders that has ever been written. beyond the usual cited feminist arguments that pervade pop culture, this book using reason argues that not only are women disadvantage by society unequal treatment, but MEN are too. Society is deprived of what they might have achieved, and we are all the lesser for it. Although written a hundred years ago, the ideas still have not been taken to heart by society. If more people read this book, the culture would be better off."},{"Title":"The subjection of women (Political science study series)","review":"The Subjection of Women deals exclusively with a subject John Stuart Mill had often touched on previously - female oppression. This classic essay is the culmination of an issue Mill had been passionately involved in since youth, when he was arrested for distributing literature about contraception. It is the most important, famous, and influential feminist text between Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman and Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique, coming about halfway between them. That it was written by a man, one born to a substantial amount of privilege and who was around very few women until adulthood at that, is of course all the more incredible. Going well beyond his prior suffrage call, it pushes for nothing less than full equality, not even stopping at legal equality but valiantly trying to change thought and custom. Mill's suffrage arguments are numerous and near-irrefutable. He has the noble distinction of being the first MP to propose female suffrage - in the 1860s! He would surely be glad to know the substantial progress since made, however disappointed - if not surprised - he may have been to know it would take sixty years to be realized.However, the vast majority of the essay deals with the rest of female oppression, a far more formidable barrier - one that, indeed, has sadly still not been fully crossed. The arguments are again very strong. Following a short historical overview of female oppression and a blunt survey of its then current forms, Mill proceeds to demolish its basis. In perhaps the most brilliant and admirable application of utilitarianism ever, he convincingly shows that female oppression is not only a great evil to women but also to men and all of society. He uses many examples and arguments to show that ending it is both a moral necessity and a prescription for many social ills. The many later advances have proven much of what he said, even if he was perhaps too optimistic in some respects. It is a sad comment on human progress that several of the ideals he passionately and articulately argued for, such as equality of intellect in marriage, are still uncommon and even scorned.Though Subjection is admitted even by Mill's many detractors to be his argumentative tour de force, it has a few limitations. First, one of his main arguments is that Victorian - nay, all historical - assumptions about inherent differences between men and women, as well as the latter's inferiority, are premature because women had never existed in a state of social equality with men. This is certainly true as far as it goes - indeed, irrefutable at the time. Though he argues forcefully for equality in any situation, he does not even address the substantial question of what, if anything, should or must be done if inherent differences are found. This defect was then nothing more than abstract and, in fact, very subservient to the cause of advancing female rights. However, the near-equality women now have in developed countries means we must look at the issue somewhat differently. The question of inherent differences, much less relative superiority, is still far from answered - may indeed be even less clear. Even so, many of the issues Mill left unaddressed because moot are now very real, even pressing. They may leave his central arguments untouched - one would in fact be very hard-pressed to find a better argument for female equality anywhere -, but the essay is certainly more incomplete now, though still substantially valuable. Finally, though Mill's liberalism on the question is almost unbelievable for a man of his time and place, some of his statements and suggestions, not least his claim that the arrangement of man as breadwinner/woman as domestic engineer - to use the (I believe) currently politically correct term - probably is best after all, will rankle current feminists. To be fair, he does not say it prescriptively - indeed refrains from ruling anything out for women in any respect -, but Victorianism's ugly specter sneaking in even here is bound to disturb some. This of course hardly negates the rest, and The Subjection is still - and surely always will be - essential for anyone even remotely interested in women's struggle."},{"Title":"The subjection of women (Political science study series)","review":"Interesting little book. I understand maybe that his wife helped him write it, or they collaborated. It ranges through history, politics and economics and although I enjoyed the book, I cannot help but feel his view of history is weak and his economics dreadful.These weaknesses aside, he makes a compelling case for the equality of women and his discussion of contemporary (to him) life issues of women is fascinating.He ends the book with a section on the difficulty of relationships between men and women when the women are not liberated. I think it is the high point of the book."},{"Title":"The subjection of women (Political science study series)","review":"Mill argues his position in a compelling and heartfelt manner. He was a true progressive. Much of his argument is still applicable today."},{"Title":"The subjection of women (Political science study series)","review":"I have to say that I found The Subjection of Women to be surprisingly accessible and very interesting. As the book was written in 1869, and as I tend to have difficulty reading classics, I imagined that this would be a trying read for me. While it wasnft the most fun book Ifve ever read, it was a much more enjoyable experience than I was expecting! I was pleasantly surprised by how progressive Millfs opinions were on the subject of womenfs rights and equality. Of particular interest to me was the fact that he mentioned the social construction of gender multiple times throughout the book. While he didnft use the phrase gsocial construction of genderh (of course) he blatantly stated that men gareh a certain way and women gareh another way because society tells men and women how to behave and think, and people tend to act accordingly. While anyone who has taken Womenfs Studies 101 or even read a basic feminist text will be able to explain this nowadays, I didnft expect to read about someone having a solid understanding of that concept in the mid-1800s. Overall, this was a pleasant reading experience and I would definitely recommend The Subjection of Women as an important feminist classic."},{"Title":"The subjection of women (Political science study series)","review":"The cruel past of mankind is the framework for all existing inequalities past and present, proclaims John Stuart Mill in his passionate defense of the equality between men and women.Natural conditionThe only natural condition of the human race was the law of the strongest. A physical fact (strength) became a legal right. Inequality of rights was the publicly and openly avowed rule of life.Mankind was divided in two classes: a small one of masters and a numerous one of slaves.Human society was based on the principle of a fixed place (where one was born) and a fixed social position. The least possible was left to the choice of the individual. All those who resisted the authorities had all laws and all notions of social obligation against them.FamilyAfter the abolition of slavery, no official slaves remained, except the mistress in every house. The family still reflects the initial \`natural' state of inequality. It is a school for despotism with unrestrained power at home for the head of the family in his role of absolute sovereign.New lawsThe legal subordination of one sex to the other must be replaced by a principle of perfect equality. The most universal and pervading of all human relations (marriage) should be regulated by justice. The laws (and institutions) should be adapted to \`bad' men, not to \`good' ones.Merit, not birth, is the rightful claim to power and authority.The free use of women's faculties would double the mass of mental faculties available for the service of mankind.In this forceful diatribe, which is still highly topical in major parts of our \`modern' world, John Stuart Mill extended the goal of his brilliant essay \\"On Liberty' to the concrete position of one half of the world's population.It is a must read for all those interested in mankind and its history."},{"Title":"The subjection of women (Political science study series)","review":"A powerful articulation of why we should all want equality for all people. Still highly relevant. Some of it may seem somewhat dated but only because we live in western society. I am mainly referring to his arguments that women should be allowed to own their own property and have legal equality and such. This is still a relevant point for women in many countries though. He refutes many objections to the equal treatment of women many of which I still hear or read today. Like that women aren't suited to many occupations either because of their physical or mental natures. I won't restate those arguments here but they are beautifully, passionately laid out and it is well worth the read. I have only read On Liberty and it is good but this was deeply moving and it is hard to imagine that he has written anything better than this."},{"Title":"The subjection of women (Political science study series)","review":"I read the Subjection of Women for my 17th Century Philosophy class. I found it interesting, but hard to read. Mill tends to be repetative and wordy. He is very much the early feminist until you get to page 86 or 87 when he tells you that for all women can do, they should stay home and care for the family anyway. I would suggest that others read this book, but give yourself time, because about 20 pages a night was all that I could muster. At 100 pages it's not too long, but could have been said with more clarity and organization."},{"Title":"The subjection of women (Political science study series)","review":"Obviously, my problem is not with the text in this particular edition of J.S.

This is basically just a photocopy of some earlier edition of the book, put between the cheapest digital photocopies they could find. The only good thing about this edition is the huge margains around the text (for taking good notes), but those are obviously only there because it was easiest to photocopy the book on this paper.

He himself admits that this is quite a task, but luckily he sticks to his guns and we do get a good description.The book starts by describing the two revolutions that he feels changed our history the most, the agricultural revolution of around 10,000 years ago, and the more recent industrial revolution. He explains how these affected our development, and relates this to mankind's increasing need for sources of power. This is where I feel the book really shines. Although he tends to quote a little heavily, his quotes are always relevant.He touches on the inequality of the distribution of global income and, true to his goal, he merely describes it.For a more in depth, and much longer, explanation of most of the themes covered in this book, with most of the 'whys' explained, try Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". For an off the beaten path explanation of underdevelopment, which Cipolla touches on, try Andr&eacute; Gunder Frank's \\"On Capitalist Underdevelopment\\"I enjoyed the book, reading it in one sitting. It definitely does what it set out to do. It does leave you asking why a lot, but then again his goal wasn't to tackle the 'whys'. Although the book was written in the early 1960's, thanks to the timescale it covers it has aged well, and is worth adding to a bookshelf."},{"Title":"The economic history of world population (Pelican books A537)","review":"This book opens with a description of the thin layer of the earth's surface which man occupies. It aims to indicate how small and fragile the whole human enterprise is .Cipolla suggests that it is so miniscule that it is no wonder that other possible Civilizations cannot observe us. He then goes on to talk about the billions of years of earth's history and the small time Mankind has been part of this. Again he seems to want to underline the fragility and relative insignificance of our place in the Universe.He then puts our present Industrial and Scientific Civilization in the framework of Time Mankind has been said to exist, which he estimates as five hundred thousand years. He points out that the greatest part of that time human beings were involved in hunting for their subsistence, and that the Agricultural Revolution came with the Neolithic only ten- thousand years ago. He then traces out for the greater part of the book the history of Mankind in terms of its sources of energy, production and consumption , births and deaths ( population). He suggests that the accelerated population growth of the past century is creating unmanageable and undesirable pressure on resources. He too examines and deplores the great global inequality in distribution of resources. In his final chapter \\" The Age of Transition\\" he again refers to the three basic types of economic organization-hunting, agricultural, industrial as corresponding to the three ranges of demographic and economic organization society operates at. He says that now in our Age of Transition the Industrial form of organization is spreading throughout mankind, with correspondent abandonment of the land and crowding in great Cities.He says a new Age and style of life is emerging, and that this is subject for anguish and concern. He indicates family ties are on the wane, and a new form of technical training for the many will replace the philosophical education for the few. New tastes, values, ideals are part of the transition.Cipolla sees the Golden Age of Industrialization as 1850-1913 and suggests that we are now and will future generations will pay heavily in economic and social well- being for this process of Industrialization. He sees that there will be not only economic but also spiritual costs for it.He concludes by considering how in only ten- thousand years Mankind has moved from what he calls a state of savagery to a situation where he controls a good part of the world. He asks the question of whether our control over the Environment has led to correspondent increase in our quality as human beings. He laments that 'aggresiveness' which he sees as key to our survival in the world of savagery is still such a formative power in our lives. He worries over our weapons of mass- destruction and where our aggressiveness may take us with them.He too wonders whether the increase in the quantity of human beings will not lead to a decrease in the quality of our lives. He again mentions that at the start of the Neolithic there were perhaps ten million people on earth but in 1950 that had become 2.5 billion. ( I wonder how he would feel today when the number is 6.6 billion. Feb.2008) He concludes by saying that Control which leads to massive death and destruction is abominable. And he pleads for human tolerance and for the respect for ' the dignity and the worth and indeed the sanctity of human personality'.A brief summary work surveying human history like this is bound to be read with many questions and objections. But it provides true material for thought.I wonder for one what Cipolla would make of the latest electronic- Internet Revolution, or of across the board if vastly skewed increase in the standard of living of mankind- that has taken place over the past fifty years."},{"Title":"Neuropsychological Evaluation of the Child (Baron, Neuropsychological Evaluation of the Child)","review":"Thanks to Sue Baron, the pediatric neuropsychologist finaly have the equivalent of the Lezak for adult neuropsychology.

The heart of the book is the description of almost all the tests available in the field of pediatric neuropsychology. The descriptions cover the statistic properties and the main studies available on the principle tests. Each chapter that presents a function starts with a state of the art at a Phd level. It really saved me hours of reading in many books ! Included are also numerous norms (mostly americans)with unpublished ones. The references included are of a great interrest too. The chapter on report wrinting is also essential. To be perfect one would expect a chapter on achievement tests and due to its publication date the WISC IV and the WPPSI III are not included.

I would open the book and the next thing I knew it would be three hours later and I'd be another third or quarter of the way through!In fact, this book was so good that I was very surprised to see the MTV logo on the last page. Because in general, I hate MTV. This book, however, pushed me to read more of the reccomended reads. None of which have truly lived up to my experience with Brave New Girl.Still, I didn't feel the depth of Doreen's relationship to her father. Even towards the end of the book. Thats the only draw back of this young adult novel, because the ending really made up for it.In short, read it.

The communication is terrible. Doreen feels totally neglected in her home and she wants to know about her brother who has mysteriously disappeared... Tracy her sister, is the favorite child. When Tracy brings home a new boyfriend... things take a total turn for the worse.... You should really read this book.. It taught me a lot."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Luna succeeds in creating a very specific atmosphere in this book - both of time and of place. She perfectly captures the intensity of teenage emotion (especially in the passages about The Pixies...I've never read a novelist write so well about the intensity with which a young person can love a certain band). She also writes well about Pasadena in the summertime (and by extension, Southern California in general).Her descriptions evoked for me not merely an idea of what Doreen's life is like, but the actual feeling in the pit of my stomach of the corresponding episodes in my own life. Even when I didn't relate to Doreen's specific experiences, I had the feeling that when I was young I expected my life to be like Doreen's, and I think this is because the book has a sort of universal coming-of-age feel that another reviewer (mistakenly) called cliched. This coming-of-age appeal can be described as the intensity of The Wonder Years' nostalgia mixed with the irreverence and balanced good-bad truth of Catcher in the Rye.I expected this to be about on par with The Perks of Being a Wallflower, as it was published by MTV press at about the same time. While it is a good companion piece (could be the female-version of Chboksy's novel), the writing far surpasses Perks as Luna has a talent for evoking exact and specific emotions that few contemporary writers of young adult fiction can approach. Very very highly reccomended..."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"When I first picked up Brave New Girl, I thought it would be another dreadfully identical teenage angst book with a girl who hates her parents and hates her friends. But no, Brave New Girl never failed to amaze me. Following Doreen throughout her life is new and exciting, as she goes through the perils of childhood. It surprized me that Brave New Girl was actually laugh aloud funny, on numerous occasions because it doesn't look like it would be. The book is fun to read, and despite the fact that it isn't extremely long, the story is so captivating it's hard to put it down without wanting more."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"This is truly an amazing book. The author takes you deep inside the mind of a young girl and nearly crushes you with the experience. The language is strong and pure, and the voice of Doreen pulled me through the book like a steel hook. It gripped me.

I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"With only one friend and a family who doesn't understand her, Doreen faces the challenges of being a teenager and trying to discover who she is and where she belongs. She longs for connection with an older brother she never knew and develops an interest in her sister's boyfriend. When the actions of one night force her into adulthood forever, she must confront the people who she has held at a distance resulting in an ending that is raw, believable and touching. Told in a first person narrative style, readers will empathize with Doreen's anger and frustration. Also, the vivid descriptions of how Doreen uses music to escape is something to which many teens can relate. This edgy, realistic first novel by Louisa Luna uses uncensored language and situations that provide a reflection of a teen culture desperate for attention, understanding and love. Recommended for readers in grades 10-12As a library school student focusing on young adult literature and services, I felt the strength of this book was the credibility given to the readers. Luna trusts teens to be able to handle tough dialog, feelings and situations. The angst that is portrayed is not overdramatic or misplaced, but strikingly honest.Doreen is a captivating protagonist whose inner struggles are translated by a very gifted new author. I am excited to read other MTV books and hope to hear more from this author in the future."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"I was not a big reader at all, not until I found this stunning book by Louisa Luna. I am a 21 year old University student, and thought I might be too old for this book. Turns out I was wrong, I think I became so personally attached to this book because I was ALOT like Doreen when I was her age. She is sarcastic, has only one close male friend, has nothing in common with her older popular sister, is a tom boy who acts so tough on the outside, but it is evident that she longs for more, she longs to be desired and she feels that she needs to make it her mission to save her long-lost brother (so to say, I don't want to give much away). She finds compfort in her favorite band, The Pixies.The most interesting thing about this novel is the way that Doreen reacts to a certain circumstance that occurs in the story; like most young girls her insecurities take over and she blames herself for what has happened, when really she was only an innocent, young girl trying to find her place in this world, thinking she was following her heart.The ending of this story is outstanding, it definatly pulled the whole thing together.Although this novel is small, I gave it 5 stars because the emotion was so true, and something I could relate to, and i found myself thinking about Doreen even when I put the book down.

Doreen grows in maturity considerably due to her experinces and truly cries out for help even before her experience with her sister's boyfriend. Parents...if you have a child, especially a young girl, who is acting aloof and seems depressed, this story may tell you a little of what your child may be thinking. The character of Doreen shows us that there can be hope in light of horrible experinces and that people can come out of those experiences stronger and wiser. It also shows that parents aren't perfect, but sometimes they can redeem themselves by really looking at their children and believing in them.

I am a die hard pixies fan, and was interested in a heroine with the same passion. honestly, the pixies references came off as cheese, just something to make the book hip. anyway, this book is about two middle school outcasts, doreen and ted. Doreen is kind of tough, and ted is kind of a wimp. And they both have fairly dysfunctional families...with the drinking and the pyromania. Doreen and Ted like to smoke cigerrettes, eat candy, loiter and hang around in basements listening obsessivly to some of the greatest albums ever recorded. Doreen's search for her older brother, or her faith that he would understand her, is an interesting aspect...however, when she and her dad reconcile in the end, the explanation given about her brother is less than satisfying, and i find hard to believe that it dissauded doreen from continuing to wonder about him. Doreens older sister's boyfriend is another interesting character...but hardly believable. at first he seems like an understanding older brother, but doreen has reason to be creeped out. however, the reason he does what he does is hardly discussed. other than all that, there are some hallmark moments with parents and some typical interactions with popular kids. yikes. this book is almost good, with its interesting characters and pixies references, but it really stumbles on full character development and gives up in the end, resorting to a trite, cliche, and yes hackneyed ending.still a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"This book is rife with cliches - the stupid parents, the clueless popular girls, the angsty-cool-dorky potty-mouth protagonist, the sad friend.

It deals with friend, family, and drug issues. Every teen should have this"},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"I picked this book up because my friend told me to read it. I thought it would be like a female version of &quot;perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; It really wasn't but good none the less. Its showed how when everything seems perfect your life could actually be upside down. I liked this book but thought more could have been done with it."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Brave New Girl is one my favorites of all time and I just finished reading it. I always alike it when the character seems so real that its not like Loiusa Luna was even a part of the story.Doreen was real as it gets and the way she didn't really express her feeligns towards Matthew made you wonder and amde you wnat to read more.She knows she's not liked very much but she's trying to jsut live her life and not really care.The story was great, the language was believable, and the first person dialogue definitely got into Doreen's head and soul. This book was just great. Louisa Luna needs to write more books."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"I am a teen girl who enjoys reading other adolescent stories. This book caught my intrest right away and I read it within one day. I couldn't believe how good it was. I cant wait for Luna's next book!"},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"i still haven't finished this book yet (that's why it only got 3 stars-- so far), but i am in the middle of it and can't put it down....and i just started it yesterday! although the main charachter is a good 5 yrs younger then me, i still really connect with her; her odd thoughts about matt, her relationship with her peers, and mostly her love for music, like the pixies. The Pixies were what got me interested in this story in the first place. Although my life is not as angst-ridden and unhappy as hers, i can relate to young doreens thoughts. You probably don't *HAVE* to know the pixies to understand her passion, but having one of their cds on while reading could surely help. i would recommend it to readers who like music, and want to 'listen' along. So far i found a humorous reference to Catcher in the Rye. Like many young ramblers in contemporary YA fiction, Doreen often sounds like a female holden caulfeild with her negative outlook and indifferent future. yet she makes fun of even holden himself and his overcompensated glory... the ironiest of ironies!!! this book could be just another story of teen angst, yet its' musical allusions and desparate characters stand out in amongst the shelves."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"I bought Brave New Girl on a Sunday at 5, and by 12 that night I had finished it. I am, unfourtunatly, not much of a reader, but yet I felt so connected to the main character, Doreen, the plot, and even the author. I think this was an incredible book, it was very powerful and brought me to tears. I am a teenager, and I found it so easy to relate to Doreen, she was a normal teen, yet she was extremely unique at the same time. Brave New Girl is honestly one of my favorite books. I reccommend it to all!!!"},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"i am a 14 year old girl. after reading this book, i realized that there are other 14 year old girls out there who feel the same as me. people who find refuage in reading and can relate to what is being said in the books. me and my friends pass books like these around to other people who we think might need them and we always get a great response. this book is one of the best so far. and it was the first book i really read."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"First I will tell you that I love MTV books and have read 5 of them so far. I will also tell you that I'm male and 18, which may be why I felt disconnected from this book. I liked it in many ways. There were lots of funny moments and Doreen was enjoyable most of the time. I guess it wasn't the book's characters I disliked but rather the plot...it lacked so much. I won't go into great detail for it would ruin the book. But I will say that I kept reading and reading and nothing really happened and then something does happen and then there is a big complex scene and it's over...I guess I wanted more. The book attempted to be brave and daring but came out kind of [weak] and only kind of daring. The teenager with a chip on their shoulder and no friends with bad family story line is getting kind of old. Not all teenager's are bitter, angry, annoying people...Doreen came off as too much of a sterotype and not enough of a real person, so I never connected with her. If you have read The Perks of Being a Wallflower and think this will be like it, DON'T READ THIS BOOK becasue it's not even in the same league. Perks is amazing and this falls too short for me."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"As a 15 year old girl I was able to relate to the main character Doreen. This book covers a vast majority of important topics I believe every teenage girl know. Dating, sex, temptation, best friends, dangerous friends, drugs, alcohol, parties, difficult parents, are all shown to you raw and in real life situations that I as an active teen was able to relate to."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Maybe I just live a very sheltered life, but the main character in this book is the oldest, most street-wise, incredible 14-year-old I've ever read about. She hilarious!! Her sarcasm cracked me up and the plot was excellent. I really felt for her. This is a great read. loved it."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"This story is about Doreen, a fourteen year old girl who is not yet sure who she is or where she belongs in the world. Doreen's often mixed and confused feelings are expressed well in the novel. She is attracted to, yet uncomfortable around her sister's boyfriend. She worries about her best friend Ted, who is bullied by classmates, but is sometimes angry and disgusted when he won't stand up for himself. She wants to fit in with her peers yet dislikes them and their treatment of Ted. When her sister's boyfriend rapes her, Doreen find in herself a strength she never had before.My only complaint is that the book is a little too self-consciously hip, but if you can get past that, it's a touching and interesting read."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"This book is sooo good, i could read it over and over.This book is so realistic and fabulous.READ THIS BOOK , and i also encourage you to read the book 'Crooked' which is also by Louisa Luna."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Although the story line of this book was not particularly interesting, the main character was beautifully developed. Doreen is a brave young lady who really defies social norms and has a personality all her own. I laughed out loud numerous times, and to be honest I really couldn't put the book down. Three cheers for Brave New Girl!"},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Doreen is an average 14 year old girl with average 14 year old issues. She hates her parents, her sister, and sometimes even her best friend. I gave this book 5 stars because I found myself relating to the situatuions and reactions that were portrayed by author Louisa Luna. This was a very touching and funny book that I definatly recomend for anyone who has ever felt lost or confused at any point in their life."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"In this book, Doreen is an average girl who no one really notices. But then she gets raped by her sister's 21-year-old boyfriend, and her life takes a turn for the worse..."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"OK, this book has a good ending with loads of actions BUT -unfortunately - everything that comes before kind of lacks something.I bought this book mainly because of the comparison to 'Catcher in the rye' (by JD Salinger), but this book is nowhere near it.Doreen, the main character seems mostly nave and passive, with no ideas of her own. That makes her, and the story, a little strange and 'far-away'.Anyway, if you like 'Catcher in the Rye' and are thinking of buying Brave New Girl then you're probable better of just reading 'Catcher in the Rye' again."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"I wish I could give this book 0 stars. It showed teenagers in the wrong light. The main character, Doreen is this angry, depressed 14 year old who hates everything. Everyone else in the book, except for Ted of course, was portrayed as evil people who deserved to be f-worded by Doreen because they like something that she hates, like singing along to commercials. It hardly has a plot and the whole book reads like Doreen sharing with us everything she hates and wants to swear about. The reason I bought this book was that I saw the ad on MTV and the title &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; together with the pretty colors on the cover made it look like an empowering sort of book. But, I was wrong. I'd recomend this book to angry, depressed teenagers who would like to get more angry and depressed."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"This book left me totally confused, I didn't even know she was raped for most of it. Almost every other word is f*** and I know real teens dont talk like that. I mean we all say it but not to the point where it has to be in every sentence. I dont really understand what the plot was or if there was one. Maybe I just dont get it but this is one of the worst books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Although the thinking of this book was interesting Louisa Luna only captured the little things and then seemed to go off. She talked about several characters that could've been rather significant in this book yet only mentioned them once & then never talked about them again. This book is easy reading and could be read in one day but i don't think it's worth reading. If Luna put more effort into this book it could've been much better. I personally don't recommend this book to anyone but if your up for light reading then this book is good for you."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Brave New Girl by Louisa Luna is an amazing book chronicaling the developement of a 14-year-old outcast, trying to find her way in the world. Doreen is confronted with many issues that face teenagers today, the fight to fit in, her feelings that she develops for her sister's 21-year-old boyfriend, and her constant problems at home and with her only friend Ted. The style of writing is very unique. The first thing that caught my eye was that Luna did not use quotation marks when Doreen was telling what people said. The use of first person really gave insight into everything that Doreen is thinking and feeling, and made the book almost impossible to put down. I finished it in 2 days. I would definately recommend this book as well as all of the other MTV books because I really feel that they express the truth about growing up that few things really show."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Brave: New Girl takes you into the mind of Doreen, who feels alienated from her family, schoolmates, everyone but her friend Ted, who is as much of an outcast as herself. She finds herself falling for her sister's intriguing boyfriend Matthew; her experiences with him reflect what thousands of girls today are suffering through, and will propell her into adulthood. This book's written in clearly and concisely in words seeming to come straight out of the mind of a troubled teenage. Its as real as reading someone's diary. It's a great read for teens in all situations and those trying to understand them."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Doreen is a high school freshman whose primary friendship is with her skateboarding pal, Ted, who like Doreen, is struggling with some problems at home. In Ted's case, an alcoholic mother who seems to get drunk and pass out at the most invconvenient times interferes with his happiness. For Doreen, her parents seem less-than-warm and overly strict; her older brother, Henry, has been long-absent (kicked out by her parents, Doreen believes) and her older sister, Tracey, is more concerned with looking cool than being a buddy to her younger sibling. When Tracey begins to bring home 21 year old Matthew, Doreen quickly develops a crush on him, but what seems like his mutual attraction for her soon reveals a more sinister side.The jaded, slacker, disaffected youth voice may be wearing thin for some of us (it is a little bit for me), but readers who like Go Ask Alice, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and similarly toned stories will love this book. If you've ever faced rejection at the hands of the popular crowd, thought your parents were dorks, and longed for understanding, you'll find a soulmate in Louisa Luna's heroine."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Brave New Girl needs to be read by every teenager as it depicts the &quot;real&quot; life of so many of our young people today. I applaud Doreen's intelligence and courage and can only hope that every teen who reads this novel will become empowered by her example. I work with young students on a daily basis and the story of Doreen and Ted kept me riveted to every page. Ms. Luna's work is a masterpiece! I laughed, I cried, I cheered.....but mostly, I cheered!"},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Every so often a book is written which is both powerful and fragile -- Brave New Girl is that sort of book. Like Mishima, Ms. Luna uses strong, even volatile emotions to portray complex psychological states; however, the voice of the main character, a young teenager named Doreen, is utterly authentic. She is also shown to be compassionate, insightful, and deeply humane without a trace of sentimentality. I think this points to a deeply truthful conception of young teenagers as complicated, conflicted, doubtful, anxious, and hopeful -- personalities as worthy of exposition as adults, and indeed more revealing because of their *less* cynical point of view. If anything, Doreen is a deeply positive character, and if she is impatient with the hypocrisy of the world around her it is because she has a surer grasp on truth than those around her.This book makes beautiful use of language, of ideas, and of the realities of human existence. Don't read it as a *teen book* (though it would be great for any teenager), but simply as a great book about a young woman."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Brave New Girl is a gritty, raw punch in the guts. It runs the gamut of \\"objectionable elements,\\" from language (the f-word makes its debut in the first sentence), to drugs, to alcoholism/drunkenness, to chain smoking, to teen sex. The plot is tough, and involves the sexual violation of the 14-year-old protagonist (Doreen) by her older sister's 21-year-old boyfriend. Other issues include the struggles and dysfunctions of family life, ostracism and bullying in high school, and struggling to answer the nagging question, \\"what happens now?\\" The reading difficulty level is not a challenge (easily junior high level), but the content level is one that is suited for more mature teen audiences. It's a book that would be well-suited to guided reading and discussion between a teen reader and a trusted mentor (parent, teacher, etc.).Having said that, Brave New Girl is also the kind of book that I think is very important. The way the protagonist responds to her circumstances (by swearing, raging against and alienating her family and friends, smoking pot, fantasizing about running away, joking about burning houses down) is certainly not a prescriptive model for coping with the brutalities of life. However, Doreen's emotions ring true, and the injustice and atrocity of her situation will make you sick. The value of all this is the degree to which it encourages the reader to tackle these things preemptively, and assess ways to work through them. It is certainly also a cautionary tale. Most of the objectionable content is showcased in a light that shows its vanity and destructive nature: alcoholism/drunkenness destroys lives; drugs only make people worse than they already are; sex is confusing and complex and dangerous; abuse is real.A note on a more literary level: Doreen mentions J.D. Salinger's pinnacle novel, The Catcher in the Rye, as a book she enjoys and relates to. That detail is a key throughout the narrative--not only does Doreen go through a lot of the existential angst and raillery against hypocrisy that Holden Caulfield does, she also uses language that mimics Caulfield's own first-person account of a few harrowing days. It's not just that both characters swear frequently (although that's part of it); Luna's protagonist also draws heavily on Caulfield's hyperbolic style of expression (\\"I waited about 10 hours while she got ready,\\" etc.). I happened to be reading Salinger's book at the same time as Luna's, and this made the similarities stand out like so many sore thumbs. At first I felt critically toward Luna for \\"stealing\\" the iconic Caulfield's verbiage to produce her own angsty-teen-coming-of-age novel. However, the more I thought about it, I decided the mimicry actually shows a finesse of story-telling: It's Doreen that has absorbed Caulfield's expressions as her own. Doreen had absorbed the language of a person she knows, identifies with, and has spent time with (by reading his narrative); it's not an author ripping off a classic, but an author understanding the way we absorb the things that form us.To close: Brave New Girl allows some closure at its end. The redemptive swing is found in loyalty (primarily Doreen's father and her best friend). Not all issues are neatly tied and closed (see also The Catcher in the Rye)--but I don't think this openness suggests there is no further \\"answer.\\" For me, the point is that the reader will have to take all she (or he) has just read, and think, and wrestle out, and talk out about what to do with it. And that's absolutely invaluable."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"there's a solid 100 page book here, the rest is typical banal padding.the communication divide between parents and kids is explored in depth. like how you think there's no point explaining yourself to them because they don't care and anything you say will only make the situation worse when really it's the silence that makes the situation worse, and they don't understand that they're making you feel like you can't talk to them and you don't understand that what they actually want is for you to talk to them, etc.and it also has the entertaining fantasy element of the opposite sex platonic best friend the main character has, with whom she has the kind of self-aware outsider clique that is victimized by the cool kids yet always seem to have more fun than they do. that part could have been developed a bit more, i mean all they really do is hang out at stores, but it worked ok.those are the two most significant/unique/interesting aspects of the book to me.the loss of virginity/being used by the boy thing seemed a bit too standard issue, implying emotional significance rather than articulating it, and as a big indie/alternative rocker myself i found the musical references too forced and religious/reverent in an unfun kind of way."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"This is a pretty thin novel, but a well-compacted one at that. Louisa Luna aptly covers the most harrowing facets of a teenage lifestyle, through the lens of a rather stereotypical high school girl. Her hardboiled narrative edge is slightly dulled by the predictability of the storyline, although vivid and entertaining.Luna makes a valiant effort to shy away from the traditional aspects of an &quot;angsty&quot; novel, but that should be expected. What the novel lacks in scale and range is made up for by the compelling characters and viciously executed dialogue. A nice plot twist at the end caps off a quick and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"HI!read this book, it is the best book ever, the first few words get you hooked.Doreen is the greatest charactor you can really relate to.She has all these problems and you dont want the book to end. :)Some charactors are so FREAKING mean you wanna kick there ...! lol.And then there are the other charactors who you wanna know more about... anywho, i might sound like a geek, but who cares, read the book anyway!!!"},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Talk about jumping directly into the narrator's mind.The narration in this book is innovative and honest. I thought that many of Doreen's words were wonderful in a way that I can't even describe. At times, I found the narration confusing, but I think it was intentional, and I think it works well enough.Being fourteen was captured in these pages in a way that I have only encountered better in Harley Like a Person by Cat Bauer. This book is more serious, more adult than Harley, and as such it also captures something else, something more disturbing than Bauer did in Harley Like a Person.I didn't really feel that Doreen had become a &quot;brave new girl&quot; by the end of the book. I can see how she would think of herself that way though. She had, however, been through a lot, so I am willing to give her the the title &quot;brave new girl&quot; if she wants it."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"I loved this book!! Yes, Doreen is a bit bitter and depressing sometimes but hasn't every teenager been that way at one point in their lives. Doreen is a real character who I can relate to. Reading this book makes you think about your family, friends, and even your relationships with people in general. Brave New Girl shows that people aren't perfect but they can make up for it in other ways. After I read this book I felt stronger and said things I never could say before."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"All in all, the book isn't bad. I know some could complain of the language, but I understand that Louise Luna is simply trying to convey Doreen's message in a way true to the character, and it works. Unfortunately, the portrayal of a standoffish, aloof teenager has already been over-capitalized on. It's a bit tired, to tell the truth, and a little formulaic. Personally, I thought Salinger's Holden Caulfield already covered this (in a timeless and universal way), but I guess the voice of disillusioned youth will always have its fans. Rather a female version of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys the sort of book often sponsored by MTV. Not really my cup of joe, but it's not terribly bad.Final note: Be aware that this follows in the footsteps of the Molly Bloom-James Joycean stream-of-consciousness. If you like a nice sequencial chain of events, or things spelled out directly, this isn't for you."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"I went into reading this book with high hopes as it is another book by the same publisher as &quot;perks of being a wallflower&quot; however...it never seemed to go anywhere and I just waited and waited for something interesting to happen...but oh well...can't get everything you wish for. Not a bad light read."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Since MTV started publishing books, I've been following them closely. The Perks of Being a Wallflower holds a place in my heart as my favorite book of all time, as a matter of fact. So, when I saw Brave New Girl and it seemed like a Perks kind of book from the female perspective, I was very excited. How disappointing! Doreen is a bitter character. Events are clear clear clear until the turning point, when everything is described cryptically. And it just spirals downward from there. I guess even MTV had to make a mistake on publishing a book. I know there are better, fresher, more optimistic voices out there. We don't need to have a happy story, but a 14-year-old character who is this jaded and this obscene just isn't necessary. If you're looking for a really good read that is as good as the summary of this one sounds, go for Perks instead. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"I read this book in a matter of 2 days. I ordered it off Amazon as well too. This book is great for the average Pixies fan, or just someone that doesn't fit into the \\"norm\\". I LOVED this book."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"Brave New Girl was a very good read and a very unique one at that. It was an &quot;in your face&quot; novel and Doreen pretty much captures teenage life. I read it in less than two days and I would surely recommend this book. Some parts were confusing but overall it was very intriging."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"this wuz a very good book. it can get a little confusing but u just have to pay close attention to what the characters are doing. very good for teens going thru hard times. i love it."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"I attempted to like this book; I really did.Present in the \\"young urban hipster\\" vein that is anything but passe these days, this MTV work is anything but \\"Brave.\\"The publication review says \\"10-14,\\" but I would never give this to anyone under the age of 15, for this book appears to have been penned with adults in mind.Half the book is full of explexitives which after awhile, become redundant. As for the extreme lack of punctuation, it is very irritating for everything just blends together. The characters speak so alike, the reader can hardly distinguish who is saying what.I kept waiting to find some moment to relate to, but alas, none every came. A great idea, it's a type of She's Come Undone for the teen crowd but the plot and poorly developed characters feel like a watered down, curse-laden episode of Dawson's Creek."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"It was well written, i enjoyed reading it, good storyline, it was completely ruined when i looked at the last page, advertising other books from the MTV publisher, it reads &quot;More from the young, the hip, and the up-and-coming.&quot; which i find completely hypocritical. if you read the book you'd understand. the heroin is completely unhip. and the ad is oozing with hip. it made me mad."},{"Title":"Brave New Girl","review":"I don't understand how someone could possibly say this book was any good. The characters were dull and undeveloped. The plot had too many strings. The author spent too much time trying to make the main character &quot;deep.&quot; She also spent too much time trying to make this book be like the phenomenal, &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower.&quot; Please, don't waste time reading this book. It's really a joke."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"When i looked at the table of contents, i saw a pretty impressive list of poets and quite a few surprises. then i read hass's essay, which was great. the problem is hass's taste in poetry. very few of the poems in here should have even been considered for this volume. even from poes who have proved time and again that they are good poets have bad poems in here. beside hass's introduction, the only redeeming part of the book is the contributor's notes and comments."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"Normally, I love these &quot;best of&quot; collections. It provides a broad enough poetry base, so that the average reader can find some poetry that they really connect with and pursue. This volume does that for sure, but in the words of the Hass (the editor) he felt stifled under the structure of the book. He had some interesting ideas about grouping the poems by year, or by the age of the poet. But alas, structure prevails and the poems are in alphabetical order of the author's last name. Is it worth it? Of course it is. Will it blow the top off of your head? Probably not."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"In a time of struggle we turn to poems, at least I do, and there are poems here that make me feel that poetry has so many disguises, so many different &quot;looks,&quot; that it mirrors the vast diversity of this great land in that noble respect. No one can like them all equally but we can be glad they exist. I love the comic poems, poems of charm and wit, and am less crazy about the dry academic &quot;languagey&quot; poems, but that's just me. The essay by Robert Hass is superb and the foreword by the series editor has so much energy and information it's a delight. Maybe no poem in the book is as great as Auden's &quot;September 1, 1939,&quot; but if you read Ashbury, or Donald Hall, or Adrienne Rich, or Robert Creeley, or Olena Kalytiak Davis, you'll feel in your heart of hearts that indeed &quot;we must love one another and die,&quot; and for as noble a cause as freedom, if not joy, poetry and life itself. Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"I was terribly disappointed by this collection. I am an avid fan of the &quot;Best of...&quot; series, both the short story and poetry annual collections, and wished I had read through this collection before I purchased it. That would have told me just how much &quot;intellectual passion&quot; as opposed to &quot;pleasure&quot; these poems would present. There is a lot of poetry of ideas and form and what feels like postmodern self-conscious gimmickry, but little true emotion or connection to the human experience. And no, I am not an \\"old fogey moon-june\\" poetry lover. I love experimentation in poetry. But I feel hoodwinked by Hass' choices (and hey-why didn't he tell us in his nice introduction that his wife was in here!??). Much of this is a poetry in love with language and ideas, but not the connection they must make with sensation and experience in order to move a reader. It's not that the poems are difficult to read through--much great poetry is after all, and much great poetry originally broke the &quot;rules&quot;-- but many of these poems I found thoroughly, frustratingly, truly incomprehensible until I read the author comments in the back. And these notes were at times laughable in their ostentation and/or pitiable in their affectedness. They explain the poem in many cases, but what were we expected to do without these author remarks? In fact, some of these author comments read like indispensable footnotes, not enlightenment on the artistic experience.All is not lost. The Ashberry and Bishop and Koch, among others, are marvelous, and proof that a great poet doesn't need afterwords or explanatory remarks and footnotes in order to make meaning out of their poetry. And since Ashberry, for example, rarely makes \\"sense\\" in the obvious way, it is not that events need to be spelled out in order of poetry to be moving. But it must have an element of emotion in order to please this reader, not just language that sounds good put together or ideas that only mean something to the writer and must be explained in detail.Anyway, there are many out there who will certainly love this collection-mostly critics and graduate students and professors, is my guess (and I just graduated recently from a writing program, so I know whereof I speak). But more and more these people determine the direction poetry is taking, so it is informative to read this collection for that reason if none other. But save your money if any of my comments mean something to you, or at least read through this at the bookstore before buying.If you are disappointed by this collection, try the &quot;Best of American Poetry...&quot; that anthologizes the earlier decades. It is a wonderful collection."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"If, very generally, the world is divided into experimental-elliptical and narrative-lyric poetry, then Hass, who has finally realized poetry has changed since he was a boy, is trying to reflect that. Everyone knows these books aren't really books of bests, they're books of trends and tend to be a bit behind the curve. Admitting that, there's no reason to be getting excited here. Rita Dove's was good, this one's eh. It's not the preponderance of more oblique, non-narrative stuff that's the problem--there's a fair amount of dreary gabble, but there are also some electric pieces--Szporluk's series of metaphors has energy, though the last two lines are right out of I-am-woman-hear-me-roar; Lydia Davis is intense and nifty and fun; etc., etc. Where Hass falls down on the job is in picking poetry of more traditional pleasures: most of the clearer narrative pieces are sentimental and unenergetic. It's as if to Hass, the new can only be the elliptical--can't be in a narrative mode that has different sound, sentiment or idea from what he does himself. Alan Feldman's piece, for example, is a namedropping and overlong bit of tripe the point of which seems to be the poet reassuring himself that his mother loved him. Of course there are Kalytiak-Davis, Anne Carson, McHugh, Stewart and a few others who are working outside all the usual boxes, and their work is always fun to read. Gluck is the real thing, and her poem Time is, I think, from her latest book, which is her best so far. Young is fun, as usual; Bernard Welt's &quot;I stopped writing poetry&quot; might be the freshest, funniest and also--to poets anyhow--poignant thing in here. Sayers Ellis is fine--he's a good poet--though I've seen other work by him that I like much more. But other than that you could almost go through this book and say, without checking the bios, this one teaches here, this one got their mfa here, and do it almost to the date. That is to say, what an academic bunch of stuff! I guess that's a pretty accurate reflection of what's going on today, but I think Dove, last year, produced an anthology which found more new voices which couldn't be pigeonholed quite as easily, while her taste in older voices at least tended to lead her to their better stuff."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. I was disappointed in this year's BAP as well. I'm an avid reader of previous collections and was happy to see Rita Dove edit the previous edition, as she seemed to value diversity in gender, ethnicity, and style much more than Haas, who seemed to select more academic, less human works (and as the previous reviewer mentioned, his wife, which I have mixed feelings about). His wife is a wonderful language poet, but really. Overall, a stuffy volume that didn't seem very representative of modern American poetry today. Save your money and borrow it from the library if you really must read it."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"want to know why nobody reads poetry anymore? read the first 58 pages of this book and you will know. 58 pages is all of my free time that i could justify wasting. page after page of dull words thrown up by pretentious people with next to nothing to say. truly horrible."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"This series is becoming more and more boring with time. The main reason is that it is more and more &quot;intelectual&quot; and smells university. Many poems are well written by today's standards, but that may just be the best way to write a bad poem. A bad poem can be considered good literature, but many good ones were considered in their time bad literature. I didn't buy this book, I read a lot of pages in the store and didn't even find three poems to make me part from my 15 bucks. The other volumes I have just sit in my library and just one or two poems in the 4 volumes I have really hit the score and make want to come back again. Want a good american anthology? Then go fot Alan kaufman's &quot;The Outlaw bible of American poetry&quot;. Another good one is the &quot;vintage book of American poetry&quot;. I hope someone tries to compete with this series because there is a lot of great stuff going on, the editors here seem to be fishing in the wrong waters."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"This book and books like this one are probably the best way to come in contact with modern poets. Many people know the time-honored favorites and even a few who garnered acclaim through the sixties, but resources like this book make it possible to see what is considered 'great' in modern works. The presentation is perfect; the poems are arranged alphabetically and without comment leaving the reader to make up his or her mind as to whether or not this poem is truly great."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"There has been much debate over the past ten years of what constitutes poetry. This book involves a broad scope of what is now considered poetry and why very few people \\"like\\" poetry. To sum it up, \\"good grief!\\""},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"Nearly every edition in this series contains I like and poems I hate. It really does depend on the editor's tastes. Since Hass is big on ambiguity, language poetry, and fragmented narratives, many of the poems here follow that. My favorites include: Bly, Rich, Lydia Davis, James Galvin. I think overall this is one of the top few books in this series. I can already see that I'm not going to like the 2002 edited by Creeley"},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"The same old poets writing the same old poem, year after year. Even Dean Young is beginning to sound a little too &quot;Dean Youngy&quot; for his own good. Hass really scoured the journals to find a good representation of the best poets writing today.

Note to David Lehman: This series needs a good kick in the pants."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2001","review":"\\"We're bent in the garden planting spring bulbs, pulling upweeds, and I'm wondering how much longer we'll crouch hereon our knees in the damp soil sorting things out. Guardiansof shrubs and flowers, the first wild cyclamen sipping the sun.We watch over each other as we watch over our garden,woolly branches of cacti, fiery pokers of aloes in winter.Especially during a long drought, after a snowfall, or followingthe arcs of missiles on our screen. Flurries of extra caring.Some mornings we hang on to each other as if we're afraid to let go.\\"~ pg. 126, Shirley KaufmanThe fascination I currently have with The Best American Poetry series seems born of my curiosity to see how each editor creates a world of poetry they feel possessed to love. The choices made by Robert Hass reflect so accurately his loves and dislikes. You can live in a short moment of his life through reflecting on what it is he enjoys about the selections in this book.Each poet sees the world so uniquely, but many times they seem to write from a place of loneliness, the desire to speak to another soul of similar substance. This becomes very apparent in the personal stories of pleasure and pain, emotional and real, fresh and trying. At times lines from a poem feel distant and sad while others spring from the page, pouncing on you with the joy of a happy kitten. Poetry has its own rewards and good poetry is the reward for searching through a lot of moments, that while not mediocre to many, may be to you. Your personal taste figures in highly in what you will enjoy and to one person, a poem may mean nothing, and to another, it is the world.For this reason, I try to view poems from many perspectives. I will say that the poems in this particular volume can be especially perplexing. The truth is, you may read this book one day and feel completely disconnected and come back and read it on another day and wonder what you were thinking.The mood of this volume is especially intellectual and complex with many literary references, like discussions of the death of Virgina Woolf and the writings of Dostoevsky. The poems are mysteries to be solved and require your full attention and don't seem to immediately welcome you into their intimacy. But then you happen upon a poem like Linda Gregg's \\"The Singers Change, The Music Goes On\\" and you know you have happened upon a moment of truth that will endure.\\"We live our myth in the recurrence,pretending we will return another day.Like the morning coming every morning.The truth is we come back as a choir.\\"Allen Grossman's \\"Enough rain for Agnes Walquist\\" has some very intriguing thoughts:\\" -a smooth stonepassed in a kiss from the mouthof a Fate into my open mouthamidst odors of metaland slamming doorsat the dark end of a railway caras the train was leaningon a curve and slowingto stop-is lost. Lost\\"Alice Noteley's poem must be printed sideways because the lines are so long it can't possibly fit on the pages any other way:\\"always near the border and never in the snows come again and the purple sinister skyso I can die and read the books they leave me always alive the letters and the letters letters.\\"Robert Pinsky's \\"Jersey Rain has beautiful images of the moon where he talks about \\"The chilly liquefaction of day to night.\\" James Richardson writes \\"Ten-second Essays\\" that are numbered and give you snippets of moments to enjoy and expand upon in your own mind. A few of the lines are quite funny, like: \\"Say nothing as if it were news\\" or witty like: \\"The road not taken is the part of you not taking the road.\\"Mary Ruefle's \\"Furtherness\\" is especially beautiful in the most poignant of ways as she writes about death. The poem I loved the most was \\"Apple\\" by Susan Stewart which made me long for the Apple tree in my grandmother's yard.\\"You can roast late applesin the ashes. You can runthem in slices on a stick.you can turn the stem tofind the letter of your love.\\"Most poets will find Bernard Welt's \\"I stopped writing poetry\\" rather amusing. I loved his line: \\"It's a terrible thing to receive exactly the attention you want.\\" The entire poem gives insight into why poets write in the first place and any poet could relate to: \\"still a breeze reaches me from time to time fragrant of verse.\\"If you read this book and stopped at page 58, you would miss an entire world!

It is a book you will refer to many times. Pay attention to page 18 and page 50-51 on scolding a shih tzu; they are senstive creatures and don't respond well to being scolded harshly. They are more than eager to do what pleases you. There is also two pages on grooming that shows the different clips for a shih tzu if you don't want to keep the long hair like a show dog.

Like \\"The Little Prince\\", it speaks quietly and simply of things that are so true we tend to overlook or forget them. Unlike the mentioned book, this one brings in harsher elements, such as poverty and abuse -- and shows how the simple wisdom of a child can overcome them. MacDonald's imagination is wonderful, and some of the dreams and fairy tales in the book almost outshine the \\"real\\" story. I love the children who dig for stars. This is one I enjoyed because it is so different, so simple and beautiful, and one I look forward to sharing with my children, should I ever have any.PS - My sister read an edited, abridged version of this book, one rewritten to make it easier for children, and it was awful.

To be fair, the cover of the book and the back cover description is a little misleading, because the main focus doesn't really fall on the creature Samuel but on Sunderland Haverner; however, as a story in itself and the way Poul composes the tale I found that the book was well written and somewhat disturbing. We can all make our interpretations on to who or what Samuel is, but it's very possible Samuel never really existed, except in Sunderland's mind. The characters are far from being stereo-typed, unless you are stereo-typing their lives and their background. Each character had their own personalities, and as the days wore on they all started to change, and all for the worst. I give this book 4 stars, because it was well written and Poul mastered the art of different views real well. However, I think parts of it did drag on to the point of confusing or turning off the attention of the reader."},{"Title":"The Devil's Game","review":"I am a big fan of Poul Anderson's, but this book was probably his worst.

Though I will admit to finishing this novel in one read and being moderately entertained by it, it is certainly not something that will stand out as a trully profound story.

This is a great little chess primer for the beginning student of chess. Learn and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Common sense in chess,","review":"I like this book, I have the older Dover edition that uses descriptive notation, this book uses algebraic notation which is now standard but in 1895 when the young World Champion Lasker provided these lectures, descriptive notation was the norm in the US and Europe.Enjoy the history and the style of writing.Very many players have started playing Chess by studying this book and it is not about specific openings or variations but more about ideas on how to play. Right from the start, the intro discusses that chess is like a fight and it is not always about specific lines but more about a will of ideas... This a guide for the practical player - the novice will see a guide about how to develop your pieces, a beginner a guide how to analyse your games, the developing player a guide about attack, a guide about defense, a guide on how to conduct an ending ... Chapter 2 - lecture 2 covers some important ideas about the Berlin variation in the Ruy Lopez - I'm sure that former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik (and recent winner of the 3rd London Chess Classic) agreed with Lasker's basic assessment that Black gains a satisfactory position and he dusted it off and managed to hold former World Champion Gary Kasparov 3 times in the 2000 WCM - this reintroduction of an old defense helped GM Kramnik to a World Championship - I'm sure it wasn't this book that led to the decision to play the Berlin but GM Kramnik has been known to roll out variations that Lasker played over 100 years ago and would be surprised if it didn't play some small part in the decision back in 2000.With respect to decisions, in chapter 6 he discusses the French and really hammers 3.Nd2 (the Tarrasch variation) as a sickly move, opening moves should not block the scope of 2 other pieces but 3. Nd2 is something I like to play versus the French (White's best line against he recommended 3... c5 involves a temporary pawn sac but with correct play Black usually holds the balance) - so time does change opening theory and perhaps prove Lasker wrong about certain variations but the ideas that he conveys are true today - his recommended variations are often still critical today and he didn't have a super computer buzzing around to test out his lines.Even though I'm a fan of Lasker, this is an intro book so I do think the price is a bit steep."},{"Title":"Common sense in chess,","review":"Ok , before you buy a book look how many pages it is and how many reviews it has received .

Toby represents both Bela Lugosi and William Faulkner at the same time -- Lugosi is being stalked, Faulkner is accused of murder -- and the cases quickly become entwined, with Toby not knowing where one case ends and the other begins. One of the differences to this book (that I don't remember in any other) is that it doesn't begin with the &quot;bad guy&quot; chasing or confronting Toby. There *is* some flashback, but it is expository. As usual, the era references are interesting, and in the re-printed version (that came out in October 2000) there is an good afterword by Kaminsky about the Peters novels and about Bela Lugosi."},{"Title":"Never Cross a Vampire","review":"Toby Peters is hired to protect Bela Lugosi, who has been receiving crank messages written in animal blood and a tiny bat with a stake through the heart. Lugosi, a delightful man who would rather be performing Shakespeare than donning fangs and cape, is both typecast and down on his luck. Peters accompanies Lugosi when he appears at the Dark Knights of Transylvania (translated to five fake vampires in an old movie theatre), but is one of the members Lugosi's tormenter?Just when Peters is about to start investigating, he gets a call from the studio - the writer William Faulkner has been accused of murder. The victim is agent Jacques Shatzkin and both the victim and his wife announced that Faulkner was the murderer at the scene, so things are not looking good. However, Peters is soon asking questions - why did Faulkner accept an invite to dinner and shoot his host as soon as he appeared and why does Mrs Shatzkin insist Faulker is the man when she has no idea what he looks like? Soon our Hollywood PI, hampered by a damaged knee when his brother takes exception to his involvement in the case, is limping around town being jumped on by men in capes and following up leads. His main problem is to find out why, and how, the two cases are linked...This is a fantastic series, complete with everything you could want from a mystery series. Peters is a typical wise cracking, but intelligent hero, and the other characters around him give the series a depth and interest. This is the fifth in this long series - book number six isHigh Midnight: A Toby Peters Mystery (Book Six)and involves Gary Cooper. The author wrote another long running series, set in Russia during the time of the KGB, and I delighted that they will also be released on kindle soon, the first book in the series beingDeath of a Dissident: An Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov Mystery. Kaminsky was a wonderful writer and, having been out of print for a long while, I am thrilled to see he may be finding a new audience who will discover his work for the first time."},{"Title":"Never Cross a Vampire","review":"I read &quot;Never Cross a Vampire&quot; almost ten years ago and I enjoyed the endearing portrait of Bela Lugosi. The book also features a cameo by Boris Karloff and does not shrink from his rivalry with Lugosi. It is fun to read how a &quot;B-Movie Star Villain&quot; can save the day.Also, the Asian Professor's account on the myth of internation vampires deserves special mention."},{"Title":"Never Cross a Vampire","review":"I love the Toby Peters series I wish they were re issued over here in the UK they are great stories, each covers a specific movie star involved in some sort of crime story.

These are intial impressions and I will follow up in August.The binding is poor. My copy, which was used by other instructors the past two semesters is falling apart.This is a book with a lot of exercises and very little excess verbiage. There is little in the way of motivation or enlightenment. Of course, the instructor may want to stamp his personality on the course.I think the first half of the book needs a section on permutations and combinations. In general counting is slighted.I also question the choice of optional topics in the second half of the book. I would like to see the construction of Q from the integers and some material on algebraic completenes of C. The choice of rings and integral domains over groups as an introduction to abstract algebra is puzzling.Finally, at my university, half the students taking the transitions course are future secondary teachers.

(Praise God) Lives were changed because of this reading and at this meeting the healing power of God was evident through the outpouring of emotional releases experienced. Personally, I have been reminded and encouraged to &quot;stop and listen&quot; to the signs from God because His voice is audible -- whether we believe it or not! There were several of us who felt the urge to share this book (immediately). &quot;I Cry No More&quot; will not stay on my shelf!

Things like stealing is bad from Windfalls, you can not believe every advertisement from Face Cream from Godey's Lady's Book and dogs can spell in The Dog Who Could Spell. In this book, I get to know Mabel's best friend, Sarah Jane better as well. They were always getting in trouble. Mabel maybe just a little more as she was a bit of a tomboy and not afraid of heights.

The title pretty much explains the premise... a little girl discovers interesting and unique things in her grandmother's attic and asks about them. Grandma always has a story to tell about the items she has carefully saved... and other little incidents remind her of stories as well. These sweet, old-fashioned books don't have much of a plot. Instead, they are just short anecdotes about a long-ago little girl with timeless lessons that are just as relevant today as ever.There are 10 books in the series. They have recently been re-released with new covers and illustrations, as well as easier-to-read page formatting. (More space between the lines which makes them more appealing to younger readers.)

I'm sure little Arleta sat wide-eyed listening intently to each tale, trying to take in and remember every detail and then begging her grandmother for another story and another. These stories remind us of a time with no computers, no TV, and no irritating media distractions. Family, friends and values were what mattered most and each story reflects that. Common acts of kindness and decency are told with both humor and lessons to be learned.This book does a wonderful job of showing kids how to love on and do good to others just as they'd like to be treated themselves. Even in difficult or imperfect relationships there can still be respect shown to those around us.

As I am a grandma I know how these stories can get told to those little ears that does not believe you were ever small. I love to see the look in their eyes when I tell them something in my past just as Arleta Richardson does about her Grandma. She makes each chapter a different story and they are so interesting. In book three I loved the way Grandma and her best friend Sarah Jane could come up with something all the time to get them in trouble. I guess the best one from these two books was the story where Arleta had ordered something free from a catalog and it was some anti wrinkle cream. She and Sarah read in an aunt's magazine where you could mix honey, wax and lemons together and when it cooled you put it on your face and it was take the wrinkles off and also freckles. They didn't have wrinkles but Arleta had freckles, so they slipped and mixed all of this up and carried it upstairs and put it on their faces. They didn't know how lone to wait but when they though they had waited long enough they tried to get it off and there was no way they could get the hard stuff from their faces. So they had to tell the Ma and when it came off it tool skin and freckles. They decided then that was something they would never try again.Both of the books have chapter after chapter with stories as this.

The book says they are for ages 8+ but you can read them aloud to younger kids as well.The 14 chapters are each a perfect length to read one each night. I sometimes read them aloud for my whole family and we all enjoy them. Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we roll our eyes at their antics. But they are real. The friend and family relationships are real. The trials and successes are real. Their faith was strong. And kids today can relate. We get a peek into the minds of these two girls and what brings them to act the way they do.

They should be in every library and school library too."},{"Title":"still More Stories from Grandma's Attic","review":"When I was growing up, my grandmother lived in a great old house with lots of bedrooms and antiques to investigate. We grandkids took turns spending the night with her and listening to her stories. Nannie had lived through World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, and many cultural changes. She had a wealth of life experiences from which to educate and entertain us, and we soaked up every detail.So I can completely relate to the premise of Arleta Richardson's books. Arleta's grandmother was also a storyteller, who recounted memories of her childhood on a nineteenth-century farm. In the Grandma's Attic series, Arleta retells those stories for the benefit of children all over the world.Here's an excerpt from the section that introduces each book in the series . . .\\"One hundred years! What a long, long time ago that is! . . . The old kitchen where Arleta sat to hear many of Grandma Mabel's stories didn't look the same as when her grandma was a little girl. Back then there was no electricity nor running water. But Grandma still lived in the house she grew up in. Arleta had no trouble imagining all the funny jams that Grandma and her best friend, Sarah Jane, got into. Or how it felt to wear long flannel stockings and high-buttoned shoes.From the dusty old attic to the front parlor with its slippery furniture, Grandma's old house was a storybook just waiting to be opened. Arleta was fortunate to have a grandma who knew just how to open it. Her grandma loved to tell a story just as much as Arleta loved to hear one.\\"These stories share exciting adventures that entertain while communicating important moral lessons. The books are aimed at kids aged 9 to 12 but will provide fun for your whole family.

These stories captivate young and old alike because they are like sitting on the knee of an a grandmother and taking in the scents and sights of a time long ago forgotten. They transport readers to a time free of modern devices and distractions and into the turn of the century. I would love to say this was a less complicated time, with less stressful decisions. However, the fact remains that there is nothing new under the sun it is just the way it is done.These stories are timeless in their moral application to ones character development. If you are seeking stories that will captivate your children while conveying godly character development this is it - look no further. I highly recommend these to home school families that are seeking to add richness and depth to their library while complimenting a biblical world view education.I was first told of this series by a fellow home school mom when I was first looking for an appropriate library for my children. A few months later I received, much to my delight, the first two in the series from B&B; Communications as review copies. And now I have the book 3 and 4 as well under the same circumstances.When I open these books my children know they are in for a delightful read that will lead to discussions on how they can apply the story to their own lives as well as a search in the bible for applicable scripture that matches the stories they have just read. I have even had them try to recreate stories with the same moral lessons in their own words.Thank you B&B; Communications for offering this book as well as the others to me as review copies. They have been a welcomed addition to my library."},{"Title":"still More Stories from Grandma's Attic","review":"Arleta Richardson has done it again! In Still More Stories from Grandma's Attic, Book 3, we hear Grandma Mabel telling us more hilarious stories of her mischievous childhood, along with her best friend Sarah Jane, and her two brothers, Reuben and Roy.

God's mercy and grace, understanding and warmth are shown through her dad without using the \`switch.'Arleta's books are great for young girls to learn the principles of obedience, character and love for God.

Well over 100 year ago when Grandma Mabel was a young girl living on a farm with her Ma and Pa and brothers, she experienced life's lessons in unique ways that she shared with Arleta. Arleta knowing her Grandma was a fantastic story teller remembered the tales to put into print for the world to enjoy.Mabel was a curious youngster that often found herself in the middle of mischief from creating her own face cream that needed chiseled off her face, to wearing her best dress to school without permission and spilling the ink well all over it, to disobeying instructions from her Ma and Pa to realize that they truly did know best. Mabel learns life lessons from the elderly around her, those she may have prejudged to realize that they were truly gifted with knowledge and love.Grandma Mabel shares these stories with Arleta in a gentle teaching approach that shares with Arleta and her readers' life lessons that are still very applicable today. Told in funny and delightful prose, the readers of today will still find much laughter and enjoyment in reading Arleta Richardson's stories.I just loved reading the stories of times gone by and sharing them with my children. A much simpler time in our history but with significant themes that still are useful in teaching our own children. They were entertaining to my children as well as myself which is perfect in a children's book.I received a copy of Arleta Richardson's book in exchange for an honest review."},{"Title":"still More Stories from Grandma's Attic","review":"I loved the first two books in this series and couldn't wait to see what adventures Arleta would share with us about her grandmother Mabel when Mabel was a girl back in the 1880's. It seemed like Mabel and her best friend Sarah Jane were always into trouble, even when they weren't trying. The great thing about the mischievous girls was the fact that the stories always imparted little nuggets of wisdom. Even though Mabel and Sarah Jane grew up during the 1880's they are just like little girls today, they wanted to be pretty, and was anxious to grow up.These stories certainly transported me back to a simpler time, and often had me chuckling at the antics of Mabel and Sarah Jane.

Each chapter is an individual story which starts off with Arleta in the present and her grandmother ends up telling her a tale of when she was a little girl in the 1880's. The time frame has moved ahead a little bit from the previous two books though Mabel (Grandma) does go back as far as being six years old; she is mostly 12/13 and the majority of the stories involve her and her best friend Sarah Jane and their life in rural Michigan on a farm. Mabel and Sarah Jane are good girls but they always manage to get themselves into trouble with their fancies and mischief. This time their adventures include a home-made wrinkle cream, trying to get by without wearing their long underwear under their stockings, a week's trip to the city, a surprise birthday party where no one invites the birthday celebrant and eating windfalls (apples) from a neighbours orchard. Wonderful, wholesome stories that will appeal to fans of the Little House or Betsy-Tacy books. These are wonderful examples of Christian fiction, but no religion is no more excessive than that being the way of life for the folks back then. Some stories have no indication they could be classified as Christian while others may have the parents teaching their children a behaviour lesson through scripture. It is all very low key. Think of the Christian element used in the LHOTP TV show."},{"Title":"Eichmann in My Hands (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)","review":"A compelling account by the Israeli agent who captured Hitler's chief executioner, Eichmann in my hands by Peter Z.

Who would have believed that the most advanced nation in Europe - culturally, artistically, technologically - would adapt such an insane ideology or descend into a hell on Earth? Then who could have predicted that, like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, the very people marked for destruction would in the end, emerge triumphant?I salute the writer for his effort even if he did get in trouble with the authorities. It is both informative and entertaining, especially the inside details of the spy world. (\\"The Boats of Cherbourg\\", a tale of a Mossad vessel-snatching from France after she turned pro-Arab, is another such tale.) What is horrifying about Eichmann is his everyday normalcy, his seemingly pleasant demeanor, a gentleman who casually chats about murdering millions of people. He is so ordinary as to invite fear. He even mentions he had Jewish friends before the war but what could he do? After all, the Jews controlled everything. That eerily sounds like some places in Europe in 2004The trial, the political machinantions in Israel (they revived the death penalty for this one case), the evidence - superbly told.

While they were holed up with Eichmann in a safe house in Argentina, the author found himself drawn to have conversations with this person, to try and understand why he did what he did. Reading these conversations affected me so strongly, I can only imagine what the author himself went through. At one point, reading Eichman's reply to a question, I threw the book across the room. I couldn't even read it in one sitting, despite the fact that it's extremely well-written.

Their task was to to lead a team to Argentina to capture Eichmann alive, and to take him back to Israel for trial, so that the truth could be exposed to the world and so that the world would know why a Jewish homeland must exist!The man who actually snatched Eichmann off the streets was Peter Malkin , a young Israeli who lost his sister and nephew in the holocaust, thanks to the work of Eichmann.What follows is fascinating account beginning with the story of two men : Malkin , and the monster who he captured , Eichmann.I enjoyed reading about Malkin's childhood and youth-he came to Israel, from Poland , when he was four years old.Particularly interesting is the brutality of the British , in the 'Palestine' colony , towards the Jews.This information makes it particularly sickening to see much of the British establishment, including the British media (epitomized by the hate speech of the likes of Robert Fisk, and the BBC), politicians like George Galloway Ken Livingstone and Tom Dalyell, academics like Tom Paulin and others, leading the international campaign to vilify and harm Israel, while glorifying the terrorists that cruelly murder Jewish men , women and children.They are showing the same callousness in regard to Jewish men, women and children being murdered today, as they did during the British Mandate.The book outlines the exploits of the Israeli agents in Argentina, the capture of Eichmann , and the conversations between Malkin and Eichmann , which reveal the chlling mind of a killer.The book concludes with a short chapter , asking the question if a holocaust could happen again.There are troubling parallels between the systematic vilification of Jews before the Holocaust and the current vilification of the Jewish people and Israel. Suffice it to note the annual flood of anti-Israel resolutions at the UN; or the public opinion polls taken in Europe, which single out Israel as a danger to world peace; or the divestment campaigns being waged in the US against Israel; or the attempts to delegitimize Israel's very existence. The complicity of the Allies in WW II is mirrored by the support the PLO has been receiving from Europe, China and Russia to this very day.If remembering Auschwitz should teach us anything, it is that we must all support Israel and the Jewish people against the vilification and the complicity we are witnessing, knowing where it inevitably leads.As with the holocaust, the same kind of Jew-haters will again attempt to appease Arab rage with Jewish blood and land. We must stand up against it. Jews are still dying for only one reason; being a Jew.Like a Phoenix out of the ashes of the Shoah (as the holocaust is known in Hebrew) the reborn Jewish State of Israel arose. The great hope of the Jewish Nation - the national anthem of Israel is Hatikvah - the Hope."},{"Title":"Eichmann in My Hands (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)","review":"\\"It is hardly a secret that innumerable German scientists, formerly engaged in research for the Third Reich, played a decisive role in the rocket programs of the United States and the Soviet Union. What remains largely unknown even today is that others, including more than a few rabid and unrepentant Nazi's, were brought into the employ of the Arab states, most notably Nasser's Egypt, to fight Israel. But we knew...\\"-Peter Malkin's chapter \\"Spy\\"Peter Malkin is the Israeli spy who tackled Adolph Eichmann on a street in Buenos Aires and brought him to Jerusalem to stand trial for masterminding the holocaust, the shoah, along with a handful of other Mossad agents. The term \\"the final solution\\" was his. The ideas for the trains, the camps, the ovens were Eichmann's. He is the only person who was executed in Israel by the government. Somehow, he managed to escape detection for 10 years following the Nuremberg trials. This story is about his capture but it is not about his trial; those details are lacking in this book. Peter Malkin like so many other jews and Israelis lost many family members in those war years. A sister stayed behind in Poland with her husband and little children. His family immigrated to palestine when he was a little boy.Malkin, a real life Gabriel Allon, was a master of disguise. He played pranks on close friends and family members, pretending to be someone else totally fooling them. Thus, his mother's comment after one succesful ruse. I had not expected such humor in this tale. One learns also about life in palestine before 1948 during the British mandate when Malkin joined the outlawed Haganah. One learns about the personalities of both Malkin and Eichmann. As I read this, I couldn't help but feel such sadness for Eichmann; he really is to be pitied. How could anyone imagine such cruel treatments to so many millions of people and then carry them out and have no remorse for it? It is to the Israelis' credit that they did not torture him, harass him, play psychological tricks on him as he had done to others. The Israelis came to bring him to justice and that they simply did. To me it is sad that Eichmann came from an evangelical family; how can a christian do such things? This I, as a professed christian myself, cannot understand. He went to the same high school as Hitler, a catholic. So many details of the shoah, Eichmann's many crimes, are left out, but enough are told to understand why Eichmann was a war criminal and that he did not get away with it. How can people still say that these genocides did not happen? Talk about denial. One might succeed in killing millions of people, but you cannot succeed in removing all the evidence and witnesses to such crimes wherever in the world they occur. And it is impossible to do so in this day and age given the technology we have now. Hallelujah.I highly recommend that at least the several movies on the Nuremberg trials be seen too. Surely such trials as these are going on right now in the world today under different circumstances of course; these trials were unprecedented and important and are models of how the international community should respond to crimes such as these."},{"Title":"Eichmann in My Hands (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)","review":"The reader gets an overview, which is sometimes superficial, of the unfolding Holocaust, and Eichmann's central role in it. Mass ghettoization gave way to mass shootings, which in turn gave way to mass gassings. Eichmann was partficularly involved in the destruction of Hungary's Jews just as the Red Army was on the outskirts of Budapest. Hungarian Jew Kastner (Kasztner), who made a deal with Eichmann, is mentioned as a \\"notorious name in Israel.\\" (p. 227).For four years after the war, Eichmann remained in Germany. Then he fled to Argentina and lived as Ricardo Klement. The Allied search for Nazi war criminals effectively ended about 1947. There was no hint of Eichmann's existence for 15 years. Many thought that he was dead. Eichmann's invisibility was facilitated by his careful avoidance of being photographed during the entire Nazi era. When in group photographs, Eichmann would hide his face behind another person.The rigidity of Eichmann's habits made him easy to kidnap once he had been located in Argentina. The agents said: \\"Un Momentato Senor\\" and grabbed him. They examined him, cross-matching such things as his scar, to verify his identity. They then flew him to Israel to stand trial.The author was a member of Haganah. By the mid-1940's, it had united in effort with the Irgun and the Stern. The author took part in the capture of Eichmann, along with Uzi Gal (best known for his machine gun).

The rest if their list is undeerstandable, but to lump Mill with Marx and Engels is to say you slept through your Western Civilization classes.Mill is a must read for anyone who wants to know how modern Western Civilization got where it is today, the roots and fruits of a free democratic society; and those who oppose him and it."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"JSM's On Liberty certainly stands among the classic works of the Age of Reason. Mill's encyclical is a perfect example of the tendency of the Enlightenment to believe something to be reasonable if it is couched in the proper language.Mill walks a tenuous path between Locke &amp; Bentham, taking up a defense of liberty, but unwilling to risk his utilitarian street cred. Thus, we have beautiful assertions such as &quot;the unchallenged idea is that which is in most danger&quot;, along side a perverse and logically twisted injection of &quot;duty&quot; into what is otherwise a syllogistic approach.Mill insists on a Lockian sphere of rights approach, then qualifies it in the cases of children (up to whatever age the law defines them), as well as in those societies that aren't developed enough for liberty (by Mill's definition?). Liberty is also to be restricted in such cases as a man might &quot;sin by omission&quot; and &quot;fail to help his Brother.&quot; These wonderful sentiments are followed by more cognitive dissonance, various ad hominem attacks on Christianity (particularly those sinister Catholics), and a lot of hand-waving about polygamy.As an aside, I imagine that G.K. Chesteron had Mill in mind when he wrote &quot;The worst judge of all is the man now most ready with his judgements; the ill-educated Christian turning gradually into the ill-tempered agnostic, entangled in the end of a feud of which he never understood the beginning, blighted with a sort of hereditary boredom with he knows not what, and already weary of hearing what he has never heard&quot;Throughout the work, Mill's passions and prejudices skew his arguments. It is a fascinating display of intellectual agility, to watch him extolling freedom while restraining it; to see him preach tolerance, and even go so far as to tolerate intolerance. Note that this last feat reminds me of the Kobyashi Maru Strategy - win the unwinnable game by changing the rules. The typical cultural relativist will divide by zero when approached with the self-contradiction of the tolerant society. Mill side-steps the issue and goes along his merry way, proclaiming not a full page later that &quot;there is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides.&quot; It's refreshing to hear a champion of responsible liberty who's ready to practice coercion.Ultimately, Mill produces a monumental work that speaks volumes about more than its subject. His observations are supremely valuable, even when they are irrational, but most of the time he manages to define a system in which the interests of the state and the interests of the individual are balanced to his particular tastes.As a final note, unlike the introduction for Clausewitz' On War (another Penguin Classic), the Introduction here has value. Gertrude Himmelfarb thoroughly ties together Mill, his physical and intellectual parents, Mill's wife, his society, and peers, and manages to wrap the whole thing up in 42 pages."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This Kindle book was clearly created from a text file and little, if any, editing or formatting was done for the Kindle.Paragraphs are fixed width, so unless you size your screen to the paragraphs, you will have lines breaking all over the place.

Mill explains his vision on the \`Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen' adopted by the National Constituent Assembly in Paris in August 1789 on a proposition by the marquis de La Fayette.The individual (liberty, sovereignty, responsibility)The individual is sovereign over his body and mind. His liberty concerns thought, opinion, sentiment, taste, pursuit and combination (freedom to unite and to trade).The limit to his liberty is based on one very simple principle: the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others.He has also responsibilities: it is a moral crime to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its body, but instruction and training for its mind.SocietySociety has jurisdiction over any part of a person\`s conduct which affects prejudicially the interests of others. Also, everyone who receives protection of society owns a return for the benefit (e.g., bearing one's share in defending one's country).But, the (majority of) people or the government has no right whatsoever to control the expression of opinion (media). Any doctrine, however immoral, has the fullest liberty to be professed or discussed.A culture without freedom never makes a liberal mind. A genius can only breed in an atmosphere of freedom.Philosophy (utilitarianism), religionJ. S. Mill regards utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions, but utility in the largest sense, grounded on permanent interest of man as a progressive being.For J. S.

Mill is a staunch defender of free trade. For reasons of efficacy, producers, sellers and buyers should be completely left free. Restrictions on trade (also of opium) are indeed restraints; and all restraint is an evil.We saw, lately, the havoc tree trade could inflict on the world economy.

This is probably now his most famous work, and it is very easy to see why; his argument is not only compelling philosophically but widely applicable and, at about 140 pages, easily read by nearly all. Everyone from pure philosophers to political theorists to practical politicians to general readers can find something to like and learn."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"\\"On Liberty\\", by John Stuart Mill is one of the most important works in political philosophy. Many of Mills' words have passed into common usage in the years since the book was published in 1859. To quote one famous example: \\"Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\"Mill writes in a florid, orotund style that often defies the rapid reader. One frequently has to plod through an over-punctuated verbal and syntactic thicket twice or thrice in order to extract the meaning of a passage. In this respect, Mill was perhaps no worse than other philosophical writers of his day - or indeed of any day.However \\"On Liberty\\" is definitely worth persevering with; not only for its exposition of the subject, but also for some wonderful passages of writing. Mill has a gift for simple exposition of complex philosophical questions.Liberty is always under threat, even in countries perhaps best known for valuing and promoting individual liberty - at least in the rhetoric of political leaders, if not in their practice. That might sound incredible, but one has only to reflect on the encroachments on liberty occasioned by the \\"war on terror\\" and the general support of the majority for such encroachments. In this case both governments and governed conspire to deny others liberty; the former by diktat, demagoguery and secrecy and the latter by strident bigotry.But, if I might be permitted a facetious remark, perhaps those countries have taken Mill too much to heart where he asserts that \\"despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided that the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"Such a patronising, indeed ignorant, view is repugnant to libertarians today, but it was a commonplace view among officials and churchmen in the high noon of the British Empire. But lest we feel too smug about the superiority of our own age, I will observe that we can see echoes of similar odious attitudes today in foreign policy, and the same will no doubt be true of future dominant powers yet to come onto the world stage.However, to be fair to Mill, his passing comment on \\"barbarians\\" is only one very minor part of this great book. More to the point, he asserts strongly in the book that views which are considered to be settled truth in one era may often be rejected in another. He goes on to say that conventional wisdom should always be rigorously tested and not merely assumed to be true on the authority of others.There are also large parts of the world where freedom of expression, and indeed freedom of thought, are suppressed. It is to be greatly hoped that \\"On Liberty\\" will one day be as influential there as it has been elsewhere. Mill himself states eloquently (but perhaps optimistically) that while the truth may be suppressed many times, it will ultimately prevail.After an introductory Chapter, Mill discusses liberty under four broad Chapters that I will touch on briefly below.In the Chapter on liberty of thought and expression, Mill has a swipe at the Christian faith. Some believers may be offended by this discussion, but why should they? The truth should be able to withstand the assaults of opposing views - indeed (as Mill says) it should welcome contrary views both as a means of strengthening the truth, and as a means of rooting out error.Moreover, Mill was writing in the middle of the 19th century, just before the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution, at a time when Christianity in England enjoyed many advantages and official protections. He quotes the example of a man who went to prison for writing an anti-Christian sentiment on a gate - an exemplary message to others who might be tempted to express their true thoughts.In the Chapter on individuality Mill maintains that liberty of thought and expression must necessarily lead to the desirability of people living as they choose, providing that they do not infringe the liberty or well-being of others. However, the arguments in this chapter are less well-presented than in the former chapter. Mill also makes an assertion that most people would reject today: \\"No government by a democracy.....ever did, or could, rise above mediocrity.\\" However it is important to remember that Mill wrote shortly after the extension of the voting franchise in Great Britain, when fears about democratic government were widely discussed, since experience of democratic government in modern industrial societies was quite limited at that time.In the Chapter on the limits to the authority of society over the individual, Mill makes the point that while the individual is sovereign over himself, the society in which he lives and from which he derives protection and other benefits also has rights over the individual. The individual is not accountable to society for his actions if they affect him alone; but as soon as one person's conduct adversely affects the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it.The wide-ranging implications of this principle are discussed comprehensively and lucidly - with good reason, because the allocation of rights and responsibilities between the individual and society is the most important business of coherent groups of human beings.In the final chapter, Mill discusses the practical application of his ideas, accepting that this is not always an easy matter."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In many ways, one is tempted to think that there is no such thing as liberalism alive in America today. It would do many well to read the work of the Englishman Mill in order to understand much of what is called both \\"liberalism\\" as well as \\"individual liberty.\\" In addition, one of the growing issues of the contemporary political landscape in America is a polarization which is wholly unnecessary when analysis is applied the current plane of consideration. The reason for this conspicuous lack of reason for polarization is made obviously clear when one reads a work on liberal thought like that of Mill's. For Mill, individual liberty is a question both of social and political proportions, demanding a lack of interference by both government and social pressures. Additionally, he is keen in his analysis of the need for humility when it comes to humanity's apprehension of the Truth, thus necessitating free speech as a vehicle for the continual realization of those parts of the Truth which man so often forgets because of personal bias.However, the analysis is weak insofar as it also denies the need for structures to educate humanity in a fallen world. His criteria for legal and social sanctions does overlook the necessity to draw on tradition to properly shape those in the world (while maintaining individual dignity). While he acknowledges that it would be preposterous to deny the necessity of interrelationships and sharing of experience, Mill remains somewhat weak on the necessity of tradition and community as related to individual liberty. However, on the whole, the work presents a decent overview of the need to acknowledge individual dignity through the liberty of the individual. Indeed, all communal criticisms aside, On Liberty does indeed serve as a corrective against crass traditionalism which propagates itself without true individual consent and embrace. Therefore, even in its weakness, it remains strong as a key text on the primacy of the human individual as the recipient and follower of the Truth. In a day when liberty is shouted by groups who have no interest in talking to each other, such a small text would do well to make all groups realize that our American (and indeed Western) goals aren't that different, that we are united in trying to express human dignity through the individuals."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Unlike the clueless and completely contradictory rantings of &quot;white_anglo_saxon_muslim&quot;, this book is entirely in favour of the freedom of the individual - personal freedoms that are entirely opposed to the thoughts of socialism and the notion of a government or body removing those freedoms in favour of a &quot;greater good&quot;.This book argues that it is not the role of anyone else to decide what is best for any one person, but that person's decision. Liberty - this book is ON LIBERTY.Anyone who thinks this book is in favour of socialism is completely misguided and confused."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"It is surprising to me how many people assume that \`On Liberty' was written before or during the American Revolution - Mill was certainly influenced by the spirit of American liberty, which was variously romanticised and adapted in Britain and Europe during the nineteenth century. Published in 1859, \`On Liberty' is one of the primary political texts of the nineteenth century; perhaps only the writings of Marx had a similar impact, and of the two, in today's world, Mill's philosophy seems the one that is triumphant.One of the interesting ideas behind \`On Liberty' is that this may in fact be more the inspiration of Harriet Taylor (later Mrs. J.S. Mill) than of Mill himself; Taylor wrote an essay on Toleration, most likely in 1832, but it remained unpublished until after her death. F.A. Hayek (free-market economist and philosopher) noticed this connection. Whether this was the direct inspiration or not, the principles are similar, and the Mills were rather united in their views about liberty.\`On Liberty' is more of an extended essay than a book - it isn't very long (104 pages of the text in the Norton Critical Edition, edited by David Spitz). It relates as a political piece to his general Utilitarianism and political reform ideology. A laissez faire capitalist in political economy, his writing has been described as \`improved Adam Smith' and \`popularised Ricardo'. Perhaps it is in part the brevity of \`On Liberty' that gives it an enduring quality.There are five primary sections to the text. The introduction sets the stage philosophically and historically. He equates the histories of classical civilisations (Greece and Rome) with his contemporary England, stating that the struggle between liberty and authority is ever present and a primary feature of society. He does not hold with unbridled or unfettered democracy, either (contrary to some popular readings of his text) - he warns that the tyranny of the majority can be just as dangerous and damaging toward a society as any individual or oligarchic despotism. Mill looks for a liberty that permits individualism; thus, while democracy is an important feature for Mill, there must be a system of checks and balances that ensures individual liberties over and against this kind of system. All of these elements receive further development in subsequent sections.The second section of the text is \`Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion'. Freedom of speech and expression is an important aspect here. Mill presents a somewhat radical proposition that even should the government and the people be in complete agreement with regard to coercive action, it would still be an illegitimate power. This is an important consideration in today's world, as governments and people contemplate the curtailment of civil liberties in favour of increased security needs. The possibility of fallibility, according to Mill, makes the power illegitimate, and (again according to Mill) it doesn't matter if it affects many or only a few, people today or posterity. It is still wrong. Mill develops this argument largely by using the history of religious ideas and religious institutions, in addition to the political (since the two were so often inter-related).The third section is perhaps the best known and most quoted, \`Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being'. It is perhaps a natural consequence of Enlightenment thinking that individuality over communal and corporate identity would dominate. Our world today goes back and forth between individual and communal identities (nationality, regionality, employment, church affiliation, school affiliation, sports teams, etc.). Mill's ideas of individual are very modern, quite at home with the ideas of modern political and civil individuality, with all of the responsibilities.Mill states, \`No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions.' He recognises the increased limitations on individual liberty given that we do live in communal settings, but this does not hinder the idea of individuality and individual liberty, particularly as it pertains to thoughts and speech. Mill explores various ideas of personal identity and action (medieval, Calvinist, etc.) to come up with an idea of individuality that is rather modern; of course, this is political personhood that pre-dates the advent of psychology/psychoanalytic theory that will give rise to a lot more confusion for the role of identity and personhood in society.The fourth primary section looks theoretically at the individual in community, \`Of the Limits to the Authority of Society Over the Individual'; the final section looks at specific applications. Mill discounts the idea of social contract while maintain that there is a mutual responsibility between individuals and community. Mill looks at the Temperance movements and laws as an example of bad laws (not only from the aspect of curtailment of liberty, but also for impractical aspects of enforcement); in similar examples, Mill looks at the role of society in regulating the life of the individual, calling on good government to always err on the side of the individual.Mill puts it very directly -- Individuals are accountable only to themselves, unless their actions concern the interests of society at large. Few in the Western world would argue with this today; however, we still live in a world where \`thought police' are feared, and \`political correctness' is debated as appropriate or not with regard to individual liberties.Mill wrote extensively beyond this text, in areas of philosophy (logic, religion, ethics). The particular text I use here, the Norton Critical Edition, has a good annotated text of \`On Liberty', a copy of Harriet Taylor's essay, \`On Tolerance', and a criticism section, including five essays written against Mill's ideas and constructions, and four essays in favour. There is also a useful bibliography and index.This should probably be required reading in civics classes, if not in the pre-university years for students, then certainly in the early university years."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"J.S. Mill has written the best promulgation of classical liberalism in his book &quot;On Liberty&quot; (OL). Although a socialist himself, many of the ideas in OL are actually tenets of modern libertarianism (also called classical liberalism). Mill states that the only reason that force can be used on any man is to prevent harm to others. I consider &quot;focre&quot; to be either social or economic. Mill saw it as only social, which explains his socialism.Not to detract from Mill or OL, the book is a resounding defense of civil-liberties. OL completes modern democratic theory as promulgated by John Locke in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government.&quot; While Locke argues for some kind of democracy reminiscent of Athens, Mill qualifies Locke's point by protecting the minority from the majority. This book should be read by Americans who want to know more about freedom, and by our elected officials.Sadly, it's our elected oficials who probably won't get it."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Few works argue as forcefully and eloquently for individual liberty as this one book. Written by one of England's greatest humanitarians, philosophers, and social scientists, this is one of the great classics in Western political philosophy. This book uses plain reason, clear logic, and objective reasoning to argue that the freedom of speech and its related freedoms such as freedom of assembly, press, petition, and religion, are ultimately beneficial to not only the individual, but to society as well. The latter argument goes as such; society is composed of individuals. Hence the knowledge and wisdom of a society is composed of the contributions of every individual. In order for a society to determine the truth, or best opinions on any particular topic, it must be allowed to see/hear all the opinions possible, which is only possible if everyone is allowed to voice their opinion.This reviewer read this book in high school, and was quite impressed with it back then. It is understandable by most high school seniors. This book should be required reading for all human beings."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This book may appear without reserves and by own right - next to Milton \` s Aeropagitica\\", Locke ' s \\"Essay about the Civil Government\\", Rousseau \`s Social Contract\\" in the enviable gallery of works of political combat that, still determine capital influence on the mankind. This is a vibrant and passionate defense about the thinking and expression liberties, a vehement apology of the tolerance and respect beliefs or dissident minorities, a fearless recovery around the human spontaneity and singularity against the exerted oppression by authorities, costumes or public opinion.Under the lucid perspective of the elapsed years, this was a visionary text whose importance perhaps still has not been evaluated in all its wholeness."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"What J.S Mill proposes in \\"On Liberty\\" is still now convincing and interesting and I believe it should draw more attention than is the case today. True, Mill's ideas are not easily applicable to practical problems and his arguments are sometimes so defective as to be justifiably called \\"fallacies,\\" but still his fundamental principle is noteworthy and defensible: You can think, speak and do, as you like, unless you do any harm to others. Mill claims that this freedom, rather than spoiling our society, contributes to the progress of human beings in the long run, and this in the sense that so long as we humans do not achieve absolute infallibility, it is nothing other than human diversity that prevents us from falling into limited attitudes and courting fatal consequences. I agree from the bottom of my heart with this idea of his, and hope more attention will be paid to the book and its philosophy."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"A very definite view of legal rights, in that no interference from government should be permitted, save for when the actions of one harm others. This, of course, brings in questions about what constitutes 'harm', but all in all, a forceful argument for absolute free speech, unhampered by any law. I think this is interesting given the later restrictions placed on free speech. I was also interested to see how this book is rated on the high end of the 'difficult to read' scale, because I found Mill easy to follow and quite straightforward."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Have you ever tried to read that fun twentieth-century philosophy, especially the Frenchy-continental strain that is so loaded with jargon and neologisms that you feel as if it was deliberately created to make you feel stupid? The alternative is that the arc philosophy from structuralism through postmodernism is obtuse because there is nothing left to say so you have to hide behind \\"Being-in-itself\\" and you have to drink vodka until being becomes nothingness.Mill's masterwork is nothing of the sort. It is a short, structured argument written in defense of a premodern libertarianism as \\"liberty\\". I won't gloss on it too much here, since others more qualified can talk about his ideas. My copy is marked up with individual passages highlighted and !!!ed, but it is not in isolation that these passages have strength. Mill is able to define his conception of Liberty very directly, and he is not utopian since he senses the limits of Liberty as he defines them. These limits necessitate a state structure that in my reading, is incompatible with the modern conception of Libertarianism. The problems were evident 150 years ago, and I read it as more against bureaucracy per se than as against Government as a whole.Overall, readings and interpretations can vary across readers and across time, but this is a very important and interesting book to help build or challenge a world-view."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"An advocate for the development of individuality/ human potentials for social progress, the author believes and emphatically promotes liberty as essential foundation for freedom of conscience, free will as well as diligent exploration of diverse and opposing/contradicting ideas. He warns against mental complacency/laziness/conformity in many forms of public opinions, custom, doctrines and religioius dogmas with underlying notion of infallibility. He calls them \\"despotism\\" that hinders human advancemen and also quotes \\"slumber of a decided opinion\\" as dangers of uncontested ideas. Reading intoductory biography also helps to understand the personal background that influenced his political philosophy. His beliefs in liberty of one's actions are qualified in the sense and context of individual responsibility for self and \\"others\\", for example, he calls it \\"moral crime\\" against the offspring and society to \\"bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able to\\" provide education. In our current culture where McDonald (not individuals or parents) is blamed for obesity and some people claim entitlement about having multiple children even when they are being born into an environment that will most likely cause suffering and cycling through welfare system, John Stuart Mill's ideas of responsible liberty sadly cause feelings of disorientation. A psychologist once said, (perhaps, Rollo May?) we have to choose between \\"neurotic necessity and responsible freedom\\" This was a great read."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force until 1871 in his native country. As for primitive societies we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the growing restrictions on freedom in many Western nations this is a book well worth reading again. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This is Mill's statement of the ' one very simple principle' he wished to establish in ' On Liberty' \\" The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion or control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. The principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively , in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do, or forebear because it will be better for him to do,because it will make him happier, because , in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise or even right... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society,is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself , his idnependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.This is in a nutshell the creed of Mill's faith in ' On Liberty ' Gertrude Himmelfarb in her brilliant introduction explains how that faith developed in part out of the personal situation in which Mill found himself after years of close friendship with the - then married Harriet Taylor after her husband died, became his wife. One great controversy relates to the vast credit Mill gave her with being a full partner in every way in creating this work. The social isolation both suffered as a result of their relationship is an important element in Mill's fierce defence of the individual's right to be free of social coercion, and opinion. Another central element in the development of Mill's thought is his reaction to the Utilitarianism his father John Mill and Jeremy Bentham instilled in Mill from childhood. 'The greatest happiness for the greatest number principal' is rejected by Mill as first basis for social action. Mill in effect says that it is not society's business to be a Grand Inquisitor and bring it bread and circuses to make it happy. Happiness is not the first principle any longer in Mill's thought rather individual liberty is. The sole curb on such individual liberty is when it leads to the harming of others. This faith of Mill can be recognized today as part and parcel of the fundamental ideology of democratic societies.This work is thus one of the fundamental political classics which form the Western political tradition. And it is one of those works which should be part of the curriculum of any true liberal arts education. The question of the excesses of this principle and whether Mill in his thought has provided sufficient check to it by consideration of other human values isa very real and debatable one even today."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In the Introduction to \\"On Liberty,\\" Currin Shields, an English egghead, bemoans the fact that Mill's most \\"famous\\" essay is \\"more talked about than read.\\"I'm surprised it is even talked about, and I am very much NOT surprised that hardly anyone reads it. Mill takes about a hundred and twenty pages to say what could be (and was) summed up in an epigram: People should be free to do whatever they want, as long as it does not harm anyone else.Not only does Mill subject the reader to pages and pages of supererogatory writing, but his prose is the epitome of Victorian verbosity, with more modifiers, clauses, footnotes, and parentheticals than there are alcoholics in Butte, Montana. (And there are a LOT of alcoholics in Butte, Montana.)I guess if you're studying philosophy, you're gonna have to read this thing sooner or later...likewise if you're an autodidact."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This book represents the beginning of the peversion of classical liberalism (Algernon Sidney, John Trenchard, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry) into the tyranny of modern day liberalism (socialism). Mill is the originator of the thoughtless confounding of liberal and socialist ideas that led to the decline of the living standards of the English people. Mill is the great advocate of Socialism. All the arguments that could be expounded in favour of socialism are expounded here. Marx, Lasalle and Engels are scarcely of importance. The blood of 100 million ultimately dripped from his pen (see the black book of communism). Liberty means freedom from taxes, too many laws and respect for property rights not the right to welfare or necessarily to vote. It is no surprise to see neo-con Himmelfarb enthusing over this book considering the Kristol family are fans of the tyrant Trotsky.Of course as an agnostic he advocates that socially, individuals should be privately able to do whatever they like. Unfortunately in order for a society to be free from too many laws the people must abide by unwritten laws and that means the laws of the Abrahamic God. If a village does not want to tolerate homosexuals then they should be free not to and be able to drive them out, it's called the social contract. As George Washington wisely put it 'in order to be a truly free people,we must be a religious people'. J.S. Mill, not a very good thinker and an appalling one on the nature of liberty."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Mill's book, On Liberty, tries to answer the question of what is the legitimate power that government can exercise over the individual . His main argument regarding personal liberty is the harm principle, meaning as long as the individual's actions do not harm other individuals, they shouldn't be restricted from that action. However, Mill doesn't only focus on the philosophical aspect of the role government should have in the individual life, but he also tries to answer more specific issues such as government policies concerning drugs, gambling, prostitution, public education versus private education, the importance of freedom of speech and more. If you're interested in such questions, this book is for you."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"As stated by Mill the topic of On Liberty is the role society should take in interfering with the liberty of an individual, that is, the amount of power that society may legitimately exercise over its people.The sphere of Mill's inquiry is the system of a democracy, where the main danger to individual liberty is that of the \\"tyranny of the majority,\\" in which minorities are subjected to the whims of the majority such that the \\"weaker members of the community\\" are \\"preyed upon by innumerable vultures.\\" Mill's argument is that \\"self-government\\" is not \\"the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest.\\"Mill's main thesis is that society and the governing bodies have no right to interfere with the liberty of thought, action or individuality in any person save when those liberties may cause harm to others; that \\"over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\" This is to say that society is unable able to interfere with individuals unless they're harming somebody, not including themselves - a person has every right to do harm to themselves and society may not intervene simply for the good of the individual.Apart from this, Mill also believes that keeping away the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" is good not only for the individuals and the minorities, but for society itself as well; that the argumentation/discussion which leads from freedom of thought is pivotal in the development of the society and truth. It is only in this that societies can avoid stagnation and people can truly learn; they must be able to see both sides of the argument (from people who truly believe them) and the ideas must be allowed to clash, thus, \\"genius can only breathe freely in an atmosphere of freedom.\\"In arguing for freedom of expression Mill argues that because the opinions of the individual may be true (or at least contain some portion of truth) and because human fallibility makes it so there are none fit to judge whether the opinion is true anyway, full freedom must be granted; not only this, but because there are none fit to judge, [according to Mill] there is no absolute certainty.This is all to lead into a sort of Hegelian system which Mill puts forth, noting that both sides of any argument generally only contain a portion of the truth and that it is only by bringing these two ideas together that the full truth can be found; a balance must be found between the ideas. The ideas must clash and in this clashing the synthesis between them will be found.Overall Mill's text is a good read even for people today. The ideas being presented are just as relevant now as they were during Mill's time, such the fact that the voice of third parties is all but crushed in the US's two party system or the discussions over gay marriage, abortion, or even something as small as free speech zones on college campuses. All of these feed back into the issue being discussed by Mill, that is, how much power society should be able to wield over its members and just what is the nature and extent of our liberty.Memorable Quotes:-\\"The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people.\\"-\\"He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\\"-\\"If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"-\\"What was not wanted was that the rulers should be identified with the people, that their interests and will should be the interest and will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its own will There was no fear of tyrannizing over itself.\\"Specific CriticismsFrom a secular standpoint I'm not sure how much can be critiqued of Mill's ideas. From a Christian standpoint there are two chief issues which may be taken.The first issue that may be taken is with the idea that \`over himself the individual is sovereign.' This is exactly the mindset which Scripture rails against and sets up as the original sin, to think that we are our own sovereigns, to usurp the sovereignty of God over his creations.The second issue which may be taken is with lack of any solid judge for truth. Simply put, the Christian would argue that God is the standard against which we measure truth, and due to his immutability he stands as a very good standard by which to judge. There is still the factor of fallibility which Mill notes, however this is not to say that truth cannot be discovered or that no statements can be set as entirely false.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Good and Fast . ... ....... ... .. ..... ........ ...... ....... .. ....... .... .... .. ...... ... ....."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This is the only version of &#34;On Liberty&#34; that I own.

While the Russians were carrying out pogroms against Jews because of their intolerance, Mill was able to provide an intellectual defense for tolerating the emerging Latter Day Saints (despite his obvious dislike for them). The beauty of this book is that the arguments are still relevant and directly applicable to the issues. Whereas Marx required armies of Soviet intellectuals in order to stay relevant, you can pick up On Liberty and fully appreciate the arguments. While it can be tempting to accept some infringements on liberty, I think it's necessary to have a philosophical framework through which to understand what limitations on liberty are justifiable and which aren't.Jorge"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"When J. S. Mill published ON LIBERTY in 1859, he was then but the latest in a very long line of liberal theorists that stretched back to Plato and continued intermittenly for the next two millennia. These theorists as did Mill attempted to ascertain what if any was that fine line between the rights of the individual to live unimpeded from the caprices of a ruling state and the duty of that state to maintain the civil order necessary for those rights to exist. That we today still have not defined this line is a testimony to the never ending struggle of thinkers like Mill to present arguments of which each succeeding generation must be made aware.From the day it first appeared in print, readers have been entranced by the clarion call for unrestrained liberty. Mill wrote ON LIBERTY in such a manner that to argue against it suggests that to do so renders one as either a tyrant or a boor. Further, those who question Mill must walk a fine line between not supporting the very tyrannical state against which Mill rails and carrying out the the logical conclusion of accepting his definition of liberty at face value. I question Mill's underlying if unnoticed logic even as I applaud his cheerleading.Mill sees society as a perpetual repressor of the liberty of its citizens. For him, liberty consists of the ability to think and do as one pleases. Barring certain exceptions this liberty is the very foundation of any society that dares to call itself free. Society, then, must bend over backwards to ensure that all possess it. The chief stumbling block in this quest lies less in the individuating traits of people and more in the the tendency of rulers to rely on the heavy hand of custom to maintain its own existence even at the cost of denying liberty to their subjects.Mill sees \\"custom\\" as a dirty word that is all that is wrong with society. Nowhere does he concern himself with any positive connotations. He limits its use only to describe that which has the potential to stamp out every last smidgeon of creativity that might otherwise emerge. He fears that it will be the ruled, and not the rulers, who wish to crush dissent. To protect individuals from custom, Mill states that only those who are daring enough to defy society may do so. He calls such dissenters as \\"eccentrics.\\" For him, it is a term of praise that brings to mind heirs of a very long line of liberal thought from ancient Greek days. Just as Mill ignores the reality that custom has two divergent senses so does he similarly ignore the same about eccentrics. Clearly, if history proves anything, it is that those who have differed in ways that are bestial are about as numerous as those that are beneficial. When Mill champions the absolute right of eccentrics to challenge custom, he opens the door to tear down the bonds of society and not erect anything of a compensatory nature. When he argues that liberty must not be used to harm others, he is using a red herring to divert attention from the grim realization that to be different means far more than than saying so."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) was interested in the nature of Civil Liberty, and the limits to the power that a Government can legitimately exercise upon its citizens. He believed that some worrying tendencies could be observed in the England society of his time, and tried to warn others about them.The author basically explains his ideas regarding the preservation of individual liberties, not only due to the fact that they are rights owed to everyone, but also because they benefit society as a whole.For example, when he says that liberty of thought and of discussion must be preserved, he tells us that &quot;Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument: but fact and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it&quot;. How can mistaken beliefs or actions be proven wrong, if dissent is forbidden?. The loss for society is clear: &quot;If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error&quot;.In order to preserve the liberties included in the concept of Civil Liberty, the author points out that there must be limits to the action of the Government. He says that &quot;The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others&quot;. Any other reason is simply not good enough. Thus, Stuart Mill highlights the rights of the individual, but also the limit to those rights: the well-being of others.&quot;On Liberty&quot; is not too long, and I think you are highly likely to enjoy it, if you can get past the first few pages. The problem is that even though the ideas in this book are quite modern, the language is somehow dated. But then, we must remember that &quot;On Liberty&quot; was written a long time ago...Notwithstanding that, do your best to read the first pages, and you will realize that after a while it will be much easier. This book is well-worth the effort you need to make at the beginning, because it is even more relevant today than when it was first published, in 1859.Are individual rights important?. Why?. Do they have a limit?. You will found the answer for these questions, and much more, in &quot;On Liberty&quot;. What else can I say?. I believe this is a book that will help you to reflect on many important issues... I certainly can't think of a better reason to read it.

However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the alleged growing restrictions on freedom in many democratic countries this is a book well worth reading. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In his classic essay \\"On Liberty\\", John Stuart Mill deals with the issue of \\"civil liberties\\" -not the metaphysical issue of \\"free will\\". While most attacks on civil liberties have historically occurred from the right within the context of a tyrannical or an aristocratic rule, Mill deals with threats against liberty from within the institutions of democracy itself. The issue is especially relevant at a time when widespread domestic wiretapping and surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.The aim of early libertarians was to limit the power of the ruler over those governed; Mill, however, identifies a need to limit the power of elected governments and officials as well. Mill is not merely addressing the issue of \\"who should rule?\\", he seeks to establish limits on the power that government may exercise over minorities and individuals. His work is more relevant now than ever.While \\"government of the people\\" is an ideal to be aspired to, Mill argues that such an ideal is often not the case in fact. He argues that those exerting the power of the government -elected officials, bureaucrats, the judiciary -often develop their own interests. They are sometimes influenced by those constituencies in ways that are at odds with the interests and liberties of individuals or other groups.Mill makes no distinction between a tyranny of one and a tyranny of many. A tyrannical majority running roughshod over the rights of individuals and minorities is no less a tyrant because it is a majority, because it is elected, or because it is elected by a majority.While society may not tolerate criminal behavior, for example, society may not legitimately interfere with or suppress all non-conforming behaviors indiscriminately or because a majority may not approve. What then are the powers that society may legitimately exercise over the individual? Mill answers:\\"The only purpose for which power can be rightly exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\\"-J.S. Mill, On LibertyJames Madison -called the \\"Father of the Constitution\\" -may have anticipated Mill's ideas in his draft of the Bill of Rights -the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Implicit in the Bill of Rights is the recognition that the power of the state is a blunt instrument. Abused, it can oppress and repress individuals and minority groups alike. The Bill of Rights addresses this issue by guaranteeing \\"due process of law\\", limiting state power over individuals and groups, guaranteeing that groups and individuals may speak freely, worship freely.The Fourth Amendment specifically is a promise that our government made to us in its very founding:\\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\"-Fourth Amendment, Bill of Rights, U.S. ConstitutionLet's make something abundantly clear: there are no \\"inherent powers\\", \\"Implicit\\" authorizations\\" that would, in any way, overturn, limit, or repeal the Fourth Amendment. Many politicians are not only wrong about that, they may have deliberately lied about it. Moreover, Congress may not overrule the Fourth Amendment with statutory law. Constitutional Law is supreme and provisions in the Bill of Right are valid until amended as set out in the Constitution itself. Widespread domestic surveillance is illegal whatever is done by Congress ex post facto -and until the Constitution is amended, it will remain illegal. At last, ex post facto laws, themselves, are expressly forbidden by the Constitution.Mill is all the more remarkable for his insight into issues that remain contemporary. In every literate criticism of \\"special interest groups\\", PAC's, the gun lobby, the tobacco lobby, the Military/Industrial Complex, one sees the lasting influence of John Mill.On Liberty is essential reading for anyone interested in law, the principles of government, political science, political philosophy, indeed, freedom itself. It is also essential reading for anyone interested in learning about the intellectual underpinnings of Anglo-American civil liberties."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This edition is subtitled \\"Optimized for Kindle\\". I was therefore quite surprised that it lacked a table of contents. What does \\"optimized\\" mean in this context?"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This book deserves to be studied closely; I cannot praise too highly the man or his work. As Mill writes in his AUTOBIOGRAPHY, his education under his philosopher father James was perhaps the most tortuous experience imaginable for a young child, leaving the adolescent John with the impression that he was something of a facsimile of his father. Nevertheless, after much difficulty in assimilating what he was taught and defining who he was, the adult Mill respectfully stepped out from under his father's shadow and went on to make staggering intellectual contributions of his own. In this book, ON LIBERTY, Mill tackles the problem of \\"the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual.\\" With some reflection, it can be seen how important this question is, for its implications touch every part of our social and private lives. Unfortunately, few recognize its importance, and the question is more often decided by unthinking custom or self-interest than reason. With scrupulous rigor, and impeccable intellectual honesty, Mill asserts the absolute necessity of dissenting opinions, of diversity in all things, and the dangers of concentrated power, be it in the form of a dictator or a democratic majority. The problems treated in this short book are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Perennial political issues such as education reform, gun control, abortion, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly; the book abounds with other, more personal, lessons on life as well, not the least of which was later encapsulated by Wittgenstein as: \\"If you want to improve the world, improve yourself.\\""},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In On Liberty, Mill attempts to define when the authority of society can rightly limit individuality and the &quot;sovereignty of the individual over himself.&quot; He writes that people are not accountable to society for actions that only concern themselves. The only means society has to express disapproval of such actions is through &quot;advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people if thought necessary by them for their own good.&quot; He also writes that the individual is accountable for actions that hurt others, and society can punish a person socially or legally as is deemed necessary for such actions. Mill observes, though, that sometimes when an action causes harm to others, such as when a person succeeds in a competitive job market, the general social good is positive, and there is no right to punish people for the harm caused. Throughout On Liberty, Mill's argument proceeds with a discussion of the appropriate level of authority that society should have over the individual, along with particular examples and applications of the theory, to clarify the meaning of his claims. The examples are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Continuing political issues such as education reform, gun control, alcohol, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly. Mill was ahead of his time. His book was insightful, thought-provoking and ahead of its time. The questions and viewpoints Mill argued are the same issues in political debates today. When reading On Liberty, I found myself reading the same paragraphs over again to understand his main issues and points. Also, in parts of the reading Mill never really comes across and answers his own questions he argued, but his ideas and arguments leave the reader thinking."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"America's defense department should take some of the billions spent on the stealth bomber or the B1 and spend it to make Arabic and Farsi translations of this book in the hundreds of thousands. We could pack the bomb bays of a squadron of stealth bombers with the translations and carpet the cities of Muslim countries with this treatise on freedom. This is The Book, folks. You cannot read this little book without it changing your life. It is an extended argument about freedom, about true morality, about freeing your mind, about untrammeling the possibility of peace and prosperity in the world. This is the book that lays out the path for treating other human beings with respect and opening the way toward progress in any and all societies. For the discussion of the \\"harm to others\\" principle alone, this book merits the world's attention and praise.Perhaps the most famous aspect of Mill's extended argument about liberty is his discussion of the \\"tyranny of the majority.\\" His argument grows from the long history of religious persecution suffered throughout Europe that led to book bans, bigotry, and even torture and burning at the stake for people who did not conform to the majority superstition, namely the dominant form of Christianity wherever one lived. Mill lived in a time when even the staid and relatively moderate views of the English Church forced people to conform their lives or face public humiliation and financial ruin, and sometimes lynching. The resulting dynamic was that free thought was thus discouraged and progress thwarted. Mill's point is that in such a psychological milieu, people are not mentally free to seek a better way. They are rather trammeled to superstition and the concomitant tyranny of the majority, the majority being emotionally dependent and mentally ham-strung by religion and religious fears and prejudices.America today is witnessing the truth of this dynamic through the virulent and underhanded tactics of the fundamentalist X-tian political right who seek to thwart medical research and impose a legislated theocracy in parts of the country. The effort to put dark-age arguments about \\"intelligent design\\" on a scientific par with evolutionary theory is a perfect and alarming example. Mill's argument in On Liberty was prescient in demonstrating what can happen when people allow religion to influence political life. The brand of literalist religion we see in America has been the bane of societies throughout history and respresents a true pragmatic evil on a scale far worse than any imagined \\"Satanic\\" sinfulness that Christians associate with popular and secular humanism. Fundamentalist religion, especially in the forms of Christian and Muslim extremism, is a societal cancer when viewed through the lense of reason and of Mill's enlightened utilitarianism. No society that allows religion to make in-roads to politics can flourish. Proof is in the failed Middle East, where no country can manage to pull its people out of poverty and squalor in spite of sitting on the world's richest oil reserves. Mill's argument in this small book speaks volumes about why Muslim countries are doomed to failure and why the Christian right in America (the blood cousins of Islamic radicals) represent the biggest and most un-American evil in our country's history. If America represents freedom, there can be no room for the \\"ten commandments\\" in the county court house.Highly recommended as a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"I agree, how hard is it to put a table of contents in, it is very frustrating trying to navigate through this book."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill, author of On Liberty, defines the nature of civil liberty, and most importantly, the harm principl. He aims to give readers a better understanding of the nature and limits of power that can be exercised by society over individuals. The purpose of this book is to inform interested individuals about the rights of individuals and the limitations of the government. This book of philosophy was written almost 150 years ago. By reading the book, the reader is able to apply Mill's message and examples to our lives in America today. The ahead-of-the-times ideas that are in On Liberty can be related to our world because it discusses controversies that are still seen in our courtrooms today. Mill is able to accomplish his purpose because he uses many examples, thoughts, and theories about individual and social rights. He works through each of his ideas, looking at both sides of the issue to enable the reader to make their own informed decision about each matter. This book has a practical meaning because it allows the reader to develop and reason ideas about government power and when that power should be exercised over the people. Unfortunately, this book does have one draw back. Mill was a very educated man and wrote very well for his time. Yet today, our style and writing techniques are not the same as they were in the nineteenth century. This makes On Liberty a difficult book to read. His book is very decriptive, yet his wording is not easily understadable and some paragraphs have to be read two or three times to fully understand what he is writing about. Aside from his writing style, John Stuart Mill has put together an essay full of educated ideas about society and individuals. John Stuart Mill wrote an informative book geared towards an educated audience. He has achieved his purpose for the essay through the use of situations and examples that can be applied to real life cases still today.

Mill's primary concern was to address the potential problem of the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" posed by the emerging democratization of society. His concern was prompted specifically by de Toqueville's account of the USA. Mill is concerned not just with the way government could impose conformity to majority views but also with general social pressures for conformity. In opposition to the dangers of majoritarianism, Mill proposes 2 versions of the Harm principle; the first the basic idea that whatever doesn't cause harm is permitted. The second and more restrictive version emphasizes violation of duties to others. Mill argues his case very well, addressing both general principles and specific problems of contemporary British society. In line with his utilitarian approach, he argues vigorously that human improvement requires the type of freedom and tolerance implied by his Harm Principles. This is also in a real sense the weakness of On Liberty. Mill's version of utilitarianism is not the hedonistic utilitarianism of Bentham and his father, nor preference utilitarianism, but a more vague assertion of what is needed for human progression. Well written, and often quoted, this is one of the accessible major texts in the canon."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"The modern age is a dangerous age, an age in which we might be alienated from that individual independence in work and in mind which defines our humanity. Confronted by this crisis, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill offer the world diverging solutions: annihilate the existing world and march toward communism, or guard against the dangers of the existing world as we further embrace liberal democracy. Despite these divergent paths which arise from differing views on the driving force of history, both systems aim to rescue the supreme interest of our individual humanity-for Marx, this interest lies in reaching absolute prosperity for the material man, and for Mill, it lies in the search for absolute truth for the idealistic man.With its emphasis on individuality and diversity, Mill's theory is in a sense more encompassing than Marx's. Mill's theory, however, is fundamentally flawed in comparison to Marx's because of its ignorance of property as a danger against human liberty.Marx sees in the industrial age the death of the property-less class. This death is brought by the industrial age's five qualities: division of labor, accumulation of capital, competition, financial crisis, and monopoly. In this age, machineries and the division of labor reduce the skillful artisans to the proletariats who merely work on one monotonous element of production. The capitalists who own the machines enlarge their capital by exploiting the proletariat's labor, leaving them only with enough to eat. Competition forces capitalists to lower prices, but this is good only until each factory produces more than demanded and a financial crisis emerges. The small capitalists are reduced to the property-less as millions of workers are swept into deeper hell. Only the biggest capitalist survives, and he becomes the monopolist who can lower wages and raise prices at whim, destroying the lives of all. (Part 1, Bourgeois and Proletarians, Manifesto of the Communist Party)The above scenario is unavoidable because the accumulation of more capital is the only end of capital. If the capitalist stops investing capital for gains he ceases to be a capitalist, and becomes a mere consumer of goods, enjoying the fruits of old exploitations. Tragically, capital can only increase when it exploits the difference of what labor costs and labor produces, as Marx writes,\\"The modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.\\" (Marx p484)The rich man sitting in his patio who has inherited a million pound and who lets others manage his money has not done anything to deserve profits, indeed, since he himself did not work, his profits must come from the works of others who he exploits. In the capitalistic system, there exists no pity, only keen self-interest, \\"all are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use...\\" (Marx p479)The workers might die, but before their body ceases to be exploited, their mind is already died-capitalism has alienated them from their humanity which is defined by their creative productivity. This alienation from our humanity was Marx's greatest worry. Animals make nests and produce goods just as we do, however, as Marx writes,\\"...a bee would put many a human architect to shame by the construction of its honeycomb cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax... Man not only effects a change of form in the materials of nature; he also realizes his own purpose in those materials.\\" (Chapter 7, Das Kapital)In order to freely produce as the creativity of his mind directs him and as his productive ability allows, the material man must be endowed with control over the means of production. In the world of private property, however, the workers have turned from the master of production to the slave of the machine-they are reduced to programmed animals that produce merely for the end of survival.The proletariat can only reassert his humanity by violent overthrowing the capitalists and through the \\"abolition of private property\\" (Marx p484). Once in communism, the workers will own the means of production and enjoy the full produces of their labor. He will be motivated to constantly transform the world into a more prosperous kingdom. As Marx writes, \\"In communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\\" (Marx p485) The abundance of material goods will allow man to work not for survival, but for his own enjoyment. In this society, there will be no family and nor religion, everything is made for the love of all and enjoyed by all. Any vestiges of private interest would result in the return to capitalism with all its evils.To Mill, the modern life is also threatening because the voice of the majority might alienate men from their individuality. The differentiation of society is essential for the vitality of the society, and this vitality empowers men on their search for truth.Political debates, according to Mill, have been about striking the balance between the ruler and ruled. It is necessary for the ruled to have a ruler in order to preserve peace and law, yet the elected or unelected ruler's power must be restrained so that he does not abuse it against the ruled. In contrast to Marx's class struggle, this \\"struggle between liberty and authority\\" (p59) from Mill is more amiable. In the current era of democratic nations, however, since the ruled are also the rulers, the opposition no longer exists. People feel that all actions taken by the people's government will be good for the people, and hence they lose the old vigilance against the invasion of public power into their private spheres. The voice of the majority becomes the equivalent of the truth and justice.Mill is worried that this majority voice will obstruct man's search for truth, the attaining of which is the goal of life. Truth is not reached once and then preserved for eternity, it is an organic being with a thousand facets whose survival requires continued inputs of each person's active mind. This truth is the individual treasure of each being, fitting perfectly to his taste and preferences; yet it is also a truth for the whole community, since it is only through the struggles of different truths that humanity as a whole reaches a higher truth-a higher level for the activation of the mind. As Mill writes, \\"There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths and point out when what were once truths are true no longer\\" (p71) If the majority religion is the only religion and taste the only taste, then people will no longer think but simply follow; society will be bogged into the swamp of mediocrity with a mind that is dead. Marx also feared the death of the mind, the mind of the creative worker. Despite the differences, both philosophers are concerned about the destruction of man's defining qualities.To counter this, Mill proclaims that the only defense for \\"interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" (p68). The government must be restrained in the sphere of public affairs, and individuals shall live as free as they want to following their individual passions.Marx and Mill both want to regain humanity. In one case, the enemy is the benumbing effects of majority rule, and man's mind for truth is debased forever into mediocrity, in the other case, the enemy comes from the benumbing effects of subjugation to the machine, and the man is turned from the master of production into the slaves of capital.The core difference between the two theories in practical operation arises from their different views on individuality (both systems serve individuals as their ends, however, individuality, allowing people to be different, are treated differently). For Mill, we must preserve individuality to bring truth (Chapter 3, On Liberty), but for Marx, the destruction of private property is the only task. The communistic society will be a union in which man can \\"...hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner...\\" (The German Ideology). This free life of a communist in communism is all good until one day the comrade does not want to be a communist anymore-but he must be one, there is no choice. In Communism, one does not have the individual liberty to have families, nor try to build a little store of private wealth.On the other side, if someone in Mill's world decides to be a communist, he has the full right to do so. He can even segregate himself away with his friends and enjoy the life of a commune. In another word, Marxism can not destroy Mill's democracy-it will just be one of the many ways of thinking allowed by the system-but Mill's cry for diversity will destroy Marx's world within a second.Confronted with the above, Marx would reply like he did in the Jewish Question, that the so-called liberty and freedom of the capitalistic world are nothing other than man's desire to keep himself a self-sufficient nomad. As he writes, all the rights of man are simply \\"the right to enjoy one's fortune and to dispose of it as one will; without regard for other men and independently of society.\\" (Marx, p42) Marx will say that only seeing the superficial political liberation is not to see the deeper human liberation which could only be achieved with the abolition of private property. Marx might not be completely right, but he does stand at a higher ground than Mill in this analysis of property.Mill in On Liberty is focused solely on avoiding the abuse of power through government, but he ignores the abuses that property owners are capable of against the property-less. In an agricultural society where everyone is equal and land unlimited, the government might be the only thing capable of suppressing individual liberty, but when one sees child-labor and 12 hour work day in modern industrial society, there is no doubt that capital could be a pitiless monster. Even when one ignores the industrial age, and tries to give Mill credit for drawing the best possible life for the pre-industrial man, one still can not avoid noticing the subjugation of the slaves, the suffering of the serfs, and all the other dark stories of the property-less in all the ages previous to the industrial one which Marx gives a full account of.Marx and Mill were faced with the same modern phenomenal, the danger of been alienated from the defining quality of humanity in the face of a new economic and a new political system. Marx might not have made the best analysis, but he did have a deep understanding of history and the problems in history. He stood at the level of the common people and tried to solve their problems caused by their material desperation. Mill did not stoop to the common people, he looked up into the sky of truth and tried to preserve the march toward truth first embarked on by Plato."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"On Liberty by Locke was very interesting and analyzed how humans see the world.

Someone may dislike homosexuals, but has no right to harass them or pass ethical judgements on them for what is their choice, of no harm to anyone else. Those are opinions of an indeterminate validity. Socal intervention may only be used to protect someone from restriction of their liberties. What Mill lacks in rigour, he makes up for in persuasiveness. He has some great lines in defense of liberty, a pre-dominant value of human life. Although, it is to be noted that the book can be somewhat tedious in areas which it is repetitive. This book also illustrates what can be seen as a fault in utilitarianism. Utilitarianism takes no notice of other values, or of a conflict of values, such as liberty of existence over the majorities happiness, in which ethics slides into absurdity."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Mill's inconsistent treatment of liberty is so schizophrenic that is seems to be written by two different people, a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde. His flashes of brilliance are marred by his incongruous forays into authoritarianism. It is incredible to me how anyone can read this book and come away viewing it as a legitimate defense of liberty. Mill is clearly guilty of wanting to have his cake and eat it too, and the resulting work is a litany of completely irreconcilable rules for civil society.The brilliant:\\"If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"How elegant. But Mill is a double-edged sword:\\"Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"And:\\"Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests, which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labors and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in ENFORCING, at ALL COSTS to those who endeavor to withhold fulfilment.\\"Mill at once complains about expected group conformity, then turns around and suggests that community scorn is a justifiable weapon to be used against non-conformists. He talks of liberty, then of the duties we owe for the \\"general welfare.\\" On Liberty could as just as well have been written by a Marxist theorist."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill was a liberal's liberal or a socialist's socialist- ahead of his times (or just hanging on Karl Marx's coattail.)

I don't find it a coincidence that Mill was described as a \\"very ladylike person.\\" That seems to explain a great deal of his writing style, which bespeaks a certain dizziness of the mind.Roger Kimball summed up Mill well:Together with Rousseau, John Stuart Mill (1806-73) supplied nearly all of the arguments and most of the emotional weather - the texture of sentiment - that have gone into defining the Left-liberal vision of the world.Mill's peculiar brand of utilitarianism - a cake of Benthamite hedonism glazed with Wordsworthian sentimentality - accounts for part of his appeal: it provides a perfect recipe for embellishing programmatic shallowness with a cosmetic patina of spirituality. It is a recipe that has proven irresistible to those infatuated with the spectacle of their own virtue.Another large part of Mill's appeal rests on his \\"feminism\\" - his conviction, put forward in The Subjection of Women, that differences between the sexes were accidental and that, as Leslie Stephen put it, \\"women could be turned into men by trifling changes in the law\\". Both are indispensable elements in the intoxicating potion that constitutes Mill's appeal and makes much of his thinking seem so contemporary.Mill's arguments and pronouncements about man as a \\"progressive being\\", the extent of individual autonomy, the limits of acceptable moral and legal censure, the importance of innovation and (perhaps his most famous phrase) \\"experiments in living\\" are all familiar to the point of invisibility. Likewise his corollary insistence on the poverty of custom, prejudice and tradition. Mill's contentions on these subjects are nowadays less objects of debate than of reverence. But the public success of Mill's teaching (especially in his manifesto On Liberty) says nothing about the cogency of his arguments. In fact, Mill's central arguments are open to - and have from the beginning been subjected to - serious criticism. Yet they have raged like wildfire through the Western world, consuming everything that stands in their path. Which means, among other things, that they exert an appeal quite distinct from any intellectual merit they may possess.As for the nature of Mill's arguments, consider, for example, his famous plea on behalf of moral, social and intellectual \\"experiments\\". Throughout history, Mill argues, the authors of such innovations have been objects of ridicule, persecution and oppression; they have been ignored, silenced, exiled, imprisoned, even killed. But (Mill continues) we owe every step of progress, intellectual as well as moral, to the daring of innovators. \\"Without them,\\" he writes, \\"human life would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already exist.\\" Ergo, innovators - \\"developed human beings\\" is one phrase Mill uses for such paragons - should not merely be tolerated but positively be encouraged.The philosopher David Stove called this the \\"They All Laughed at Christopher Columbus\\" argument. The amazing thing about the success of the Columbus argument is that it depends on premises that are so obviously faulty. Indeed, as Stove observes, a moment's reflection reveals that the Columbus argument is undermined by a downright glaring weakness.Granted that every change for the better has depended on someone embarking on a new departure: well, so too has every change for the worse. And surely, Stove writes, there have been at least as many proposed innovations which \\"were or would have been for the worse as ones which were or would have been for the better\\". This means that we have at least as much reason to discourage innovators as to encourage them, especially when their innovations bear on things as immensely complex as the organisation of society. In On Liberty, Mill presented himself as a prophet of individual liberty. But if liberty was always on Mill's lips, a new orthodoxy was ever in his heart. There is an important sense in which the libertarian streak in On Liberty is little more than a prophylactic against the coerciveness that its assumption of virtuous rationality presupposes. Mill hoped that liberty would replace the reign of prejudice with the reign of reason. In fact, it has had the effect of camouflaging prejudices with rational-sounding rhetoric. The effort to unseat customary practice and belief has resulted not, as Mill predicted, in encouraging a drift towards unanimity but in increasing chaos.Nor is this surprising. As Mill's great critic James Fitzjames Stephen noted, \\"the notorious result of unlimited freedom of thought and discussion is to produce general scepticism on many subjects in the vast majority of minds\\". Such \\"paradoxes\\" (to put it politely) show themselves wherever the constructive part of Mill's doctrine is glimpsed through his cheerleading for freedom and eccentricity.Mill claimed a monopoly on the word \\"rational\\". So long as that monopoly remains unchallenged our paralysis will be complete. The antidote to the moral helplessness that Mill's liberalism generates is not to be found by digging deeper in the trench of liberal rationalisation. On the contrary, it begins with the recognition that no \\"one very simple principle\\" can relieve us of the duties we owe to the inhabited world that we, for this brief while, share with many others.See Kimball's excellent November 1998 article in The New Criterion entitled \\"One very simple principle\\""},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"I don't really like the fact that Mill wasn't religious- I don't believe you can have a just person who doesn't believe in a higher power, but the economics in On Liberty and the politics are amazing.

It is one of the most fun books I have read and kept my interest throughout. Mager employs an underlying playful theme in the book, which captivates the reader and allures him into the game. The chapters are short but powerful, and lead the reader through the process, ensuring that each concept is understood before going on to the next. If you are a little fuzzy about instructional objectives, this is the book for you!The preface of the book really sets the stage that Mager is trying to create. \\"If you are not interested in demonstrating achievement of your objectives, you have just finished this book\\" (Page vi). A simple, but a powerful way of letting the reader know what kind of journey they are about to embark on. Any educator or planner should be interested in how to demonstrate that they have accomplished the objectives they establish. Mager provokes reflective thought from the get go and keeps it going throughout the entire piece. Mager does a great job explaining how to establish effective objectives.The book opens with background chapters well written to provide insight for the reader. The purpose of writing objectives and why one should even care about them are covered with humor and zest. What makes an objective useful and how it is worded is very important, and Mager presents some fun and real life examples to drive home the importance of communication. How an objective is worded and conveyed to the student is the most critical component of understanding instructional objective writing, because if they are not clearly communicated, they are not functional, practical, or useful. A poorly written objective can do more harm than good and Mager enforces this thought throughout the book.Performance, conditions, and criterion are the primary considerations in writing instructional objectives. Performance, \\"what will the learner be doing,\\" sounds like a no brainer, but Mager points out that how performance standards are worded and conveyed to students becomes the first big step in the process. The learner cannot be expected to prove competency if they don't understand what it is they are supposed to be showing or doing. The condition under which the learner is to perform is the next step in preparing objectives. The learner cannot be expected to understand the condition if the planner does not clearly state it. The final step is the criterion under which the performance will be evaluated. It conveys how the learner and instructor will be aware of successful accomplishment of the stated objective.Mager includes a chapter toward the end of the book to discuss \\"pitfalls and barnacles\\" of instructional objective preparation. This is really a great summary of important points made throughout the book. Objectives that contain no performance, are written to describe teaching points, and include jibbersh are just a few of the common problems that Mager points out. In this chapter, Mager drives home another of his underlying themes, which is that instructional objectives are written to communicate instructional intent.In a comparison between Mager's thoughts on preparing objectives and Caffarella's (2002) discussion in her book Planning Programs for Adult Learners, several similarities are evident. Both authors suggest that objectives should be stated clearly to convey intent without extraneous wordy phrases. As Caffarella points out \\"good program objectives are practical and concrete,\\" this is mirrored in the book by Mager. Caffarella points out that objectives can be used as checkpoints as a means of validating internal consistency of the program, and evaluating effectiveness of transfer of learning. These concepts are not stated in the book by Mager, but can be implied from his stated purpose.A program planner or educator must have a firm conceptual grasp of what instructional objectives are and are not. I have found that incorporating several sources of information on the subject enhances understanding and forces reflective thought. Communication is the real vehicle for success when writing instructional objectives, because the learner and planner must both understand and comprehend the objective in the same manner. Poorly written objectives serve to derail the flow of a program; causing confusion and frustration for everyone concerned. Mager's book is highly recommended by this reviewer for any planner or educator interested in demonstrating objective accomplishment."},{"Title":"Preparing instructional objectives","review":"great book but a little old. i saw the newer version and it was terrific. the headings and index were better in the new one."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Prints and Printmaking: History, Materials and Techniques From Woodcut to Lithography","review":"-- so let's start there. One good thing is breadth. It starts with the printmaking studio, with the tools, lighting, furniture, and floor plan useful for making the drawings and pulling the prints. It describes the inks and their formulations for specific processes. It describes even some of the papers for printmaking, how they're made, and the sizing and other treatments that affect the structure of the paper.Also on the good side, this shows the tools and techniques of wood engraving, down to the way your hand should hold a burin. It covers lithography, and pays special attention to screen printing (serigraphy). Every section is richly illustrated to show the tools, materials, and masterworks of each printmaking process.For all that, the selection and coverage of topics are oddly spotty. The section on intaglio printing shows specifically how to hold the handle on the machine for laying an aquatint ground, but omits whole centuries of engraving techique. It mentions sugar-lift technique briefly, without describing or showing the esthetic reason for the process. It goes into detail about the carpentry for the corners of the frames used to hold seripgraphic screens, but devotes only a page or two to the process by which an artist creates an etched plate. It also treats us to such insights as (p.80) \\"Metal polish is used for polishing.\\"What's good is the breadth, from inception of an image to the hardware use to hang the framed print on the wall. This may help the practioner in some technical points, and there's a good chance that at least one detail will appeal to any beginning printmaker. What lacks, however, is uniformity in treatment. What it does, this book does well. Sad to day, there is much that it omits.If the authors' idiosyncratic choices of topic match your needs, you'll love it. Print afficianodos may learn a bit more about their favorite processes, and maybe even about favored artists. The coverage is erratic, though, and may skip over your needs as an artist or art lover.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Age of the Cathedrals: Art and Society, 980-1420","review":"Now, don't get me wrong, this book is a very serious scholarly work packed with facts and dates, notes and references. However, according to the author -renowned French historian and member of the Acad&eacute;mie Franaise Georges Duby, who died in 1996- History should be considered, and worked as, a literary genre. And hence his care with vocabulary and narration, his pains to characterize the frame of mind of those who populated the age he was a specialist in: the European Middle Ages. This book is maybe his most significant contribution to understanding the artistic heritage of those years, and he certainly succeeds with it in making us grasp some of the feelings and visions of the world that are behind some of the most striking monuments ever made by men: the gothic cathedrals.Duby's aim is, as usual, to explain through carefully crafted narration how the society that erected such awe-inspiring monuments behaved and tried to understand itself; how cathedrals are a product of it, and also which were the powers that guided that society. But although some representatives of those powers (church and monarchy) may have been wholly convinced that Cathedrals where ultimately monuments to their glory, Duby shows us throughout the pages of this wonderful book how the architects and the workers, the masons, the servants, the monks, but also the priests and nobles, artists and scholars, contributed with their work and their blood, to make cathedrals maybe the most astounding homage to the power of Life, with its terror and its beauty.Terror is what you will find at the very beginning of the book(in the year 1000 approx.): the terror of living in the wild forested land that then was Western Europe, trying to scratch a living out of the unyielding land, trying to survive and understand the scourge of terrible plagues or murderous invasions that decimated the few and scattered settlings. The amazing pungency of this beginning totally catches us (who probably expected an arid compilation of dates and battles) unawares and takes us from the basest level of medieval society (especially that of France) up through different layers to the powers that governed lives and souls and who decided where and when one of these fabulous temples should be erected.Even if you are not a catholic or Christian, even if you are an atheist, when you walk into one of these striking temples you can't help but notice -at ground level, near your feet- how there are numerous tombs of kings, priests, powerful people, that will make you think about the unavoidable mystery and darkness of death; how higher up there are paintings and works of art depicting good and evil, the fights and the fears, the knowledge and redemption to be sought and found throughout life; and when you raise your eyes to the stained-glass windows and the soaring spires....the wonder and the bliss, the whole power of Life.So, if you are considering a visit to one of these greatest of human works of art, the gothic cathedrals of Western Europe, this is the book to read, or even take with you. But even if this is not the case, I recommend you to read it. You will see a whole society creating, with their work and effort, with their minds and hearts, with their very blood, one of the greatest, best homages to Life: to the sheer awe and terror of it, and the sheer wonder and beauty of it.(In memory of Bob Zeidler. To the friend I would have liked to have, who died on April 2 2005)"},{"Title":"The Age of the Cathedrals: Art and Society, 980-1420","review":"This very interesting book is an extended interpretative essay relating Medieval art to its social context. Duby moves across the whole Medieval period tracing innovations and changes in artistic traditions and relating them to political, social, economic, and intellectual phenomena. To a large extent, Duby is using Medieval art as a window into Medieval society. A very erudite book, Duby draws on a truly impressive knowledge of Medieval art and life. This book is written clearly (and apparently translated very well) and Duby's arguments are presented very well. To get the full benefit of this book, however, at least a basic knowledge of Medieval history is required.Duby very much sees the different forms of Medieval art as resulting from complex and often inter-related changes in political structures, economics, and intellectual life. A number of his analyses of changes in art forms and traditions are brilliant examples of inter-disciplinary analysis. A consistent theme is the importance of art, especially during the earlier Medieval periods as a form of worship. His discussion of the emergence of the Gothic style at the monastery of St. Denis under the direction of the famous Abbot Suger is a good example. Duby traces the important role of St. Denis as a royally sponsored and affluent institution. The increasing affluence of Northern France and expanding power of the French monarchy brought needed resources and prestige to St. Denis. The monks of St. Denis, including Suger, were heavily influenced by the mystical writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, whom they identified with their patron saint. Dionysius' mystical association of God with light apparently inspired Suger to construct the first Gothic church - one that emphasized the entry of light into the place of worship. At the same time, Suger's ability to attract craftsmen from a broad swathe of western Europe resulted in a synthesis of previously somewhat disparate artistic traditions.Duby has several similar analyses in which he ties economic, political, and intellectual currents to art. The explosive development of Gothic churches all across Europe testifies to vigorous economic growth, the re-emergence of vigorous urban centers, and a migration of priestly power away from monasteries to bishoprics. The development of the great cult of Mariolatry and use of the Virgin in high Gothic art reflects partly the development of a vigorous, independent church led by ambitious popes. The late Medieval emergence of more humanistic and individually oriented figurative art has something to do with the emergence of William of Ockham's disjunction of faith and reason.One defect of this book is the lack of illustrations showing many of the specific works that Duby discusses in his text. A more expansive edition with a high number of illustrations would be useful."},{"Title":"Novell's Guide to NetWare 5 Networks","review":"Hughes and Thomas basically accomplish their stated goal &quot;...you will learn basic to complex concepts and rules on the aspects of NetWare 5&quot;(p.xii).

Extremely wordy, repetitive, regularly travels half-way around the world to get across the street. Exhaustive in its treatment of trivial details (like how to expand an NDS container) while lightly skipping over complex subject matter (like partitioning). The only good thing I could say about this book is the design and outline of its contents and the effort exerted in filling in the details seem to be well matched, both of them quite low.

This book worked for me. It is witty, well-paced, has a clever plot, and most importantly, is believable notwithstanding its batty premise of a modern-day witches' coven deep in Upper Middle-Class America. A reader looking for &quot;horror&quot; is bound to be disappointed, because Ms Michaels is not out to terrorise her readers or scare them silly. Which is fine with me, because I prefer stories which are moved by real human agents who face up to challenges and grasp their destinies, rather than tales popoulated by terrified pawns of the supernatural. An easy and thoroughly enjoyable read. Not too much stress on the little grey cells, but neither are we required to suspend our disbelief."},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness","review":"Style-wise, this is perhaps her most creative book. It is split into 3 parts: the 1st is 3rd-person omniscient, the 2nd is told through the male main-character's POV, and the 3rd is told through the female main-character's POV. The events unfold much like a movie in that the reader isn't just told what is going to happen... rather, we &quot;see&quot; it as it happens. It makes for a very exciting read! The characters are wonderfully 3-dimensional, and as always with this author, the conversation is witty &amp; smart!"},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness","review":"Love Barbara Michaels/Elizabeth Peters novels. Her story telling is great. The suspense, confusion of who is who and what is really going on keeps one spellbound to the surprising ending. Worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness","review":"This is not the best novel by Barbara Michaels, but it is not her worst either. What I enjoy about the mysteries she writes under this pseudonym is that she often takes common themes, approaches, or stories and comes at them from an unusual angle. She does that with this novel, too. The story starts out with Peter just getting out of prison in Europe meeting up with someone he asked to do some investigating for him. Peter is directed to a quaint, well-heeled little town just outside of Washington, D.C. The person he is seeking has written a book about witches and the occult and he soon finds that many of the lead personalities in the town are involved in such also. Who can he trust? I was surprised at how the story turned out but the ending could have been handled a little better; it is rather abrupt."},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness","review":"Peter Stewart comes to the New England town of Middleburg with impure intentions, but finds a city that makes even him nervous: beneath its sleepy, wealthy exterior, Middleburg hides a penchant for the occult and perhaps something even darker than that. Stewart's point of view is a pleasant surprise--bad guy outclassed by a worse town, and with a bit of a mouth on him too, he offers a unique view of Middleburg; his nefarious goings-on, rendered with just enough detail to make them realistic, are outright interesting, as well as a refreshing change from the sort of tentative exploration one expects in a gothic novel. Unfortunately, Stewart's point of view denies many of the traditional gothic indulgences which build atmosphere, and so while Middleburg has its moments it never quite becomes haunting. The book changes protagonists at its midway point, but does itself no favors. The second protagonist has a weaker voice and character, and the second half of the book is given over to a lengthy climax which leaves little room for character development. Nonetheless, the protracted climax is engaging: Michaels retains her eye for detail, the action is strong, and dwelling on it for half the book renders it grand instead of dull. Except that the point of view switch robs the climax of its emotional import, it's a satisfying conclusion.And \\"satisfying\\" is an apt descriptor for Prince of Darkness. The book is by no means high art, but it is solid entertainment. Oblique to a glaring degree, the prose is a little tortured, and not in the way one would expect from a gothic novel--but it serves the same purpose, creating a style that's affected and suitably lush. The setting may not be haunting but it's still strong, and autumnal, picturesque, menacing Middleburg is a delight. There's some compelling intrigue, but this is stripped of impact with the point of view change and so it's action which sustains the book--and there's plenty of that, vivid and suspenseful. Prince of Darkness isn't quite an inversion of the gothic genre, but it's just unusual enough to stand out, and rewards reader interest with a compelling tale. To another reader, I imagine that this sort of book could be addicting; personally, I wish for something of more emotional or thematic substance to compliment the plot. Still, I moderately recommend Prince of Darkness: it's just what it sets out to be, and in this case that's enough."},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness","review":"The book is not as dark as I would've expected.

However, the book moved me right along, and definitely contained plot twists."},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness","review":"Made me a believer that whether witchcraft is real or not, the people who believe in it can be pretty scary. It's one book I've reread several times."},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness","review":"Starting off on this book, I have to admit that I was expecting a little more from it than what I got out of it. Barbara Michaels books can sometimes be either hit or miss, depending on the reader. I suppose that perhaps I just wasn't the type of reader who would enjoy this book.The book's basic plot is about a young man (Peter) who travels to a small town to do just one thing: to terrorize Dr. Katherine More. His reasons for this aren't made apparent at first, but he is unwavering in his mission to destroy her sanity through any means possible. Meanwhile Peter finds himself getting drawn to the lovely young Tiphanie as well as the town's interest in the occult.While I mostly enjoyed the book, I have to say that I was rather disappointed by it. The ending lacked the big bang that I was hoping for. In truth, the ending seemed a little overly stretched out & could have been resolved much quicker than how it did. I also found the main love intrigue a little farfetched- there really wasn't any chemistry there, to be honest. I was willing to buy into it for the purpose of the story but overall I have to say that it felt like it could have been taken out & not hurt the story any at all. Other than that & the drawn out ending, this was a pretty fun read. I do have to warn any prospective readers- this is not a supernatural tale, although there are certain elements in it.As long as you aren't expecting bells & whistles, this would make for an excellent beach read. It's not my favorite book by Michaels, but it's far from being the worst book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness","review":"I picked this one up for free at a library giveaway and read it on vacation when all of my other books were exhausted; time that would have been better spent in virtually any other pursuit. I have not read anything else by this author, so perhaps this is her style, but I thought this was one of the most poorly-written novels I've ever read. I say that because every bit of suspense in the novel is generated by deception.My usual review scores:Plot: 3Concept: 6Writing Quality/Flow: 2/5Characters: 3Horror: 2Humor: NAFun Factor: 2Page Turner: 3Re-readability: 3Overall: 2The book opens with a man being hired to do a job, and the events are presented in such as way that we think he's going to kill an innocent woman, or at least drive her insane in some sort of plot to get her money. The book is from his POV for the first 2/5 or so, and then just as his plan is going well he makes a huge discovery that changes his entire outlook on things -- at which point the book's POV changes to that of the woman who he was trying to drive crazy with cheap ghostly parlor tricks. The novel then proceeds from her POV, while the initial male character starts behaving completely differently than he was when he was the narrator, with no explanation given. We get the thoughts of the female lead from then on, but never enough to answer the basic mysteries of the tale. The author simply had to switch to her POV since if we'd stayed with the man's we would have learned what was going on, instead of having it drawn out for another 100 pages.This book is not a mystery, since there aren't any clues given that would let you figure things out in advance. Rather, it's cheaply-deceptive because the suspense is generated entirely by the author withholding information from the reader and switching the POV around to keep us on the outside. On top of that, the final reveal is melodramatic and cheesy to the extreme; think of every bad twist you'd see in a soap opera, and you'll see it in this novel. Dead characters coming back to life, secret identities, hidden relationships between characters, and so on.Great writing and characters might have redeemed this, at least partly, but there is none to be found. The main male lead is just some English guy with no particular distinguishing traits, the woman is skittish and uninteresting, and when basically every other character in the novel suddenly turns out to be a murderous demon, it's not believable and is just silly. We didn't care about the other people, nor the main characters, so why should we care when the ridiculous events of the climax begin to take place? The book also cheats on every bit of potential gore, sex, confrontation, etc. Just as something passionate is about to happen, the narrative skips to another POV, or forward in time until after the events have already taken place.I was hoping for a good suspenseful tale with some horror, occult, or even romance, and I was disappointed to find nothing but cheap thrills and obfuscation by a mediocre novelist. I can't recommend this one at all."},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness","review":"When I first read the synopsis at the back, I thought it was gonna be truly dark, mysterious &amp; suspenseful.But little did I know that it just made use of the title to attract unsuspecting readers like myself!!!!!Really not worth a read....you feel that you have been led round by the nose in a merry-go-round!!All it contains is petty tricks played by small town occultists!"},{"Title":"Reunion at University Avenue","review":"\\"Reunion at University Avenue\\" is an unique kind of thriller - a story that makes fun of campus politics even as it pulls the reader along for a ride through a realm where some take SG quite seriously.

I just enjoy the way this man writes, whether it be pulp fiction of this warm tale of domesticity. I love knowing that the creator of the perennially unattached T.

She is working on a TV show and a book on the New York School of artists Pollack, de Kooning, Kline and Gorky. Their paintings are being slashed--in a museum, a law office, and in homes.One of her fiends has a Franz Kline that is slashed in his home, and is killed when he surprises the vandal. Then the murders begin. Gabrielle Hoffman, granddaughter of an artist and also a collector; the artist Beatrice Larsen, a collector, a museum curator.... Kate is asked to help the art squad, and later the FBI enter the picture to coordinate the investigations in different jurisdictions. An FBI-planted story in the press about stolen art works being fakes leads to the deaths of three more people and stalls the investigation--as they assume one of them was the slasher.The author has created some fascinating paintings that are the clues in the case, and are reproduced here. His thorough research is evident as is his talent for meshing historic characters with fictional artists.Armchair Interviews says: A thriller that would really appeal to art lovers."},{"Title":"The Killing Art: A Novel of Suspense","review":"History and fiction collide with deadly consequences in the third Kate McKinnon novel -- a story of bitter revenge, where the past invades the present and a decades-old secret proves fatalKate McKinnon has lived many lives, from Queens cop to Manhattan socialite, television art historian, and the woman who helped the NYPD capture the Death Artist and the Color Blind killer. But that's the past. Now, devastated by the death of her husband, Kate is attempting to quietly rebuild her life as a single woman. Gone are the Park Avenue penthouse and designer clothes. Now it's a funky Chelsea loft, downtown fashion, and even a hip new haircut as Kate plunges back into her work -- writing a book about America's most celebrated artistic era, the New York School of the 1940s and '50s, a circle that included Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Mark Rothko.But when a lunatic starts slashing the very paintings she is writing about -- along with their owners -- Kate is once again tapped by the NYPD. As she deciphers the evidence -- cryptic images that reveal both the paintings and the people who will be the next targets -- Kate is drawn into a world where art and art history provide lethal clues.The Killing Art is Jonathan Santlofer's most gripping and chilling story yet, but that isn't the only reason the novel is remarkable. The author, who is also an acclaimed artist, has created works of art just for the book that tantalize and challenge readers by using well-known symbols in innovative ways, allowing them to decode the clues along with Kate. A masterwork of both suspense fiction and art, The Killing Art will impress both thriller readers and art fans as the plot twists and turns toward a shocking climax."},{"Title":"The Killing Art: A Novel of Suspense","review":"I can't give this 5 stars because of some flaws in the writing, but the plot was so good and was enhanced by illustrations done by the author, who is also a painter, that I really enjoyed reading this for the story alone. The author also puts in a lot of information about a group of American 20th century painters known as the New York School, probably the best known is Willem de Kooning. His knowledge and research in this area was excellent and helped shape the story as well as get the reader interested in the paintings. The plot involves someone who is slashing famous paintings to ribbons (and people as well) and before each destruction/killing sends a composite painting that contains a clue as to where they will strike next. The author draws these composite pictures and puts them throughout the book, so that the reader can follow exactly what is going on. I think the author shows promise as a mystery writer, but he is weak in areas other than plot, which accounts for the 4 stars. The characters are not well developed and many are almost stereotypes (and that includes racial, ethnic, gender and political). They just don't come off as real people. In addition, the dialogue is pretty awful. You dont hear people actually talking the way a lot of these characters talk, and if you heard it on late night TV, you'd be grabbing the remote. He should pay more attention when he's outside his own field. For example, the psychiatrist almost made me think I needed to call one. In about five pages, he diagnoses the killer as being 1) a psychopath, and 2) paranoid schizophrenic, and 3) obsessive-compulsive. All three in one? The NYPD can't find this person? He must be wearing a sign the size of a bus. A lot of the conversation had me cringing. BUT--the story was just so good and so well plotted that I was willing to overlook things I ordinarily wouldn't. For the art and the art history alone, it's worth reading, and I did not guess who did it until the very end. Keep on going, Mr. Santlofer."},{"Title":"The Killing Art: A Novel of Suspense","review":"With \\"The Killing Art,\\" Jonathan Santlofer has written a well-paced, intelligent and suspenseful mystery with a unique twist. The author has made art and it's history feel like a character in his book by including black and white paintings by the killer who is targeting paintings from the 1930s and the owners of those works. It draws you into a world where art and it's history provide clues for the reader to decipher along with the police. These cryptic images reveal hints as to as to the killer\`s identity and the actual people who will be the next targets.It was fun to feel I could participate in the investigation as I tried to decipher the evidence, and \\"play detective\\" along with the characters in the novel.An intriguing, thinking person's mystery which is often surprising, and ultimately very satisfying.

She is writing a book about the New York School artists of the 1930s and 40s. When Detective Monty Murphy calls her, Kate puts it all on hold. Someone has slashed the de Kooning painting she donated to a museum in her late husband's honor. Kate and Monty team up and are on the hunt.**** If you enjoy art then you will doubly enjoy the writings of author Jonathan Santlofer. This novel combines a detective thriller AND art work for you to contemplate. Personally, I've not read the author's previous novels involving Kate, but after reading this one I am seriously considering haunting a local book store in hopes of finding them. A terrific tale that will keep you reading late into the night. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"The Killing Art: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Jonathan Santlofer's third Kate McKinnon novel repeats the themes of his first two offerings: violence that erupts in the art world and/or around priceless works of art, murders of artists, curators, art collectors, and the occasional \\"collateral victim.\\"Kate is a former Queens cop who married \\"up,\\" quit her day job, and became a society matron, a philanthropist, host of a TV show on PBS, and now she is writing a book. In her last outing her husband is brutally murdered, and she insists she work as a consultant on the case. She brings to her colleagues a doctorate in Art History, thus giving the police (and readers) short courses on great artists and their work. To solve this crime, a working knowledge of the symbolism behind each painting and an understanding of the artist who created it are helpful. In THE KILLING ART, \\"original artwork by the author is included.\\" This is an interesting device that challenges readers to help discover the clues and make the connections.Kate is a mover and shaker who uses her influence and money to help children who have potential that would die if not for the special opportunity she affords them. \\"Talk about timing. Just after her third miscarriage, tangled in the red tape of adoption, and here they were --- dozens of kids who needed her help. Kate had seen what the program could do --- offering a handful of kids special attention, less crowded classrooms, encouragement, and preparation for college, if they wanted to go.\\"The plot centers on a killer who vandalizes and slashes great works of art as his signature. His plans go wrong in his second outing and he is caught; the owner of that artwork is his first kill. He enjoys it --- the power, the feeling of the knife entering the man --- and decides to add killing to his M.O. He escalates into a sociopath/psychopath committing increasingly ghoulish murders.In THE KILLING ART Kate once again inserts herself into the investigation of the series of diabolical killings that are connected to the slashed paintings. The spouse of one of her dear friends is murdered when he catches the killer in the act of destroying a painting that hangs in his home. Kate is determined not to let his or the deaths of the other victims go unsolved. The perp's M.O. makes for an interesting twist. S/he sends a warning, via a painting that incorporates the last victim's ruined canvas, and hints at who the next target is. Since Kate is writing a book about the New York School of artists and their inner circle known as the \\"irascibles,\\" she definitely is an asset to what appears to be a vendetta against their work.\\"To the artists of the New York School painting was their life, their soul, their raison d'etre. For them the 1930s and '40s were defined by cold-water flats, hard work, heavy drinking; painters hanging out in bars and coffee shops, arguing about the latest trends and ideas --- creation over completion, painting as an event --- but most of all, it was a time of intense friendship and camaraderie.\\"At least that is how the legends and myths about this group offer up their story. The in-crowd included such luminaries as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Lee Krasner.Kate was and is a very good cop. Her art expertise is stellar and her eye is as sharp as her gut instincts when it comes to solving crimes. She works with the NYPD and the FBI in their efforts to catch a killer. She always has been a strikingly beautiful woman who takes her looks for granted and really never uses them to get what she wants. She maintains her cool and keeps a certain amount of distance between herself and the ugly side of life she is forced to deal with. She, like the painters, is reinventing herself as she moves through the grief that is always with her. She bought a loft, had one of her prot&eacute;g&eacute;s move in with a baby, and has created a small family.In the meantime, each owner of each painting that is destroyed gets a small painting in an envelope that represents elements of the New York School painters' work. Kate is the one who deduces that these are the killer's calling card, and he is taunting everyone by hinting at which will be his next slashed painting and who will be the dead owner. The creepiest threads in the novel are the glimpses readers get into the mind of the murderer. Those interior monologues are chilling, yet readers will find themselves spellbound as the monster reveals bit by bit who he is and why he kills.Jonathan Santlofer has that \\"special something\\" that allows him to wander into dark places and report what he finds, yet he always has control of the plot. The regulars are becoming more and more believable as each book brings them back. This series could turn into a really hot item as readers become more familiar with this writer.--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum"},{"Title":"The Killing Art: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Jonathan Santlofer's 3rd book is even better than the first two, both of which I loved. This is a book like no others. Smart, witty, suspenseful, fast-paced. The Killing Art combines history and fiction in a most creative way.

She was drawn back into police work when art and murder intersected in the cases of the DEATH ARTIST and the COLOR BLIND. Now she is writing a book about the New York School of abstract impressionists of the 1930's and 1940's like Phillip Zander.One of the paintings Kate donated to the Modernist Museum was slashed beyond repair and she later finds out that a Jackson Pollack painting was defaced in the sane manner a few weeks earlier. The same person ruins a Kline painting at the home of Kate's friends the Starnetts and kills the male member of the twosome. Kate is once again drawn into a murder case. The killer strikes three more times leaving a clue each time. Even when various police departments and the FBI finally believe they know who the killer was after he died in a shoot out, Kate is convinced that the person was not a murderer just a thief and con man. Acting on a hunch, she enters a scenario where innocent people could die.Jonathan Santlofer has written an existing crime thriller that focuses on the cliques, petty jealousies and the competition for attention that is prevalent in the art world. The small paintings that contain the clue the killer sends to the victims are placed in various chapters in the book giving the plot an artsy feel and makes the reader feel that they are part of the investigation.

(Kindle Edition)I love a good mystery....who doesn't? Jonathan Santlofer's Kate McKinnon books definitely fill the bill. \\"The Death Artist\\", \\"Color Blind\\" and \\"The Killing Art\\" all feature an appealing heroine named Kate McKinnon, who can pull off an evening with a group of socialites who wouldn't say \\"CRAP\\" if they had a mouthful, and the next day be sitting around with a bunch of detectives and swearing like a sailor. These three books are mesmerizing. The heroine has a conscience and a heart, as well as the occasional foul mouth and a willingness to get her hands dirty. Appreciation of fine art is woven in and around the plots and characters so skillfully that I soaked up knowledge of different schools of art, without even realizing that it was happening. The murders are vivid and creepy and full-bodied, no pun intended. I will not give away any of the plotlines or any more about the characters. These things are amply covered in other reviews. My advise is start with \\"Death Artist\\" and work your way through the other two books. You will not be disappointed, except perhaps that you will be so sucked into the books and the people who populate them that you won't accomplish much else while reading them. Time very well spent."},{"Title":"The Killing Art: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Santlofer does it again, with this chilling third instalment to his Death Artist series. In The Killing Art, protagonist Kate McKinnon must re-invent herself in the glamorous art world of New York City. But just as she begins to take comfort in her new existence, she is drawn back to her past as an NYPD Detective and finds herself on the trail of a serial killer.The thing that I find most fascinating and satisfying about Santlofer's work is the way he incorporates his inside knowledge of the art world into every page. His use of his own paintings as clues is both unique and brilliantly enticing. Before embarking on his career as an author, Santlofer was already a well-known painter. His symbiotic merging of the two art forms creates a product that is addictive to say the least.Donna Carrick"},{"Title":"The hidden romance of the New Testament","review":"Wonderfully researched! ex: Most Christians are familiar with \\"The Man from Arimathaea\\" who gave his tomb for Jesus's burial, but have you ever heard \\"the rest of the story?\\" By researching the secular documents of the times and comparing them with the Bible and other writings, a more complete picture can be drawn.

If you use some of the ideas that were in her book you are definite to make a 100.The problem with Mrs. Pflumm teaching Science was her dad did her project for her. The solution to this problem is that she wrote a book about the project and she gave it to them to get ideas for the project. If it wasn't for that booklet she would of had a hard time teaching Science.She also had a cat that was fat. His name was proton, that is a sciency name. Proton is a cat that is in love with cake; he eats it all the time. That is why he is so fat. Once, Proton jumped in the back of the truck on the way to work , because he smelled the batter that they were going to eat at school. I love her books she is a very funny lady and a great writer!!!McKenzieDME"},{"Title":"Agnes Pflumm and the Stonecreek Science Fair","review":"I love the Agnes Plumm series. I recommend this series. The one that made a difference in my life was the Stonecreek Science Fair. It really changed my mind about science projects.The reason it made a difference is because it taught me to do a project on a subject of my interest. Also to not let your parents do it for you. To only ask for help when needed. This is why I chose this book.PatrickDME"},{"Title":"Agnes Pflumm and the Stonecreek Science Fair","review":"I enjoyed this book because it encouraged me to do better.

This author examines why the S&L situation happened. The answers he uncovers do not paint the picture that the politicians want us all to think too much about. Basically the Federal government changes the rules in relation to capital requirements for S&L based on pressure from contributors and a Reagan policy of deregulate everything. Once that happened the mess started. The biggest mistake the government made was deregulating a business that they were on the hook for if they went under. The vast majority of S&L's were actually doing fine until even more regulation came out regarding capital requirements - all in all the politicians had as much to do with the issue as the bankers. The book is much better at explaining this then me, if you are interested in the topic or would like to broaden your understanding of the issues I would start here."},{"Title":"I'm Your Father, Boy","review":"I'm Your Father, Boy -- as the title suggests -- is a smart, thoughtful, humorous, engaging and thorough consideration of the fragile relationship between a father and a son, as this son finds his way through childhood, young adulthood, and into manhood. Dr. Ezra Griffith (the son) uses his vivid memories of his father to construct an engaging life narrative: the combination of resistance to and respect for his father distinguishes the parameters of this story, and speaks, generally, to West Indian cultural dynamics between children and parents. This book is as much a cultural study as it is autobiographical and biographical.What distinguishes I'm Your Father, Boy from the usual bildungsroman is Griffith's ability to isolate his experience with his father from the rest of their world, without disregarding or undervaluing other community members -- including his mother, and a cast of neighbors, relatives and friends. In other words, he and his father center this narrative and others are invited into the text to support it. Thus, while his father's death and his return home to the funeral frames this story -- and brings his life into a new context -- it is the everyday lessons that Griffith learns from his father that shape him into the man he is today (that man, it is significant to note, is a respected member of the Psychiatry faculty at Yale).I'm Your Father, Boy would be a wonderful addition to a course in autobiography or African American/African Diaspora Studies. But, in general, it is just a good read, and a wonderful celebration of family and kinship.Audrey Elisa Kerr, PhDAssociate ProfessorEnglish DepartmentSouthern Connecticut State University"},{"Title":"I'm Your Father, Boy","review":"I'm Your Father, Boy is called a memoir, but it has the richness, the fully-drawn characters, the dialogue, and the richness of language that make me think of terms like \\"non-fiction novel,\\" or \\"literary non-fiction.\\" Dr. Griffith lovingly (but not sentimentally) makes his father, himself, Barbados, New York City, and a whole cast of supporting characters come alive. I felt as though I was remembering things I never knew and learning about new things at the same time. Dr. Griffith gets beyond nostalgia to the real place, the real sights and sounds of growing up in Barbados, the good and the bad. He gets beyond the truisms that go with the idea of a \\"clash of cultures\\" to the disjuncture of seeing and feeling that constitutes that clash, straight to the heart of change and shock and loss. It's good to read a man writing about his father, and a psychiatrist and academic writing about his religious roots. I'm Your Father, Boy is a wonderful accomplishment, and a joy to read."},{"Title":"I'm Your Father, Boy","review":"Dr. Griffith demonstrates mastery of the narrative. I am also a Barbadian who has also made the transition to living and working in North America via New York. Dr. Griffith was able to connect with me on many levels.

This book is the better book of the series. If you liked &quot;the Black Donnely's&quot; you are really going to like this one, it is filled with more town myths and legends of what goes on at the Donnelly's old farm after dark."},{"Title":"Vengeance of the Black Donnellys","review":"I read both the BLACK DONNELLYS and Vengeance of the Black Donnellys over 25 years ago. I, in turn loaned my copies of these books to several family members who,in turn, read these books and passed them around to family members and friends. Their reactions echo mine. My parents and an aunt and uncle travelled to Lucan, Ontario several years ago, and visited the Donnelly grave. While there, they took pictures of the Donnelly tombstone and did ask some people about the Donnellys. Even though the Donnellys were murdered 118 years ago, there are decendants of the members of the vigilante committee around and it is still a rather sore topic to try to discuss. The Vengeance of the Black Donnellys is strictly a fictional story, which the author, Thomas P. Kelley states at the beginning of the book. But - if you read the &quot;Black Donnellys and think about some of the events that are mentioned in the Vengeance of the Black Donnellys, maybe truth is stranger than fiction. If t! his book is made up, maybe the author is hitting on some truths that followed the murder of the Donnellys and none of the survivors of the vigilante committee is willing to acknowledge just how close the author has come to relating how those responsible for the murders came to meet their death."},{"Title":"Vengeance of the Black Donnellys","review":"This is the sequel to Kelley,s \\"The Black Donnellys\\";the story of Canada's most barbaric feud.This was a true story of 35 years of fighting,feuding,barn burning,animal mutilation,revenge and mayhem that ended in the massacre of 5 Donnelly family members on February 4,1880.This massacre was carried out by a VigilanteGroup.See my review of that book on January 29,2006;and visit the super web site \\"The Black Donnellys\\"for the whole story, many excellent pictures and lots of information.Kelly was the first author to write a book on this all but forgotten tragedy in 1954.He ignited a great interest in the whole story.He was not,nor did he ever profess to be a historian.He was a very successful pulp fiction writer.In fact he was probably the greatest Canada ever had,and his books sold in the millions.He was somewhat like Ned Buntline ,a New Yorker,who went out west and was one of the most popular pulp fiction writers of the Wild West.Kelly would find a story that he felt would interest a lot of people,spend some time to learn the essence,then set about to tell it,filling in the details where necessary,from his own imagination;right down to and including conversations.He was an excellent storyteller and left the nitpickers worry themselves about details and accuracy,if that was their avocation,but it wasn't his.\\"The Black Donnellys\\" was such a great success,he decided to follow it up with a book that told story of the awful fates that were visited on the members of the Vigilante Committee.Though there were probably some things that really did happen to some of them;Kelley let his imagination run freely,and created all kinds of legends and stories.The result is a thrilling tale of evil,revenge,romance and adventure that is difficult to put down once started.However;for the greatest effect ,his other book,which is essentially the true story,should be read first.Just as in his first Donnelly book;each chapter starts off with a verse from an old ballad about the things that happened on the Roman Line and around Lucan following the awful murders.There has even been a bit of a cult following that has grown up and visit the areas in hopes of encountering some of these 'old ghosts'on the anniversity date of the night of February 4,1880.Let me just qoute a couple of verses of the ballad to set the atmosphere of the book and tale;\\"It happened,God alone knows why,In Lucan,long ago.Dark clouds were on the moon that night,The fields piled high with snow.As the mob killed old Johannah,She cried out with her last breath:'Your murderin'souls will roast in hellYou'll all know a violent death.\\"\\"For the midnight hour brings alarm,And horses won't pass the Donnelly farm.Stay off that road or you'll come to harm,Out on the Roman Line.\\"\\"They found him in an upstairs room,He lay half beneath the bed.Blood flowed around his lifeless form-In one corner was his head.\\"And finally;\\"The ghost of the violin still plays-For the dead sometimes return.I know what these old eyes have seen,I know what I did learn.And even though a thousand yearsMay pass along in time:\\"The ghosts of the Black Donnellys willStill ride the Roman Line!\\"If you'd like a great story of murder and mayhem,this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Vengeance of the Black Donnellys","review":"A good example of sensational literature but not much help if you want the facts.

Each chapter is organized into two parts, a theoretical treatment followed by an in-depth case study. Although it's a bit heady, the book is also extremely practical. The field of community building/organizing is obviously practice-oriented, but some solid theory has been needed for at least a generation. Other &quot;macrosociologists,&quot; planners, and political economists have tried but fallen short of merging theory with practice in this important endeavor of community action.

I believe that Tony Plate has clearly explained and illustrated with key graphic examples how the process of Holographic Reduced Representation (HRR) can be used in several different types of human thought structures. I believe HRR could be key in advancing the theoretical practice of decoding, criminal behavior patterns for organized crime, corporate mergers and acquisitions management patterns, physiological profiling, linguistic and behavioral analysis for many forms of human resource selection (e.g., juries, employer profiling, family counseling, shopping habits, etc.).The chapter on Convolution-based models is exceptional. Tony has now explained to me something I have been trying to express to others for years, which is \\"the greatest point of CONVOLUTION has many meaningful aspects to the overall data set\\". I only hope that Mr. Plate will continue to research and write on this new and interesting perspective of pattern representation. I would love to see more and different types of data pattern sets representing many of the thoughts in other areas of science.I would also encourage people to read \\"Small Worlds\\" by Duncan J. Watts and \\"The Neuroscience of Language\\" by Friedemann Pluvermuller. Both of these books will help explain what I believe Tony Plate has expressed so clearly about the possibilities of using HRR."},{"Title":"Singing Mother Home: A Psychologist's Journey through Anticipatory Grief","review":"In reading Singing Mother Home, it quickly becomes evident that Donna Davenport has poured herself into writing this book as she shares sadness, frustration, humor, and heartwarming memories concerning her mother and the process of her mother's death. It reads very easily and is divided into subchapters so that I was able to pick it up and put it down as time allowed. I found however, that I read much more at each setting than I had originally planned. I was able to resonate with many of her memories of her mother, the feelings of the anticipatory period, and desire to keep elements of my own loved ones alive in my present life.This book provides a very well-written account that left me feeling as though I had lived a bit of both Donna's and her mother's lives. There is a fullness to their lives and their relationship that comes across very clearly, and I believe that anyone would connect with this account and feel a sense of commonality and renewed hope.This book was a wonderful purchase and I would recommend it for anyone who has experienced or is experiencing grief. I plan on buying one for a family member who lost her husband a few years back. I believe that readers will surely feel the sense of connection to it that I did."},{"Title":"Singing Mother Home: A Psychologist's Journey through Anticipatory Grief","review":"In \\"Singing Mother Home\\" we have the unusual privilege of a watching a highly qualified practitioner of two of the \\"helping professions,\\" teaching and counselling, come to very personal terms with the kind of situation she teaches and counsels about. Dr Davenport's gentle telling of the story of her mother's death, and the openness with which she shares her inward struggle, serve both to humanize \\"the experts\\" and to validate the anguish of the rest of us, \\"non-experts\\" all, whose guilts and fears can be considerable as we face the necessity to allow beloved parents to take their leave.A couple of chapters at the end of the book allow Dr Davenport to offer her professional insight into the dynamics of grief. Considered with her remarkable self-revelation in the narrative of her story, the reader's sense of her is that she is not merely a highly skilled professional but, under the circumstances, a companion of uncommon humanness along an inevitable and inexorable road, one we all must travel.Those of us who have attended parents during their last years, months, days and hours know that there are a myriad details both of heart and body, to deal with. Dr Davenport shares with us many such in the thought and behavior of the pricipals of her story, but it is quite a tribute to her literary skill that the tale never becomes merely a chronology preoccupied with \\"events,\\" whether physical and psychological, but uses them only as tools to enhance the real issue of relationship with oneself and others as death intrudes on well-ordered lives with its threat to make a mockery of human devotion."},{"Title":"Singing Mother Home: A Psychologist's Journey through Anticipatory Grief","review":"Most people are so uncomfortable with the concept of death they spend their lives ignoring it as completely as possible. This book is a fascinating read because it does just the opposite -- and it does it in an original and intriguing way.Written by a psychologist about the death of her own mother, Singing Mother Home tackles the subject matter from two mutually cooperative angles.The author not only comes to terms with the permanence of death as a reality in her own very personal world, but explores it as a professional too, by giving us an up-to-the-minute look at death and loss from the perspective of modern psychological theory and applying it in her particular case.Fortunately, the theory doesn't bog down the writing. It's a surprisingly quick read despite its elegant prose and almost immediately compelling -- who among us hasn't wondered what it would be like to lose a parent and how to cope during the process?Alternately, if this is a situation you've already struggled with, you'll no doubt resonate to the universality of the author's trials -- with her expectations of herself at such a difficult time, with her family, with death generally.I'd recommend it to anyone interested in any of these topics."},{"Title":"Singing Mother Home: A Psychologist's Journey through Anticipatory Grief","review":"Davenport doesn't just talk the talk of a therapist discussing the grief process.... she walks the walk, and her readers walk with her, side by side. Whether dealing with the terminal diagnosis or decline of an aging parent, coping with a loss, or just anticipating the inevitable, Davenport's journey is one we will all take. However, for many of us, while we may feel deeply, we are unable to put words to the feelings, at least not with such accuracy, poignancy and honesty. The sibling interplay, the need of the adult child to be special, the power of emotional resistence... it is all here. At times lyrical, at others stark, the author manages to share her journey on several levels.... intellectual, psychological and pragmatic. This is a book that I read when facing the impending death of my father from Alzheimers as I began the process of home hospice. I gave my copy to my sister-in-law to read after her mother died. She read it in a day. It is on my shelf to use with my clients (I'm a therapist too) when issues of grief arise.

Carl Jung is also one of my all-time favorite personalities. His writing is grounded and creative and Jaffe's translation preserves its subtlety. If you want a great way to take the plunge into Jungian theories, his autobiography is a beautiful way to do it. This book will leave you wanting more and, as it did me, may just change the way you view the world and the importance each person's personal journey is in life, including your own, and how how that journey and the self is connected to everyone else around you - past, present, and what yet lies ahead."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"I only read this because it was a book club selection.

Realizing that was getting me nowhere, I went straight for the horse's mouth, and bought Jung's autobiography. One of the best literary decisions I've ever made. This book is one of the most fascinating things I've ever read, and is worth ten Jung introductions. In it, we get to experience and see the world through Jung's eyes. Jung had a beautiful way of expressing himself, so that much of his prose reads like poetry. He does an excellent job of trying to communicate through those completely uselss things we call words the inner reality of the human experience. Jung refers many times to his ability to see a world that apparently other people couldn't see. He does an amazing job of helping the reader to see what he saw, even at the expense of his own ego. When he was young he fancied himself a bit touched, and I have to admit that after reading the kinds of things that went through his mind as a boy that I thought he must have been at least half insane. His experience with \\"the will of god\\" in particular left me shaking my head, thinking, \\"And we've based our knowledge of psychology on this guy?\\"I think when he was a boy Jung was indeed a little crazy, and maybe it was that slightly off-kilter mindset that allowed him to become such an excellent psychotherapist. He steadied out as he got older, and thankfully stopped having dramatic visions of god doing disgusting things.Jung also provides some excellent insight into the character and mind of Freud. Freud too was a little nuts, and Jung makes no bones about showing us this. He reinforces the notion that everything should be taken with a grain of salt, even the most revered ideas of the world's greatest thinkers. Truth changes, and is relative to the environment in which it is perceived.My only criticism of the book stems from Jung's musings after he has detailed his relationship with Freud and other aspects of his academic career. He enteres a stage of his life in which he decides to \\"confront his unconscious,\\" i.e., to study it himself in as great a detail as possible. Here, Jung fades into a dreamy, imprecise rambling about what he calls his \\"fantasies.\\" Jung never explains exaclty what he means by \\"fantasies.\\" Is he talking about dream material, or waking reveries? Or is he referring to the mysterious \\"visions\\" that plague him from time to time? He doesn't elaborate. But he goes on for what seems like fifty pages at least simply rambling about nothing. He stops giving detailed examples as he did earlier in the book and loses himself in a kind of drug-induced reverie that leaves the reader standing out in the rain. I simplly did not know what he was talking about at this point in the book, and Jung should have done a better job at elucidating what kinds of things he was engaged in at this point of this life.Nevertheless, I would highly recommend this autobiography to anyone interested in Jung. Some small knowledge of psychological theories will help you out, but there's always a dictionary and wiki if you don't have that."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Very spiritually awakening philisophical book.A must read for anyone studying Jung or psychology.I had to read it for school but might have read it anyway on my own."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"In conclusion, after reading Jung, I came to realize that God is mistery itself. An infinite abyss that can be found intrinsically, in our hearts and souls, but also manifested extrinsically in the vast universe.Here is the greatest and the smallest, the remotest and the nearest, the highest and the lowest, and we cannot discuss one side of it without discussing the other. No language is adequate to this paradox. Whatever one can say, no words express the whole... for only the whole is meaningful. Love \\"bears all things\\" and \\"endures all things\\" . These words say all there is to be said; nothing can be added to them. For we are in the deepest sense the victims and the instruments of cosmogonic \\"love...a unified and undivided whole. Being a part, man cannot grasp the whole. He is at its mercy. He may assent to it, or rebel against it; but he is always caught up by it and enclosed within it. He is dependent upon it and sustained by it. Love is his light and his darkness, whose end he cannot see. \\"Love ceases not\\"--whether he speaks with the tongues of angels,\\" or with scientific exactitude traces the life of the cell down to its uttermost source. Man can try to name love, showering upon it all the names at his command, and still he will involve himself in endless self-deceptions. If he possesses a grain of wisdom, he will lay down his arms and name the unknown by the more unknown, ignotum per ignotius, that is, by the name of God. This is a confession of his subjection, his imperfection, and his dependence; but at the same time a testimony to his freedom to choose between truth and error."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Jung was not only a brilliant intellectual; he was a traveler in consciousness whose key breakthroughs came from personal experience of nonordinary reality. Unlike some &quot;Jungians&quot; who have turned his terms and models into a catechism, he was constantly improvising and shapeshifting the language and concepts he used to evoke multidimensional reality. If he were still with us, he would be using a new vocabulary, and reporting from further frontiers.

Jung's life and his humble experiences. I have read his other works, includingMan and His SymbolsandDreams, and never fully understand them until I read this last book of his to which brings it all together in terms of his scientific approach. This 400-page book is a window into his inner world, and it is such a remarkable read.In this book, Jung revealed much wisdom and insights from his early years up to his remainder of his life. One even can learn about oneself from his life. It is very much worth reading. It is both fascinating and inspiring.My favorite line of Jung from this book:\\"As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.\\""},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"At one point in the largely fascinating hodgepodge of his remiscences, musings, and summings-up of his life and work, aka \\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections,\\" Jung makes a startling admission, the implications of which, if he notices at all, go unremarked upon. That is, Jung describes the development of his psychoanalytic system as driven by his desire to fit his own experiences--many of them unconventional, inexplicable, if not downright paranormal--into some order of normality. \\"I may be insane,\\" he might well be saying, \\"but if I can fit my experiences into a coherent template and demonstrate that a lot of other people's experiences can also be explained thereby, then I am perfectly sane.\\"This attitude doesn't invalidate Jung at all; it merely honestly affirms the solipsistic basis of all our so-called rational thought. We use reason to rationalize how we intrinsically are the way a lawyer uses argument to defend a murderer. Nothing wrong with that...especially when someone is brilliant enough to come up with an explanation that rationalizes--and thereby normalizes--a good deal of the rest of us in the process.This celebrated book is not so much an autobiography, it's not even completely written by Jung, but sort of cobbled together from a variety of source material, some of it by Jung, some of it transcriptions of what Jung said, all of it, we're assured, overseen by Jung and given his imprimatur of approval. Jung himself makes it clear that this book isnt to be taken as strictly biographical inasmuch as he believed, quite rightly, that autobiography inevitably becomes either hagiography or apologia.By way of contrast, what Jung does here is give an account of the major events of his life, (including his psychic life--the dreams, visions, etc) that shaped his work. As a result, \\"Memories, Deams, Reflections\\" is a curious blend of intimacy and impersonality. Jung divulges the content of some of his most harrowing dreams, but at the same time he manages to give away almost nothing of his personal life with family, friends, lovers, etc.I find it puzzling that where psychoanalysis is still considered seriously at all, it's dealt with in almost strictly Freudian terms, as if Freud's bacon hasnt already been fried and refried, his water carried and carried back, enough times already. Jung is saying something entirely different than Freud, something, it would seem, far more cogent to our times than Freud's reductionist psychological materialism, which seems now so much a product of the late 19th century. Is the relative marginalization of Jung a judgment passed by the academic elite that Jung, always abundantly more popular, especially among New Age types, is considered a bit of a crackpot, a pseudo-scientific fabulist akin to a Tolkein or a C.S. Lewis, a mystico-literary curiosity suited more for artists and occultists, and not for serious-minded medical men?Jung is often derided as a god-obsessed, would-be prophet of the New Aeon (as opposed to Freud's scientific atheism), but a careful reading of Jung's reflections in this book shows the matter to be quite different. What Jung tried to point out is that the \\"god-need\\" in our psyche is real, even if god, per se, is not. Human beings have a need for \\"religion\\" almost as desperate as their need for air. And if it isnt Judaism or Islam or Christianity that satisfies this need it'll be something else, like Marxism, Fascism, Scientology, Environmentalism, Statism, Satanism or any one of the ten-thousand-and-one \\"self-evident truths\\" that people will cook up in order to provide a transcendent meaning to their lives. One look at the rabidity of some radical green activists, for instance, is enough to convince you that worship of God has been replaced in their minds by worship of Mother Earth, and the violent fanaticism that led to Inquisitions and Crusades in the one instance is never far from the surface in the other. Our age has its sacred cows just like any other and those who dont worship them are subject to ridicule and ostracism just like they've always been.Wherever one god is overturned, another rushes in to claim his place. The throne is never left empty for long. Our psyche, it seems, abhors a god-vacuum.This is an important insight into liberating ourselves from the notion that we now stand liberated from the need for god. That notion, perhaps more than any other, has led to some of the worst atrocities of the 20th century.What Jung points out more than anything else is the limits of reason, boundary beyond which science cannot go. The psyche, he argues, has its own reality and its own needs and they cannot always be squared with what is reasonable or scientific. During a period of intellectual history in which we've been led to believe that science could provide us with verifiable answers to all our questions if only we were clever enough to understand them, Jung's insistence that there exists a class of \\"truth\\" that cannot be categorically proven-- except, perhaps, by gathering evidence of its traces in what is common in our dreams, histories, and cultural artifacts--must almost by the definition of \\"science\\" be regarded as a form of mystification.Thus, Jung's rather ill-deserved reputation as a \\"mystic,\\" \\"prophet,\\" and \\"sage.\\" If he were any of those things, it was only incidentally. As \\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\\" amply points out, Jung approached his project with intellectual and scientific rigor, even to the point beyond which science, and to some extent, intellect itself, could not go. At that point, he rather courageously refused to dismiss what could only be limned darkly and sought instead \\"proof\\" that it might well exist in the abiding need we have for it to exist. Jung is something of an archaelogist of the psyche. He searches for traces at the bottoms of consciousness, he reconstructs the bones of giants (the Archetypes), and he identifies their evolutionary descendants in our own shifting times.If god were a brontosaurus long extinct, he's left his tracks in the ossified mud of the lower layers of our brain. No one may ever have seen a brontosaurus in the flesh, but something left those tracks, something left those bones, something Big.If Jung is a \\"Christian\\" as he's often maligned to be, than he's the sort of Christian who would have been burned at the stake. Jung's idea of \\"Christianity\\" is one of perpetual heresy, of a \\"god\\" in a constant state of development--an idea that he took a lot of heat for in his book \\"Answer to Job.\\" Jung's notion of religion was always, first-and-foremost, one that demanded an on-going personal relationship between the individual and whatever he might conceive as \\"god.\\" In the absence of such a relationship, man's connection with god withers; when god stops growing and religion stops developing than Christianity (in this case) ossifies and dies, just like any other mythologyWell, Im in Florida at the moment, in a hotel room, lying next to my boyfriend--its nearly 6pm and we've been out all day. I think I'll give him a massage; altho he might have drifted off to sleep, in which case, I'll let him nap for a while. Anyway, while I'm off taking care of that, I really think you should begin reading \\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\\"--its gotten me back into Jung and reminded me of why I used to love him so much.

He was having day long conversations with voices in his mind, seeing visions that you'd laugh about if someone told you. Once, he recounts going on a long trip with a friend, then decided to go home (they were days or weeks away from home, and hadn't reached their agreed upon destination) because he'd had a dream the night before. OK. You feelin' OK there, Carl? Hello? Anybody in there?...Earth to Carl!Notwithstanding the fact he was evidently off his rocker, his ideas have been tremendously influential in a huge number of artists' lives and work, not to mention millions of \\"regular\\" folks.In this book, he details his life long search for, and identification and exploration of the soul. He firmly believed there is a soul, and I must agree with him that those who think life doesn't have any purpose just aren't in touch. Regardless of religious belief, Jung believed the real purpose in life is to explore consciousness to the fullest during the short time we're here, and search for that little speck of light that will carry the soul into the next stage.Mind blowing stuff to be sure. Forget about conventional organized religions. You can pray all day long to an absent God with a congregation who think they're going to \\"heaven\\" if they just do the \\"right thing\\" while keeping an angry God at bay.But, if, on the other hand, you're on a real spiritual journey, Jung can provide your road map."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"...my only complaint is that his family hacked out all the &quot;controversial&quot; stuff.

Don't misunderstand - I liked it but found myself a little bored at times. However (let the contradictions cease!!) I liked the format of this book as autobiogrpahy more than most of the others I have read. I would recommend this to people who want to know about him and the way he thinks (the way he became enlightende) but I would recommend some of his others book for those looking to be enlightened!Thanks"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"As I began to read this book I immediately noticed that I was relating to things in Jung's life that I have never been able to express to other people. So here I knew that I had found a man that could express very complicated ideas and I pressed on hoping that we would be more and more alike. In fact we were and I am so happy to realize that others feel the things that I have always thought were unmentionable, or didn't even realize were there until they were gently raised to the surface.There were times while reading the book that I got bogged down in the complexity of what was being said only to have a huge &quot;OH!&quot; when I finally understood what Jung meant and how I identified with it so deeply. My pattern of reading the book was to read for awhile and then put the book down (I could only take so much at once) for awhile to let things settle in my mind. I have had several powerful dreams while reading this book and had them analyzed. After things settled a bit I would be &quot;called&quot; by the book and pick it back up and sure enough WHAM it would hit me again with something and I would have to work though it again. This continued until the end of the book.My life is slowly changing because of this book and others of his.

Yes, the book is excellent. Yes, it contains invaluable thoughts from Jung. Yes, it is a must read for any Jungian or anyone else for that matter. However, there is something that should be taken special note of. If, when reading the first few chapters on his early years, you find yourself identifying very closely with his experiences, beware. It is well known that many people experience synchronicities while reading this book. Example: a person may have a dream, and the next day find that very dream explained in the book, wherever that person left off reading the day before. These synchronicities can have a very large effect. If you are one who finds yourself identifying with jung's thoughts and feelings to a high degree, you may experience more than just dreams. The book becomes an integral part of your life. It won't let you skip around or stop reading it for too long. You will be bound to the book to finish it in order. When you reach the 10th and 11th chapters in which he describes his afterlife experiences and thoughts, be extremely careful. You may enter into that same \\"shadow of the valley of death\\" while you are reading this part. This is not a book to be taken lightly. It gives you knowledge coupled with experience, not just knowledge. Do not bother opening it unless you want to embark on a serious psychic journey, which will result in increased wisdom and understanding through many unforseen experiences.

I did the mistake of lending it to someone else and I have never had it back. Then, three years ago, I found that Brazilian Edition and I bought it. I read it over and over, particularly when I needed someone to teach me something really important to my life. Then, I decided to taste the English (American) Translation. I bought this one. I wasn't disappointed. The translation seems to be very carefully done. But although it is a good edition it misses few paragraphs and letters if compared to the Brazilian edition I have. Was this English translation \\"censored\\" in any sense ? I doubt that. I simply think the translator just \\"missed\\" some pages of the original (in German) edition.

I read an article in the New York Times about Jung's Red Book, which said he used much of the material that came forth during the time of its writing and illustration to co-author his autobiography (Dreams...). So since the Red Book wasn't yet published, and since it was $200 compared to $10 something for Dreams..., I purchased Dreams...Each day of reading this magnificent book was a splendid journey, a meditative circumambulation around one of Jung's (and our collective) mandalas."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This \\"mythical\\" (Jung's word) book on Jung's life is certainly a beloved \\"bible\\" of many Jungian analysts and devoted fans, many claimed to have re-read this book once every year or so (so as to have a closer touch with the psyche of the guru). Fair to say the book is rich in metaphysical speculations, Jung's web-of-dreams as demonstration of his mythical (alchemical?) life goal in understanding human psyche (his own individuation), his famous or infamous encounter with his own unconscious (the raw data as recorded in the Red Book has been an embarrassment of his descendants for many years), near-death experience (rich speculative materials for New Age mediators), and his life-after-death speculation has given rationalization for some current Jungian shrinks to treat patients based on the belief of a trauma happened in one's previous life....not to mention his UFO mention.Yet, Jung had categorically maintained that his analytical psychology belonged to the realm of natural science and that he himself was a scientist. As such, he never proclaimed the physical existence of metaphysical entities, though he didn't deny the possibility of such physical existence. This position is quite different from some current Jungian psychologists and new age fans of Jung. And Jung made this (him being a scientist) quite clear in the book. For example, concerning the \\"loud report in the bookcase\\" (p. 155) that Jung described as having meaning (i.e.\\"synchronized\\" with or even caused by his psyche), Jung gave the readers a fair view of Freud's scientific argument in Freud own words. I shall quote as length here because it shows the true character of Jung (p 361): \\"At first I was inclined to ascribe some meaning to it if the noise we heard so frequently when you were here were never heard again after your departure. But since then it has happened over and over again, yet never in connection with my thoughts and never when I was considering you or your special problem. (Not now, either, I add by way of challenge). The phenomenon was soon deprived of all significance for me by something else.\\" Jung didn't refute Freud's argument in his book.In summary, a book with excellent materials to study Jung from different perspectives.

These passages recalled &quot;Into the Heart of Darkness&quot; ...the horror, the horror. It is also a sad &quot;autobiography&quot; that contains no treatment of the importance or meaning of one's spouse and five children, not to mention all the lovers. Jung appears to be a man who fought institutional rules, made his own, and then broke those,too. Most likely the experts who carry on his legacy have dealth with all this, but it left me wondering... if Jung (and his co-writer) was not capable of honestly facing his &quot;outer&quot; or worldly experience, why should I believe that he was capable of honestly treating his &quot;inner&quot; experiences?

I found it hard going and didn't inderstand it."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"When a friend introduced this book to me almost 20 years ago, it launched for me, a deep personal interest in the works of Carl Jung. I think this is an excellent book to start out with because it is Jung's telling of his life's story.Jung explains his early questions about God, his deep curiosity with the human mind, his work with psychotherapy and dreams analysis, and his fascination with the unconscious--which would eventually put him on the path to his life's work.Through this book, you can see how Jung developed his ideas and you can get a feeling of the passion that he experienced as he made his discoveries. This sense of development is especially helpful because it will lay down a solid foundation for later readings of his other works (such as his collection of lectures that were published in the Bollingen series).It will also help when you're reading other books about Jung that are not written by Jung. For the past 20 years or so, it has become quite popular to toss around the word 'Jungian'... almost making it a junk adjective like 'psychic' or 'cosmic'... There is a fair amount of misunderstanding about Jung's work. Even within the Jung Institute, you'll find some differences of opinion.For these reasons, the best place to start is with what Jung *actually* said. Also, if you have a basic knowledge of psychological terminology, this book is fairly easy reading."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Jungs autobiography: Excellent as to understanding Jung's work, life and philosophies etc. This is the book to get if you are at all interested in Jung from an overall perspective i.e. from the cradle to the grave. I would also recommend the movie 'Matter of Heart: The Extraordinary Journey of C.G. Jung ' ASIN: B00028G6LC.As regards the field of psychology, you will have an understanding of how his views came about and developed. You will also understand Jung's relationship and split with Sigmund Freud (Archetypes Vs Libido). Personally I think both have merit, but to ignore Jung's philosophies associated with archetypes, is a grave error indeed. I still ponder on how Jung collected information from mental patients and discovered how their dreams etc had a common archetypal base.Even though I have a interest in psychology, the matters of the spirit are of greater importance to me. Jung's discovery of Archetypes, gave me a personal accepted understanding of the tree of life; a profound stepping stone upon the path from exotericism to mesotericism and gnosis. This is the greater message of Jung in my opinion.Added to this review years later: Yesterday I watched the movie \`A most Dangerous Method'. One can also see the movie \`My name was Sabina Spielrein'. These movies deal with Carl Jung's extramarital affair with his patient Sabin Spielrein. Points of discover: Carl Jung \\"that his own life was scandalously immoral on account of his sexual excesses and that he formally repudiated belief in Christianity despite his father's being a minister of religion. He saw the Catholic Church, with its dogmas and moral teachings as the source of all the neuroses which afflicted Western man\\" ([...])Points of consideration: Jesuit Catholic Luciferic deception i.e. spiritual head of the one world government, new world order. Universities generally teach Freud, why? Jung reveals man's spiritual reality. Add to this darwins THEORY of evolution inclusive of his families inbreeding which then saw his families members directly connected with the Eugenics movement. This is then used for racism and elitist theory regarding culling of humanity, also Hitler's final solution.Back to the Jesuits; we see the infiltration of the Christian churches with ecumenism, Loyola theology; a methodology to re-integrate the lost sheep of Protestant Churches. This also involves the new age religion, very sinister. Catholic Schism i.e. it hates Jung for Jung hating the catholic church and also revealing the spiritual side of man, who can have direct connection with God. Yet now uses Jung (with teachings on Imagination) associated with Teilhard de Chardin (Jesuit).Obviously, the Jesuit catholics use whatever methods they can get their hands on to further their ends. For me, when it comes to Jung, I still don't chuck the baby out with the bath water. I see that his teachings of dream analysis and Archetypes still have powerful merit. I also see that he was hated via the jesuit catholics for safe guarding the Gnostic library. The truth is a crack that runs very fine between a mountain of lies."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Jung's work is often difficult to read. This is an excellent introduction to his thinking, and a fine outline of his life. Man and his Symbols is also a good intro to Jungian thought.However, over long, somewhat pompous comments are really not appropriate. Jungians would call this inflation."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"&quot;Memoirs, Dreams, Reflections&quot; helped me to establish a contextual framework for understanding the life of this truly seminal thinker and his work. It is an excellent place to start before diving into some of Jung's often esoteric and abstract essays, transcribed lectures, and books.One of Jung's greatest achievements has been his ability to produce a new vocabulary for modern man to deal with the processes that occur where the personal psyche meets objective reality. His genius lies in his blend of deep intuitive thinking and strict scientific empiricism. Jung's contributions are still slowly trickling down into the collective understanding of modern culture."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Admittedly, this is the most important book for those interested not only in the Jungian approach in psychology, but also in the life itself of Carl Gustav Jung. Indeed, this is an autobiography, imbedded in which is most of Jung's theories and quite an adequate outline of his cosmotheory as well.Now, this being the book that &quot;allows&quot; us a glimpse into the soul of this psychologist, i was for one somewhat puzzled by the overall insight i got. While for the most part i appreciated Jung's bold approach in matters considered heavy taboos in his time (not to mention our time as well for certain particular issues), on the other side i found that Jung is self-contradicting at times, or murky, for lack of a more descriptive term.Jung dares to look on the &quot;other side&quot; and consider it openly an integral part of &quot;this&quot; side. What others deem as &quot;paranormal&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; is to Jung just the other side of the same coin. He discusses the reality under the accepted reality but he is not straightforward about it. If i wanted to take it far enough I'd even say he's not honest about it. He does mince hiw words much too often and stops short of telling you what he really thinks. But this hardly undermines his openmindedness. Same goes for his treatment of religion.In the beginning of the book he goes to great lengths in his denouncing of the western religion, and yet, all throughout the book he leaves countless hints that he's religious himself, without ever explaining in what sense. This was in my view perplexing.The part of the book where he details his views on psychotherapy and explains how he approached his patients is definately the highlight of this book, and it should be of paramount importance for those interested in that subject area.The last third of the book is mostly about Jung's travels. That part, might be disturbing for some, as one can sense that Jung felt some kind of well hidden superiority over the people he encountered. This superiority is often enough brought forward as his surprise over the insights these people offered him, but it still remains a mystery (at least to me) what he actually &quot;took&quot; from these people pertaining to their beliefs and approach in life. If anything, that is.All criticism aside, this is still essential reading. Jung was a person torn between the desire to explore the off-limits and his fear of being ostracised by the scientific community. In the gray area within that struggle is where one discovers Jung's most thought-provoking theories because that is where he presents himself bare."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"I was at my local library looking for 'serious' books on dreaming. I was sick of all the flimsy material I was reading and wanted to find out what the big thinkers thought about the subject. This book came up in my library search and I picked it up thinking it would be a book about what a psychologist thought about dreaming - in all honesty I didnt know anything about Jung or had read any of his material. I started reading this book and found out I had picked up his memoirs, which was really disappointing for me as I dont generally like reading autobiographies of any kind - but I simply couldnt put the book down! The imagery of his language drew me in, and a simple sentence was enough to set me into a train of thought that could last for hours on end - it has simply been the most amazing book I have ever accidentally read so I had to buy it! This is not a book for anyone looking for hard facts about anything, but rather an exploration of this man's amazing life. The way he is able to weave the stories of his life together without sounding mystical, over analytical or insane is absolute genius. If you are caught up in the mysteries of the world and are looking for someone to identify with, then you cant go past the life of Jung."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Recently, I had an inexplicable craving for this book, which I first read when it was assigned by a high-school Teacher Who Changed My Life. This time around, I opted (in the name of time famine) for the abridged audiobook version, read by Michael York---a fateful decision, as it turned out, since the contrast between York's plummy, uppercrust English accent and Jung's retelling of his \\"personal myth\\" (not his life, but his inner life) is as uproarious as it is surreal. Shove one of these tapes into your car stereo and let the man who channeled the Collective Unconscious, psychology's answer to Lemuria---a consoling fiction that laid the cornerstone of the New Age (and obliterated beyond repair the notion that psychology was even remotely scientific)---provide a wonderfully incongruous voiceover to the geography of nowhere (Wal-Mart, Target, Costco, Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Wal-Mart, Target, Costco...) as it flashes past.Thrill to Jung's formative childhood dream of a giant, one-eyed phallus sitting erect on a king's throne---a monstrous thing \\"made of skin and flesh, and on top there was something like a rounded head with no face and no hair. On the very top of the head was a single eye, gazing motionlessly upwards.\\" Gird up your loins for a week of fear-crazed bedwetting: \\"The thing did not move, yet I had the feeling that it might at any moment crawl off the throne like a worm and creep towards me.\\" The one-eyed trouser snake of locker-room lore, as reimagined by H.R. Giger! Pure terror! Listen, in rapt fascination, to the account of the female patient who believes she travels to and from the moon, where the moonpeople are threatened by a hypnotically beautiful vampire, who turns out to be a buried memory of sexual abuse, risen from her childhood nightmares. Laff until the tears run down your cheeks as Jung recounts the Battle of the Titans, in which he and Freud struggle for control of the historical narrative of psychoanalysis, each interpreting the other's dreams as maliciously as possible---as evidence of sublimated sexual pathologies, death wishes toward the father figure, or worse! (Profoundly unsettled by Jung's interest in the then-recently discovered mummies of pre-Christian \\"bog people,\\" Freud is convinced that the Swiss analyst's obsession with \\"these corpses\\" masks a death wish toward him, and faints dead away at the dinner table.)Jung's account of his childhood crisis of faith is worth the price of admission, all by itself. In it, we accompany the author on his way to school. Rejoicing in the chirping birds and exquisitely blue sky, he offers a silent prayer of thanks to the Creator God: \\"The world is beautiful and the church is beautiful and God made all this and sits above it far away in the blue sky on a golden throne and...and...and...\\" Suddenly, our narrator is struck with A THOUGHT TOO MONSTROUS TO THINK! Tormented for days by this soul-shriveling blasphemy, he finally decides, after much agony of mind, that God must have intended him to think this scaldingly sacreligious thought. This revelation \\"liberated me instantly from my worst torment, since I knew that God himself had placed me in this situation.\\" Abandoning himself to divine will, Li'l Jung allows himself to think the unthinkable: \\"I gathered all my courage, as though I were about to leap forthwith into hellfire, and let the thought come.\\" (Pregnant pause by York.) \\"God sits on His golden throne, high above the world and under the throne an enormous turd falls upon the sparkling new roof, shatters it, and breaks the walls of the cathedral asunder.\\" (That, Virginia, is why they call it a throne.) \\"I felt an enormous and indescribable relief; instead of the expected damnation, grace had come upon me, and with it an unutterable bliss.\\" (Where are the Farrelly brothers when we need them? Do not go in there!)Let that be a lesson to the morbidly religious among you---not to mention those bibliocentrists who turn up their noses at the obscure pleasures of the audiobook."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"It begins with his first memories, and ends with his near-death experience, weeks before his actual death. Precious few are the books that one returns to time and again, and this is one of those. The language is simple, magical, and, to use Jung's own term, numinous.What is most interesting: there is absolutely no mention of Jung's rape by an older man whom he regarded as a father figure, an incident which Jung confessed to Freud in correlation with his \\"religious crush\\" on his mentor. There are those that speculate it was this Amfortas-like wound that, after his break with Freud, deepened his crisis. But, it was also this crisis that propelled Jung into an explosion of creativity, the result of which was his groundbreaking Psychological Types and his soon to be released The Red Book."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Read along exploring the mind and spirit of this century's (and possibly the next) deepest thinker as he takes you on a reflective journey through his inner and outer lives. A wonderful book to bring us back to our grounding in the spirit. Jung not only speaks of but lives out the archetypal truths of mankind. His description and recounting of his discovery of the Biblical &quot;stone the builders left untaken&quot; which he had his builders use as the cornerstone of his castle is an inspiring revelation of a turning point in his life and beliefs from this most eastern of western philosophers. One comes away from the book with a fulfilling sense of wholeness that remains a part of the heart. It is a book to buy, read, and reread at different times throughout life"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This book does give a good overview of Jung's ideas, and how the developed in his life and interior thought. What I most love about this book, however is the feeling I came away with for Jung himself. It made me feel that he was a deeply compassionate, openminded and rational man, if imperfect as all men. Its greatness is that it puts a human face behind all of the science and ideas of his legacy, and gives the reader an insight of his own inner experience which one can relate to."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Wow!I've always admired Carl Gustav Jung, and this book, a biography of his inner life, has helped me to understand him much better. It was fascinating to read about his boyhood, his adolescence, his days as a student, his time as a doctor (most all of his adult life) and his travels. And the best part was the insights he shared about his inner life.Perhaps the biggest surprise in reading this book was the extent to which I identified with him. As a child I had a rich imagination and sometimes thought that I was some kind of an odd-wad. And like Jung, not only did I have trouble with algebra when I was in junior high, I also, like Jung, had thought it was a plot! It was nice to find out that a highly intelligent person like Jung had experienced many just-like-it-only-different events as I had.The biggest thing I appreciate about Carl Jung is his attitude towards the individual. I think he has one of the best treatments of individualism that I've read. The \\"individuating\\" process he outlines will make us better members of the community. Like Jung, I have always felt that the community is only as healthy as the individuals in it.I continue to learn about his approach to dreams and to learn new insights from this book. It's very much worth reading."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Jung's Autobiography is highly readable, and thoroughly enjoyable. In an often mythic style, it demonstrates his commitment to the truth of experience. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the life of Jung and the events in his life that influenced his work."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"A fantastic book, equally informative, fascinating, and insightful. It serves as a very good introduction to Jung's works, which can at times be heavy reading for non-psychologists. You will be impressed by not only the genius of this man, but captivated by the story of his life. This book should a must read for anyone interested in unravelling some of the mysteries of the psyche."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"When I first started reading this book, I was highly nave as to what my possible reactions could be. I never realized that this book would spark an internal flame within me, causing me to yearn for more knowledge and a broader insight into many subjects. It even lead me to come to many realizations about myself and my actions that I could never explain, but turned out to be so true and conclusive.The extremely difficult vocabulary content did not discourage me one bit, it just made my curiosity grow. Jung amazed me with the beauty of his language choice and writing style and further astonished me with this extensive knowledge on so many various subjects and interesting way of interpreting them. Jung constantly referred to literary works and ideas of other authors and always stressed his references. This was perfect because this was the first book that I've ever willingly read from cover to cover in the psychology field, and it gave me an idea of other books like this one that I could read on topics that I liked and could hand-pick.The book was most interesting knowing that it was written in autobiography-style and at the end of Jung's life, thus giving myself (the reader) his life-experienced and life-proven philosophies. It was a very difficult read but it was well worth it. I could honestly say that sometimes I just couldn't put it down; and no other book has been able to do that for me."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Several key ideas in this work grab my attention and lead me to believe that this is a fine starting point for understanding Jung, both his life and his thought:* The Collective Unconscious: Jung's notion that we are being \\"carried along,\\" sustained and directed by this deep, dark well of unconscious archetypal meaning and energy that seeks to make itself known and become integrated into our conscious life. Here's the alpha and omega.* The Persona: The self we manifest publically is not the whole story but a necessary \\"mask\\" that helps us get by in the world, the ideal image we have of ourselves. We latch onto these social identities to define us, but as a part of the \\"collective psyche\\" they do not distinguish us in any significant way. Jung's struggling awareness of the \\"split\\" between his two personalities, \\"No. 1\\" and \\"No. 2,\\" led to this concept.* The Shadow: There lives within us another side of our personality that is filled with all those aspects of ourselves we hide away, both from ourselves or others, as unacceptable. The shadow has a \\"dark side,\\" which is the stuff we find morally reprehensible, but it also has a \\"bright side\\" containing our unembraced potentialities. Daryl Sharp describes the shadow as a \\"hodgepodge of repressed desires and uncivilized impulses.\\" It serves our wholeness by nagging and ambushing the persona (ideal self) with a larger sense of our humanity.* The Affirmation of Wholeness over Dualism: Given the primary role of the collective unconscious and how it seeks to integrate the persona and the shadow, we are to be wary of all one-sided emphases in terms of personal growth.* The Nature of God as Light and Dark: Jung came to see God as embodying both light and shadow as well. His dream very early in life of God defecating on the church jolted him into a kind of \\"blasphemy\\" that was both horrifying and redeeming. He eventually came to see God as embodying the wholeness and synthesis of opposites that every person needs.* The Desire to Ground Psychology Historically: Jung could have easily become just another crackpot esoteric with all his mystical visions, dreams and overwhelming intuition. Yet he struggled long and hard to substantiate his subjective experiences, to verify their occurrence and meaning in the \\"outer world\\" cross-culturally and give \\"reality\\" its due.I am completely captivated by Jung's thoughts about Christianity and how this \\"myth\\" needs to grow and develop or it will die on the vine. I am convinced as a pastor that the Church's sense of faith needs more of an \\"experiential\\" focus than a \\"dogmatic\\" one. Jung was not afraid to open himself to the awesome mystery of the Other, even if it meant moving into the unknown and sacrificing what he held most dear. I'm convinced that Jung offers an invitation into the \\"larger life\\" of God, one that values the questions and trusts both the presence and absence of God as necessary to our wholeness.Reading this autobiography energizes me to move beyond dabbling with Jung, to seek a deeper understanding and integration of his insights. I intend to be more forthright with encouraging others to listen to their dreams and to \\"own\\" their shadow. In particular, given my largely evangelical tradition, I'm eager to broaden out the spiritual direction conversation beyond the usual obsession with persona tinkering. I hope to help others open up to and trust the terrifying richness swelling up from the collective unconscious. This work has prompted me to pursue other works by James Hollis, Jeremy Taylor, Daryl Sharp, June Singer, and David Tacey."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This fabulous memoir goes out of print and then, sometimes, re-emerges in a later edition. I hate it when I cannot find a copy, as I want to give it to many people I know. I gave the most recent edition as a gift to an erudite friend, because I read the book thirty years ago and still recall how deeply affected I was by the book. The book is not psycho-babble or even a tome about Jungian psychology; rather, it's deeply personal, incredibly creative, and spiritual in a way that does not gag one. I highly recommend this book, and the new cover is sharp, too."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"One of my favorite books of all times. I've always enjoyed memoirs and biographies, but reading Carl Jung was an exquisite pleasure. I loved how he so freely shared his own dreams, doubts, thoughts and I took to heart his notion that as a therapist we can't help our clients if we aren't willing to go to the same depths they do."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"For anyone interested in learning about Jungian psychology, this book is a perfect introduction to Carl Jung. It is extremely readable and deeply rich with wisdom. This book is a summation of Jung's personal thoughts and insights about the different phases of his psychological work and life completed towards the end of his life.Jung discusses psychiatry as a relatively new science and that his belief that psychology is all about psychic energy. Because of this awareness, Jung believed that peoples' drives are energetic processes and the unconscious itself is a psychic process. He describes his own first-hand observance with the paranormal and because of that experience why he believed there are events that overstep space, time and the process of cause and effect.As an avid Dreamworker myself, I loved how Jung discusses the importance of giving shape to our secret inner expressions, creative energies or archetypes that emerge from the unconscious especially through dreams. In this book, Jung relates experiencing archetypes within is a process the individual goes through that is similar to an ancient alchemical process.I think many readers will find his description of the process of disorientation and loss of footing from a strong and rigid ego-based life to a Self or soul based-life through the process of individuation and working with the unconscious is a natural process as a huge relief through understanding the process better.Personally, I found his book exceptional and as someone interested in dreamwork and Jungian psychology this book was an important foundational reading for my own future work in this field. Anyone who struggles with established expectations in terms of vocation will enjoy reading about how Jung said that varied subjects actually corresponds to out natural inner dichotomy. Anyone interested in ancestor work will enjoy reading about his validation of the importance of that work to bring inner harmony within a person. One of the most important phrases in the book I found and need to continue to ponder myself in doing inner psychological work was the idea that \\"questions and demands which destiny required of me did not come from the outside.\\"Jamieson HaverkampfAuthor of Mom Minus Dad: The Essential Resource Guide for Busy Adults with a Newly Widowed Parent and current Dream Group Leader student at The Haden InstituteMom Minus Dad: The Essential Resource Guide for Busy Adults with a Newly Widowed ParentMom Minus Dad: The Essential Resource Guide for Busy Adults with a Newly Widowed Parent"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss and former disciple of the great Sigmund Freud, was always at a loss to talk about his personal life and this book is a rare exception in this regard, although not being recognised by Jung as pertainning to his bibliography. As it happened with the publication the many letters he exchanged with Freud, this book was only published after a long series of extenuating negotiations between Jung himself and Aniela Jaffe, the editor.But notwithstanding this preliminary remark, the book is Jung to its deep roots. Despite being recorded in its greatest parts and then transcribed Aniela Jaffe, the book transports the reader in the true atmosphere of Jung's school years, the years he spent at the University, his feuds with his father and the difficult relationship with his mother, his breaking-up with Freud, the interpretation of the 2 personnas of his mother, and so on.The book gets increasing intensity and the account is even dreadful/scary when Jung reports the discovery he made about the power behind anima entities, where the unconscious of man is part woman , and a very powerful one in this regard, to the point of totally anihilating one's self if not taken control of.THis is a necessary reading to anyone interested in the origin and development of psychanalisys in the voice of one of his founders."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This is far and away one of the best autobiographies I have ever read. It's clearly written, engaging, and fascinating. Really gives you a ton of perspective on the man and his ideas, how brilliant he really was. He details the paths he took the choices he made, and offers a million anecdotes about patients and how they led to his theories. Important to anyone who enjoys religious studies, psych (duh), anthropology, and history. Just wow. I loved it."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"&quot;What we are to our inward vision, and what man appears to be sub specie aeternitatis, can only be expressed by way of myth. Myth is more individual and expresses life more precisely than does science... Thus it is that I have now undertaken, in my eighty-third year, to tell my personal myth. I can only make direct statements, only &quot;tell stories.&quot; Whether or not the stories are &quot;true&quot; is not the problem. The only question is whether what I tell is _my_ fable, _my_ truth.&quot; (C. G. Jung, p. 3)If you're looking for a book &quot;about&quot; the life of Carl Jung, keep on looking. This is not so much a biography as it is a window into the process of Jung's experience. Think of this as Jung's &quot;case summary&quot; of his life. We don't read many of the amusing anectdotes, or &quot;objective&quot; critical insights that other biographies offer in abundance. Instead we get to experience Jung's auto-mythos for ourselves.Jung reveals much, imparts wisdom, offers us early memories, and paints the canvas of his life for us. It's an incredible gift from a wise and self-reflective man. Jung was not without his faults, as other biographers have pointed out, he had many--some quite appalling! More than one of his analysands became his lover--behavior that would cost him his license today. But again, this is material you should look elsewhere for. Here he ponders his fears, his weaknesses, the ones that he has already accepted and worked with.I recommend this book for people who have never read Jung before. It teaches more about his approach than any of his other books. It finds the meaning in his own life, viewed through his approach to life. &quot;Meaninglessness inhibits fullness of life and is therefore the equivalent to illness. Meaning makes a great many things endurable--perhaps everything.&quot; (p. 340)"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This book is less complicated than most of Jung's other writings and really explains the man Carl Jung. I highly recommend the book to anyone studying Jung. I would also recommend the book an Encounter With A Prophet."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"These writings come straight from Jung's own inner experience and it is his last book before his death in 1961. I have read and re-read this work because at different times in my life I needed to re-evaluate where I was and where I was going.Other books by Jung are more intellectual and scientific, whereas, this autobiography has the wisdom of a person in the later part of life and it was written not so much to teach but to leave with us his legacy.Having myself had a near death experience, I was especially re-affirmed by Jung's own near death experience and his dealings with this phenomenon. His acceptance of his own humanity and his returning from this state to share with us his knowledge and vision is a gift to all of us.It is not easy to return to our humanity and deal with the sufferings we encounter but growth is the only evidence of life. We have to come down from the mountain top and work in the valley.This brings to mind two books written by Hannah Hurnard called Mountains of SpicesMountains of Spicesand Hinds Feet in High PlacesHinds' Feet on High Places. Allegories about living our lives with others and not in solitude.Solitude is a wonderful place but if we stay too long we become self-centered, afraid to reach out to others.

Jung was both a self-admitted gnostic and an introvert, and this very personal account of his life, which he was completing at the time of his death, is correspondingly subjective in tone.Jung had a difficult but remarkable childhood, to which he devotes a substantial portion of the text. Both blessed and plagued by heretical visions which he was unprepared to understand or interpret (among them: God defecating on a cathedral; an enormous cyclopean phallus enthroned in a subterranean chamber), Jung also found himself unable to seek advice from his father, a country parson suffering from a crisis of faith, or his mother, whom Jung believed to have a weird and \\"uncanny\\" \\"second personality\\" which only emerged at night. In time, the awkward young Carl came to believe that he had a guiding \\"second personality\\" of his own, which he perceived to belong to a mature and intellectually accomplished man of 18th century Europe (as an adult, Jung would adopt another \\"psychic being,\\" whom he called \\"Philemon,\\" as his personal \\"daimon,\\" mentor, and guide). Already tending temperamentally towards remove from others, these experiences only acerbated Jung's boyhood sense of rural backwardness, loneliness, and social isolation.Due to both its subjective nature and the enormous scope of Jung's experiences and speculative beliefs, 'Memories, Dreams, Reflections' is the sort of book that hardline scientists and skeptics may scoff at, especially since Jung is largely concerned with discovering the liminal crossroads where objective truth, physical law, spirituality, and human psychology converge. Throughout his life, he also placed a tremendous value on the meaning of personal and collective dreams, both those he considered merely informational as well as those he considered prophetic and of a collective nature.Throughout the volume, anecdotes abound of seances, extrasensory perception, automatic writing, \\"poltergeist\\" phenomena, \\"meaningful coincidences,\\" alchemy, visitations from the dead, unidentified flying objects (which Jung, who never claimed to actually glimpse one, did not believe to be vehicles from other planets, though he didn't absolutely rule out the possibility), alternate dimensions, the Holy Grail, and, in one bizarre episode, a seemingly endless parade of merry-making phantom boys who pass by his lakeside home in the dead of night. Though Jung interprets this particular \\"haunting\\" in terms of local history, it's remarkable that he, who believes \\"the mythic side of man is given short shrift nowadays,\\" doesn't consider the trooping fairies of Celtic and Germanic folklore as any equally likely explanation.In another incident, he and companion, while traveling in Italy, spend hours admiring the interior of a cathedral, only to discover later that the mosaics they found so unforgettably beautiful did not exist, and never had existed.As unlikely a collection of first or secondhand experiences as the anecdotes may represent, Jung never allows his narrative to lose its tight focus or relate these incidences to his larger theme: the nature, development, and evolution of human consciousness. However, in genuine gnostic fashion, he is quick to remind his readership that human perception is always ultimately subjective, and that, while \\"facts\\" certainly exist, no man can claim to know what the absolute truth is about any facet of reality.'Memories, Dreams, Reflections,' which was completed from notes after Jung's death by associate Aniela Jaffe, does not pretend to be a work of science (and, appropriately, is not an official volume in Jung's Collected Works), and is in fact far more concerned with ethics, spirituality, faith, and consciousness. One of the book's greatest achievements is its narrative power, which never flags, no matter how potentially obtuse the point is that its author is attempting to make. Throughout, Jung's tone is also uniformly humble and sincere, and his conviction in his beliefs, electrifying.Jung's ultimate message for mankind and mankind's future is clear: \\"Man's task...is to become conscious of the contents that press upward from the unconscious. As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.\\""},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"I think Carl Jung was very ahead of his time and he was in sense an explorer like Columbus, except that his territory was the vast space of his own interior. My understanding of Jung is that he took his own explorations to the brink of psychosis in the service of understanding himself and the psyche. Whether you are a Jung fan or not, it has certainly been my experience that he has a lot of insight and wisdom to share with respect to the nature of the psyche.This book is basically an autobiography and it is very dense reading. Jung was highly educated in a variety of fields and without some basic understanding of philosophy, major literary figures and mythology, it may be a difficult reading. However, if taken slowly, it is truly manageable and you will discover many gems.I agree with some of the other excellent reviews that suggest that this volume presents Jung the legend more than being an objective account of his life. However, it offers a lot of insight into his thinking, major influences, etc. It is a fascinating story in itself.I think this book is most useful and interesting to people who already know a lot about Jung. It is not the best introduction to Jung. If you want a good introduction, I would suggest Murray Stein's \\"Jung's Map of the Soul.\\" Another concise introduction in Jung's own words is Aion. I would read one or both of these first before tackling this volume."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"I enjoyed this (simply from the standpoint of its being a very well-written autobiography). Though I do not pretend to be an authority on psychology myself - I find something in Jung that is almost more spiritual than scientific. Of course, Jung will not be readily excepted in modern circles for his lack of empirical evidence - but that is not what concerns me - he is a fascinating figure and writer. All I know is there will always be something in life and science that is inexplicable - and this is what makes people like Freud and Jung live on forever - they are so willing to search for what is unknown."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"MDR is one of the few titles by Jung which is meant for general readership. Most of his works (his titles in the 20-volume Bollingen series) are very technical and, admittedly, soporific at times.Be that as it may I cannot emphasize enough how important the ideas and discoveries of Jung are. Had he lived two or even five centuries ago his ideas would be just as cogent to us today, or perhaps even more so, in the face of ongoing and seemingly interminable political-military crises that overwhelm us, in a time when we have enough technology to obliterate entire nations via remote control.Indeed Jung resurrects such ancient ideas as soul, psyche, daimon, gods but he contextualizes them anew. No longer are deities entities that live in the firmament above, but rather they are our projections of the psychological goings-on deep within us. And here Jung strikes at the heart of all our problems (and opportunities) for Jung always circles around and orbits the phenomenon of the unconscious, from whence our consciousness is born and in which it is and will forever be rooted.In my opinion, in MDR, Jung shares his most crucial ideas in the last three chapters, namely, \\"On Life After Death,\\" \\"Late Thoughts,\\" and \\"Retrospect.\\" Always Jung is dedicated to reality and the truth. He does not acquiesce to the tastes and sensibilities of his readers. For instance in \\"Late Thoughts\\" he underscores the point that the \\"recognition of the reality of evil necessarily relativizes the good, and the evil likewise, converting both into halves of a paradoxical whole.\\" And on the last page of the last chapter he both muses and avers: \\"The world into which we are born is brutal and cruel, and at the same time of divine beauty. Which element we think outweighs the other, whether meaninglessness or meaning, is a matter of temperament... Probably, as in all metaphysical questions, both are true: Life is--or has--meaning and meaninglessness.\\" These are very somber perhaps even depressing revelations, but for Jung the only way we can rise above our neuroses is to acknowledge such painful truths.I have perhaps quoted more from this work of Jung's than from his other titles. Not only is it easier to digest, but since it was written just 4 years before his death I believe it contains some of his best thoughts, thoughts congealed and shared when he had reached the peak of his mountain, thoughts from a very, very wise old man."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Being 16 years old, i get a lot of strange looks from friends when i pull out this book and get absorbed in it. They can't fathom why i would find it so interesting. Well, for one, Jung's childhood experiences coincide with my own to a startling degree. I have had to keep myself from yelling out in public when reading this book and coming across something that i also experienced. Being something of a budding philosopher, i came across many ideas in the chapters to follow that coincide with my own formulated theories. I've never encountered such a beautifully written work in my life before, or a more touching one. Jung's description of the balance of his own psyche has aided me greatly in finding firm footing for my own wandering mind. This book entertains, teaches, and imparts invaluable wisdom to the reader. I wish that he were alive today, and i would do everything in my power to thank him for his impact on my life. If you like psychology, philosophy, or anything of sort, read this. If you're looking for answers to psychic questions, read this. If you've never cared for psychology, read this... it might change your mind. Jung is a genius and possesses rare insight into the matters that concern everyone."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This is not a typical biography. Rather than the usual record one might expect about an individuals life, that is, chronological time, events of significance, famous personages met and their influence, etc, Jung records momentous aspects about his inner life, his life long and extraordinary relationship with the unconscious. As he states from the beginning, this book is a reflection concerning his self-realisation of the unconscious and its manifestations. In old age, he realised that so-called outward memories, the temporal existence of the senses, had faded, and what remained were memories of his inner life, which manifested in dreams and visions. He found that he could only write his life in terms of a personal myth, because he believed 'autobiography', as a form of truthful expression, was at best, unreliable. Memory, in other words, cannot be trusted. Thus, Memories, Dreams and Reflections, is a personal 'story' about a man's journey of spiritual enlightenment and self-realisation, the process of the unconscious finding expression in the outer world.Jung's inner life was certainly extraordinary. From an early age, the sheer power of the unconscious made itself known to him in terrible visions. Jung must have been an unusually grounded child in order to withstand the psychic forces that pushed their way into his consciousness at such a young age. He survived these onslaughts, I believe, because he didn't resist them, but chose to grapple with the images, follow his instincts and, along with the violence of these images, came also a knowingness and feeling of safeness, that he was, even at a young age, following what he was meant to do. It is no wonder he became a psychiatrist, a \\"doctor of the soul\\" as he calls it; because by helping others through their personal journeys of realisation, he came to better understand his own.At the end of Jung's life he maintained that he was not a mystic, a wise man or a sage. He admits that he drank from the stream of knowledge and life, but was not the stream itself. But what is a mystic in the traditional sense of this term? A mystic is one who, through meditation, prayer or other means, achieves direct intuitive experience of the divine. A mystic experiences these 'other realities' and brings their experiences back, in some cases, to share with the rest of us. To the mystic these experiences are real. Taking this definition at face value, Memories, Dreams and Reflections is a record of one man's intuitive experience with the divine. Jung made it his life's mission to express these experiences in such a way as to make them real, and to then formulate them into a psychological method, in the hope of helping others lost and searching for meaning in their lives. Jung was most assuredly a mystic. His writings tell us that there is something greater than ourselves within us, and our task is to grapple and understand this power, that he has chosen to call the unconscious; and by better understanding this greater part of ourselves, we can become more human.This is a wonderful story about the inner life of a man, a mystic and original thinker."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This is a book that I read with intense interest, I walked around the house, this book in hand.C.G.

If I hadn't known that he was married with five children I would have assumed he was a complete hermit. Loving relationships seem to have meant nothing to this man. I honestly wonder how he could have been a good therapist. I also wonder why so many women have followed his teachings when quite obviously he held them in such low regard.

Having seen various elements of this popular hagiography dismantled by mordant &amp; unrelenting Jungophobes like Richard Noll, I would only stress what I consider the lasting value &amp; glowing inspiration for modern ( Western ) (wo)man in search of her/his soul. I'll post my review in a half-humorous form of a fragment of a dialogue, the now extinct form venerated by Plato, Galileo or Bruno.Q. What, then, is the message of Jung's life, that,what William James had described as ordeal of consciousness ?A. The goal of Jungian individuation is expansion &amp; integration of the psychic contents (&quot;soul&quot;) within the field of awareness, the ego being the center of conscious life. The grand finale would be fusion, coniunctio, of the &quot;soul&quot; ( psyche ) and &quot;Spirit&quot; ( pneuma/Self ), with ego retaining its &quot;privileged&quot; position as the center of the conscious life.Q. So is this expansion and integration something one is aware of when it is happening or when it has happened ?A. Well, that's a tricky subject. I'll try to give some hints a few outspoken Jungians like Marie Louise von Franz, and Jung himself have adumbrated. Of course, the entire spiritual &quot;enterprise&quot; is based on the Western Hermetic/Gnostic tradition, from Corpus Hermeticum to alchemists's &quot;opera&quot;. In short, you got a growth of inner ( and outer life ) on various levels of consciousness ( altered states, dreams, hypnagogic dreams, guided imagination, prayer, conscious ponderings, listening your inner daemon/voice, ordeals of emotional &amp; family life,....). The goal is &quot;individuated&quot; man/woman: that is, someone who lives an authentic life ( Shakespearean &quot;to thine own self be true&quot; ), not an onedimensional spiritual saintly prototype nor a conformistic ego- centered mediocre. I suppose the ultimate ideal would be someone like Goethe or Plato- a multidimensional, creative individuum with strong sense of &quot;I&quot;, yet in deep contact/fusion with the divine wellspring within- in sum, ideal of the &quot;Renaissance man&quot;.Q. Was Jung able to achieve the &quot;fusion&quot; in his own life?A. From what is described in his spiritual autobiography- yes. Yet, I suspect he went even a step beyond: his final stage was that of a deified psyche ( with ego/ I-sense still present, but somehow subdued &amp; the eternal/divine life perpetually glowing in the background of waking consciousness.)"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"We know now what we didn't back in the '60s and '70s: this 'autobiography' is more creative writing than historical fact, and it wasn't written by Jung but by one of the many disciples assigned the task of creating a mystique of sainthood around a deeply troubled individual.The carefully crafted presence of Wise Old Man Jung is artful, a mix of hero-worship, hagiography, and new age religion.

JungArguably the greatest autobiography of the century, Memories, Dreams, Reflections is a man's attempt to reconcile his own inner life with the inadequate rubrics of his time: intellectual, philosophical, and psychological. Jung had the courage to disown Freud's idea that the unconscious was merely a cause of mayhem for the ego. Rather the self, the archetype of wholeness, both guides the ego to its highest fulfillment and presents it with demons in the form of dreams and fantasies. Ideas we take for granted today originate here: The idea that there is a symbolic language that connects all minds which he dubbed the collective unconscious. That men have an inner feminine life and vice versa. The valuation of all religions and philosophies, east and west, as food for the soul. Yet Jung is no dreamer. He was able to draw on Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, as well as non traditional sources, to make his points. His intellectual achievement is gargantuan, being that he is a 19th century character trained by traditional medicine, and bred by Swiss Christianity.I urge anyone who is unsatisfied with popular psychology, religion, and culture to read this book. It is a common inclusion in philosophy of religion classes and is still read in psychology schools. It is especially good for young people just coming to grips with their spirituality, and for the elderly searching for a sense of meaning in their lives. For those attempting to reconcile their intellectual and spiritual lives, Jung provides a way of looking at things, not a dogma or philosophy, that adds luster to both."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"If you are new to reading Jung and even new to psychology this is a good place to start.It covers the breath of his work from a personal point of view.You get a glimpse of Jung the man and the psychologist.His studies are immense and you can easily spend a few years getting to know him.

Jung's contributions are still slowly trickling down into the collective understanding of modern culture. One of Jung's greatest achievements has been his ability to produce a new vocabulary for modern man to deal with the processes that occur where the personal psyche meets objective reality."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"According to Jung, the unconscious tries to \\"compensate\\" the \\"lopsidedness\\" in the conscious attitude, and dreams are part of this process. He says: \\"The relation between conscious and unconscious is compensatory. This is the best proven rule of dream interpretation\\" (Collected Works, Vol. 16). The examination of Jung's dream interpretations reveals that what he calls \\"lopsidedness\\" is a harmful mistake, or a harmful mental/behavioral failure, and \\"compensation\\" means the correction of the mistake, or the termination of the mental/behavioral failure.As I explained elsewhere, the compensation of the lopsidedness in the conscious attitude by the unconscious is only a particular manifestation of the general truth that all functions of the mind, or all of its \\"topographical parts\\" in Freud's words, complement each other and constitute an integrated system, in contradiction with Freud's theory of conflict. In fact, Jung's theory was produced as a reaction to Freud's conflict theory. Consequently, we can equally say that consciousness sometimes compensates the lopsidedness in the unconscious attitude. Besides, it is most natural to expect such cooperation to work even when it is not possible to talk about any lopsidedness in the conscious or unconscious attitude. I described this cooperation in much detail elsewhere in my chapter on cerebral lateralization.Again as I explained elsewhere, Jung's conception of the function of dreams is basically correct and constitutes a very fruitful idea. But he did not apply this idea adequately to dream interpretation, apparently because he did not express it clearly and used instead obscure ideas like lopsidedness and compensation. His major mistake was to assume that every dream presented the compensated state of the lopsidedness, or the corrected state of the mistake.Jung could be able to produce a correct theory of dreams if he tried to answer the following questions: (a) What is the content of lopsidedness in general but clear terms? (b) How does the conscious attitude become lopsided and why it cannot correct its lopsidedness itself? (c) What makes the unconscious fit to compensate the lopsidedness of the conscious attitude? (d) In what measure the unconscious succeeds or fails in doing the compensation work, and why? (e) Most importantly, how does the unconscious do the job of compensation, or the correction of the harmful mistake? It is evident that in the absence of especially the answer to the last question, it is not possible to discover all the thoughts expressed by a dream.As I explained elsewhere, a complete dream contains three types of thought: (a) the presentation of the lopsidedeness, or the mistake, which is treated by the dream; (b) the explanation of the cause of the mistake, or failure, which is often in the form of the external attribution of the failure; and (c) the correction of the mistake, or the termination of the failure. A complete dream begins either with thought (a) or (b) and ends with thought (c). Thoughts (b) and/or (c) may be missing in a dream or may be implicit in another part of the dream, but thought (a) is always present in explicit or implicit form because it is the reason why the dream is produced. In reality, this understanding of dreams is implied by Jung's compensation idea, because the fact that the unconscious can compensate the lopsidedness in the conscious attitude means that the unconscious is rational enough to do that, and the above three types of thought are the ones produced consciously and rationally when dealing with failures in the waking state.Jung was not able to see these facts, because he could not free himself sufficiently from Freud's influence. Just as Freud interpreted everything in a dream as meaning wish fulfillment, Jung interpreted every dream as presenting the compensated state of the lopsided that it treated. In reality, a dream may present the lopsidedness instead of its compensated state, as exemplified below.Jung's dream about his patient (p. 133): In his dream, Jung looks up at his female patient who is \\"sitting on a kind of balustrade,\\" \\"on the highest tower\\" of a castle \\"at the top of a steep hill;\\" he bends his head back too far to see her properly and wakes up with a crick in the back of his neck.Jung's interpretation based on the compensation hypothesis was this: \\"If in the dream I had to look up at the patient in this fashion, in reality I had probably been looking down on her.\\" So, he assumed that the dream was telling him not to look down on her. This interpretation was based on the assumption that the dream scene represented what Jung had to do in real life, which means the solution of his problem, or the compensation of the lopsidedness in his conscious attitude. This interpretation contradicts the fact that Jung hurt himself in the dream by looking up at his patient and also by the fact that he considered his patient in real life \\"a highly intelligent woman.\\" These contradictions can be eliminated by assuming that the dream scene represented the mistake that Jung was making in real life, or his problem, not its solution as he assumed. So, the correct message of the dream appears to be this: \\"You are making a mistake and hurting your interests by overestimating your patient.\\" The implied advise was to stop overestimating her, which is the exact opposite of what Jung thought the dream was advising him. This interpretation is supported not only by the pain that Jung felt in the back of his neck at the end of the dream and his waking state evaluation of his patient as a highly intelligent woman but also by the fact that he was unable to realize progress in the therapy of his patient, evidently because he considered her a highly intelligent woman. This dream shows that the compensation hypothesis can cause a wrong interpretation even when the subject matter of a dream is approximately recognized, which is not always the case, and that therefore this hypothesis may also say nothing about the meaning of a dream. In such cases, Jung introduced obscure ideas in the interpretations, such as mandala, archetype, and collective unconscious, without explaining why these appear in the dream and what they precisely mean in relation to the dreamer's life. In fact, many of Jung's ideas are found \\"mystical.\\" In opposition to this, Freud's interpretations are always clear and detailed but always wrong basically. But despite this fact, Freud's dream theory is more popular than Jung's, because it is found plausible due to the fact that it is produced by likening dreams to daydreams which mean wish fulfillment as everyone knows.Jung's understanding of dreams needs to be corrected, or completed, also concerning the language of dreams. He criticized Freud's idea of dream symbolism saying that what Freud meant when he said \\"symbol\\" was \\"sign,\\" and that a symbol was something more complex than a sign. Today the widely accepted view is that dream language is concrete-analogic, or concrete-metaphoric. In reality, most of Freud's dream symbols involved analogies, but many other writers abused the concept of dream symbolism and produced largely invalid dictionaries of dream symbols. Not only dream language but also dream cognition is concrete-analogic and therefore cannot use abstractions and logic. This is a consequence of the accepted view that dream thoughts are produced by the right brain which operates using concrete analogies instead of abstractions, speech, and logic. The verbal metaphors that are used in the waking state are also used in dreams in concrete pictorial form, because the source of both the waking state analogies, or metaphors, and dream analogies appear to be the right brain. Because of this, dictionaries of dream symbols can contain correct entries, but even the most common analogies can carry special meanings when used in dreams in relation to the dreamer's life experiences. Many otherwise correct dream interpretations by Jung and his followers are somewhat flawed because of they twisted the meanings of dream analogies in various ways. An example is below.A man dreamed that as he came out of a meeting he put on somebody else's hat. Jung could say nothing about the relation of this dream to the dreamer's life experiences and claimed only that the hat represented the Mandela, which, according to him, is a concept present in every human mind. The analogic interpretation of this dream can be that the dreamer had easily accepted, or was in the habit of easily accepting, other people's ideas and views. This would be the presentation of a lopsidedness in his conscious attitude.Jung was aware of the insufficiency of his theory and said: \\"There are still boundless opportunities for pioneer work in this field\\" (Collected Works, Vol. 16). Nevertheless, he and his followers produced many correct and nearly correct dream interpretations. Jung's readers can use his compensation theory better then he did by keeping in view the facts mentioned above and reading my books.Jung's compensation theory can be seen as the solution of the problem of dream interpretation, and thereby of the problem of dream function, if the process by which compensation is realized and the analogic cognition and language of dreams are taken into consideration, both as explained above.Cognitive-Behavioral Cybernetics of Symptoms, Dreams, Lateralization: Theory, Interpretation, TherapyTheory Construction and Testing in Physics and Psychology"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"If you're going to purchase one book about the Swiss psychologist C.

In reality, Jung only wrote a few chapters, and even these were edited by his secretary Aniela Jaff&eacute;, the real mover and shaker behind MDR. The rest of the book is Jaff&eacute;'s creation. Apparently, Jung never saw the finished manuscript and MDR wasn't published until after his death. The full story is told in \\"Jung stripped bare\\" by Sonu Shamdasani.Despite this, MDR is nevertheless of considerable interest. Regardless of whether it reflects the \\"real\\" Jung or not, it certainly shows us the Jung of the Jungians. This is how most Jung fans *want* Jung to be, and what draws them to Jungianism in the first place.Personally, I found the following chapters interesting: \\"Visions\\", \\"On life after death\\" and \\"Late thoughts\\". Jung describes a near-death experience, discusses the possibility of reincarnation, and explains his views on good and evil. Of course, there is a lot of interesting (and frankly bizarre) material in the rest of the book, as well. Jung had strange visions of an anti-Christian and phallic nature already as a child, and as an adult he met a spirit-being named Philemon, who became his guru. Philemon was a bearded man with two horns and the wings of a kingfisher. (If you ever see him again, please call NBC News!) Jung also tells the famous story of how his house in Switzerland was haunted by the souls of dead crusaders, and how Jung calmed them down by writing \\"Seven sermons to the dead\\".Theologically, pardon the expression, Jung seems to have been a pantheist or impersonal panentheist. His view of God was bipolar: evil is part of God. There is also a strong streak of antinomianism: God prods people to do evil deeds so they can experience his grace, everyone must confront \\"the shadow\\", etc. This is the least sympathetic part of Jung's message. Overall, his worldview is pantheistic, animistic and Gnosticizing. Only Jung's scientific pretensions stopped him from sounding like another version of Rudolf Steiner or Madame Blavatsky. (The Theosophical Society Adyar have published a book called \\"The Gnostic Jung\\". Hardly a co-incidence.)At least this is how C.G. Jung comes across in MDR. And whether we like it or not, this is the \\"archetypal\\" Jung, the Jung of the Gospels, so to speak, in contrast to \\"the historical Jung\\", who may or may not have been somebody else entirely. MDR gives us the culture icon, the spiritual sage preaching to an increasingly secular age in which Man has lost his Soul.Or something. ;-)"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This is a potentially seminal (meaning here life-changing) book for anyone that has embarked himself/herself on a spiritual quest. Dr. Carl Gustav Jung was a trained psychiatrist whose unusual insights and mental/spiritual experiences slowly made him drift away from that profession into, mainly, the field of psychology. He was a daring thinker and a honest scientist. In this particular book, he goes back to selected events of all kind, in order to guide the reader into, not only his life story, but into his apprenticeship, so to say, as a mental-spiritual-cultural alchemist and facilitator, not only for his generation and country (Switzerland), but for all humankind wherever they happen to physically abide. Reading this marvelous book I found myself nodding approvingly at the explanations he gave to the dreams, insights, ideas and events that befell on him and which, very often, left him baffled.

Although he was a true empirical scientist of his time, he also was quite aware and affected by spiritual and psychic experiences and mysterious energetic forces that, to me, validates a universal intelligence that is not well acknowledged in Western philosophy. In fact his empirical process led him to not be able to dismiss his experiences because he could not disprove them, and he seemed singularly self-possessed and courageous in this way. He was prepared to delve into the greater forces at work that affect the psyche, beyond just what has been experienced and suppressed.

I had already read &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;Chocky&quot;. This novel was published ten years after Wyndham's death in 1969.The story is about an island called Tanakuatua, where a millionaire plans to build a community. The narrator, who lost his wife and daughter in a car accident, volunteers for a position as one of the &quot;pioneers&quot;. Little do the settlers realize the island is inhabited by swarms of intelligent, deadly spiders. Radiation from nuclear tests gave the spiders' evolution a bit of a push.I have a feeling Wyndham had quite a fascination with spiders. In one of his early short stories (&quot;More Spinned Against&quot;) a man who collects spiders meets a rather grisly fate. In another of Wyndham's stories, &quot;Wanderers of Time&quot;, the heroes are in a remote future where swarms of intelligent ants rule the world. It seems like a similar formula was used for &quot;Web&quot;: the idea of humble creatures becoming intelligent rulers.The premise is a bit reminiscent of &quot;Them&quot; (a giant ants movie), or &quot;Swarm&quot;, a killer bees movie, but there is a certain degree of intelligence in the story."},{"Title":"Web","review":"I love pretty much everything John Wyndham writes. If you do too, this will be a good read for you. If not, then you may want to skip it. This title offers most of the pleasures of Wyndham- a clear, understated prose style with elements of humor shot throughout. As usual, you get the impression that Wyndham is writing himself into the story as the narrator, a modest, observant, unassuming type who reports what he sees with a minimum of embellishment. Though the plot is unoriginal, the action is very exciting at times and will pull you in. There is some filler, namely a long background of the spider infested island, made palatable by Wyndham's fine writing. It's refreshing to read a short book, at a time when most science fiction authors are apparently paid by the word. If this were written today, it would be 700 pages and part 1 of a trilogy of novels.

In Web, a bunch of idealists hoping to create Utopia wind up on a remote island infested with intelligent - and lethal - spiders. Most of the characters are not well-developed, but stand in for stereotypes, but this is a very exciting book once it gets going. The implication is that the spiders mutated after humans did A-tests, so we are about to reap what we've sown. Wyndham's writing is crisp and clear, and the only problem I have with the book is the lack of depth in the characters. But the plot is terrific."},{"Title":"Web","review":"I very much wanted to like this book enough to give it five stars, but the truth is giving it four stars may be generous. The concept behind the novel is brilliant. Unfortunately, the delivery of the story is erratic. While some reviewers suggest only Wyndham fans would enjoy the book, I would tend to disagree. In a better developed form, this book could have enjoyed wider acclaim.In a book about hostile spiders, Wyndham lays the setting for more than half of the book. Past the halfway point, the reader finally meets the spiders, who are introduced as a \\"brown patch\\". Having introduced the villain so late in the book, the conflict comes even later. Thus, the ending seems rushed. Having been subjected to nuclear experimentation, the island of Tanakuatua has only recently been declared safe for inhabitants. An idealist, who's dream of building a perfect society needs a site, purchases the island. Upon arrival, settlers begin disappearing and the natives reveal the source of the \\"taboo\\".Wyndham may be better known for other works, but this brief work is enjoyable despite its flaws. The story demonstrates brilliance in political ideology as well as it understanding of biology. These traits make the book somewhat surprising to be labeled for young adults."},{"Title":"Web","review":"The version of \\"Web\\" that's most likely to come up on an Amazon search is a Penguin Readers \\"retelling,\\" intended for children and people learning English.

I had hoped for a version with a degree of attentiveness in Kindle formatting usually lacking in the free offerings.I really feel cheated, as I expected to be purchasing \\"Roman Fever AND OTHER STORIES\\", a work of some 300-odd pages, not one of 10 if that.

A modern day fable set on the old premise of a love triangle. Asarella is the apprentice to the centuries old and mysterious arch-mage Eliwho. Eliwho finds great potential in his apprentice if he can only curb her brash and impetuous ways. Asarella's recklessness quickly gets herself in trouble as the story opens. She's concerned about the people held captive by the devil of Sibilla in his gloomy abode, including the young, and handsome prince Mizyar. When Eliwho refuses to aid them, Asarella decides to go off on her own.The devil she finds is not what she expected. No horrific beast but a darkly handsome man who is prim and proper and amused at this upstart young girl who seeks to challenge him. When a love potion goes awry, Asarella finds herself now a prisoner by choice in the castle and now herself the object of affection by the Devil himself. Soon trouble comes to call on Eliwho in the form of another devil, the Devil Rakne who has a long-standing grudge with the arch-mage. Force to flee, Eliwho soon makes his way to the castle where his apprentice is and the two rival forces of darkness find themselves engaged in a battle that neither can win. And what's more, the Devil Rakne now seems to have become infatuated with Asarella himself. The young apprentice now is trapped between the two devils and her master.Masca seems to have been a bit influenced by the work of Neil Gaiman's Sandman and Death characters with their young, good-looking, yet modern gothic look and overtones. Kim however, infuses the tale with a degree of humor not found in Gaiman's work. Asarella is certainly the most intriguing character in the book. The fact that everyone becomes infatuated with her would definitely point to there being more to the young apprentice than meets the eye. Kim has a lush, detailed style of art that seems well-suited to the subject matter. I found the story moved really well and was quite easy to follow, something I can't say for all Manga I've read. A good start to the series and I certainly look forward to seeing much more.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Masca 1","review":"This would be my favorite Manhwa so far and i have read plenty of them.

Work was a major proponent of the point count bidding system--then an exciting idea and an important leader in the introduction of bridge to America. This book, including the 'new' 1926 Laws of Bridge, was the latest and most up-to-date when published. Of course, eighty years of play do change things.In his introduction, Work predicts that Auction Bridge has finally settled down and would remain unchanged for a long period of time. It's ironic that this book was released the year after the game of Vanderbilt detailed the rules for Contract Bridge, the form of the game that quickly replaced Auction Bridge.While much of the play aspect of the game is identical to that outlined by Work, and the 'Absurdities' section is priceless--including myths still heard today, the major value of this book is as a retrospective look at a form of the game that was once hugely popular but that has vanished over time.Real students of the game of bridge will enjoy having this document in their libraries."},{"Title":"Hypnography for Men","review":"I admit I was somewhat skeptical when I first ordered, but now I'm convinced.

Until then, I'll just do it the old way. I studied astrology for about seven years with the late Ivy Jacobson, who was without a doubt the best astrologer around and whose books, while difficult to find these days, are absolutely the best, with the rare exception of a couple of others, &quot;The Morinus System of Horoscope Interpretation,&quot; published by the American Federation of Astrologers, for example (J.B. Morin wrote his incomparably logical books in France in the 1660s). As a result of learning with Ivy Jacobson, the charts I've done have always been extremely accurate in their predictions, right to the day. Her methods are the most complete and precise there are. Most astrologers either overlook, or are completely ignorant of, much of what she has to teach. As the astrologer who directed me to her said to me: &quot;If you really want to learn astrology, go to Ivy Jacobson. She's the best teacher there is.&quot; So, dear readers of astrology, if you really want to learn this golden science to perfection, look up the American Federation of Astrologers, located in Tempe, Arizona, and ask them for a list of the books of Ivy Jacobson. Get whatever you can and gobble it up! I doubt, however, that they are printing her correspondence course. But good luck in your studies. Astrology is the very heart of the occult sciences, and worth every ounce of trouble it takes to learn."},{"Title":"The New Way to Learn Astrology","review":"Not bad for a novice, however if this is the method of Noel Tyl, why didn't Noel Tyl write the book? Does Basil Fearrington not have his own method to the teachings of astrology, or was he simply paid by Noel Tyl to sing his praises?"},{"Title":"The New Way to Learn Astrology","review":"Basil Fearrington's &quot;New Way to Learn Astrology&quot; is one of the few astrology books that can be read from cover to cover rather than being used just as a reference book. The author expertly guides the reader thoroughly through astrological symbolism and interpretation. Numerous examples make concepts easier to comprehend. Each chapter is followed by a summary and a quiz (with answers in the back) allowing the reader to build quickly on their acquired knowledge and rapidly gain confidence in their abilities.This book solidly and clearly presents information useful to beginners as well as seasoned astrological students -- and is a wonderful review for practicing professionals. Rather than being just another book with a &quot;cookbook approach&quot; where the reader looks up a planet in a specific sign or house, this text teaches the student how to understand concepts and make their own meaningful interpretations based on their acquired knowledge.The organized, systematic approach concisely and efficiently ties together interconnected concepts into a practical, meaningful, and complete horoscope interpretation.I am a full-time astrologer and have selected this book as the text for the classes I teach. The information allows students to quickly tie together their knowledge and efficiently approach interpretation.This book packs quite a punch! Clarity and content make this the first book I recommend to people seeking to begin or enhance their astrological knowledge."},{"Title":"The New Way to Learn Astrology","review":"Basil Fearrington's book, and it is Basil's book, reflects many years of skeptical and thorough research done by himself to prove that astrology works. In the New Way to Learn Astrology, he adopts Noel Tyl's method of teaching students not only about why astrology works, but how they can achieve an in-depth understanding in a short period of time. Directed toward the novice, New Way delivers what it promises: a clear and concise study wrapped around an intimidating subject. Many students are misled by books that throw jargon and &quot;cookbook recipes&quot; together, which only gives the impression that we are lost to the influence of planets. This unintended error leaves astrology with a mask better suited for fortune tellers and soothsayers as science and skeptics tear apart a valuable tool. Yes, Noel's application of psychological need theory applied toward astrological symbols is in this book. But there's so much more. Hemispheric influence, parental and environmental effects during childhood, complex aspect structures, retrogradation, progressions and transits are all included in this text. There's even a section on the misunderstood and often excluded quintile and quindecile! These rare pieces of information are needed by experienced astrologers, who have become reticent in adopting new ideas that will improve their art. And yet, this book begs for a second edition. The only two changes I would like to suggest involve the chapter on computers and astrology and the lack of a glossary. New students may be uncomfortable with new terms such as orb, meridian and nadir. And while these are mentioned within the text, having a glossary would help many maintain the speed with which the book promises. The chapter devoted to computer use is an excellent idea, but the book falls short with only five pages devoted to it. While the concepts of sidereal time and time zones are the best explained of any beginner book on the market, there's a need to explain further what a computer can truly accomplish. With various software on the market, including freeware, there's no explanation as to how to figure whether you've used your software correctly or not. Surely, there could have been a page or two more to help us discern what we want a program to do. Hopefully, New Way will continue the changes aimed at creating a better astrological consultant. Symbolism and psychology do indeed hold a greater future for astrology, than its immature predecessors of fatalistic magic and stereotyping. This is a must have book for your shelves."},{"Title":"The New Way to Learn Astrology","review":"This book is a great learning text that helps to keep the student of beginning astrology focused. Each chapter ending with a summary and quiz is a wonderful help for reinforcement. And, while the basic signs, planets, aspects, and houses are covered, Fearrington also covers keys to interpretation that are not often seen in beginner texts, such as the Aries Point, configurations such as the Grand Trine and T-square, the quindecile, the meaning of Saturn Rx., and hemispheric emphasis. Chart examples of well-known figures are used in this very readable, easily understood text. It provides an excellent beginning place for anyone wanting to learn to be an effective astrologer who can cut to the chase quickly, as well as a refresher with some new perspective for those who already have some astrological experience. This is well worth the time!"},{"Title":"The New Way to Learn Astrology","review":"Basil Fearrington has taught the Noel Tyl method in South Africa and now teaches it through this book.

And what a boost that is to beginners (I've seen the excitement in the students I teach.)The author has done an excellent job of organizing the material in a logical fashion for learning and still manages to appeal to the seasoned astrologer.One of the best features of this book is that it teaches concepts that can be applied over and over in various combinations.I highly recommend what is truly a &quot;New Way to Learn Astrology.&quot;"},{"Title":"The New Way to Learn Astrology","review":"Basil Fearrington's The New Way... is an incredibly helpful book for those eager to enter into no nonsense, real life astrological analysis.

Get deep inside the head of a fascinating character, Wilton McCleary, former Civil War POW and now a cop/detective. Kidnapping, plot twists, the story unfolds like a screenplay as you can better than see, taste, hear, smell- and because it is written in the first person- even feel the story. Like Carr and Peters, you feel the era. The story unfolds, and enfolds the reader.

This was a story that was too short -- can't wait to read the next installment."},{"Title":"The Killing Breed","review":"I am a fan of historical mysteries but have always yearned for a book that realistically recreates the past rather than paint it with a cozy glow. I have finally found what I've been looking for in Mark Graham's The Killing Breed. Graham masterfully evokes the rich squalor of nineteenth-century Philadelphia in this murder mystery featuring police detective Wilton McCleary, a Civil War veteran with no illusions about his city or its inhabitants. The period detail feels so real that I would swear the author had lived there. I wholeheartedly recommend The Killing Breed to lovers of historical mysteries, of mysteries in general, and of historical suspense novels such as those by Caleb Carr. This book is the first of a series featuring McClearly. We are in for a treat! Mark Graham is a major new talent."},{"Title":"The Killing Breed","review":"In The Killing Breed, Mr. Graham introduces Wilton McCleary, a Civil War veteran who survived a journey through the Hell of Andersonville. Now working as a detective on the Philadelphia Police, McCleary is investigating his first case: to find out who kidnapped \\"the greatest ratting dog in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\\" from one of the city's premier politicians, Alderman Bunker. He barely gets a lead in the Bunker case when a more sinister kidnapping occurs, involving the youngest son of a local businessman named Archibald Munroe. With the reputation of the police force on the line, McCleary quickly takes the lead on the Munroe case and learns it has more in common with the Bunker case than just the criminal act of kidnapping. And before either investigation can be closed, McCleary must descend into Hell once more to uncover a past corrupt with the deceit of innocence and the treachery of power.Following this treacherous course of events, Mr. Graham's well-paced mystery creates an atmosphere that permeates Philadelphia's antique charm with a physical awareness of the muggy summer haze and gaslight noir in which the story unfolds. The Killing Breed's pages come to life with cast of characters -- from the compelling, self-assured McCleary to the imposing, self-confident Bunker, and the tormented Munroe to the demented kidnappers -- that bustle about the streets of late Nineteenth Century Philadelphia in search of ransom, solace, power, and the successful closure of two crimes. An intriguing look into the darker side of The Quaker City in the 1800's, The Killing Breed blends the dark finesse of Poe with the terse dialogue of Chandler; it is sure to appeal to the tastes of hard-boiled fanatics, mystery lovers and anyone who enjoys a thoroughly entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Killing Breed","review":"I found The Killing Breed to be a very enjoyable read that engaged my imagination as well as my intellect. Unlike other more celebrated authors who turn out banal, formulaic reproductions, Graham writes a realistic story with realistic people doing realistic things. The reader is educated through the story as well as entertained. I read the book in two sittings and almost missed my train stop in the process, so engrossing was the story! I hope this author keeps up the good work."},{"Title":"The Killing Breed","review":"Wilton McCleary is a Philadelphia police detective in 1874, a man haunted by his Civil War imprisonment and the war itself. Now, as the newest member of the force, he has something to prove, and he intends to solve the cases of a kidnapped boy and a stolen dog without the help of his fellow (mostly corrupt) officers.In addition to a compelling setting and an interesting, articulate narrator, this story is exciting and intriguing, while at the same time repulsive. Unlike many historical mysteries, this is not for the faint of heart -- tales of ratting and violence and filth and squalor abound! McCleary occasionally ponders deep questions, but in a plausible way, and the writing is terrific. I look forward to others in this series."},{"Title":"The Killing Breed","review":"Wilton McCleary is a detective with a chip on his shoulder. He feels slighted because he did not get to fight in the Civil War but was taken as a prisoner before he could see any real action. He remained a prisoner until the end of war. Because of this, McCleary has a grudge against society. He becomes a cop and rises to the status of Detective rather quickly due to having the right connections in the department, and not because of job performance.Being the youngest Detective, given the fact he was handed the job and not earned it, and because of his POW status and his anger and not fighting he feels that he has something to prove to his community, his department and all of Pennsylvania. This need for proving himself often causes him to jump into a situation without thinking about it and he also feels as if he can handle situations alone.In \\"The Killing Breed\\" he has the wonderful case of a kidnapped dog tossed in his lap. He feels slighted that he has to deal with a kidnapped dog, but at the same time he is somewhat eager to tackle the case alone. Then he is also assigned to a case of a kidnapped child, in which the entire department is working on. Because he does not like the detective in charge he withholds information that could have been beneficial to the case. It is discovered that both kidnappings were done by the same person but only McCleary knows this apparently. However, he later learns that Bunker (the owner of the kidnapped dog) and Leah Munroe (the mother of the child) both have more involvement then they first let on. In today's society they both would have been held accountable for withholding information but McCleary does not let the department know that Bunker and Leah knew more than they said. McCleary gets a feeling of power, I think, from having information that no one else has.The author, Graham, has apparently done a lot of research because he does indeed take you back in time and lets you feel, see and smell what the city was like in that time. But, he may concentrate on surroundings more than people and sometimes the people are described physically only, but you get no real sense of their thoughts and actions and what drives them. We do get brief bios and correlations between the Leah, Bunker and the kidnappers, but no real connection or empathy with them.However, I do recommend this book and the others that Graham has written. I have all 3 of them and have read 2 of them so far. As mysteries, they will keep you guessing although we are not hand-fed clues as in a Sherlock Holmes or Agatha Christie novel, but we find out the clues as McCleary finds them and we are told what they mean right away.As period pieces, these books are really good. Graham has put in all the grimey and nitty-gritty details and I feel that Reader's will get an accurate portrayal of what it was like to live in that time period."},{"Title":"The Killing Breed","review":"In 1874 Philadelphia, police detective Wilton McCleary enjoys his job, protecting his fellow citizens from the criminals.

The two prime plots intelligently blend into a cohesive and highly intelligent story line.

I also recommend their book Guided Reading."},{"Title":"Matching Books to Readers: Using Leveled Books in Guided Reading, K-3","review":"Matching Books to Readers is a time saver for teachers who are trying to combine the selection process of whole language with the need for students to have phonetically protected texts. There is theory here, but there is also practicality. It provides suggestions for a range of book in a classroom library so that the needs of all students are addressed. Perhaps one of its best features is the leveling of children books in the appendix. This can be used by the teacher to order (names and addresses of publishers are provided) or to provide books for students based on a variety of levels. It is a good companion for Guided Reading. I would reccomend it for any teacher who is trying to develop a balanced reading/writing program"},{"Title":"Matching Books to Readers: Using Leveled Books in Guided Reading, K-3","review":"This book is another great book from Fountas &amp; Pinnell and it is very much like the other Guided Reading book but has more in-depth information. I personally used this book when I was leveling an entier bookroom for the District of Hagerman, New Mexico. This book also came up through conversations at a workshop that dealt with what to do while you are doing Guided Reading. Guided Reading is a wonderful way to give individual instruction to a small group of students at their level of reading. At this time many concepts and strategies can be taught in a short period of time. This book also has a great resource in the back which includes hundreds of books that are already leveled for you! Anyone interested in Guided Reading should buy this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Matching Books to Readers: Using Leveled Books in Guided Reading, K-3","review":"The most important part of this book to me are the leveled book lists. They not only list by title, but also give lists by level. If you are find that your classroom needs more books that are at level H, you can quickly locate the section with level H books. Then you'll know right away which books to order. You don't need to search through the alphabetical lists to locate your level. I noticed another reviewer thought the leveled list section was worthless and I completely disagree. I use both lists all the time."},{"Title":"Matching Books to Readers: Using Leveled Books in Guided Reading, K-3","review":"Fontas and Pinnell attempt to assist us in leveling our classroom libraries so we can better service our students. However, with so many different publishers out there, and each having their own way of leveling, I'm not so sure this book is much of a help.

The useful section is the list of children's books with their appropriate reading level (using their own system, but can be converted to other reading systems). However, when writing a book of this nature it is imperative that the book be regularly updated. This is not the case, unfortunately, so there are numerous trade books left out. The teacher is left to his or her own judgment where the level should be (a very time-consuming process).The other complaint is why the authors chose to have sections of books listed by title and then crossreferenced them by level. The level section is absolutely worthless; furthermore, more than one person obviously has put the lists together for there are titles on the title list that aren't on the leveled list and vice versa. There should be only ONE list, books listed by title. Books also should have the author when it's clear there is an author. Using the publisher or book series instead of an author is again useless."},{"Title":"Matching Books to Readers: Using Leveled Books in Guided Reading, K-3","review":"our district uses the fountas system for determining if a student is a grade level & this was helpful for getting a sense of where they were & where they were going. great for making sure the books we were asking them to read at home over break were appropriate & for reading aloud books that they would be expected to read in a year or so. the groups of 50, 100, 200 frequent words this system also uses were online, good for flashcards."},{"Title":"Behind the Ballot Box: A Citizen's Guide to Voting Systems","review":"Very well written and easy to read, this book is all about helping you pick a voting system. The professor helps you pick criteria that are important to you. Then, he explains the major types of voting systems, and explains their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, you get help on how to take those criteria and election systems and determine what system you prefer.In the context of this crazy presidential election, for example, you can compare the advantages and disadvantages of plurality voting v.s. two round runoff voting v.s. instant runoff voting.A must read if you are interested in voting systems, you are a student of voting systems, or *especially* if you are trying to make an informed choice about what voting system best fits your community."},{"Title":"Behind the Ballot Box: A Citizen's Guide to Voting Systems","review":"I've earlier reviewed another book by the same author on the same subject: \\"Real Choices/ New Voices,\\" as well as another book on the same subject, \\"Electoral Systems: A Comparative Introduction,\\" by David M. Farrell. I gave the first one 4 stars, and the second 5, which poses a problem. I really want to show this book as a lot better than Amy's other book, but still not up to the Farrell book. But I cannot give it 4 1/2 stars, so you'll have to note, if you read this review, that I certainly mean to rank it higher than the 4 star figure I gave it, but the existence of Farrell's excellent book precludes my giving it a full 5 stars.Amy states in this book that most proportional representation (PR) advocates fail to acknowledge the negatives of PR and only mention its good points. What he fails to reveal in this comment is that Amy himself, in his other book, is guilty of this! This book, by contrast, is far more balanced, and this makes it a much better book than Amy's other one.I would certainly be more inclined to recommend this book, as giving a more balanced treatment of different voting systems and their advantages and disadvantages than \\"Real Choices/ New Voices.\\" However, the very best book on this subject I've seen, excluding a long out of print book by Lakeman and Lambert, is \\"Electoral Systems: A Comparative Introduction.\\" David M.

This book has helped me organize projects for programming-in-the-large. I have been using GPSS, this book has also been helpful in my search for an alternative simulation approach and software that is object oriented. I found Psim portable and very useful in applying OO concepts in my simulation projects. Overall I believe this book is a very good as a supplemental book on simulation with OO programming."},{"Title":"Practical Process Simulation Using Object-Oriented Techniques and C++","review":"This book is about an introduction to the process-interaction approach to simulation (first began with Simula, and then Demos), an approach widely applicable in real-time and distributed systems. The approach involves a high level view of a system and is inherently object oriented.As a distributed systems consultant in the Java and FORTE space, I have used this approach in developing distributed systems and I find it very useful when dealing with such issues as: synchronization, interrupts, and communications. These topics are simply and clearly explained in the book aided by case studies. I have used Psim (the supporting software) to test my different strategies in developing this sort of systems. Psim is simple and portable.In my opinion, the book fulfills its goals as stated by the author in the Preface; it presents the concepts in simple and readable terms, and shows how to implement simulation models applying these concepts. The book is also practical as I say in the title of this review as it avoids unnecessary theory, and it assumes the reader to have some knowledge of object oriented programming (C++). When I train customers in developing systems using FORTE or Java, I make the same assumptions."},{"Title":"Practical Process Simulation Using Object-Oriented Techniques and C++","review":"This book starts with a description of objects and OMT and UML stuff. It explains the benefits of object oriented techniques and of the capabilities of simulation. It takes some pages to explain how simulation languages work and what needs to be included. So far no problem. Untill it starts explaining about a barber shop and PSIM (the simulation language developed in C++ by the author of the book). All kinds of process flows are modelled, not only in the basics of the library elements of the language, but also in the example itself. Unfortunately the whole object oriented technique is neglected. For the object oriented expert a good laughter, for the novice in either OO or simulation, watch out for this book and duck.

Ching's publications, this is a fundamental resource to the student of architecture, as well as the practicing professional. The practice of architecture is intrinscially tied to the ability of the Architect to communicate complex ideas to a myriad of persons. To be succesful at this communication, one needs to be conversant in both the written/spoken language of architecture as well as the illustrative language of drawing. The Visual Dictionary exemplifies this concept. Organized around 68 essential concepts of design and construction - concisely written and beautifully illustrated - Francis Ching brings forth clarity in communication rarely experienced in the world of design and construction. I use this book in teaching, in practice, in reference, and in simple enjoyment.

From the first page, I was captured by the poetic nature of the writing. Some books can be read quickly, not so Ramona. Every sentence is crafted so carefully, every description so complete, some passages must be read over and over again just for the sheer pleasure of the prose. The plot combination of social justice and romance makes the book amazingly contemporary. The racism of this book is directed toward the Native American population and their story is a heart wrenching one indeed. The description of the startling beauty of the landscape and the lives of the characters stands in stark contrast to the breathtaking cruelty with which this nation took land from its native population. Ramona thrilled me and broke my heart. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I have Heard Ramona by Helen Hunt Jackson described as a &quot;propaganda novel.&quot; That it well may have been in its day. But &quot;Ramona&quot; has not endured all these years because of a propaganda message. This novel has endured because of the trueness of the characters--The noble Alessandro, the patient, tender Ramona, the faithful Felipe, the just, stern, sad Senora Moreno.Even the minor characters are true to form especially the jealous, vindictive Margarita, the loyal Marta, and the strutting but endearing Juan Can.I rediscovered this book in a dusty corner of our public library and devoured in in two days.A book becomes a classic when it becomes part of your soul. The love story of Ramona and Alessandro has burned itself into my heart where it will remain forever."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I just recently heard of this book, although it was a bestseller around the turn of the century, and was popular through the 20's. Modern readers may find the language and parts of the plot melodramatic and overly sentimental, but the characters are strong and memorable, the story is full of exciting incident, and the portrayal of the United States government still shocks. I grew up in California, but I had never really seen how \\"white Americans\\" appeared to the Native Americans and Mexicans who first lived here. \\"Ramona\\" gives the earlier settlers a voice. Erica Baumeister's review, quoted on the Amazon page for this book, states that \\"the book has the flaws of being created by an author who, although deeply engaged and sympathetic, had not experienced the life she was describing.\\" I don't agree--perhaps if I had grown up as an \\"Indian\\" or Mexican in those times I wouldn't find the book convincing, but as it is, it worked for me. The main characters, Ramona and Alessandro, are \\"fairy-tale-ized\\", but their story still touches, and the book still has power. Helen Hunt Jackson purposely wrote \\"Ramona\\" to call attention to the U.S.'s unfair treatment of Native Americans, but the two essays included in the Signet edition claim that, for all the popularity of the novel, it didn't bring results. For that, we have only our own injustice to blame, because this poetic messenger did her best to right some wrongs."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I thought this was one of the best books I have ever read. You will fall in love with Ramona (Majella) and Alessandro.If you are like me your heart will break, then it will heal slowly, but maybe not all the way.

I recomend this book mostly to girls. It can be read from teens up. You do not have to be fans of history to love this book."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I must admit I read this novel only to get the background on my girlfriend Majel's name. I initially held no respect for its &quot;Great American Love Story&quot; subtitle, but this book really hit me right in the chest. I liked that I was able to extract the characters' personalities from their words and tones rather than from paragraphs of third-person description. I liked that it piqued my interest in nineteenth century Californian history, especially the upsetting struggle of the Mexicans and Native Americans living there. And lastly, I liked experiencing the boundless love that flowed from the simple, strong and beautiful Ramona. A quick, colorful, emotionally satisfying novel."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Ramona, set in early Spanish/Mexican California, weaves the tale of love between the Indian Allessandro and the Mexican-Indian girl Ramona. Rich, deep characters and vivid description of the landscapes makes this novel a great piece of California historical fiction. Through Jackson's powerful illustrations, the racism Mexicans and Indians both endured at the hands of White and Mexican settlers is experienced by the reader. Yet the love story is what makes this book and Jackson's romanticism of the landscape and the main charcaters only enhances Californians' fascination with Mission Revival."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"It has been a long time since I first read this book, but the subject matter will be around for a long time to come. Bewitching love story for which at least one beautiful song has been written, \\"Ramona\\" and possibly \\"Vaya Con Dios\\". It is a love story, one whose emotion most of us will recognize; another time, another place, from our own Spring Time; woven skillfully into cultural differences, that somehow begets bigotry, born of all the little differences that make each of us unique, but also make us strange and unacceptable to others who cannot accept differences from what they have always known.The descriptions of that far removed landscape and time are marvelous. The Old early Missions, the sheep, the priests who visit the valley in the traditional way on foot, traveling on ancient footpaths to bring religion to the people (and keep them religious), all are magical in their simplicity as the author brings forth their tale. She is also one of the first to dare write of things unsavory to the average conscience. She took conditions \\"as they were\\" and exposed them \\"for what they were\\" in the treatment of people displaced.It's a setting deep within the Old Spanish Mission Country of Southern California, among the sheep ranches, and steeped in Spanish Culture, strict traditions, and unforgiving religion. Times were hard, values were strict and anyone not fitting snugly into a pre-conceived notion of a pre-conceived group was hard-pressed to find a life to live in peace anywhere. It is in this life where Ramona grows up, a child of a misalliance between the former lover of the Senora Moreno's own sister and an Indian woman - that's a twist in the story to be discovered while reading it. The Senora, for a variety of reasons you will understand as you read, agrees to take the child Ramona in to raise, although she never accepts her, because she is not blood family. The description of Ramona is captivating, long black hair of the Indian girl, dark blue eyes of the Scottish father - truly she is beautiful, but it is also apparent that her beauty goes deeper than the skin; she is beautiful of spirit as well as of the flesh.Alessandro, an Indian lad, comes to work on the ranch early in the spring to help with the annual sheep shearing. Ramona quickly sees in him something she has never seen before - someone who will accept her for whom she is, without reservation, coupled with a gentle mind and character much like her own. She falls in love with him, adding another layer of \\"difference\\" to her half-breed status.Felipe, the beloved son of the venerable, strong and proud Matriarch, Senora Moreno, who rules not only the ranch but her son with an iron hand, falls in love with Ramona himself but knows he can never take her for his own, for many reasons. Those \\"reasons\\" finally dissolve during the tragic ending of the story and what remains of the life of Ramona blends again into the home she left as a young woman - as she tried to make a new life with a stranger she has loved deeply. As she is delivered back to a life of security, she is strangely serene - but never again will she feel wild, young excitement once experienced with Allesandro, the Indian. I offer one of the last lines of the epilogue - as she finally stands \\"quietly in Filepe's arms\\":\\"...how unlike was she to that Ramona who flung herself on Alessandro's breast, crying 'take me with you! I would rather die than have you leave me!'.....\\"Ramona is well deserving of it's place in Classic Literature - a love and strife story extraordinaire."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I heard about the book while hiking at Seven Falls near Colorado Springs. HHJ was suppose to have gone to the overlook there to write, including parts of Ramona. This intrigued me and so I checked it out. I don't read much non-fiction, so I enjoyed the idea of a history based novel. It was enough of a love story for me to earn points with female friends, but enough of an adventure to keep me interested. One part of the book that I found distracting was the attempt at phonetic spelling of the Tennessee drawl of a few characters. I had the hardest time reading that, which perhaps is an excellent way of HHJ to capture the difficulty of listening to it."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Readers can follow the narrative style of &quot;Ramona&quot; with ease. It does not take a long time to finish reading this book.I like the author's use of a love story, albeit sad and doomed, to shed light on the treatment of Native Indians in American history. You also learn a little about the life of the Mexicans and American settlers in California.&quot;Ramona&quot; can still serve as a reminder of today's social injustices and the role we play in it.Fafa Demasio"},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I admit it...I never in a million years would have read Ramona, if not forced to do so by my history professor for a class in race &amp; ethnicity in American History. However, having said that, I found the book a thoroughly enjoyable read...overdramaticized, yes, but we can forgive it when we consider the original date of publication. However, it is the story behind the story that is most interesting. What Ramona truly is....a middle class white woman's perception of what it might be like to be an Indian. Jackson was an abolitionist turned author in the 1830's. This is her most recognized and extensive work. So the next time you read it, if you read between the lines, you will see HER innate prejudices and assumptions. But,like I said, I enjoyed it immensely and reccomend it as a fun read...but don't take it too literally...it is after all, fiction"},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Sometimes I wonder if there's a point to reviewing older novels. I mean - there's obviously a point to reading them, and Ramona presents a good case for that. But after reading a book like this it's hard to imagine that others haven't read it, or something like it... until I remember that until this past semester, I'd never even heard of Ramona.For those of you who, like me, had never thought to pick this book up let me just say that it will frustrate, awe, and inspire you. The story is one that speaks of epic, sweeping love and loss, but it's buried in pages upon pages of description which, back in the day before the internet, television, and radio, would have passed for entertainment but today just feels as if it's one more thing to push through in order to get to the meat of the story.Thankfully, I read this book for a classroom setting - so three days were set aside for us to get to the meat and actually talk about the themes and ideas in Ramona.Here's what I came away from this talks with:Even in a story, such as Ramona, when the author is seeking to shed light on the issues of the time (specifically the tensions between whites, Mexicans, and Native Americans), in order for Ramona to be related to she is given \\"white\\" characteristics - i.e. blue eyes from her Scottish Father.Sweeping stereotypes are made not only about the whites (and honestly, as far as stereotypes go, they were pretty harsh but necessary ones) but also about Mexicans. Even the Native Americans in this book did not escape judgement from Helen Hunt Jackson.Jackson has no problem spending 70 pages talking about the little things - making a bed on a porch, tension-filled relationship between Ramona and her adoptive family, and so on.. but she spends less than a paragraph on a vital turning part of the story. In fact, the action and result of this turning part happened so quickly I thought I'd imagined it happening and had to go back to re-read it.I understand from our discussions the importance of a book like Ramona and I believe that it's important that it continues to be read and talked about - but more than anything, I wonder how that will be possible with the changing of our culture. We talk in 140 character tweets - so how can we expect young adults today to be patient enough to read pages upon pages of description? It saddens me to think that this story is one of many that will end up lost as a result - so if you decide to read just one \\"classic\\" American story this year, think about choosing this one."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I got the book exactly came how the seller said it was. It was fast shipping and in great condition. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Helen Hunt Jackson's two major books, CENTURY OF DISHONOR and RAMONA were on a reading list of mine when I was a graduate student back in the Upper Paleolith. I didn't like either book, but am forced to concede their value.RAMONA reminded me of trying to eat ten gallons of ice cream. It was too sweet, too melodramatic and I was lucky to avoid death by cloying suffocation from reading it.It is, however, a great example of late 19th century romance. People didn't have e-mail, text messaging, computers, TV or radio. Instead, they read! A lot of them read RAMONA and apparently enjoyed it a lot more than many of today's readers.It is dated, but that is its true value, in my opinion. Jackson doesn't step out of her skin, or her age, when she writes. Some of the dated, annoying stereotypes which roll off her pen illustrate the perceptions of the age in which she lived. For better or worse, that's their value.If you're interested in American Literature, Intellectual History, or regional literature related to California, RAMONA may be of interest to you. I have a copy and enjoy it in small doses as befits an aging Philistine."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I truly enjoyed this wonderfully written work by Helen Hunt Jackson. It is definitely her best! The love story shows how badly Native Americans and the Spanish living in California were cheated out of their land.

The Mexican TV has taken the book to the TV screen. Currently, the production is being presented in a local Hispanic TV channel."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"While appreciating what Helen Hunt Jackson was trying to do with Ramona, there are some aspects of the book which truly bother me. One can't help but wonder at her glossed over, hisoricaly nostaligic view of the mission system in California. The Native Americans who were in this system were kept in virtual bondage and horribly abused, both physicaly and sexualy and were forced to give up the lifestyles that they had known. I think Ramona has good intention, but like Uncle Tom's Cabin, the book it was modeled after, suffers from a severe case of historical nostalgia. It is, however, interesting to read the book from a modern perspective in the sense that reform literature has certanly changeg over the years! A good read, just beware of the hisorical inacuracies."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"If anyone is actually looking for a true tale of the plight of California Indians, don't bother to look at Jackson's novel.It is inherently racist, written by a woman who doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same likes as Upton Sinclair or Harriet Beecher Stowe.On one of her visits to California, Jackson called the Native Americans she saw \\"loathsome, abject and hideous.\\" In her novel, she doesn't stray far from this inherent indignation of another race. In fact, she most likely had no idea she was being racist, another reason entirely why this book should be burned. ALternately thorughout the book, Jackson refers to the indians Ramona and ALlesandro encounter as \\"patient creatures\\" (16), \\"poor creatures\\" (20), \\"wild creatures\\" (47), \\"faithful creatures\\" (353), \\"miserable creatures\\" (324), \\"vagabond bands\\" (286) \\"like beasts\\" without the Christianizing presence of the Missions (231). are they human? possibly. are they equal to the pastoral spanish who enslaved them that Jackson venerates so much? most definitely not.Secondly, ALlesandro could be the most anglicized Indian ever. He is most assurredly an abberation, physically looked like a mexican, was the most devout catholic, lives in a house that is like any mexican villa. INdeed, Jackson remarks that \\"There were not many such Indians as Allesandro and his Father. If there had been, it would have been better for their people,\\" (327) and that he \\"almost makes one forget he is an Indian.\\" (101).also, she refuses to create an interracial love story. the whole crappy book is predicated on the fact that Ramona is half indian. only when she is indian can she fulfill Jackson's debased notion of racial determinism.Besides the myriad moral reasons why this book is so terrible, it could be the most groandiose, verbose, and pooorly written romance book EVER. the characters lack any moral ambiguity which would make for interesting characterization and are constantly marked by sweeping romantic gestures that could better be classified as trash fiction than a literary classic.You'd find more entertainment from reading the yellow pages than wasting your time. The world would be a better place if the trees from which the paper for this book came from were still planted."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Ibi is right. Ramona has been produced in TV. You can see Ramona at Univision, which is channel 23 at 4:00pm.The actress is named Kate del Castillo, and it has been a hit in Mexico and the US.I am watching the novel and I can truly say that is as excellent as the book. This book has everything, it has sadness,glorious moments and mostly the discrimination between Mexicans,Yahi Indians and Americans, if you want to read a story that will keep you glued to the book for the whole day, buy Ramona. Maybe you guys don't know it but Ramona was a hit in Mexico because when Elen Hunt plushided the book, a Cuban man named Jose Marti translated the book to spanish, and he talked wonderful things about Elen's talent to write which was well deserved.I am watching the novel, if you want to see it, is up to you(of course you have to understand Spanish, good I learned in school)Read the book and you won't be dissapointed with Elen Hunt wonderful story Ramona.You will like it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"\\"Pity me,\\" wrote Emily Dickinson, in a letter to her girlhood friend Helen Hunt Jackson, \\"I have just finished 'Ramona.'\\" \\"Ramona,\\" a 19th century wild West romance that inspired a spate of 20th century movies and a swing era band standard title song, is more readable than one might think, written by American author Jackson, who deserves to be better remembered. I only got into Helen and her work myself because of my interest in Emily and her world. \\"Ramona,\\" though wonderfully well-written and still readable, even historically important, is a 19th century romance, and therefore not \\"literature,\\" properly speaking, nor likely to turn up as required reading in any academic curriculum anytime soon. It's not easy for us today to imagine that age, back when the much more famous Emily Dickinson was still completely unknown, in which the too young death of Helen Hunt Jackson inspired a national day of mourning.Much of the historical interest of \\"Ramona\\" swirls around one of America's forgotten wars, much like Korea, in this case the Mexican War. To this day, Mexico still resents the loss of about half of itself to the burgeoning US, ceded to us by a corrupt pusillanimous Mexican government as essentially spoils of war, with matters considerably complicated by the discovery of gold in a huge chunk of it, California, a couple of years later. The issue in \\"Ramona,\\" however, has principally to do with the fates of the population of the vast new territory at the time, namely its Mexicans and Indians. The tragic destruction of their wealth, ancient land titles and treaties, communities, culture and even people at the hands of the inrushing American population, all under the diffident benign neglect of Washington government, barely stopped short of softcore genocide. Jackson, already a famous writer, as a young New England widow, relocated to the West for health reasons and subsequently remarried, was one of those American thinkers of the day who discovered and got interested in the plight of this displaced, distressed population as a social issue.Jackson wrote a detailed survey of the crisis, with which she bombarded congress, only to get no palpable reaction. Accordingly, she decided that what was really needed was some sort of public outcry, inspired by some sort of popular literature, after the model of her friend and fellow New Englander Harriet Beecher Stowe's \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\\" which had so inflamed the nation as to inspire the Abolitionist movement. The resulting opus was \\"Ramona,\\" the story of the doomed romance of a half breed Mexican rancher's daughter and a young Indian brave, their affairs caught up in the tidal wave of US immigration into their ancestral lands, and it's a dandy. No chick-lit here; it's a much different wild West as seen through the eyes of someone who actually lived there, written by a gal with a real gift for descriptive prose, eye for local color, and a keen insight into the inner motivations of her characters.In one sense, the book was a success; it was a huge best seller, and Emily Dickinson wasn't the only reader, by far, who adored it. In another sense, it failed, perhaps by being too good... certainly a far superior book to \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" The same general public who were enthralled by its vividness somehow never internalized its story as depicting a real national crisis about which someone ought to do something. In defense of Washington, it must be said that the tiny government of the day, what with Indian wars, Reconstruction and such, already had enough on its plate to tremendously complicate things politically for them, even without such a vexed issue as this one. However that may be, Jackson was not about to give up, continuing to tour and write about the Southwest despite her mounting health problems, which, unfortunately, killed her a couple of years later, with her dreams of social justice still unrealized. The legacy: a ripping good story that lived on for a long time after its author. Not to mention an ongoing sociopolitical crisis with which anybody who knows the Southwest at all is only too familiar."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I AM 79 YEARS OLD AND 'RAMONA' IS THE FIRST REAL BOOK I EVER READ (UNLESS YOU COUNT DICK AND JANE).
