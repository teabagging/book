Casteneda has gone through many steps in his personal life, and he has, over many years, tried to let the reader into his world. Casteneda's &quot;reality&quot; is pure and beautiful, and it becomes &quot;real&quot; to us as we read. &quot;we must look &quot;beyond&quot; if we want to know the truth&quot;.

Indeed Castaneda has written a dozen books and there is a kind of progression along the different volumes.When reading Castaneda's books one must keep in mind that the use of psychotropic substances was not an end.It was used by Don Juan in order to show Carlos that his mental, his perceptions were totally subjective, relative, arbitrary.The following 99% of the way of the warrior have nothing to do with the use of those plants.In this book you will find the description of the fundamental concepts used by Don Juan : tonal/nagual, impeccability, personnal power, controlled crazyness,...A very good read to start with Castaneda's writings."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I realize that there is some controversy surrounding this book and that there are quite a few who believe that Castaneda did not base this book on actually fact. I think that this is very likely but in the end I do not care. What I read in the book was the story of a man who is intrested in Shamanism and the exploration of realm of consciousness that one would not normally have acces to. Whether Don Juan was an actually person or simply an alter ego of Castaneda is not really the point. This is one mans journey of self discovery and I throughly enjoyed it on that level. While I would never try any of the stuff mentioned in this book I do find it inspiring in that it encourages one to look at their perception of reality and what really is ordinary. Is this a factual scholarly refrence? Probally not. Is it a very entertaining and intresting book? Without a doubt!"},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Carlos Castaneda's 'Yaqui' series are, for better and worse, in a class by themselves and one of the most enduring documents of the 60's counterculture. The case can be made that the events described in the series did not occur. However, even Castaneda's most thorough critic (Richard de Mille) is left with admitting that, if Castaneda did not actually work with Don Juan and others, that Castaneda cribbed from excellent anthropological and ethnographic sources. If one accepts that these works are, in essence, fiction, then what sort of fiction are they? The model of the work (both in structure, length and subject matter) appears to be Plato's 'Republic': an instructive dialog on the nature of reality and the proper way to live. Set aside the attempt to lionize or demonize Castaneda, to affirm or deny the 'reality' of the events described and let the work stand on its own. Is it any good? I think, the answer for many people (albeit for different reasons) is 'Yes'. It is 'true' in the same way many fictional works are true. It is 'false' in the same way that many fictional works are false. As for the quality of writing, it strives not to get in the way of the ideas, which, in a work about ideas, is a good thing. One last consideration, from this reviewer's perspective, the first three books form the core of Castaneda's Republic. 'The Teachings of Don Juan' reads like a PhD thesis (which it was) and as some other reviewers noted, somewhat dry. But it sets the stage for the real 'heart' of the series: 'Separate Reality' and 'Journey to Ixtlan'. After 'Ixtlan' the reader of the rest of the series will likely note a number of significant changes in context and, to some extent, style."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I thought I would neaver get to read this story agian. How wonderful to find it and get it so cheep and easy! Thanks, I am verry pleased."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"\\"The Teachings of Don Juan A Yaqui Way of Knowledge\\" by Carlos Castaneda was a real pioneering anthropological study of shamanism, and a door-opener into the prevailing 1960's and early 1970's sub- drug culture.Carlos Castaneda gave us a new look into the possibilities of various realities and perceptions not really understood, and only discussed at late evening dinner parties, or in the dorm rooms of various colleges or, perhaps a sociology classroom here and there.For some reason, the fact that Castaneda was using drugs for research and personal understanding made the book easily more acceptable to a variety of his readers.I first read the book about 40 years ago. At the time I thought it was superb. However, upon re-reading it (at age 62), it simply didn't have the same powerful grasp it once held.The initial meeting between Castaneda and the alleged \\"Don Juan\\" is interesting reading as is the recruitment process into the shadow-world of the shaman. Naturally, there are psychotropic drugs involved, but it seemed to me that page after page, after page was nothing more of recounting his \\"trip\\" experience from the three major sources of Yaqui wisdom; Peyote, Jimson Weed, and Mushroom.The use of such drugs obviously enhances the ideas of what we today would call; \\"Shape shifting,\\" Astral Projection, and various other rather well known terms in today's\\"witchy\\" terminology.Although, Mr. Castaneda followed this publication with numerous other related stories, I think he probably spent too much time and focus on the drugs for surely...there was much more knowledge passed on other than the collection, preparation, and usage of various hallucinogens.None the less, the book remains a major pioneering feat, and is interesting especially, if you are reading it for the first time. It is a contemporary real life story of \\"The Sourcer's Apprentice\\" with Carlos Castaneda playing the role of Walt Disney's \\"Mickey Mouse.\\"Regardless of my somewhat prejudicial summary, there are some very good points of wisdom handed down by Don Juan that should be remembered by any generation who has an interest in anthropology, sociology, and or, just plain...entertaining reading."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I am not really very objective about Carlos Castaneda's writings, my goal is rather to tell you what I have come to value in his writings over the years.This book is the 1st one in the series of about 9, and it has become a bestseller over the course of 30 something years - many, (from what I hear) have had an opinion about this book. Some have become enamoured with the tales that included the extraordinary experiences involving author's uses of native \\"power plants\\". Others wanted to find their own \\"Don Juan\\". And many probably did...What have mesmerized me (and this wasn't the very 1st Castaneda book that i read at the time) was the open spirit with which the book was written. Its mystery and courage in presenting a world where magic and personal transfirmation are indeed possible.It caused the author many problems over the years, much many than if he chose not to become a writer and just remain a college professor. That would be easier and he would ve had a much more comfortable life. Instead, he decieded to go ahead and write sharing with us what came to be known in recent years as the Toltec Path. I write this review with deep appreciation for Nagual Carlos Castaneda (or whatever his name may be now) and I hope some fresher readers will also enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I first read this book a few months ago before reading the rest of the series, and it was a mind-blowing read.\\"Teachings of Don Juan\\" is the first of many books by anthropologist Carlos Castaneda to which he revealed his teacher-student relationship and experiences with Yaqui Sorcerer by the name of Don Juan. The dialogues and experiences lay within this book are rather insightful read.This book is merely a starting point where readers begin to understand the warrior's way and how one would understand one's perceptions of the world and how they can be deceiving. The plants or substances discussed in this book is not the means nor the ends, but merely just a tool, rarely used, in order to shock the author to see what lies beyond and around himself. Merely a step towards being a \\"man of knowledge.\\"Remarkably, as I read through the series, I cannot help but wonder who Don Juan really was and where the sources came from. I recently found the answers to these questions in William Patterson'sThe Life & Teachings of Carlos Castaneda, which is a new profound perspective of the life of Castaneda and his work."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I decided to read this book because it is one of the only texts I know of that deals with the spirit of datura. I did so reluctantly because of all I had read in the past about Castaneda being a fraud--either making up the figure of the teacher don Juan or importing his LSD experiences into the background of shamanism, etc. I had also been given a copy of one of his books years ago and thought it was just a lot of gobbledy-gook. But this book is worth reading.There is good information in this book about at least one person's work with the plant spirits of psilocybin mushrooms, peyote, and datura. I can't speak about the other plants, but the descriptions of how the datura spirit behaves deepened my understanding of this plant. I only wish that the information had been more specific. I am sure also that those interested in working with psilocybin mushroom spirit would have liked to know what the five plants were that were combined with the mushroom to make \\"the little smoke.\\" A lot of detail is missing.But this book is also just a good read. The descriptions of his emotions when he is met with various \\"nonordinary realities\\" is very good. I found myself drawn in and could hardly put the book down.The structural analysis of the experience at the end of the book is not well done. It seems clumsily imposed on the material and does not reveal anything more than an attentive reading shows. That part does read like a grad student paper written to fulfill an assignment rather than to elucidate a subject.The rest of the book makes up for it, though."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I probably would have given this book a higher rating if it hadn't came so highly recommended.As it was I found it disappointing. Though Castaneda gave an interesting account of his experience, the lengthy detail of it was a bit dry. I achieved no revelation, and neither I think did he.Either this book is just too deep for me to understand, or it lacks substance, as I just didn't get anything out of it."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Having read the four main writings of Casteneda in the early 70's, back when most of us did inhale, and then reading them again twenty years later, I am still moved by the wisdom and pointed simplicity of these books. The quest for knowledge is a path which is lifelong, which few of us ever achieve to our satisfaction. Back when I first read this book and the others, I was a teenager in a blue-yellow haze and found great wisdom in what Carlos had to say. And inherent to my years, I knew all the answers to the questions... Now, and perhaps the greatest gift of knowledge, I ask myself, &quot;Have I ever really known?&quot;. This concept is best illustrated by a long ago read line by Casteneda.. &quot;Death is the greatest thrill of all, That's why they save it for last...&quot;. The journey is a long one, and we have just begun..."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"The Teachings Of Don Juan is the first of Carlos Castaneda's epic, nine-book fantasy saga centered on the mythical Yaqui Indian \\"brujo\\" (wizard) Don Juan Matus. In the first novel, Castaneda casts himself as the novice who stumbles upon Don Juan and his ancient magical wisdom, becoming the wizard's apprentice. This is hardly original stuff, we've seen it from Star Wars to The Matrix and in countless space-operas and sword/sorcery epics. Two things make this series unique:1] As in Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" saga, psychoactive drugs (mostly peyote and mushrooms) are used to access amazing, superhuman powers. This lends the whole series a hallucinogenic quality, somewhere between psychedelic science-fiction and primitive mythology.2] Castaneda writes in first person, creating an elaborate mythology from his anthropological studies at various Californian Universities in the 1960's, and perhaps a little personal experience. Written as a first-person journal, you follow the Hero on every step of his journey to self discovery. Of course, Castaneda eventually discovers that he is the Chosen One, and takes the place of Don Juan as \\"Nagual\\", or high wizard. Harry Potter, anyone?The not-so bright side of all this is that Castaneda passed these obvious fabrications off as fact, creating a cult of personality around himself. Former members of his cult went on to write memoirs about their experiences with the \\"Nagual\\". It seems that Castaneda, despite being a gifted myth-maker and talented writer, led a self-centered life which hurt many of the people around him.At any rate, if you enjoy genre epics such as Lord of the Rings and Dune, you will enjoy the unique and transporting saga of Don Juan and Carlos Castaneda. But for true anthropology, look elsewhere. This is just fiction."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Many other reviews have pointed out how remarkable it was that Castaneda was able to write 87 books on his experiences with Don Juan, despite having only spent about 5 minutes with him in a chance meeting at a bagel joint near Times Square. We often hear that Castaneda was comfortably ensconced in the bowels of the University Research Library at UCLA when he was supposedly wandering the Sonoran Desert with Don Juan. However, it's not often mentioned that when Don Juan was supposed to be in the desert himself, he was actually in New York City, getting his hat blocked (in Sonora, for hat blocking, they know from nothing). Their meeting was the inspiration for the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup commercial (\\"Hey! You got peanut butter in my chocolate!\\" \\"Hey! You got chocolate in my peanut butter!\\" The rest is television history).In that encounter, Don Juan also imparted his tried-and-true methods for picking up women in bars and other venues; he was, after all, a real \\"Don Juan.\\" Castaneda has also written about this aspect of the master's teaching under various pseudonyms. However, few are aware of Castaneda's forays into other religious traditions. He was truly an eclectic spiritualist, dipping his toes into the pools of many esoteric waters. Those interested should peruse his many other books, which if not available on Amazon, should be easily found in the \\"used book\\" section of your local Starvation Army outlet:The Teachings of Pope Don Paul II; a Catholic Way of KnowledgeThe Teachings of Rabbi Don Schneersohn; a Talmudic Way of KnowledgeThe Teachings of L.

She haunts the meat counter at the Farm Fresh supermarket and strip mall pharmacy blighting the tranquil tobacco country of her southern Maryland suburb. But Mary Kate bangs out pulp vampire novels in the upstairs chambers of her old house. The reader is warned early in the story of the strains in her marriage.

The police question Theodora with only fellow writer Connor Drake, who has loved her forever, on her side. When a second murder similar to the first \\"Vampire Killer\\" slaying occurs in New York while Theodora is in town, the author knows she must risk her life to uncover the identity of a murderer even as her marriage is collapsing.Though the identity of the \\"Vampire Killer' seems unreasonable and Mary Kate's husband is an idiot, WORSE THAN DEATH is a pleasant amateur sleuth tale. The story line allows the audience to see behind the scenes at a convention and the impact on a family when a member attends a lot of these. The two bites are cleverly explained and the heroine's willingness to risk her life to solve the case makes for a fine reading experience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Worse Than Death","review":"If you've ever thought of being a horror writer, or if you ARE a horror writer, I think you'll really enjoy this book. I'm a struggling writer myself, and I couldn't believe how much I identified with the protagonist and how real the conventions seemed. The strains our solitary avocation put on a marriage seemed too familiar, too.Since I don't normally read mysteries, I can't comment on how well it fits the format of the genre, but I will say that it held my interest, moved swiftly, and didn't disappoint."},{"Title":"The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship: A Critical Introduction to Sociological Poetics (The Goucher College series)","review":"The work of the \\"Bakhtin school\\" -- Mikhail Bakhtin, Pavel Mevedev and Valentin Voloshinov -- during the 1920s has attracted *sub rosa* attention in the US since a translation of Voloshinov's *Marxism And The Philosophy Of Language* was published in 1973; and although an interest in Bakhtin later non-Marxist on \\"dialogism\\" has caused the authorship of that book and *The Formal Method In Scholarship* (to a certain extent always in question in the Soviet Union) to be a source of major interest, these books demand study as works separate from that phase of Bakhtin's intellectual development.Furthermore, although *Marxism and the Philosophy of Language* contains remarks on many topics (e.g., indirect discourse) which would be of acute interest to analytic philosophers, that actually makes this more recently translated work a solider introduction to literary study with critical intent. The intriguing remarks of Voloshinov/Bakhtin are nearly all programmatic, but this study of the earlier period of Russian formalist analysis (works from which can be found in the recently translated *Problems of Idealism*) is thoroughly *substantive*.In the hands of Bakhtin and Medvedev, \\"the study of ideologies\\" is extremely wide-ranging and *never* without its social component, like many works of early Marxist philosophy which prefigure \\"externalism\\" (Hilary Putnam remarks upon this at one point in his \\"Meaning of Meaning\\"-era papers). But it does not exhaust the field of signification, giving the methods given here as appropriate for investigating literary works formalistically a quite definite cast: this work has more in common with *The Anatomy of Criticism* than *Anti-Duehring*, although Bakhtin did not partake of Frye's high-structuralist Bicycle-deck (that is, *als ob* but never *gegenstaendlich*) attitude to signification. As a result, \\"post-structuralist\\" approaches to authorial intent may find a more comfortable ground for interfacing with structuralism without losing the flexibility necessary to do close reading here."},{"Title":"Dawn and the Older Boy (Baby-Sitters Club (Quality))","review":"As a kid in elementary school, I was a devoted BSC fan, and this was one of my favourite books. I love the books where the girls are into boys and dating, and this is a good example.

Dawn hardly gets to have a love interest, those fun story lines always goes to Stacey. So it was nice to see strong, independent Dawn be weakened. Not because I don't like her, but it goes to show that even the strongest people have their moments, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Dawn really likes Travis, but does he like her as much as she likes him? That is the question. I also love Mary Anne's advice to Dawn-you'll see what I mean after you read the book.This book is amazing for anyone who is going through a heartbreak or has already gone through one, it is hard for us to see the truth because we are blinded by our feelings.This book makes me think about one of my favorite sayings \\"Sometimes it's better to forget what we feel, and remember what we deserve.\\""},{"Title":"Dawn and the Older Boy (Baby-Sitters Club (Quality))","review":"In this book,Dawn meets a friend of Charlie's ( kristy's older brother)And falls in love with him.

(The Money, Faith and Lifestyle)","review":"&quot;Financial Meltdown in the Mainline?&quot; was written about 10 years ago. Loren Mead, founder of the Alban Institute, applies more than 20 years of working with churches across denominations to this book. He claims that the issue of church finance came up in the writing of each of his previous books, but that he did not directly address the issue in any of them. He directly address church finances in this book. More than that, he says what needs to be said without sugarcoating the truth.He looks at the financial crisis present in every denomination - churches, denominations, seminaries are all suffering. The cause - Christians are not giving money as they should, nor are Christian leaders speaking accurately about the depth of the crisis. Mead backs these claims up with hard data.I must admit, the first six chapters were pretty depressing. Mead confirmed many of the suspicions I developed during my first two years serving as a church administrator.Underlying the financial crisis, Mead claims, is a spiritual crisis. In short, Christians are serving money rather than God. And Christian ministers are serving people rather than God (i.e., they do not speak the truth for fear of the reaction of their congregation).Mead is a strong advocate of endowments in the face of this financial crisis. He offers practical guidelines for endowment management.Every Christian minister and lay person should read this book. Perhaps the strength with which Mead paints the picture will bring the truth to light in a way that will draw out godly giving from all Christians."},{"Title":"Live Well, Sleep Well: The Holistic Way to a Good Night's Sleep","review":"Contemporary urban life is hallmarked by chronic and habitually insufficient and inadequate sleep for millions of people.

Woodson, main character, Cynthia, takes no prisoner's; it is all or nothing. She gives all and expects all from the people in her life, especially her son, Sean. Cynthia had a determined mother who taught her to live by outstanding ethics and morals, so she expected no less from her son. Sean's mother taught him that no excuses could be made for not taking care of his responsibilities; homework must be done and slacking up on his schoolwork only brought him problems.Sean had his share of growing pains, having to deal with not having a man in his life to lead the way. Super Woman did not let this handicap her son's life; with her guidance he was able to put his hurts aside and become an outstanding man. When one solution did not work, it was on to the next resolution. When Sean had problems at school, she worked diligently to find a school that would give him the support that he needed, paving the way for Sean to reach manhood with stellar academic accomplishments.I enjoyed this book because it shows what a determined mother can achieve. J. L. Woodson wrote an excellent tribute to his mother. It felt good to read a book about a young Black man making it in today's world when all odds are against him. If you like to read a feel-good book, you might want to give this author a try. Mothers can give this book to their struggling sons; maybe it will uplift them. This young author as an excellent writing style and I will read him again, I found this book to be refreshing. As he ages, I expect his stories to evolve.Reviewed By Margaret BallAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Superwoman's Child: Son of a Single Mother","review":"SUPER WOMAN'S CHILD: Son of a Single Mother by J. L. Woodsonis a teenage boy's story and tribute to his mother and single mothers throughout the world. Sean Morris takes the reader on a journey throughout his life while being raised by his mother, surrogate grandmother and an aunt. Through his trials, tribulations and his joys, the one person missing from his life is his father. This is a painful subject with Sean, who goes to great lengths to get his father's attention. Sean must learn to accept and cope with the fact and accept that his father is truly an absentee dad, through no fault of his own.Attempting to make a better life for her child, Cynthia moves to the suburbs of Chicago only to discover racism within the school system and threats within the neighborhood. Sean is shuffled off to other schools, moves in with his father and finally lands in a college preparatory magnet school. It is here that Sean finally comes into his own; accepts his fate and things he cannot change, i.e., his father's apathy towards him. With the help of the school staff and classmates, community programs and his mother's staunch determination, he strives to survive, graduate high school and attend college.From an attention grabbing opening to a fulfilling conclusion, SUPER WOMAN'S CHILD: Son of a Single Mother is a revealing look into the household of one fatherless child amidst many hilarious and sad moments. With a core family, which has Sean's best interest at heart, there are not many goals he cannot reach. This story is a special tribute to a special woman and many women throughout the world. J. L. Woodson does single mothers proud.Reviewed by Dawn R.

Woodson tells the story of Sean Morris, a troubled child, and his mother Cynthia, a single parent doing the best that she can to raise her young son right.I was expecting some kind of insight from the standpoint of the son as to why he was getting in trouble, missing school assignments and not applying himself. The apparent issue of his missing father seems convenient more so than actual and I would've preferred if the author had been more detailed in the action plans the therapist worked on while helping the child became familiar with his emotions.SUPERWOMAN'S CHILD wasn't a bad read; it's just not what I thought it would be as readers hear from Sean's standpoint. And though you see him finally get his act together, the story itself just isn\`t strong enough to hold your interest.While I'm all for suggesting books, I find it hard to believe that a teenaged boy would recommend EVERY WOMAN NEEDS A WIFE to other teenage boys. I get that the author of that book is the author of this book's mother, but perhaps what would've been more helpful is a book relatable to teen boys. I enjoyed the college visits as that part of the story was detailed with rich and valuable history. A few issues in editing."},{"Title":"The Spanish Inquisition: Its rise, growth, and end","review":"As stated in a previous review this volume contains three books, containing 548 pages, covering the rise, growth and end of the Spanish Inquisition. The book begins with an excellent history of the origins of the inquisition. In the Twelfth Century, the Catholic church had a problem it had become so corrupt its congregation had lost faith. At first the church tried reforming itself, which the clergy at all levels rejected. Poverty, humility, and reform, did not go well with the church which had just assumed power over the secular states of Europe. The people who were looking for a less secular form of worship were branded as heretics and the catholic church formed the Inquisition to deal with them. Things of course went down hill from there.The Inquisition was instituted by a Bull that instituted:1. Torture as the means of obtaining confession2. penalty up to death at the stake3.A police force to serve only the Inquisition and subject only to their law, not subject to civil courts4. Confiscation of goods and property of heretics distributed by Inquisition5. The accused is guilty, if they confess they may be shown mercy, if they maintain there innocence even under torture they are to be burned as unrepentant heretics6. The accused could not be represented by a lawyer7. All proceedings were to be secretWhat an incredible system to prove that absolute power corrupts absolutely. After showing how other countries dealt with the Inquisition, the book turns to Spain. How Isabella and Ferdinand, invited the Inquisition into Spain, and used it to their own advantage, reserving the right to appoint the inquisitors their first choice was Torquemada, after him they chose Ximenes. Under these Inquisitors-General the Inquisition was fine tuned as a instrument of terror and repression, not rivaled until the killing fields of Cambodia. This book covers the entire history of the Spanish Inquisition 1483 to 1834. Great detail is given to the exact methods and procedures the Inquisition. This is made possible because the Inquisition like all bureaucracy's kept detailed records, many of which survive today, much to the dismay of the Catholic church and others who would like to minimize or obscure the facts. I have read several books on the Inquisition, but this is by far the best."},{"Title":"The Spanish Inquisition: Its rise, growth, and end","review":"First off this book is not 180 pages as stated here at Amazon. It is three books combined into one volume so it is 192 pages for the Rise,176 pages for the Growth, and 180 pages for the End for a total of about 548 pages. It is a complete study of the Spanish Inquisition, one of those times in history that many would like to forget but like the Holocaust it should be remembered as an awful and horrible portrait in time. We can all learn something from this episode in time. I found the book fascinating but very disturbing. It was something I could not put down. The inhumanity inflicted upon another human being in this book is beyond sickening. The fact that torture was used to persuade others to see the light is even more disgusting. The book goes into great detail with case histories of the atrocities.The inquisitors were nothing short of demonic in their quest to make others believe. Heresy against the church was often nothing more than a way of gaining capital and claiming land. The treatment given to the Jews or Maranos by the Spanish inquisitors , as they were refered to was appalling. It was all business, a body of men assembled to root out evil while they performed evil misguided acts in the name of God.The treatment of the Moslems or Moors was no less horrible. Either convert or be burned alive at the stake after months, often years of interrogation and torture. The descriptions of the torture methods are ghastly. Beginning in 1232 and imposing its will on the \\"heretics\\" for six centuries until it was completly dissolved in 1834 left thousands dead and a schism between races and religions that may never be resolved. The lucky ones were pardaded through town and allowed to be killed (strangled usually) prior to being finally engulfed by the flames for pure spectacle. Miss Pleady is a fine scholar who lends detail to every death chronicled but she does more than that. She explains everything matter of factly about all the participants. She talks extensively about the Kings, especially Phillip II and Queens who perpetuated the Spanish Inquisition along with the Popes. The most famous Inquisitor , Torquemada is discussed in great detail. Ximenes another Grand Inquisitor and a self righteous bigot who is examined leaves these numbers as his legacy, 3,564 burnt at the stake, 1,232 burnt in effigy, and penitents who suffered from confiscation of worldly good and other punishments, 48, 1059. These figures may not be totally accurate but lets not haggle over numbers; the dirty deed done in the name of God is something everyone should know about.Neopotism and hypocrisy reigned the land. Phillip II fathered some twenty plus illegitimate children, cousins married each other for power, at times to have deformed heirs but all with the popes and church's blessings. Bishops became confesors to nuns in the convent only to seduce them. Priests had wives and children while the church was busy rooting out heretics. The book shows the far reches of the Inquisition as it went into the Netherlands, Peru, Mexico. Naples , Sicily, Portugal and elsewhere. The account of Martin Luther is discussed and why the Inquisition had difficulty sprawling out into Germany. The full dynamics of the wreched Inqusition is fully analysed. From the beginnings to the end it is all here. The torture chambers ,the covered and cloaked inquisitors, the igniting of the faggots and the smell of burning flesh, the screams, the brave martyrs, the men who did this wrong in the name of religion, it is enough to make one sick and worse than any horror movie. Read it for yourself you be the judge about the things people do in the name of God."},{"Title":"The khalifate of the West,: Being a general description of Morocco,","review":"Macekzie writes presumably the early part of the 20th Century about Morocco which he describes as the \\"Caliphate of the West\\" I say the early part of the 20th century because he begins the book discussing the \\"Sick man of the East and the sick man of the West\\" The eastern sick man being Abdul Hamid the second the Ottoman Caliph the sick man of the west it would appear in the authors mind Morocco itself having not been \\"Uplifted\\" By enlightened folk such as the Young Turks!Makenzie is essentially a colonialist or rather a wannabe colonialist writing to a British audience on the merits of taking colonial possession of Morocco (Vast land, everyone is uneducated, low population, lets just keep religion out of it lets just invade and enlighten the natives with our progressive ways, every element of government is corrupt) You pretty much know the rest. If you have read any of the late 19th Century anti Ottoman dross of the time you pretty much know what you are in store for. The authors arrogance is almost shocking in parts. His contempt for Moroccan people is obvious (Note his description of Tangier how horrified he is that they still wear \\"Native dress\\" not changed since the Romans) He goes on about their not being roads then the next minute points out a road the French built in Tangier (Yes he is jealous the French are getting in there before the British) In fact in many parts it reads like some of the memos pre Gulf War that were being churned out (Evil corrupt government, locals getting murdered by scoundrel government, we will go in there and uplift the country etc etc)The book is basically a platform for invasion, occupation and exploitation. The authors only interest in Morocco is how it can be exploited its people how they can be used. On another note the publishers of this book bibliolife have done a shocking job of reproducing the pictures in this book. They are pretty much worthless as you can hardly see them. I was going to get this from Darf publishers who were the original publishers of hard to get books on North Africa but this was a lot cheaper.

He also has a nice list of recommended readings, although it's only two pages."},{"Title":"Sex For Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry","review":"When I first saw this volume, I thought, \\"It's about time.\\" While we talk behind closed doors of the sex industry, we seldom discuss it openly except as a joke. At the same time, it appears to be growing! And we pretend that those involved in it are not really human beings, people, in fact, who are trying to make a living. As if they were prisoners, we sequester them and ignore them, pretend they don't exist, except when we need what they offer.Of course, I had some cynical suspicions. Was this the excuse that some sociologist came up with when his wife caught him? At least that suspicion was quickly abated.One cannot help but be fascinated by some people in the \\"sex industry.\\" Who are the people who answer the phones on the sex calls? Why do people get involved in making porn movies? The book covered some of that, how, for example, some of the women who do sex calls aren't as stupid as we'd like to think, how they even get some of their ideological points across while on their calls.Some of the text, however, I found to be silly. There was some that amounted to fairly boring and pretty meaningless statistics. Some of the rest of the text I found valuable. How many of the street prostitutes are crack or heroin addicts? How many are physically abused by their johns? And others I found offensive. There was an entire essay on a group in Oregon who ostensibly trains street prostitutes to get out of the business. That in itself is commendable. But they use \\"radical feminist ideology\\" that offends me. While, for example, the word \\"victim\\" has been shunned--replaced with more acceptable terms like \\"survivor\\"-- what the women are taught is still no less than their roles as victims. It's the Catherine McKinnon school of fem-rhetoric, that women who have sex are inherently victims--err, \\"survivors\\"--of the prevalent, powerful patriarchy, and on and on. And men are NOT victims of some of the same workplace politics? It leads me to believe that many of the feminists who proclaim this stuff have never really gone out and gotten a job.What's more, the author of that essay praised the project, despite its weaknesses, for its phenomenal success rate, which I read as somewhere substantially beneath 20 percent. That to me is far from success. Further, if it is success, the women who partake of it believe in the man vs. woman theology that keeps such \\"radical feminist\\" organizations in business. And that's at least sad.The chapter dealing with the brothel industry in Nevada is fascinating. Granted, there's a little feminist speculation (something of which I may be over-wary because I know the institution at which the editor teaches has a women's studies program--some graduates of which I know all too well--of dubious scholarly merit.) But one fact the chapter ignores has been obvious to me for years: among the reasons prostitution AND gambling are legal in Nevada is that the state is a desert! What else would they do there if you didn't have \\"industries\\" traditionally shunned elsewhere! Anyway, there were worthwhile observations and insights in the chapter, and I can't allow a few ideological squabbles to overshadow that.The final chapter went to United Kingdom for reasons I didn't understand. The writers were able to discuss with various English police departments their views toward prostitution. And many of them felt--as do lots of people, I suspect--that legalization of the practice should be seriously considered. It's \\"the world's oldest profession,\\" and despite regulations and the like, it ain't going away.Anyway, much of the book is a bit dry, rather statistical, a bit too pedantic. The subject matter is important, something we really should think about. I wish it had been just a smidgen more titillating, though to have been less serious would have invited the allegation that the writers weren't taking the subject seriously, were perhaps covering up their embarrassment over discussing it.So, despite its weaknesses, I'm glad it was written.

It is also a story of the various people and characters of the time period. For example Josephus Daniels, Secretary of Navy, was viewed by some as an incompetent anti-war pacifist. By others he was looked at as the great builder, educator, and democratizer who created the modern Navy, as we know today. The book also uses the various memoirs, diaries, letters to emphasize the vital roles played in Naval preparedness by lesser figures such as captains, minor admirals and district commandants. The text also analyzes the Naval Preparedness Act of 1916 and its shortsightedness. The Act increased the number of ships from 340 to 497. This was a 46 percent increase but nothing was done to address either the recruitive or training of men to staff these ships. Besch also examines the basic nature of the planning and execution of the training and educational activities that the Navy had undertook in 1917-1918. In 1912 there were 3094 officers and 47,515 enlisted men. At war's end there were 32,474 officers and 49,730 enlisted men that had been trained. Last the book effectively examines the \\"Old War\\" traits of training, or the well to do commissions and the wealthy making major donations or donating their yachts for Naval use. For example, William Wrigley, the chewing gum magnet, donated airplanes and equipment to form the first aviation school at Great Lakes, IL. He also funded the entire operation for a two-year period. In addition, the new weapon systems of submarine warfare and aircraft brought a whole new dimension of training to serve the new weaponry.Pre-war methods or approaches to learning centered around an apprentice master approach to education. Training was carried on at a leisurely pace with small classes learning from an experienced senior officer. The need to build a highly trained technical force created a need for new approaches to education on training. Eventually, a professionally designed curriculum applied to distribute education system delivered an accelerated format to adult students.Michael Besch draws on a variety of sources to paint a coherent picture of pre-war World War I Naval preparedness. He uses a great deal of primary source material, which gives great validity to his work. The book should be very useful to serious students of World War I. It is a scholarly work on both adult education and Naval training.Joe Skvarenina has published five histories on a variety of topics. He teaches creative writing to adult learners and writes a monthly local history column in an Indiana newspaper."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"The Mitford sisters were power-groupies of various stripes. Nancy liked historical tyrants (Louis XIV and Frederick the Great); Jessica liked Stalin; Unity and Diana liked Hitler; and Debo liked the Duke of Devonshire (she was a piker).But at least Nancy and Jessica had some talent. Unity was a rabidly unstable anti-semite, who committed suicide in an extraordinarily florid way. Diana was a rabidly stable anti-semite. Period. So why should we care about this moon-faced woman in a succession of horridly unflattering hairstyles? The author hasn't a clue. She keeps telling us that Diana is gorgeous, but at least understands that it isn't obvious from the photos in the book. She keeps telling us that Diana was brilliant, but you sure couldn't tell from her behaviour. When she was twenty-three, she hooked up with Oswald Mosley, and he is far more interesting than Diana, mainly because he is almost rivetingly despicable. The behaviour of Diana and his sister-in-law toward him (and his behaviour towards them) beggars belief. That this ridiculous creature dominated Diana's life is all you need to say about her. It could be contained in a paragraph. The author appears mightily constrained by the fact that her subject is still alive. Without that fact, she might have had some pithy things to say; but still, Diana is an irrelevant footnote."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"I have been facinated by stories of the dashing and eccentric Mitford sisters. I am familiar with Nancy's barbed wit. I have heard tales of Unity's tragic choices....but not as much about Diana. The majority of the book ( way too much and too much &quot;precious&quot; detail) tells of the unconventional upbringing of the Mitford clan, their weird odd habits and speech patterns, their loves and forays into social and political life. We see Diana as she becomes a social fixture, marries and then begins her foray into public and political forums. The most interesting portion of this book is Diana's flirtation and eventual embrace of Germany and Hitler in the early 30's. It is almost obscene how Diana becomes enamored with the reich's idealogy, and how acceptable the anti-semetic line of thought was to someone of the British uppercrust(it caused me to wonder how prevelant that way of viewing the Jews was in the uppercrust, and did that allow Hitler to advance unchallanged for too long). It is sad to see how this idealogy stayed with her throughout her life. The brief shining moment is the way she deported herself while imprisioned in British jails during WWll.....but this book is a major disappointment. No matter how interesting, how cultivated, how charming Diana is portrayed, her beliefs are repugnant and the casual way she embraces them so wholeheartedly is chilling. The book is too dense, fillled with too much trivia, hard to get involved with and to stay with. I set it down several times. I think is was both the writing and the subject. It barely addresses her life after WWll. How did she react to the face of evil once it was exposed to the world? How did her children endure the legacy their parents forced upon them? It would have been interesting to see if social and political retrubition or redemption was attained and how the British endured the viper in their midst."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"Diana, Lady Mosley, though perhaps not as well-known in the US as her sisters, writers Jessica Mitford (_The American Way of Death_) and Nancy Mitford (_Love in a Cold Climate_ and _The Pursuit of Love_), is a notorious figure in her own right.Marriage at eighteen to brewery heir Bryan Guinness thrust Diana into the limelight; she quickly established herself as one of the 'bright young things' who dominated the London social whirl. She knew everyone from Evelyn Waugh (his book _Vile Bodies_ is dedicated to Diana and Bryan) to Lytton Strachey of Bloomsbury fame, and became the very image of a glittering social hostess. I say 'image' because only a few years into her marriage Diana was swept off her feet by Oswald Mosley, a promising politician and successful lady-killer whose motto was 'vote Labour; sleep Tory.' Diana was later to claim that meeting Mosley, her 'kindred spirit,' had made her realize how empty her life was, how intellectually unsatisfying.Leaving her husband and two young sons and living openly as the married Mosley's mistress, Diana soon became a convert to his political philosophy, which by this time had ripened into fascism. Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists, was an unlikely populist, retaining, like Diana, all the trappings of aristocratic life.During the years before she finally married Mosley Diana spent much of her time in Germany. Partly to further Mosley's career, Diana established herself in Hitler's inner circle. Her younger sister Unity, a rabid Hitler groupie, was to attempt suicide after the declaration of war between Britain and Germany, but Diana was more hard-headed than Unity, for whom Hitler and fascism were twin passions. Diana's intellectual acceptance of the fascist philosophy seems much more shocking by comparison, signifying a cold-blooded determination to minimize or deny the 'tricky bits,' as she was later to call them.After the declaration of war, Diana and Mosley, now married and parents of two baby boys, were imprisoned at the direction of Winston Churchill, Prime Minister and Mitford relation. Diana and Mosley saw this as a vindictive and senseless act, but they were locked away for nearly four years nonetheless, emerging into a world in which they had no real place any more.Most of Jan Dalley's _Diana Mosley_ concerns the tumultuous years I have briefly summarized. Dalley, although considered too uncritical of Diana by a number of reviewers, provides a balanced account of Diana's life and times. In a very real sense, allowing the unrepentant Diana to speak for herself serves to underscore both the moral bankrupcy of fascism and the 'banality of evil,' as Hannah Arendt termed it."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"Actually, this book is more a history of a whole family - notably the Mitford sisters - than a biography of an individual in the strict sense. Since the author was dependent on published sources and was denied access to the private correspondence of both Diana and Sir Oswald, it is up to the reader to take a view on the macro issues. Was Diana a fully fledged fascist? Well, up to a point, but she would have been against the Holocaust had she known of it in the 1940s. Or so we are led to believe. So maybe it's best to describe Diana as a drawing-room fascist. She was one of the very, very few people to have known quite well both Hitler and Churchill, yet she seems to have distanced herself from politics for the most part. In an interesting sidelight, we learn that Churchill wrote to the governor of Holloway, where she was imprisoned under the 18b regulations, suggesting she could take more baths than were allowed to other prisoners. This offer she rightly refused. Yet, in this biography, you never feel you know Diana intimately. She is usually publicly aloof, intensely private and obviously forever loyal to Sir Oswald. Her later life, following her husband's death in 1980, is very sketchily described. Dalley's study is an interesting gallop through a fascinating life. The dynamics of family life are the strongest point. But it will be left to future studies to analyse fully Diana's personal impact on the turbulent times she witnessed and, perhaps, helped to mould."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"While this book may seem interesting to those unfamiliar with the writings by and about the Mitford sisters, to a rabid Mitford fan it may fall flat. The author did not have access to Lady Mosley's letters (although she did have Lady Mosley's cooperation with the book), and the result is a biography entirely lacking in the Mitford charm and wit. Little new information is brought to light, personality is taken into little account, and at times the book is muddled and repetitious. While the author obviously did extensive research, the book was not a pleasure to read - which is a first, in my opinion, among the many books by and about Mitfords. Perhaps Charlotte Mosley, who did such a masterful job editing Nancy Mitford's and Evelyn Waugh's letters (&quot;Love from Nancy: The Letters of Nancy Mitford,&quot; 1993; and &quot;The Letters of Nancy Mitford &amp; Evelyn Waugh,&quot; 1996, both Houghton Mifflin) might get her hands on some more letters and publish them? The correspondence of all of the sisters would be a massive tome - but massively entertaining. Unlike this new biography. I'm very sorry, but it's true."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"It is difficult for most people living at the beginning of the twenty first century to understand the attraction Adolf Hitler had for intelligent, civilized people. &quot;Diana Mosley&quot; helps us understand by telling the story of an upper class English couple who were seduced by Hitler's charm. It's too easy to dismiss potential fuhrers and duces and their followers as marginal, uninvolved, and uninteresting people. We need to be reminded, as &quot;Diana Mosley&quot; does, that anyone from anywhere can be entranced by evil."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"Ms. Dalley does a superb job of detailing Diana Mosley's life. Her book is comparable to Anne de Courcy's biography of Diana but has a number of additional details. Her portrayal of Diana as an intellectual who is also a bon vivant is quite accurate. She also somewhat emulates Diana in her own role as an author who offers a bit of sarcasm. I think that is a very good trait!"},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"Excellent in detail of Diana (Mitford) Mosley and her husband, also her family, and occurrences in Hitler's Germany."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"I disagree with the reviews that complain that the subject is not atacked for her political views. It is a obvious that anyone tied who can be directly tied to this view during this period and is established as an anti-semite is morally reprehensible. The author does not and should not even try to attack those views as that is not the purpose of the book. The purpose is to follow the journey of Mosley from aristocratic child to spouse of an anti-Semitic fascist leader and beyond. As to post-war discussions, of course, any normal person would be disgusted by much of Mosley's conduct. Still, that is part of the story.As is obvious, this is one of those biographies devoted to the life of someone who one might assume to be a secondary or even a minor, if any, influence on history. As the wife of the leader of the consolidated fascist union in the years proceeding world war two, one might view Diana Mosley as someone simply in the shadow of her husband. The author surprised me with an extremely well written insight into the significant role of this woman, not in relationship to others, but as to her conduct and accomplishments, for right or wrong, throughout her life. Instead of explaining her in the context of other people, the author discusses events and other people in the context of Mosley.As pointed out above, this book goes against the usual approach of biographies of \\"secondary\\" personalities on the world stage. I have frequently found such books give very little attention to the person's life before whatever significant event or events they are tied to. Here the author not only explores Mosley's childhood in depth, but also all the member of her immediate family. Far more impressively, the author somehow manages to seamlessly maintain the family backdrop throughout Mosley's life. To me, I greatly appreciate a book that has, for lack of a better term, an even approach throughout. I do not care for books, particularly biographies, that start almost abruptly with a short chapter on childhood, then devotes the huge majority on the primary issues of history involved, and finally again almost abruptly ends with a short chapter about death and/or retirement. The greatest strength of this book in my humble opinion is that common flaw is absent here.Finally, the author had took an unusual approach to her sources, both primary and secondary. She relied a great deal on books written by Mosley's sisters and other contemporaries. Likewise, she also relied a great deal on information she acquired directly from Mosley. An academic might have some problems with her approach, as she did not bury the manuscript in footnotes, but it is effective. Where relevant, the author simply cites the materials as the basis of the information in the text. This approach is perhaps a result of the author being a journalist and not an historian. However, that certainly should not be held against her, as William Shirer has demonstrated.Again, I do not hold myself out as an expert of the period. Still, I have read a number of books dealing with the extension of both the fascist and communist movements in a number of democracies including the United States, England, France and South Africa. Based on my previous readings, I had an almost myopic view of fascism in England embodied solely in the person of Oswald Mosley. Besides giving me an excellent insight into the British young aristocratic society in the pre-war years, this book also gave me a new view of the specific workings of the British fascist movement. If you are interested in such things, I would strongly suggest you give this book a read."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"Though I had heard of the Mitford sisters, this was my first foray into a biography about one of them (to be followed by more!). They do have a way of sparking curiosity with their unconventionality and downright bizarreness!I echo some of the other readers' concerns: Dalley does not address how the Mosleys' despicable views were reacted to later on in life, nor how the unveiling of the true evils of the Third Reich after the war affected them and their thinking (from the question's absence, it appears not to have affected them at all, which is even more ghoulish than ever having those extremist views in the first place). Perhaps if these abhorrent opinions would have been placed in context within a panorama of the public at large at the time, it would have presented a more understandable portrait of why these people believed such nonsensical and evil things.While Dalley makes it clear that she was under considerable constraint because he subject is still alive (and while Diana Mosley \`cooperated,' she would not permit quoting of previously unpublished letters or diaries, hamstringing attempts at insight), the timid minimal pursuit of the farther-reaching implications of their bigotry and racism makes the book appear two-dimensional and sycophantic. Ms. Dalley should have posed the hard (and most interesting) questions, and shown the faces of the Mitford children's virulent views for what they are: hateful-and all the ensuing questions of how? why? etc. Instead, she is charmed by the cosmetic trappings and glittering society. These aspects of Diana are interesting as well, but the underlying theme of how she and the others evolved into people who willingly embraced evil (and apparently never disavowed it or apologized for it) remains effectively untapped here. One feels one has read through Diana's daybook-whom she had lunch with, the litany of residences, where she traveled-but without truly touching the heart of who this woman really is and what she is all about. It gives the sense of reporting rather than biography. Again, perhaps that was the result of the subject's stonewalling, who knows?Despite these difficulties, I found the book to be well-written and immensely readable (I would have actually preferred more detail, especially toward the end where time is compressed and everyone's endings are tidied up much too summarily) and consider it, if you have an interest in the Mitfords, better read than unread."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"In the years preceding the second World War, Diana Mitford left her wealthy young husband, with whom she had two small children, to take up with Sir Oswald Mosley, the maximum leader of the British Fascist party. She found him and his cause far more exciting and engrossing than the regular upper-class art and society crowd she had previously ornamented, which was populated with dreary &quot;parlour pinks&quot;. Now she split her time between a love nest in London and Berlin, where she and her sister Unity spent their days sucking up to Hitler and his inner circle. Diana tried to get Hitler to cough up money for Mosley. Mosley himself concentrated more successfully on Musselini, who did indeed secretly provide funds for the care and feeding of British brownshirts.At some point Mosley's wife (yes, he was married too, and on his second marriage) conveniently died. Mosley was faced with a dilemna. Should he marry Diana? Or his other lover, his dead wife's sister. I guess he procrastinated as long as he could, until finally sweeping Diana off her feet for the ultimate in romantic weddings. A small gathering in Nazi Germany: just the happy couple, the Goebbels and, of course, Adolf Hitler. Then they returned to England to continue the good fight at home.Not surprisingly, when was broke out, Diana and her knight in shining armor were incarcerated. The Mosleys' regarded this as dreadfully unfair, since he had given lip service to patriotic concerns by announcing that his brownshirts should join up. The Mosleys' regarded their captors as foolish and dim. But it was clear to even the dullest mind that Mosley would be Hitler's man in England if the was started going poorly, and if Mosley had his way compromise with Hitler would be the next step in the war.After the war the Mosleys' returned to a much quieter lifestyle--raising some of the numerous children they had spawned in their various marriages (those that they were allowed custody of) to become good fascists. They eventually turned their energies to the Neo Nazi movement in England, and Diana used her keen mind to help these thugs, bigots and nuts try to mask their vicious, malignant motives with pseudo-intectual political sophistry.The book is very informative and interesting, but disturbing. The author points out how inconsistent and appalling some of the political philosophy Diana embraced was, most notably with respect to anti-semitism. But the author does not seem to challenge some of their more dreadful sophistries: such as the popular neo-nazi notion that the Jews would not actually have been GASSED if England hadn't come into the war. (with its corollary that England and those other mean countries wouldn't have picked on poor Germany if those nasty Jews hadn't made such a fuss about being persecuted, beated, robbed and murdered!)The author at times seems to be writing a standard Society bio, full of cameos of the rich and famous, and boasts of their devotion to Diana. The author also seems quite sympathetic to Diana's distaste for parlour pinks and &quot;pinkos&quot; (I'm quoting the author here), and to the notion that fascism and even collusion with Hitler is more acceptable than any truck with communism or the Labour Party.Nevertheless, I'd recommend reading it. It is definitely food for thought in a lot of ways."},{"Title":"Diana Mosley: A biography of the glamorous Mitford sister who became Hitler's friend and married the leader of Britain's fascists","review":"Of the many new biographies that I have read recently, barring a few of Prince Charles, this is one of the most sycophantic and subjective. The views that Diana and Oswald Mosley spouted were deplorable then as any fascist/racist views now. The terror and horror fascism caused between 1933 and 1945 in Germany alone, Ms Dalley seems to feel was not realised by the Moseleys. They were not apparently aware of the sinister connotations of their beliefs! They were innocents, merely trying to find a better life for the British! While the Moseleys didn't institute such atrocities as Hitler did, Oswald did spread racial hatred, and caused persecution in England, although Jan Dalley seems to feel that this was a mere by-product, caused by a few unreasonable fanatics.I could go on and on. My other gripe about this book was Ms Dalley's blanket 'condemnation' of the autobiographical writings of Nancy and Jessica Mitford. While exaggeration may have occured it was no more that would occur in any family autobiography. . .who can look at their family objectively????? Indeed, this exaggeration was true of their general characters, and the manner in which they were brought up, and the conventions of their time and class. At least they didn't preach hatred and bigotry.I digress. The duty of a biographer, IMHO, is to provide an objective and informative view of the subject, so that the reader can make a decision for themselves.Ms Dalley professes to offer reasons, not excuses, and seems to think that it is reasonable to defend the deplorable views of this possible intelligent, possibly beautiful, possibly wronged woman with the reasoning that D. Mosely didn't know about the full horror of fascism pre 1945, and hers was an innocent form, as I have said. I feel myself being incoherent in my indignation, so I shall cease. My objective view of this book is that I can only suspect that Ms Dalley is herself a 'drawing room fascist'."},{"Title":"The Night Country: Reflections of a Bone-Hunting Man","review":"I first was introduced to Loren Eisley by a roommate in graduate school who read aloud to me the final essay in this book. It is entitled, &quot;The Brown Wasps,&quot; and if you've never read anything by Eisley, you might want to start there. Among many things, this particular essay is about memory, home, and the place of death in life - themes that run throughout the book whose essays are intimate narratives that intermingle meditations on science and personal history. Having now written these words I feel they miss the mark in recommending this book becuase the themes of Eisley's work seem more experiential than concrete to me, which is the case for many truths about life - truths that can be captured more by the feelings evoked by a time and a place than by mere words alone. And yet, his words do a remarkable job of evoking past times and places, locating them in your present life and providing a context for understanding their meaning. If you read this book, perhaps you'll want to share it with a friend, as my friend did with me, and I have with many good friends since.

It too is haunting, beautiful, disturbing, hopeful, fearful, and immensely imaginative.Here's a taste, from the chapter The Places Below: &quot;If you cannot bear the silence and the darkness, do not go there; if you dislike black night and yawning chasms, never make them your profession.

THE NIGHT COUNTRY, however, remains my favorite. Eisley's vision overlays the human and non-human worlds and examines both over the span of ages rather than years. He will show you tiny snippets of life in a parking lot, shadows on cave walls, deserts, pigeons and childhood memories that will linger in your thinking like dinosaur footprints impressed in mud and baked to permanence by hot volcanic ash. You may choose not to follow that trail again, but I assure you it will remain vivid. Consider the return of an old man to a boyhood home after more than a half century, eager to see the cottonwood tree he and his father planted together. It was the tree his father had promised would provide Eisley with shade in his old age, where he might sit and remember his Dad; a tree that had grown and blossomed and flourished year after year in Eisley's thoughts and dreams; a tree under whose branches Eisley figuratively lived his entire life. Gone. For, who knows, fifty years? And yet, what tree could have been more real, more alive? Like a field mouse displaced by developers, pigeons abandoned with an archaic train station, a bum dying in a depot, or a wasp fading into the chill of autumn, Eisley knows that the shadow he casts on a hotel wall will be that of another man tomorrow, and all shadows fade together into the night."},{"Title":"The Night Country: Reflections of a Bone-Hunting Man","review":"Until recently, I had never heard of Loren Eiseley. I was turned on to this book by someone's blog, where they had mentioned digging it up in a bookstore somewhere and taking a chance on it. The blogger had been thoroughly impressed and as he himself was an author that I liked, I decided that the book would be worth checking out for myself.After even the first chapter, it was easy to see that Eiseley was an incredible author and that he wrote with a style that differed markedly from anyone else I'd read before. I was glued to this book from cover to cover and it was a wonderful, mysterious and thought provoking experience from beginning to end. You never know exactly where the book will take you as you read through it, but you're never disappointed by where you end up at each chapter's end.I can't really compare this book to most others that I've read, as those aren't quite the same type of writing, but to give some sense I would say that if you like Carl Sagan, Eiseley would definitely appeal to you. It's definitely different subject matter from Sagan's work, to be sure, but in the same way that Sagan does, Eiseley provokes your thoughts and challenges you to re-evaluate your beliefs about life, nature and the human condition. Like Sagan, Eiseley will take you on a journey that you won't soon forget.I'm definitely looking for some more work by Eisely and I would highly recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"The Night Country: Reflections of a Bone-Hunting Man","review":"Eiseley was an anthropology professor in Philadelphia [U. of Penn.] who wrote more about the human condition than about anthropology, alone. This somewhat rambling series of thought-provoking essays recounts experiences of the author during anthropological explorations. He tells, for example, of the reasons why he is \\"the man who didn't find the skull.\\" That is, he thinks he never became a more famous anthropologist because of three missed opportunities: the cave of spiders, the owl's egg, and the old man out of the Golden Age.Near Carlsbad, NM, he was hunting for evidence of an ice age man when he found a cave that had more recent traces of man . . . and a crevice that might lead to more ancient findings. As he crawled into the passage, Eiseley encountered a low-roofed chamber that had a velvet-like ceiling. Millions of daddy long legs! When the light hit them, they dropped off the ceiling. \\"All I know is that up out of the instinctive well of my being flowed some ancient, primal fear of the crawler, the walker by night.\\" He retreated.The second chance was a cave at the top of a rugged canyon. As he entered the opening, an owl flew out, leaving an egg unattended. Beneath the egg and nest, all sorts of treasures might exist, but Eiseley couldn't disturb it because he knew the owl species was endangered. \\"Under it might be a treasure that would make me famed in the capitals of science, but suppose there was nothing under the nest after all and I destroyed it?\\" [He left it alone.]\\"The old man of the Golden Age\\" was someone who brought Eiseley a human jaw which he claimed was from 20 million years ago. It was embedded in stalactite drippings that could represent considerable age. But the man would not show the cave location unless Eiseley would publish a story saying that the Golden Age (Miocene period) was true . . . that a great civilization existed then. The man was mad or crazy; Eiseley could make no such statement. His pride prevented it, and so he lost the jaw and the possibility of future finds that the man could have shown him.In this book, Eiseley displays a richness of vocabulary and observations that proved his sensitivity to the world around him. He was willing to examine what he considered to be his own weaknesses and shortcomings. He came from a childhood with a mother who was deaf and a father who worked long hours as a laborer. He worried about the profound impact of teachers on students because he remembered how influential some were on his life--both positively and negatively.He marvels that we are made up of elements some of which are dead, yet we live.

I suspect that _Mirror to the Sky_ would actually appeal to a wider audience than his previous books._Mirror to the Sky_ seems at first to lack the overarching theme of cosmic menace and human futility which fairly screams from the pages of Geston's earlier novels. This is deceptive, however. It's all still there, but it is handled in a far subtler fashion, with the customary crushing defeat replaced by a chillingly empty victory that left me thinking about the book for hours afterwards.Highly recommended for Geston fans, and probably the most accessible introduction to his work for new readers."},{"Title":"Mirror to the Sky","review":"Mark Geston's fifth novel (and first in almost twenty years), takes an ordinary sf premise and transforms it into a dark brooding novel that refuses to give into the conventions of the genre. Mirror to the sky opens along similar lines to Arthur C. Clarke's classic Childhood's End. As in Clarke's novel, mysterious aliens from beyond our solar system make contact with our planet and appear willing to help mankind in their fashion. But whereas Clarke's aliens, santanic in appearence, ultimately enable mankind to reach transcendence with a cosmic overmind, Geston's aliens appear almost godlike in their perfection but, as time progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that they have their own agenda. Mirror to the sky functions as a fasacinating counter-aurgument to the optimism of Clarke's work. By contrast, Geston's future appears dilapidated and weary, but honest."},{"Title":"Issues in Feminism: An Introduction to Women's Studies","review":"When I came to read this book, it was from a perspective of learning very little about feminism. This book was required for a class that I took, and it was perhaps the only book I took away from college with a continued interest to read again and more thoroughly. I am not the most learned scholar on the subject of women's issues, but the selections in this book really struck me as perfect for an introduction and to garner passion for the subject, as well as being very educational. Very accessible as well for younger people or newbies to the subject."},{"Title":"Issues in Feminism: An Introduction to Women's Studies","review":"Like many people who read this book, you're probably assigned it for a class. This book really wasn't all that great. There are so many other womens studies books that outline feminism so much better. A word to all of your professors assigning it--stop."},{"Title":"Mathematical brain benders","review":"These brainteasers are challenging--a little too challenging I feel. Most of them require serious work, at least for a casual puzzler and layman, and the reader could use some formal math training or a strong affinity for geometry. These puzzles are distinctly harder than the ones in, say, Martin Gardner's Entertaining Mathematical Puzzles. In other words most of Barr's puzzles are not the kind of brainteasers where you (the casual puzzler) sort of mull it over for 5 to 20 minutes and either get it or don't; these are not the kind of puzzles that you think through on a short drive or in the shower or on a coffee break.To give you an idea, here's a typical one, on p. 54: \\"A draftsman has no instruments but a compass and a sheet of paper which he does not fold, and which can be bought at any stationer's. How does he establish and mark the 6 vertices of a regular hexagon with only ONE placing of the point of the compass?\\" The answer (yep, looked it up) is NOT one where you're going to go \\"oh, of course!\\", that is, not unless you're a pretty hardcore puzzle type with a serious interest in geometry. Or how about this one (p. 37): \\"Any or all of the faces of tetrahedron may be right triangles, with the right angles distributed in various ways. Obviously no two right angles can be in the same face .... What are the restrictions in the case of a tetrahedon which has only three right angles, with two at one apex, and the 3rd at another? Give proof.\\" Whoah! That is a typical brainteaser in this volume. In fact calling them \\"brainteasers\\" gives the wrong idea. Many of the solutions sort of resemble excerpts of diagrams and equations from Newton's Principia. (I'm exaggerating but not that much.) Well I think I'm a reasonably intelligent guy ... was good at math through calculus.... And maybe, MAYBE, I could start to chip away at some of these, but it starts to feel like a chore .... The only respite here is a section in the back called \\"Submiscellany of short puzzles, more or less from everyday life\\", which are more common sense questions or Jeopardy-type questions.... (Even here some of the questions are a bit off, for example \\"What transparent object becomes less transparent when wiped with a clean cloth? It is found in many households\\" The answer is an object that is not that common.)I'd say that, if you enjoy the level of puzzles in Gardner's slimmer Dover books, or e.g. Emmet's Puzzles for Pleasure or Erwin Brecher's Ultimate Book of Logic Puzzles & Brainteasers, and are looking for more of the same, you ought to be warned that most of Barr's puzzles here are another order of difficulty and complexity. I give it 4 stars as nevertheless I'm sure there are people --either more dedicated puzzlers or much smarter than me or both--for whom this book is ideal."},{"Title":"Mathematical brain benders","review":"I am still studying a few of these puzzles.

It involves a respected businessman who disappears while visiting his despicable low-life twin brother . Inspector Monk is put on the case to find the man or prove that the brother killed him, what follows is a very graphic description of the slums of England in the 1850's and how people really lived in those times. Anne Perry does a fantastic job of recreating that period of history. The book is fast-paced and has many great twists and turns until the surprising conclusion at the end. It will definitely keep you guessing throughout"},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"At the end of this book--which features one of my favorite literary characters, William Monk--I still didn't know &quot;who dunnit,&quot; and I felt a real sense of relief that it was OVER. I still enjoyed the book, but it was neither as riveting, nor as satisfying, as her other Monk novels.William Monk, still suffering from almost total amnesia, is still working as a private detective in London in the 1850s. In this novel, with his sidekicks Callandra Daviot, Hester Latterly, and Oliver Rathbone, he is called to investigate the disappearance of Angus Stonefield at the request of his wife, Genevieve. For days and days (and hundreds of pages) Monk looks for clues as to how and why Angus has disappeared. Finally, Monk has to agree with Genevieve that the secret must lie in his relationship with his estranged brother, Caleb. Caleb freely admits he destroyed Angus, but Monk is not able to catch him. As with most William Monk novels, all the revelations come in the trial, where family secrets are finally displayed.If you are a real Monk fan like me you will still enjoy this book. However, if you read Monk here and there, you probably will do better to skip this book and move on to another one. You also might enjoy this book better if you watch Heavenly Creatures and find out about Anne Perry's adolescence!"},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"Good Service from this provider.

I enjoy the progression of the relationship between Monk and Hester."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"Anne Perry cannot write a poor novel. This book is another excellent title from this prolific mystery writer. I especially enjoy her character development and the geographic and historical background as well as the plot.My complaint was I had already purchased the hard copy many months ago and the old memory cells failed me. Consequently, paying the exorbitant Kimble price annoyed me sufficiently to complain about the cost of this novel. Amazon should include the date the books are originally published so old failing memory guys such as myself can control rising blood pressure so frequent during excess purchases."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"When you read a good mystery, there is an after-pleasure as you think back about the parts that did not make sense when they first appeared, and now that you know what really happened, they fall into place. In \\"Cain His Brother\\" the reverse happens. Things that might have made sense with a different ending, now can not possibly do so.We begin with a missing man, a twin. Even with that much information, a solution that proved to be the right one crossed my mind. When the problem is resolved, it turns out - indeed hinges on the fact - that a major character knew the secret from the very beginning and could easily have saved everyone a lot of heartache and more by simply revealing it. His motivation for not doing so is flimsy at best, and he seems to have set himself up for the messiest possible outcome.Two subplots interrupt the flow of this insubstntial narrative. One, about typhoid patients in the Limehouse of London, does at least put Hester Latterly (perhaps a more interesting character than William Monk, the \\"detective\\") in a position to make contacts in the area of the putative crime. The other, about a beautiful woman who tries to disgrace Monk, does not connect with the rest of the book, and remains motiveless. Is Ms Perry trying to hook us into a saga?It is hard (all, right, it's impossible) to read an Anne Perry novel since 1992, and her exposure as Juliet Hulme, without looking for subtext. Here we have a child born to wealth who has an evil side, another born to poverty who forms an attachment to someone with wealth and status, and two people locked in a compulsive, violent relationship. Sometimes one wishes Ms Perry would stick to costume drama or science fiction.But I give this three stars for the Victorian setting and the nuances of class and style. That aspect is marred by a completely anachronistic use of first (or as they would have said, \\"Christian\\") names by people who barely know each other - as likely as men in the 1950s to hug. At one point, where a man seems to give away more intimacy than is appropriate, we are left wondering whether the lapse from propriety is his or the author's. Ms Perry does not write convincingly of the mentality of men: Monk is far too sensitive to colours, textures and the aspects of beauty that women cultivate to appeal to other women, and not driven enough by base passions."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"Ms. Perry never disappoints. You feel as if you are actually a part of Society whenever you read one of her mysteries: she has a master's grasp of that time periods social mores."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"I received the audio book promptly & the shipping package was perfect. I have enjoyed listening to this audio book while doing my needlework. I am looking forward to finding more treasures like this one."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"Perry always includes some sociopolitical evil in her mystery novels about Victorian London, to give her more enlightened characters something to fulminate against. This includes especially Hester Latterley, ex-Crimean War nurse, sometimes her friend Oliver Rathbone, one of the city's leading criminal attorneys, and occasionally William Monk, ex-police inspector turned private detective. This is the sixth in this series and where Monk was the major focus and POV character in the first few books, that role is now pretty evenly divided among the three of them. This series is also unlike the author's longer-running \\"Thomas Pitt\\" series (set a generation later) in that as much as one-third of the plot is set in the courtroom, Perry-Mason-style. This time, Angus Stonefield, successful and morally irreproachable self-made businessman, has disappeared and his wife (who is perhaps his widow) is becoming frantic since until he's declared dead she can't make decisions about the business to provide for herself and her five children. Angus had a twin brother, Caleb, living a violent and ne'er-do-well life down by the docks in Limehouse, and Angus apparently visited him regularly, out of loyalty and perhaps guilt over his own success. Did Caleb murder his brother? Monk takes on the case while Hester joins a couple of socially aware society ladies in running a makeshift hospital in Limehouse during a typhoid epidemic. Of course, Caleb is eventually captured and put on trial for murder, but the evidence is still highly circumstantial since no body has been found. And then things start to get complicated. Unfortunately, through various bits of dialogue and speculation by the characters, Perry telegraphs the \\"maguffin\\" by about the third chapter. It's not a bad book, but the pacing is pretty bumpy and the resolution is not entirely believable. Perry seems to have hit a lazy patch."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"William Monk is hired by Genevieve Stonefield to find her missing husband, Angus. He was last seen visiting his twin brother Caleb, who lives in Limehouse; the destitute part of London. Monk must find Caleb, but no - one is willing to talk.

Another brilliant novel from Anne Perry."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"I read the first five Monk books by Anne Perry several years ago. I enjoyed the initial premise, in which a detective suffers from complete amnesia and has to piece his life back together (something he still hasn't done here in book six). I brought this book on vacation to renew my acquaintance with the series. What a disappointment.Jay Leno was making jokes about Evil Twin plots back in the early 80s. So for an author to dredge up that tired line again requires amazing skill to make it work. Unfortunately, Anne Perry is not up to the task. Honestly, I had the \\"twist\\" figured out by about page 20, and it took another 380 pages for her to let everyone else in on the big secret.Besides the big plot snore, around page 200 Perry inserts a completely unrelated plot, having to do with Monk's personal life. It's as though Perry realized her book was turning out short, so she inserted a 100-page novella to pad it out. Once it is resolved, we return to the main plot as though nothing happened.Monk's relationship with Hester consists of the two of them being as nasty as possible to each other every time they talk. It's tiresome and unrealistic. The stock characters have just become cardboard cutouts that Perry manipulates with annoying predictability.I'm tired of reading comments about how \\"realistic\\" her Victorian stories are. To me, it seems as if she writes with a few books of Victorian information on her desk, and refers to them every time she needs to describe a costume, or find a name for a street. Honestly, people, if you want to read something that evokes the Victorian Age, read Dickens, Trollope, Wilkie Collins. Yes, some of their plots are corny, but they were fresh at the time and are certainly a match for the faux Victoriana of Anne Perry. And if you had already read Robert Louis Stevenson, as I had, you would also have figured this plot out by page 20."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"This is the first Anne Perry book I have read. Therefore, you may take my review as a message to other first time Perry readers, not the fans.I started the book with reasonable expectations. The opening scenes painted a normal murder mystery, perhaps a bit cliched, but decent. Monk set off on basic detection, and all was good. And he reported back to his client. And then he detected. And reported. Again, and again, with _zero_ new information or plot development. In between the fruitless detective efforts, Monk met new people and exchanged social minutiae with his few friends, but no progress on the case.Monk eventually tracks the suspect down around page 200, brings him into custody, the trial starts, and then the suspect is murdered. Monk finds the culprit amazingly fast, the case is solved and the book ends. Why? I don't know. There was little build-up, and pithy resolution, so the book could have continued blithly for another 300 pages.I did not enjoy this book. The pacing was bad. Roller-coaster writing. The plot was cliched: multiple personality disorder and amnesia were the core plot points of this confused book. The exposition was bad: the author repeated and digressed until you knew the scenery in nauseating detail. The characters were simplistic. They, too, were as stereotypical as the plot.I do not reccommend this book to other readers."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"Today I read a used first edition that I bought, so part of my review is my memory of the first time I read it. Unlike some other mysteries I'd reread lately, I had no difficulty remembering the main points -- they made too strong an impression.I thought I knew what was going on by page five. I was correct in one supposition, but the truth was far stranger than I'd imagined.For a time it may seem that the typhoid epidemic in evil twin Caleb's stomping grounds is irrelevant, although interesting in itself if you care about medical history. I liked learning about Hester's version of oral rehydration therapy and blanched when I read about burning tobacco leaves for fumigation. Do not allow yourself to become impatient. It's all relevant and that will be revealed in due time.Is Angus' wife, Genevieve, a cold-hearted accessory to his murder? Did Caleb murder Angus? Is Angus still alive? Why did the author give him the same name as one of the Pitts' cats? (You may ask, but you won't get an answer.) Since we have another Angus, will an Archie show up?What about Lord Ravensbrook, who was guardian to the Stonefield brothers? What's his role in this tragedy? Mr. Niven was unwittingly ruined by his friend, Angus. Does he really hold no grudge?Who is the lovely Drusilla and why is she seeking out William Monk? She's a member of Society, as he isn't. Certainly her many charms give Monk the opportunity to unfavorably compare Hester to her in his mind. Will he live to regret this or does Hester have a rival? Does Hester even care?If you're a fan of Oliver Rathbone, don't worry. He'll have plenty to do during the trial scene. Hester isn't neglected, either. I thoroughly enjoyed her solution to one person's nasty little trap for our hero.Contrary to what other reviewers have said, this book isn't confusing. While I admit to having been partially fooled the first time I read it, once a crucial point became clear, everything made perfect sense. I definitely recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"Perry's Victorian London mystery, featuring the amnesiac ex-Inspector William Monk and the Florence Nightingale-trained nurse Hester Latterly, revolves around the disappearance of a model husband and father of five with a successful business.Angus Stonefield disappears on a visit to his vicious and violent twin brother in the slums and Angus' lovely wife is convinced that this time Caleb - the twin - has murdered her husband. While investigating, Monk runs into Hester Latterly setting up a make-shift hospital to deal with a serious outbreak of typhoid in the filthy and overcrowded slums.Hester and Monk's relationship remains tensely ambivalent and Monk's bitter interior monologues become tediously repetitious. This is a heavily padded novel with an overworked plot device but Perry's fans will enjoy her gritty depiction of hopeless poverty and stark class divisions."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"I love Anne Perry's ability to twist and wind through a story and keep you hanging until the last pages. I also love her well researched novels that offer such exsquisite detail about Victorian London, especially the class differences (particularly in this book). Unfortunately I found the conclusion of this novel truly unoriginal and disappointing. The result it ended with was a thought that had ocurred to me earlier in the novel, but I doubted it just because of the lack of inspiration it required. I am more fond of the Monk/Latterly series than the Pitts series, and &quot;Cain...&quot; is one of the better stories among the Perry novels, but I would definitely read it knowing in advance that the ending doesn't compare with the rest of the story. If you want a truly excellent Anne Perry book, read &quot;The Face of a Stranger&quot; (the first Monk/Latterly novel). A great read."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"This is the best book by this author that I have read so far.Perry's writing style is unobtrusive, somewhat given to unclear pronouns, but generally solid.I found it interesting that nothing seemed to differ between this setting, in 1859, and the setting of the author's Pitt novels, in the late 19th century, except that the Pitts have telephones. I wonder how authentic that is. I found no obvious errors, except that, in keeping with the rest of Perry's books, the women seem very independent for the period.Perry has come up with what must be one of the best characterization hooks ever invented. William Monk suffers from amnesia. He has reason to think he was an unpleasant person, a person capable of wronging others, in the past. But... he can never know what, exactly, he did. I would have liked to see a few more original touches in his *current* character, but it's still a fascinating idea.The plot of Cain his Brother is outstanding. A minor consistency error here and there does not detract from its drama. A man has murdered his twin brother -- or has he? I thought I had the secret figured out several times, but I was wrong. But when the answer was revealed, it made perfect sense. Perry sometimes has surprise twists out of nowhere at the end of her books, but this time she got it exactly right. I remained unclear on one thing --Ravenstone's motivation -- but that may be my oversight.This is a very entertaining historical mystery which I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Cain His Brother","review":"I have read l0 of the William Monk series.

Angus, a devoted family man and successful businessman, went into London's slums in answer to a summons from his twin brother, Caleb - a man his complete opposite in everything but appearance. Angus is impeccably ethical; Caleb has no ethics. Angus is kind and patient; Caleb terrifies most of the people who know him. Many times Angus has returned home after visiting his twin with physical injuries, and Genevieve tells Monk that she knows her husband deeply fears his brother. But the tie of twinhood is more powerful than that fear, and Angus never refuses to go when Caleb calls for him. But this time, Angus has been gone so long that his wife fears Caleb has killed him at last. Leaving her a widow without any way to claim that status legally; and therefore without any way to assert authority over his business, which will quickly fail without him, or to claim income she needs to support her five children.Meanwhile, former Crimean War nurse Hester Latterly and Lady Callandra Daviot - Monk's patron - set up a makeshift hospital in an old slum warehouse as a typhoid epidemic rages. Hester, who has helped Monk with more than one case despite the way they irritate each other, quickly learns a great deal about Caleb Stone (as he calls himself); and when Lady Ravensbrook, second wife of the uncle who raised Angus and Caleb, falls ill while helping to nurse typhoid victims, Hester moves into the Ravensbrook household to care for her. Which gives Nurse Latterly access to other puzzling aspects of the Stonefield twins' lives...especially after Genevieve begins helping Hester care for her patient.Well written and well plotted, but I did find the ending a disappointment. I still want to know (spoiler alert - stop reading if you don't want to know!) exactly how Lord Ravensbrook came to know his nephew's secret, and whether he merely concealed it over the years or actively enabled it. For me the story felt cut off just when it could have become most interesting. A terrific read in all other ways.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Worst of all, the discussion had nothing to do with the custom he had started off with.

Much of the book revolves around organic evolution and the evolution of a sentient mind. And how complexity analysis might aid in the understanding of these fields. Not the least in devising deeper forms of artificial intelligence.So intriguing techniques like cellular automata and neural networks are studied. There is a fair amount of speculation as to how these and other topics might ultimately relate to sentience or consciousness. But the musings are grounded in solid science.

I am pleased to see this book taking such a constructive attitude. To paraphrase, failure happens, learn from it, move on and mange effectively. In particular this notion is applied to Information Systems and the management of technology without which it would be hard to live and work in the 21st century. In other words you don't have to be in IT or on a technology management course to appreciate the impact information has. This book will help you to get there.It is interesting and well thought through with some fantastic models typifying for me the real difference of systems thinking, the ability to connect learning and use different ways of communicating in order to get the best outcome. It is also written in a way that meant I could clearly hear the voices of the authors speaking as well as demonstrating their ideas in diagrams and text.The case studies also help to illustrate the author's ideas by showing the consequences of failure over time. They have not been afraid to use some traditional, but what some might consider old fashioned, ideas of control and formal systems which I believe still have considerable relevance. They have integrated them well with newer models and concepts and so I recommend this book for professionals and students alike."},{"Title":"Discovering Higher Mathematics: Four Habits of Highly Effective Mathematicians","review":"I needed a refresher course (after being away from grad school for 30 years!) and was intrigued by the approach: discover the flavor of the topic by experimenting, then often resolving this into a formal proof by your self.The book is sufficiently short to be quite approcable yet reasonably complete.

It is elegantly written, the prose is effortless and along the way he gives insights into the entire spectrum of science, philosophy and metaphysics. Young has been recognized as a genius on the level of Einstein, but I can tell you, Young's theory is far more coherent. You know how a genius can make a remark on a subject, just toss off a remark, that just opens your eyes because it is so succinctly phrased? This book is like that. I consider it to be a work of genius, highly recommended, if you are into the Big Picture."},{"Title":"The Reflexive Universe: Evolution of Consciousness","review":"Truly an all-encompassing work that bridges the gaps between such diverse fields as: biology, physics and psychology.Anyone who can expertly discuss both helicopters and consciousness deserves a read!"},{"Title":"The Reflexive Universe: Evolution of Consciousness","review":"I found a 76' Delcourt copy with \\"geometry\\" as part of it in a breakfast cafe in Arkansas for $1.25, it was held together with a rubber band but complete and intact. I would equate this moment in time in my life to John Smith finding the Morman Bible, except this find actually had value to me and humanity. This book permanantly affected my thought process relative to so many dynamics I encounter daily in life. In my top 3 non fiction books of all time."},{"Title":"The Reflexive Universe: Evolution of Consciousness","review":"I am a rational individual, but I'm not a committed \\"rationalist\\" nor a materialist. I believe that the fundamental question here regarding the metaphysical status of consciousness is a meaningful topic to discuss. I mention this so that I'm not accused of a priori bias against spiritual/religious thought.That being said, I found this book to be largely an example of sloppy reasoning, unjustified conclusions, bad science, and equivocation. I'll be fair: I found the first few chapters interesting, where the author speculates about the quanta of light. I don't regret reading that far: he seemed to be level-headed, he seemed to more or less inviting the reader to do some meaningful speculation with him.Nevertheless there were hints right in the beginning that he's somewhat pompous: it's ridiculous, and desperate, for one man to think that he can figure out an ultimate scientific truth about the nature of our existence - especially (and as is the usual case with newagers) without undergoing the necessary peer-reviewed scrutiny, if not within scientific literature then at least with philosophical.The desperation, I think, is played out in how the book quickly develops, where, in my view, the author goes off the deep end and descends into a nebulous, pseudo-scientific quagmire of meaningless word manipulation. Call it consciousness, call it number, call it matter, call it soul, call it what you like: but it's just no good to assume that there is one metaphysical thing that the universe is and then go about arbitrarily unifying all other categories presented in our thinking and in scientific analysis on the basis of that preferred category. We can see this played out time and time again in crackpot thinkers. Theories of everything are dime a dozen. It amazes me how an apparently accomplished person in the field of theoretical and applied science can produce such dribble. Moreover, I find it amazing that he thinks he ideas are so original, constantly referring to \\"his theory\\" as if he weren't ultimately parroting other new age esoteric views.This is the last book, I think, I'll ever buy which comes from the new age sector. You're much better off buying a work of actual critical and responsible philosophy, be they representing Vedanta or Buddhism or whatever. And that is just what this book is not. This book is uncritical and irresponsible.For a better presentation on some esoteric speculation on the nature of light, get Arthur Zajonc's \\"Catching the Light.\\" The book under present review will be a waste of your time."},{"Title":"The Jesuits in North America in the seventeenth century (Francis Parkman's works. New library ed)","review":"Really great early account of the Jesuits influence on the American West. Also available on Project Gutenberg if you don't have kindle."},{"Title":"The Jesuits in North America in the seventeenth century (Francis Parkman's works. New library ed)","review":"This book by Francis Parkman, written in the mid 19th century gives a valuable account of the lives of Jesuit priests sent from France to convert the dangerous native tribes around the Great Lakes area of North America. The Jesuits were meticulous record keepers of their missions in North America in the 17th century and Mr. Parkman was a careful historian.This fascinating book contains much information about the 5 Nations (Iroquois) and the Algonquin tribes and their centuries-long ferocious hatred of each other. The Jesuits sent priests to live among these tribes and the astounding ways these tribes lived are fully explained, especially their culture of torture and canibalism. These priests suffered the greatest physical deprivations and danger living among these war-like people. It also shows the manifold reasons the French were in North America at that time, the most prominant being the fur-trade. While the priests were zealous to convert the Indians to Catholicism, the Crown was interested in the great profits that could be pulled from the forests through making the native peoples dependent on the French.The book corrects much of the wrong information that most Americans learn about these formidable tribes. It is a gripping look at a culture gone forever and unabashadly shows both the natives' attributes as well as their unrelenting cruelty towards their enemies. The reader comes away with an understanding as to why these peoples are extinct and how in part, their own actions played a definitive role in their eventual demise."},{"Title":"The Jesuits in North America in the seventeenth century (Francis Parkman's works.

New library ed)","review":"The author and the Jesuits who labored to convert the various tribes repeatedly distorted images of the Wendat (Huron) and the other tribes encountered in order to justify the continued efforts in North America. The constant onslaught of adjectives like \\"savages, filthy, smelly,\\" etc. continues ad nauseum. They ignore that America wasn't discovered in the 1400s by Europeans, but by the native Americans more than 15,000 years earlier. Today research indicates North America may have been settled more than twice that many years ago. They ignore the Democratic forms of government developed by the tribes. They ignore that the Indians didn't need a new religion as they embraced believes that predated Christianity and even Egyptian and Early Greek beliefs by thousands of years. The Jesuits, the civilian government, in the form of Champlain, were there to exploit America's vastly superior resources and steal the land from the \\"savages\\" who had lived in harmony with nature for many millenia. They took the resources and repaid the Indians with trinkets, beads and diseases that wiped out entire tribes because they lacked any built-up immunities. The Europeans also brought a new animal to America, one the continent could easily do without - the Norway Rat - one of the major spreaders of disease in Europe. All of the negatives are glossed over as part of the ongoing European efforts at complete genocide of native Americans."},{"Title":"AN Unexpected Husband (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Rather a fun book. A father who turns down marriage proposals without reference to his daughter, an elder brother who knows best and is stubborn, a younger brother who is army mad. French soldiers have been seen on the coast of England. Suggestions of spies. A very much unwanted suitor who has elder brother's backing.These are stiff odds for any heroine. Throw in a hero with secrets. Definitely a fun Traditional Regency, recommended.From the back cover of the Zebra paperback..A Lady's DesireMiss Bethany Whitcombe was most pleased to see a brightly painted wagon rattling up the country road to Whitcombe Hall. Sifting through a tray of tempting wares would be a pleasant diversion-especially with everyone on the shores of Kent waiting anxiously to see if Napoleon would send his soldiers upon the next wave. But it was no ordinary peddler who met her eye with a cool, blue gaze, then came to her aid when smugglers attacked. And now that her grateful father had welcomed her injured rescuer as an honored guest, Bethany would have a chance to discover why the handsome stranger intrigued her so.A GENTLEMAN'S SECRET Eric Pennington's mission-to find a smuggler's ring reputed to be in league with Bonaparte-was far from easy. But the wrenched shoulder he'd suffered while playing the hero would make it damned near impossible. He needed an unwitting accomplice, and instinct told him to look no further than Lord Whitcombe's lovely daughter. The enchanting Miss Bethany would make an excellent courier.. .if he could manage to keep her insightful mind and keen wit from discerning his secret.

The photos illustrate the town, the British Viceroys and their minions, British and Indian, and the scenery.Simla, at a high cool 7,000 feet elevation, was the summer capital of the Raj of India from about 1830 until Indian independence in 1947. Here, the Viceroy and British civil servants and military spent the summer months when the heat on the Indian plains was unbearable. Simla was a place \\"where the elite and aspirants met and participated in established social rituals.\\" By 1904, some 7,000 British recreated (that seems the appropriate word) in the town during the season.Pat Barr's text of 40 pages gives a history of Simla in the 19th century, up until the first railroad was completed to the town in 1904. For the homesick colonials, Simla was England away from England. The text and photos illustrate a vanished world that was immensely appealing in its day for those on the higher rungs of British society.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Something to Fall Back on","review":"She's a delight!

Like Bombeck, Maureen writes about what she knows best - her life and the pursuit of happiness. She revels in the perils of deflowering her garden; her jewels; the Tory Party; her career in the theater, and a friend's King Charles Cavalier puppy - \\"Now what do nine inches of silky, tumescent fun mean to you??\\" It is really difficult to get through a page without laughing out loud.Maureen was married to playwright Jack Rosenthal for over thirty years, until his death in 2004. They have two children - Amy, who is the writer-in-residence at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theater, and Adam, a Cambridge graduate. In 1999 Maureen was awarded a CBE, (Commander of the Order of the British Empire), by the Queen for meritorious achievement. She was the second person in her family to receive this honor. Husband Jack was presented with his award in 1993.If you feel like a good laugh - and in these times who doesn't (?), pick up a copy of \\"Something To Fall Back On,\\" or any one of Maureen Lipman's books, and take your mind off any troubles you may have.

I agree that these stories don't have the depth of Ms. Pilcher's novels, they are still pure Pilcher, with situations and characters with whom the reader can relate.

All of the stories in this book are set both historically in the early 1900's all the way up to more present times. Each story has an underlying theme whether it be love, death, forgiveness, sadness, happiness etc. and they all seem to have moral.Even though this was not my normal choice when reading this author's work, I enjoyed each story on its own merit and felt that I was able to get a quick, pleasant read in between doing daily things and/or just to relax."},{"Title":"The Blue Bedroom and Other Stories","review":"This is a sweet collection of short stories. There are no adventures, no mysteries, no steamy bedroom scenes. These are short vignettes of life in England and Scotland, mostly about 30-60 years ago (my estimate), in a simpler time. Ms. Pilcher can describe a room, the preparation of a meal, or a walk through the countryside like no other author. You can smell, hear, see, and taste it all, but she does it subtly without boring you with overdone descriptions. The characters are everyday people with everyday issues. This is a delightful little collection to pick up when you have a few minutes to settle down with a cup of coffee to read."},{"Title":"The Blue Bedroom and Other Stories","review":"The Blue Bedroom is a collection of short stories by Rosamunde Pilcher. As I have stated in previous reviews, my passion in reading leans toward mysteries. But I am also a devoted fan of Rosamunde. She manages to write romance stories which include wonderful descriptions of the countryside (Scotland), the weather, the residences involved; in other words, even though these would be considered romances, she weaves many other things into them, and it makes for nice reading; nothing complicated, just a good story that I feel has a happy ending. I don't consider the stories \\"sappy\\" and would recommend them to anyone. I'm not going into detail about the stories in this book, as there are many, but just will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the read.

These stories, first published in the Eighties, are as lovely to read as any of her recent best-sellers, and every bit as riveting.I first read this collection years ago, but I had forgotten the stories, forgotten how Pilcher can describe a bedroom, a drawing room, a beach, a sunny day, a cloudy day, an aging spaniel in its basket. When I am deep into a Pilcher story, I can taste the soothing cups of tea. In each story, I am there, as I imagine every reader must be as well. I am simply transported, just as I am when reading her books.I simply marvel at the sheer simplicity of Pilcher's writing. It is so deceptive. Her stories seem to be mere pieces of fluff, but in fact, they are so much more. I already knew that, of course, but I had to be reminded how wonderful her short stories are to read.

Even more fortunate folk may have encountered some of Sanders' other work, published in a variety of categories.Sanders has recently returned to writing SF, mostly in shorter forms. He has published such excellent stories as &quot;Elvis Bearpaw's Luck&quot;, &quot;The Undiscovered&quot; (which was nominated for both the Nebula and the Hugo), and &quot;Jennifer, Just Before Midnight&quot;. He has also published a new SF/Fantasy novel, _The Ballad of Billy Badass and the Rose of Turkestan_. Even more recently he has published a fine mystery, _Smoke_, and an excellent science fiction novel, _J._ -- both are very well worth finding.This is a very fine contemporary fantasy, with an exciting story in the forefront, as well an involving love story, plenty of humor, and even a message. The message doesn't get in the way of the story: instead, the story supports the message, and the message is a passionately presented and definitely worth hearing.The title characters are Billy Badwater, a Cherokee and a Gulf War veteran, and Janna Turonova, a doctor from Kazakhstan. Janna is in the US partly to alert people to the terrible environmental damage done in Kazakhstan by Soviet nuclear testing and toxic waste. Billy meets her at a powwow, and they fall in love. Soon Billy finds himself chasing this woman across the western U. S., and on a reservation in Nevada he finds evidence that much as the Soviets used the Asian people's land as dumping grounds and testing grounds, the U. S. has used Native American land in the same way. The fantasy element arises from a monster that is called forth by the toxic waste in Nevada. Billy, aided by Janna and some other friends, especially his dead Grandfather, is pushed to use Indian magic in battle against the monster. The story is exciting and involving throughout, and the love story is convincing and sexy."},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"At this moment there is no rhyme or reason to American publishing, no way of telling where the good and vital books are going to be appear. In a way that's frustrating. In another it's exciting. It makes it possible to have the sense of discovery that you get picking up and reading something like THE BALLAD OF BILLY BADASS AND THE ROSE OF TURKESTAN. It's a thriller and a love story. It utilizes Indian lore and science fiction. Set on Southwestern Reservations and in the seedier side of Las Vegas, BALLAD gives a chilling glimpse into the third world country that exists inside this nation. It's cult success is just about guaranteed. It deserves much more than that."},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"Billy Badwater is one of the most appealing fictional characters I've ever met. In fact, all of the characters in THE BALLAD OF BILLY BADASS AND THE ROSE OF TURKESTAN are so fully realized that the book is replete with major characters and rich lives that continue well beyond the page. There are almost no minor characters because any character that comes under Sanders' skillful pen for a couple of sentences springs to life by such adept description and wise choice of detail as to defy understanding of quite how the hell Sanders manages to invest so much in each character time after time.The book wove the seriousness of its subject matter brilliantly with generous, laugh-out-loud humor. Grandfather has to be the sweetest dead curmudgeon in all of literature. I'll never look at a crow again without wishing that Grandfather would suddenly say something insulting from the crow's beak and ride on my shoulder for a few sarcastic miles.A wonderful romance takes place in the midst of intense action that keeps gathering momentum and doesn't let go of its grip on the reader as the story avalanches down an unearthly mountain of terror and something eerily vulnerable and wholly of this world while being altogether unworldly rises to battle the threat of chaos with the frailest and most potent of powers.Best of all, even better than the fabulous characters, the heartwarming romance, a dead grandfather anyone would love to posthumously adopt, and a kickass plot, best of all is the overall sustained level of incredibly terrific writing. It would be a disservice to merely call William Sanders a great writer because he surely deserves the appellation of one of the world's greatest living writers. Grandfather, if looking over my shoulder, would dryly remark &quot;One of the greatest, dead or alive, for that matter.&quot; And Grandfather knows his stuff."},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"No one writes about American Indians better than William Sanders--and that's because he is one, yes, yet it's also a credit to the power of his talent. Sanders proves that again with THE BALLAD OF BILLY BADASS AND THE ROSE OF TURKESTAN, a remarkable novel that effortlessly blends mystery, romance, humor, suspense and bone-chilling, supernatural horror.Billy Badwater and Janna Turanova are the most unique and intriguing pair of lovers I've ever had the pleasure to spend time with. Life has been hard for both Billy and Janna; but no matter what life has been for any of the people in this story, all paths lead to the Nevada drylands, and the terror that has awakened there--and none who walk away will be untouched or unchanged, including those who read this novel.Who are these people who must save the world, and therefore, save you and me? A Cherokee man of no ambition, recently discharged from the more shadowy regions of the U.S. Army, with a passion for big motorcycles and small, beautiful women; and a highly-educated, independent-minded, sweetly desperate woman already at war with the faceless governments who have poisoned the earth and victimized us all, regardless of where you live and who you believe you are.Seamless prose, detailing so intricate it takes your breath away, and original, memorable characters are only some of the hallmarks of this wonderful book. I will especially never forget the craziest, zaniest, loveliest wedding; and THE best grandfather, either living or dead, whether a blue jay or a crow.Let William Sanders take you on this extraordinary journey. He is a writer so gifted, wise, honest and brilliant it's a road you will always remember traveling.Nasgi nusdi, as the Cherokee say: That's how it is."},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"This is an extraordinary book. That it had to be self-published is a crime against nature - which is perhaps fitting, as it is a powerful sermon on that subject, among others - but that should give its readers the satisfaction of knowing they have found a buried treasure.William Sanders is a fantastic writer, and this is his finest work. Line after line, it is series of perfect observations; the whole is a seamless work of description and feeling - perfect gems on a flawless background of enamel, as engrossing and complete as a Faberge egg. The sheer craft of the writing is almost overwhelming in itself, the kind of writing that seems as effortless as breathing, because every word is so absolutely correct and necessary.Added to the plot - both profoundly spiritual and a right rousing tale - and the glorious characterizations, this makes it the kind of story you hope to find and keep forever. It's deeply romantic, it's a grand hero tale, it's laugh-out-loud funny where it needs to be, and in the end it is heartbreaking in both its triumph and its tragedy.You read this, and you'll wish you had saved it for an emergency day when you really needed to be inspired. You read this, and you'll know that you'll read it over and over. It's one of those books that becomes part of your soul and helps ensure that you have one.

An out-of-work, out-of-the-service Cherokee and a visitor from Kazakhstan with time running out. Couldn't be anything other than a crisis looking for an unstable area to happen.Unfortunately for them, they are at ground zero for a disaster no one on Earth has even imagined, much less thought of a way to battle. This could be the last battle for everyone.You've read plenty of scifi, fantasy, and horror, but you've never read anything that blends them as skillfully as BILLY BADASSS. I know you've never met up with an author who can do it better than Wiliam Sanders.Sanders is a master at the practice of language. Try finding a single word that isn't essential. Don't bother; it's not there.This is one time when there is just no substitute for experience. Sander's life has been a wealth of experience and every fibre goes into his prose.

Two paragraphs in I was nodding appreciatively at Sander's spare, lucid prose; then the story began to move like a rollercoaster and I hung on for dear life. Action galore and no end of fun-- I particularly enjoyed the dead-on skewering of New Age pretensions (especially of white people who co-opt Native American religions) at a very, very ill-fated Meditation Center. There are also hilariously surreal moments; Billy's dead grandfather utilizing a motel room TV to speak to him comes to mind, as does the rather feckless Lovecraftian abomination out of space and time that is by no means the book's real villain. But if horror is your thing, you'll find it here too, drums and drums of it leaking toxic waste and radiation into a Nevada that might have been imagined by Dante. All this and true love too. This is a book worth waiting for (and one we had to wait outrageously long to get). If you appreciate superb prose, if you like your adventures two-fisted and your romance high, if you're interested in what Native American life is really like-- treat yourself to Billy Badass and the Rose of Turkestan."},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"Due to the vagaries of William Sanders's writing career, this one is coming out via a self-publishing house, which is nothing less than a crime. If you order it, it might take as long as a month to get your copy--and it will BE WORTH IT. I don't figure I need to say much about the book, because Poul Anderson and William Sanders and everyone else here is covering that. Buy a copy for yourself, and for your best friend, like I did.

Very refreshing in these days to see minority charactere (in this case American Indians) portrayed not as politically correct stereotypes, but as individuals with good and bad qualities. For example, the character of the drunken reservation cop must have taken real guts to write, as it is sure to offend PC readers.New Agers are even more certain to be outraged by the author's scathing (and hilarious) sendup. In fact there is something to annoy everyone - conservatives, liberals, Indians, whites, even Harley-Davidson riders. All in all it's easy to see why the author had to publish the book himself, as it is far too outrageous for the timid mediocrity-mongers of the American publishing industry.Whatever it took, I'm glad it did get published. It gave me some great laughs. And the ending was one of the most amazing things I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"_The Ballad Of Billy Badass &amp; the Rose of Turkestan_ is a delight.William Sanders' deft touch and sure hand blends the classic American &quot;B movie&quot; villain with villains who are sadly all too real, ancient tales, and compelling characters to create something rare and marvellous.And if you'll excuse me, I bought _Smoke_ at the same time, and I really need to get back to a more comfortable chair..."},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"BALLAD is brilliant, as is its author, William Sanders.

What can I say, after this book William Sanders is my favorite author."},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"This gem of a genre-bending book defies catagorization. It's grand! There really is a Ballad of Billy in this book, and it goes like this:\\"Billy Badass was a warriorFrom Oklahoma wayA hero of his nationWho had wore the Green Beret.He met the purtiest ladyShe was from a fur-off landAnd Billy Badass fell in loveWith the Rose of Turkestan\\"Jerry Dwayne, of Jerry Dwayne Austin and the Piss-CuttersHouse Band of \\"The Last Church of Naked City, Losers Welcome\\" Las Vegas, Nevada.Billy Badass is our hero's nickname. His enrollment card in the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma states his name as William E. Badwater. And the Rose of Turkestan is Janna Turanova , of Kazakhstan, part of the former Soviet Union. A bunch of yonegs have been messin' with stuff they don't understand, causing all manner of real radioactive nightmares out in the Nevada desert. And Billy and the Rose become embroiled in the imbroglio.Notwithstanding the impending destruction of the planet, Sanders and his characters maintain a sense of humour. There are dealings with a minor bureaucrat in the INS, threatening mean and nasty things regarding Janna's VISA (the immigration status - not the Credit Card.) Bureaucrat says: \\"We don't just hand out the Green Card to everyone who asks. There are criteria to be met, guidelines to be followed - do you have any idea how many people want to come to America to live?\\" To which Billy responds \\"Some of us already ran into that problem.\\" And regarding the flawed, lone law enforcement officer on the Bucktail Springs Reservation: \\"Leonard isn't exactly your Tony Hillerman breed of Indian cop.\\"And this isn't exactly a typical Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror/ Mystery/Action/Romance. It's a uniquely delightful brew!"},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"Fortunate SF readers will have encountered William Sanders' earlier novels _Journey to Fusang_, a fine, funny-serious, alternate history about a North American colonized by the Chinese instead of the Europeans, and _The Wild Blue and the Grey_, another alternate history about Indians from an independent state as pilots in World War I. Even more fortunate folk may have encountered some of Sanders' other work, published in a variety of categories.Sanders has recently returned to writing SF, mostly in shorter forms. He has published such excellent stories as &quot;Elvis Bearpaw's Luck&quot;, &quot;The Undiscovered&quot; (which was nominated for both the Nebula and the Hugo), and &quot;Jennifer, Just Before Midnight&quot;. He has also published a new SF/Fantasy novel, _The Ballad of Billy Badass and the Rose of Turkestan_.This is a very fine contemporary fantasy, with an exciting story in the forefront, as well an involving love story, plenty of humor, and even a message. The message doesn't get in the way of the story: instead, the story supports the message, and the message is a passionately presented and definitely worth hearing.The title characters are Billy Badwater, a Cherokee and a Gulf War veteran, and Janna Turonova, a doctor from Kazakhstan. Janna is in the US partly to alert people to the terrible environmental damage done in Kazakhstan by Soviet nuclear testing and toxic waste. Billy meets her at a powwow, and they fall in love. Soon Billy finds himself chasing this woman across the western U. S., and on a reservation in Nevada he finds evidence that much as the Soviets used the Asian people's land as dumping grounds and testing grounds, the U. S. has used Native American land in the same way. The fantasy element arises from a monster that is called forth by the toxic waste in Nevada. Billy, aided by Janna and some other friends, especially his dead Grandfather, is pushed to use Indian magic in battle against the monster. The story is exciting and involving throughout, and the love story is convincing and sexy."},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"I'd enjoyed William Sanders' short stories before I'd heard about this book. Not every writer can handle novels and shorter works with such grace and power. Keep writing, William. Billy Badass made me laugh when it wasn't making me think--and you can't have too many books like that around."},{"Title":"The Ballad Of Billy Badass & the Rose of Turkestan","review":"Having read &quot;The Wild Blue and the Gray&quot; when I was in college -- and dozens of times since -- I was floored when I ran into a mention of a new novel by William Sanders, whose work I hadn't run across since the mid-1980's. I finally laid my hands on a copy of &quot;Billy Badass&quot;, was immediately entranced . . . and then despaired as the plot became utterly predictable and the prose became politically-correct, all by the end of the third chapter.I eventually gave the book to my aunt, who wouldn't mind such issues and doesn't have prior expectations of Sanders' quality.I would stand &quot;Wild Blue&quot; up against Neal Stephenson's &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; any day for its artisanry. Both have vivid characters, memorable lines, and twists and turns that no other authors I've read have ever come close to matching. I was expecting the same from &quot;Billy Badass&quot;, but instead found cardboard cutouts and a plot that never veers from its obvious resolution, even when complicating factors (a few misbegotten mobsters, for example, who come straight from the comic books) are thrown in. In the whole novel, the only part which still stands out in my mind came straight from an old joke that I had heard years ago; it was funny once, and Sanders' treatment is cute, but it's not original.A final -- or, really, a first -- disappointment was when he gave a character the same name as one in &quot;Wild Blue&quot;, even though the other novel was set in an alternate history that is unrelated to the setting of &quot;Billy Badass&quot;.I hope &quot;Smoke&quot; is better, and that the reissue of &quot;Journey to Fusang&quot; will live up to all that I have heard about it. &quot;Billy Badass&quot; is a tolerable light read, but I would only recommend it to completists and to those who aren't selective about their reading."},{"Title":"The Natural Approach (Language Teaching Methodology)","review":"This is a must-read for any foreign language teacher. It has helped me immensely as a teacher. Even though the book was written a while ago, it is all still relevant today."},{"Title":"The Natural Approach (Language Teaching Methodology)","review":"The author discusses theory in the first chapters and practice in the last chapters. I was more interested in theory, so the book seemed to diminuendo. For a reader who is more interested in practice, the book may seem to crescendo.First, the author makes a quick overview of the history of second language education. It seems that the student's own language was barred from the classroom for the first time in the first decade of the Twentieth Century. If this is true, then most foreign language teachers today are 100 years behind the times.A Korean English teacher once told me that it was dangerous for foreign language students to practice conversation where there was no teacher or no native speaker to correct errors. I didn't have the documentation handy, so I couldn't tell her that students could do better without all that error correction anyway. Too bad I didn't have the documentation in this book.The author also summarizes schools of foreign language education other than his own baby. I have wondered how nouns could be taught in TPR (Total Physical Response), now I see that they are used as objects (\\"Put the book on the table\\"). The psychological method, the series method, the phonetic method, the direct method, and the audiolingual method are briefly defined."},{"Title":"The Natural Approach (Language Teaching Methodology)","review":"I was informally introduced to \\"natural method\\" of teaching foreign language this summer at grad school and wanted to find out more, so I bought this book.

This is an introduction to the process of getting a patent and what it is that you have after you get one.When you work with a patent attorney, the first thing that he has to do is explain to you what you need to do, how you need to document things, the procedure that you're going to have to go through and a whole lot more. This procedure is long and tedious. If the lawyer has to sit and explain it to you, he's going to charge you a bunch. This book does that job for a lot less money, and probably does a better job.There's one point that needs stressing. After you file for the patent, the application will be declined.

Along with this, a basic glossary rounds out the books contents.Overall, the material is presented in a clear and consistent pattern. Not a lot of depth of discussion is presented in any one area.

A must read!!"},{"Title":"The Ninth Dominion","review":"\\"The Ninth Dominion\\" is somewhat of a sequel to an earlier novel by Jon Land entitled \\"The Eighth Trumpet\\". \\"Trumpet\\" is one of the best of Land's novels and is a non-stop action, espionage thriller. The same can't be said for \\"The Ninth Dominion\\". Unlike his earlier works, this one is more of a \\"hunt the serial killer\\" novel instead of an espionage thriller.The novel begins with the escape of eighty four inmates from a maximum security installation. Their leader, Leeds, a man nicknamed \\"The Candy Man\\", is a mastermind who planned his escape before being captured by Jared Kimberlain, the lead character also known as \\"The Ferryman\\". Leeds plans to essentially reverse society and have those who have been shunned and locked away from society to take control. Essentially, the \\"inmates would run the asylum\\".New characters are introduced, including a female character who is a member of the new version of the Caretakers, the group to which Kimberlain was a former member. The female character has a mysterious past that is linked to Kimberlain, although neither knows it. The giant Winston Peet also returns from his original appearance in \\"The Eighth Trumpet\\", but is underutilized in this one.While Leeds is trying to overtake the world, a serial killer is stalking small towns (or so it appears) and killing all the inhabitants. Kimberlain also must track down the killer and bring him to justice. This is where the novel seems to lose its direction. Had the book concentrated solely on Leeds and his world domination scheme, the novel probably would have been better. However, the substory of the serial killer, while tied into the main storyline at the end, seemed out of place throughout most of the novel.If you're a fan of Jon Land's novels, you'll want to read this one as well. If you enjoy serial killer novels, you might want to give this one a shot. If you are expecting a novels up to the standards set by \\"The Eighth Trumpet\\", you might be disappointed. While it was great to see the main characters return, this one seemed to concentrate too much on Kimberlain and not on the minor/smaller role characters such as Winston Peet."},{"Title":"The Ninth Dominion","review":"This book by Jon Land is a sequal to &quot;The Eighth Trumpet&quot;. This book features the Ferryman, a govenment clean-up man, who is trailing a serial killer called &quot;The Candy Man&quot;. Will the Ferryman be able to stop this killer in time? The story was well written and kept me on the edge of my seat. The suspenceful and shodowy plot was so well written, I had to check the locks on my own doors as I read it. If you like suspence, read &quot;The Ninth Dominion&quot; and its prequel &quot;The Eigth Trumpet.&quot;"},{"Title":"Classic Airliners: 76 Older Types Worldwide, Described and Illustrated in Color","review":"Whether you are a seasoned airliner aficionado like a casual or curious observer, or myself this small book contains a treasure trove of facts and anecdotes on airliners ranging from the 14-seat De Havilland Heron to the mighty Boeing 747-100/-200. Mr. Singfield accommodates nearly everyone's definition of a classic airliner; his criteria for inclusion are that the type must be out of production with at least one preserved survivor (air show circuit queen or museum piece) somewhere in the world. Sadly, this precludes inclusion of such fascinating types as Handley-Page HP-42 Heracles, and De Havilland DH-91 Albatross, the latter in my mind being one of the most beautiful aircraft ever built. At least the author explains this up front in the introduction. Similarly, we also no not get to see most of the wonderful old Clippers, such as the Martin M130, Sikorsky S-42, or Boeing 314 Clipper, but newly restored Vought-Sikorsky VS-44A is present in all its glory.Mr. Singfield includes the venerable classics such as the DC-3, Lockheed Constellation, De Havilland DH-106 Comet, and Boeing 707, but the book's greatest strength lies in its inclusion of less well-known types, particulary old Soviet types that are only recently accessible to Western observers. This book helped me finally distinguish between the Ilyushin Il-12 and Il-14 and the Antonov An-8, An-10, and An-12. The author also points out how the Antonov An-8's design predated the mighty Lockheed Hercules. And speaking of old Soviet airliners, page 138 has a wonderful and highly historic 1956 picture of Tupolev Tu-104A CCCP-L5445 visiting Idlewild airport in 1956, the first production airliner to visit New York City (Boeings Dash-80 did make a visit earlier), predating BOAC's first London to New York Comet flight by some two years!&quot;I'm sure you will find ... other [airliners] that qualify for inclusion by age, scarcity, or interest,&quot; writes the author. Indeed I did: the McDonnell-Douglas DC-8 series -60 and -70, oldies but goodies widely praised for their durability and excellent economics. The 737-100 and -200 are included but not the 727 series, which enjoyed one of the longest production runs of any airliner until eclipsed by the 737 and A320 series. The early model 747s are there, but the DC-10 and Lockheed L1011 are not, though the latter two are rapidly disappearing from mainstream service. However, much to his credit, Mr. Singfield did include the Concorde, which with its recent (2003) retirement has become a cult symbol even among persons with no further interest in airliners.All in all, this book has a lot to offer, and even a jaded aviation enthusiast who thinks he or she has seen it all will learn something new from this interesting book."},{"Title":"Classic Airliners: 76 Older Types Worldwide, Described and Illustrated in Color","review":"You can never get bored of this great book: for more than 3 months I kept it around with me everywhere, and if I had 5 minutes, I just opened it up randomly and forgot about the outside world. Not that much of technical specifications (just the basics), but lots of history and superb photographs (3 photos for each model!) about commercial airplanes of yesterday and day before yesterday, including legendary and less known makes and models. Each entry has information about production and about present availability of the model, whether airworthy or just a museum piece. The book is very rich in Russian-built aircraft, including models you may have never heard of. If you are an aviation fan, wherever you open this book, you will find something interesting to read and see. If you are not a specialist, going through this book, you may formulate a shocking idea about how the industry reached to where it is now. An excellent gift item to your son before he believes that travelling is Jumbo Jet or maximum an Airbus and an excellent gift item to your father to help him recall some possible personal experiences that he had already forgotten from the near past. Tom Singfields excellent work is a must for everybody, having the slightest interest for technical history of commercial aviation!"},{"Title":"The River of Adventure","review":"As a child I walked every week to the library to pick up Enid Blyton books.

When my kids were old enough I ordered Enid Blyton books over the internet in India and read them to my kids over and over, then my kids read those books over and over.

The adventures of Geri and Jay bring them one step closer to maturity and acceptance of responsibility, along with the sense of a new, unfamiliar relationship between them. With Me &amp; Jay, author Royce Adams documents an undeniable talent for story telling that is as young reader friendly as it is entertaining."},{"Title":"Me & Jay","review":"Geraldine Thomas was a thirteen year old tomboy. Her best friend was Jay Thornton, who was always too curious for his own good. Geri's other friend was Randy, who was an oddball to others his age due to his high intelligence. During a hot day Geri suggested hunting up, what the locals called, Blue Pool. It was a an isolated, tear drop shaped, crystal blue lake a few miles away. Many tales circulated about people dying at the lake or disappearing, but Geri and Jay still decide to go. That was only the first of several bad choices the two made that day. Randy was the only one smart enough not to thumb his nose up at danger. He stayed home. Soon Geri and Jay are facing venomous snakes, hopping on and off moving trains, starting a brush fire, finding a new cave, being chased by two mean men out to seriously harm them, and much more! During it all, Geri and Jay become closer and learn some interesting things about each other.***** Author, W. Royce Adams, writes the way pre- teens and teens talk in today's real world. This makes the story more believable and smoother for the reader. Readers cannot help but learn a few things while reading the story as well, such as what stalactites, stalagmites, and gypsum grotto are. I would not be surprised to see this book win awards! Many will place this book upon their \\"Keeper\\" shelves. I sure will! My twelve year old son could hardly wait to get his hands on the book once I was finished.Perfect for fans of \\"Hardy Boys\\" and \\"Nancy Drew\\", or just for those who enjoy a lot of excitement in their stories!

Having heard that this book was flying from shelves across the country, garnering the love and respect of thousands of children every day, I thought I'd check it out myself. It's very rare that a non-fiction book becomes overwhelmingly accepted by kids. But when it happens, watch out! It might be all you can do to keep the l'il buggers from reading it day and night and day again.The book is a clever look at the wide variety of sharks living in ocean waters today. From the tiny sixteen inch cookie-cutter shark (which wins my love on name alone) to the vast twenty-nine foot six inch basking shark, this book has \`em all. It includes a variety of amusing factoids in its text, providing copious amounts of useful information. In a well drawn graphic section, the book examines the common properties that all sharks share, both inside and outside the body. Kids reading this book learn about the different parts of the shark and why they're so awfully dangerous. Most interestingly of all, the book makes it perfectly clear that while sharks do kill an average six people a year, people kill an average 100 MILLION sharks a year. The book finishes up with an index of all the sharks in the text (for kids' easy referencing) as well as a bit of shark history to boot.I was a little sad that author Nicola Davies didn't give any space to a bibliography of sources kids could use to find out more about sharks and their ways. Still, that's small potatoes. Davies certainly seems to have plumbed every last bit of interesting information about sharks she could find. I mean, who knew that the gel-filled pits in a sharks nose detect the electrical messages in a prey's body? Or that latern sharks have light making organs that help them blend into the silvery surface of the water around them? News to me! Illustrator James Croft gives the book an easy-going cartoonish feel that doesn't particularly add much to the book, but neither does it detract. The book's brightly colored and amusing. Just not particularly original in that respect.If you need a good non-fiction picture book that'll give some of the more scientifically minded kiddies the thrills they seek (and frankly, what kid isn't interested in man-eating animals with big nasty teeth?) \\"Surprising Sharks\\" is your best bet. It's not gory, but it'll certain give some kids the thrill of fear they seek in their non-fic lit. An enterprising and engaging book."},{"Title":"Surprising Sharks (Boston Globe-Horn Book Honors (Awards))","review":"When participating in a storytime session, as I now do weekly, I like to choose picture books with bright images and related to nature, as the sessions are held in a children's museum with a strong ecological emphasis. I chose Surprising Sharks by Nicola Davies for last week's story, because here in Florida, we are quite familiar with sharks. But a reader is in for a - you-guessed-it! surprise with this book as it shares the wonders and intrigue of sharks in easy-to-read text and appealing pictures.Written by Nicola Davies and illustrated by James Croft, the work is a science text, storybook and environmental lesson all-in-one. Davies doesn't shy around the fact sharks are killers and humans are sometimes their prey but instead, turns this into a lesson about how we can educate ourselves about sharks. Any words too terrifying for little ones, such as \\"killer\\" or \\"bone-crunching\\" can easily be skipped.The pages' fonts vary in size, and the illustrations are bright and colorful, making it extremely attractive to children. The overall effect is fun and light, not scary. The facts contained within are interesting, with charts of shark anatomy and tidbits about not-so-common sharks, like the Wobbegong, whose mottled skin resembles a carpet on the sea floor. Also detailed is how sharks are born, their feeding habits, and humans use sharks in every day products."},{"Title":"Surprising Sharks (Boston Globe-Horn Book Honors (Awards))","review":"Since our first reading, my four year old daughter loves this book.

Hero left her 6 yrs ago after he made her choose b/w him & her parents. Both find that they have changed since their early marriage & that they're still attracted to each other. But Hero is still dating her friend who hopes to marry him.Overall writing was good. Sexual chemistry, love scenes, emotional pull, & pacing were good also. My low rating is due to the 1-sided romance, heroine's regression, Hero's character, & cheating. Let me elaborate. The story progressed well, letting us see how the heroine was before, during, & after their marriage ended. Heroine showed emotional growth & gumption until she sees Hero again. Then, things went downhill from there. Heroine became a doormat & chases Hero like she did in the past to the point that she actually had sex with him while her friend(Hero's current girlfriend) was close by. She also easily forgave him & took him back. He made her choose between her parents & himself, knowing that she valued helping her mother who suffered from severe depression. Their romance was one-sided with heroine clearly in love with him. She was the pursuer & Hero condescended her with his favors. Even at the end, he didn't seem as in love with her as she is with him. He desired her & felt flattered by her affections. But he was never truly \\"in love\\" with heroine. He didn't bother to look her up in the 6 years they were apart, had other affairs, & only thought about her when he considered marrying her friend. He only made the decision to choose heroine over his girlfriend after their sexual encounter. He was self-serving, cheating user. He used his girlfriend to make heroine jealous & cheated on her with heroine. HEA doubtful.Read only if you're interested in romance where heroine chases after self-serving Hero."},{"Title":"Not His Kind of Woman (Harlequin Presents Ser.)","review":"I read this book in high school and I thought the story could/shoulda been made into a bestseller!!!

In the first few years, the international press boosted Albania as an &quot;economic miracle, (a) Balkan tiger, and (a) rising shining star.&quot; In 1997, swept up in the mania of a ponzi-style investment scheme, the Albanian house of cards came tumbling down. It is hard to comprehend the scope of the collapse - more than 75 percent of the population lost all their life savings. Riots, beatings, looting of Army armories, burning of government buildings and rampant mayhem gripped the country for weeks.Finally, in an effort to stabilize this torn and devastated country, a contingent of multinational troops had to be sent in. A collapse of this magnitude does not have a cause; rather, it is a compendium of factors that cumulate in tragedy.In Albania in Crisis Daniel Vaughn-Whitehead evaluates the &quot;how&quot; and the &quot;why&quot; this country fell so far so fast. Writing with empirical statistical support, Vaughn-Whitehead pulls no punches as he uncovers the causes of this crisis. The signs of the impending tragedy were there if anyone had looked critically, but the social and economic harbingers were ignored until the very end.This academic work is recommended for those with an interest in Albania or any emerging post-communist countries."},{"Title":"Be expert with map and compass;: The \\"orienteering\\" handbook","review":"Most of the learning exercises are based on a sample map, this obviously comes with the printed copy.

If locating a position without trails or roads within a few feet using nothing but a map and compass is important this book is great. That kind of skill does not come easy. It takes a lot of work and practice. The book is devoted to accuracy in positioning location. An orienteering course is essentially a bunch of posts with identifying markings out in the back country, off of the trail. The posts are positioned \\"2 accuracy\\" units away from each other. Suppose people are being trained to locate a position within 5 feet. Posts will be positioned ten feet apart and there may be as many as ten posts in an area all about ten feet apart. In orienteering the competitor would be expected to identify the correct post and return to camp with that information. Typically competitors are given multiple posts to find in these little groups of posts in the back country and the first person back who has correctly identified the posts wins the competition. This is a lot like identifying way points and going from one way point to another on a back packing trip. This book was great when I first read it in the 70's and I won an orienteering competition when I was in the Army. Finding a position accurately is the same if you are looking for a way point or a post. Most people in the back country these days, hiking on trails, don't need the level of accuracy this book can help a person achieve.

It was recommended by everyone I knew, as there wasn't a whole lot else out there at the time, and it had been in print since 1955. Today, about the best I can say for Kjellstrom's book is that it is better for beginners than the rambling \\"Sierra Club Land Navigation Handbook\\" (revised edition or not), but that's about it. The illustrations in \\"Be Expert With Map and Compass\\" are few and small, and the book has an ancient feel to it, with outdated references and quirky language (it's been in print for nearly 50 years, and the author died over 10 years ago when in his nineties). A smaller criticism is the tiny format and paperback-size pages - difficult to lay flat and read while attempting to orient the map or set the compass (you'll have to practice this stuff in the field, remember).The age of Kjellstrom's book is revealed in the obsolete recommendations on adjusting the compass for declination, where the hoary old methods of memorizing rhymes or worse, of drawing magnetic declination lines all over your map with a pencil (usually inaccurately) and obscuring important detail is advocated. The latter method, still practiced by orienteering or adventure racing competitors (who get nicely pre-marked magnetic-oriented maps or draw their lines at home on a draftsman's board with a protractor), it's not easily accomplished without error using only a ruler. And if you have to improvise in the field, imagine doing it in the wind on some rock with only a compass baseplate for a straightedge! Modern books recognize better methods: either buy a compass with adjustable declination, or else tape a separate pointer for local east or west true declination for your area onto your compass baseplate. Simple, easy, and virtually error-proof.A more serious problem is that fully half the book doesn't even deal with real-life wilderness navigation, but is instead devoted to the unrelated sport of orienteering and the setting up of orienteering races (a fine sport, but with little relevance to practical backcountry navigation with its use of special large-scale maps and simplified compasses used only to orient the map to north). Learning how to set up control points and course lines for orienteering races ISN'T going to teach you how to navigate in remote backcountry! Worse, this emphasis on orienteering means that the book completely omits important material: advanced map/compass navigational techniques, sun/star navigational methods, position-finding, latitude/longitude and UTM grid systems, navigating in certain specialized environments and climates, etc, etc. - information a wilderness navigator ought to know.To conclude, the book is simply outdated, inadequate, and slow-reading in comparison to modern map/compass guides (my first recommendation: 'The Essential Wilderness Navigator') that will teach you much more, and more quickly."},{"Title":"Be expert with map and compass;: The \\"orienteering\\" handbook","review":"Completely foreign to this subject I was searching for a book to use to teach our homeschool group about orienteering and map reading.

The map allows you to work the exercises found in the book (which are quite helpful). The book was written some time ago and Hjellstrom does focus on the sport of orienteering, but as the entire point of that activity is navigation using a map and compass, I don't see this as a negative. As others have pointed-out he does not cover newer topics such as GPS or altimeters, but if you're buying it to learn to use a map and compass, that really isn't an issue either.

But instead, the very few statements about GPS just tell you that GPS is BAD, and maps and compasses are good.If you look in the table of contents, you won't see any chapter about GPS. Go to the index and you see only three (that's right, three) pages which mention GPS.

This book is essential for the actor who wishes to delve deeper into his/her craft. Sir Laurence writes with clarity and conviction, and at times it's as if he's speaking the words right to YOU. This book allows you to peer behind the performance of many of Sir Laurence's favorite characters: Richard III, Henry V, Shylock...and if you've ever had the privalege to play Hamlet, this book brings to life all of the emotions the actor feels before, during, and after &quot;Hamlet&quot;.I could go on forever about how great this book is.

On ActingEpilogue: A Letter to a Young ActressList of PerformancesIndex==================================================I don't quite know what to make out of this book. Some parts are magnificent and others are terrible. In general I am most willing to close my eyes about the latter when the former are rewarding enough. Well, the balance is a little off here. There are some penetrating and beautifully written observations about the actor's vocation, especially authoritative considering the source they come from. But they are greatly diluted with indifferent, often downright tedious, bits of autobiography.Perhaps I am the wrong person to read this book. It seems to address aspiring actors and I, except when at home and completely alone, am certainly not one. On the other hand, I have always loved Olivier's performances, much as I sometimes disagree with his interpretations (e.g. Othello). So it is interesting, to say the least, to read the essence of what he had learned for six decades of acting.In the Prologue Larry tells us that this is not a book of gossip but is entirely dedicated to the profession, and the vocation, of the actor. This is terribly misleading. The book is actually full of gossip. True, it is not of the \\"who's sleeping with whom\\" kind, but it is nonetheless dull for that. For instance, \\"Knights of the Theatre\\", Olivier's reminiscences of Gielgud and Richardson, \\"John\\" and \\"Ralph\\" in other words, are superbly gossipy and vastly boring. Who was better as Romeo or Mercutio, how Ralph nearly burned his house with some fireworks on Vivien's birthday, things like that. Larry, who cares about this stuff?On the whole, the book is well-written and very readable. Having lived a lifetime with Shakespeare, Olivier often writes almost like the old Will, only in prose. He commands vast vocabulary and strings words, clauses and sentences in a manner that appeals both to the heart and to the brain. Unfortunately his rhetoric often sounds empty and sometimes degenerates into awkward affectation. His rhapsodizing about Shakespeare, \\"the world's greatest man\\", is positively ridiculous; we all agree about Will's greatness: it needn't be shouted. Also, partly by nature, partly because he was in his late seventies, Larry is prone to mighty digressions and intolerable verbosity. You have to be patient with the garrulous old man.Some reviewers have found the author \\"pompous\\". I can't say I have sensed that. Certainly, Olivier is self-assured and very proud of what he has achieved. But in the end of such a life as his, it would be shear pathology of human humility not to be. He is well aware that sometimes he may sound arrogant, but this is seldom if ever the case. Surely if there is a man justified to call himself a \\"born actor\\", this is Laurence Olivier. But he certainly doesn't look down on you. It's Larry who's speaking to you in a colloquial, chatty and engaging style, not Sir Laurence, Baron Olivier, ''the greatest actor of the twentieth century'', or other pompous monuments. The problem is not the style but the content.The beginning was distinctly disappointing. ''Beginnings'' makes some vague and eminently unsuccessful attempts to trace the roots of acting, historical and otherwise. \\"Lessons from the Past\\" consists of Larry's analyses of Burbage, Kean, Garrick and Irving, four great actors from the past centuries, the first one reportedly Shakespeare's own favourite. These pages, with very few exceptions, are as tedious as the author's memories of John and Ralph. The basic difference is that here he is prone to extensive quotations of contemporary sources. The rambling ''Beginnings'' contains some of Olivier's most affected and meaningless prose; his insights into the actor's mind are epigrammatic and amusing, yet embarrassingly superficial and hackneyed:He is always waiting to pounce at the slightest opportunity, wanting to get at the audience's jugular. A lion, a tiger, a leopard - there is something feline about him. But then perhaps he is more subtle than that, more capable of disguise - a serpent. That's it, a serpent.We actors stand by our present performance, not by our past. We are as immediate as the moment. We give you our feelings and hope that you will return yours. We ask for acceptance; we are your servants.Scratch an actor and underneath you will find another actor.The situation improves considerably, alas, only in the very end of the book. The essay \\"On Acting\\" is far and away and finest piece; it makes the rest of the book look even more pedestrian. Now here Larry's rhetoric is not just beautifully written and emotionally charged. It is marvellously meaningful and extremely thought-provoking. He starts by listing his personal rewards as an actor, but then he goes on to extend his scope to the whole of acting, including the Almighty Critics. He finishes with a poignant remembrance of his prime. An extensive quotation would be better than any summary:I have been acting all my adult life - and before. It has stood by me and I have stood by it. It has given me much joy and some sorrow. It has taken me to places that otherwise I would not have seen. It has given me the world and great happiness. It has brought me friends and good companionship, camaraderie and brotherliness. It has thought me self-discipline and given me the retentive eye of an observer. It has enabled me love my fellow men. It has clothed me, watered me, fed me, kept me away from a bowler and a nine-till-five desk. It has given me cars, houses and holidays, bright days and cloudy ones. It has introduced me to kings and queens, presidents and princes. It has no barriers; it has no class. Whatever your background, if it decides to embrace and take you to its heart, it will hurl you up there amongst the gods. It will change your wooden clogs overnight and replace them with glass slippers.[...]Once you have been to the tree and tasted the fruits, some sour, some sweet, you will never be able to leave it alone again. It will get under your nails and into your pores, it will mix with your blood, and nothing will ever take it away from you. It has its ups and downs, twists and turns, great fortune and bad luck. It has its own superstitions and its own language. It has its 'in' crowds and 'out' crowds, its jealousies and its loves. It can destroy you in all sorts of canny ways with drink, drugs, success or failure. It can change charming personalities into monsters, and big egos into even bigger ones. It can make you believe your own publicity. It can make you sit on your behind and feed on past glories. It can leave you in a pile of yesterday's press cuttings and laugh at you as you wonder what happened to your real self. It is selective and very surprising. It can make you give up everything else. It will blinker you to personal relationships and destroy marriages and families. It can turn even twins against each other. It can rape you, bugger you, bless you and succour you. Its moods change with the wind. Once you have made your decision, if you believe enough, there is positively no turning back. Above all, you must remain always open and fresh and alive to any new ideas[...]You must be prepared to sacrifice in order to succeed. You must set your goals high and go for them with the pugnacity of a terrier. But remember, to fall into dissipation is easy, for it is a glamorous profession, full of glorious temptations. Place a foot on the first rung and the serpents will appear beckoning with their silky tails, flattering you and begging you to bite the apple.So many talents, good, raw and rich ones, have been battered against the walls of dissipation and left to drown. The sycophant serpents are everywhere. Because as a profession it generates glamour, the acolytes queue up to stare at, touch or, if possible, entertain something that they can never be. Their admiration is genuine, but beware, actor, beware. Beware of the Greeks.[...]Above all, do not despair when the hand of criticism plunges into your body and claws at your soul: you must take it, accept it and smile. It is your life and your choice. And beware, look to the opposite. Do not float toward the heavens when the same patronising person places a hand on the crown of your head and breathes compliments into your vulnerable ear. Everything can change tomorrow. I suppose critics are a grim necessity. There are good ones and bad ones, and ones who simply masquerade as critics but are merely purveyors of columns of gossip, tittle-tattle signifying nothing. Poor creatures who are pushed by their pens rather than by their intellect. The good ones are essayists and of immense value to our work.[...]I know that, if we are foolish enough to parade ourselves between spotlight and reality, we must be prepared to receive the attention of the pen, but let me plead for thought, care and sincerity, not for mere showmanship.[...]I can no longer work in the theatre, but the thrill will never leave me. The lights and the combat. The intimacy between the audience and me during the soliloquies in Hamlet and Richard III - we were like lovers.I do wish there were more passages like that!What I have omitted are mostly bits of autobiography and practical advice to young actors. Only they are better integrated and more interesting than those in earlier chapters. Larry talks about quite a few things, from the importance of physical training and exploring the athletic dimensions of every role to the paramount significance of the voice and the need of practice every single day. He is convinced that the really great parts stay with you all your life, rewarding constant study and re-interpretation, yet he also insists that a true actor should always be willing to do something new, something fresh, something different, especially a whole new part that seems, at first glance, unsuitable for him.I was particularly interested to learn about his fascination with surgeons, a very special kinds of artists. He did a lot of cajoling one such friend into letting him attend an operation; from the beginning he was ''riveted'' and, contrary to the doctor's expectations, didn't hit the floor. When one of his kidneys had to be removed, Olivier wanted it done under local anaesthesia so that he could watch the whole operation on video. But this the surgeons didn't agree to.Coming back to physical fitness, this essay also answers the question why Olivier was still able to give impressive performances well into his sixties and why, despite quite a few serious health problems in the last decade of his life, he aged very well indeed. The latter is amply testified by George Underwood's wonderful portrait on the cover. It is dated ''1987'' and Larry, it seems to me, looks pretty stunning for a man of eighty; there are tons of photos on the Web that confirm the realism of the portrait. The reason, as he proudly informs us, is that all his life he was an avid sportsman. Even when he could no longer do any weightlifting or athletics, he could still swim a couple of miles in his swimming pool every day.The rest of the book is frustratingly uneven in merit. All pieces represent the same bizarre hotchpotch of reflections and recollections, sometimes profound but mostly trivial, occasionally to the point but often wandering in all possible directions.Part Two is especially dismal - perhaps because I expected too much from it. First of all, almost everything about those ''Great Shakespearean Roles'' is autobiography, and the worst possible kind: mere facts. Leaving that aside, Larry's ''insights'' into those famous parts, each of which he played hundreds of times, is stupendously trivial. I've already heard that story about Hamlet's Oedipus complex and \\"the man who couldn't make up his mind\\" (the dreadful sentence Olivier started his movie with). I consider either to be a gross over-simplification. Shylock shouldn't be a Jewish caricature? Well, of course not. But isn't that blindingly obvious?When he comes to Othello, a role he played only in the mid-1960s, and reluctantly at that (Iago was his man in earlier years), Olivier describes vividly the make-up, the movements and the voice he used, but you can see and hear all that in the movie. He says precious little why he thought necessary to adopt so controversial a style. Nor does he elaborate in any meaningful way about the histrionics that marred many of Othello's finest lines and, to my mind, fatally compromised his interpretation.The best I can say about the essays in Part Two is that they are often hilarious. Larry's exuberant irreverence when he deals with Shakespearean characters makes for a very pleasant contrast with his foolish adulation of the Bard himself. King Lear? ''He's just a stupid old fart''. Antony? ''An absolute twerp''. Sympathy for Romeo? ''But then anyone who lets an erection rule his life doesn't deserve much sympathy, does he?'' Believe it or not, these are not so out of the context as it might seem. Here are some examples of stories that made me laugh aloud, yet advanced my understanding of Shakespeare not a jot:[On Antony and Cleopatra:]It was a purely physical relationship. Two very attractive human beings determined to do wonderful things to each other. Result... suicide. There is nothing cerebral about their love: it is pure passion, lust and enjoyment. And why not? How would you feel alone in a chamber with that lady? I don't think you'd want to discuss The Times crossword.[On Antony:]It's a wonderful part. But just remember, all you future Antonys, one little word of advice: Cleopatra's got you firmly by the balls.[Why Othello is such a difficult part:]I have this fantasy, and I like to think it's probably very near the truth, that Shakespeare and Burbage went out on a binge one night, each trying to outdrink the other, the yards of ale slipping down their throats and thickening their tongues. Just before one or other slid under the alehouse table, Burbage looked at Shakespeare and said, 'I can play anything you write - anything at all'. And Shakespeare said, 'Right, I'll fix you, boy', and wrote Othello for him. I'm sure something like that must have happened.[And one gem from later part in the book:]When I wanted a Mississippi accent for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, I couldn't find a single soul at the American Embassy in London who could cough me up one. The nearest was a nineteen-years-old girl from Tennessee. [...] Maureen Stapleton and the director kept saying I was fine but I wondered whether it was Mississippi enough.Despite some perceptive passages about the actor's profession - the essay on Shylock contains a powerful section on stage fright, the one on Richard deals thoroughly with make-up - the whole of Part Two is regrettably skippable. I expected so much more from an actor of Olivier's monumental stature and vast Shakespearean experience. Perhaps he gave everything he could on the stage and the screen. Little was left for the page, which is a very different medium anyway.''Breakthrough'' is a far better example how this type of semi-autobiographical essay should be written. It concentrates on two plays and two characters that were especially dear to the author. One is Archie Rice from John Osborne's The Entertainer, which Larry played on the stage in 1957 and on the screen in 1960. Of particular interest here is the detailed and vivid description of the shear hard work that learning a new character requires. It is nothing short of complete identification with the mind of the fictitious creature. It was a challenge for Olivier to portray a music-hall entertainer and he attacked it with his usual determination.One passage I found extremely fascinating was the first reading of the part with the other actors. Before they started everybody was interested only in gossip about Marilyn Monroe, because Olivier had recently worked with her in \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\". But inside his head there was a very different ''gossip'' going on. The alternation between the gossipy questions from all around and the mental rehearsal of his lines is brilliantly written. It transports you inside the actor's mind with rare success.The second part is John Tagg in Jane Arden's The Party which, as it turned out, was Olivier's last one in the theatre (he was 67 at the time). The character gave him the rare opportunity to indulge in a twenty-minutes long speech with a Glaswegian accent. Also, the play and the part were overtly political: yet another challenge not quite typical for this actor. Come to think of it, whether on stage or screen, Olivier's versatility is pretty impressive. And so is his longevity.''Colossus of the Drama'' is a tribute to Eugene O'Neill and what is ''undoubtedly his masterpiece'', Long Days Journey into Night. In the 1971 production of the National Theatre Olivier played the part of James Tyrone, an ageing actor, and he apparently had a comprehensive knowledge of O'Neill's oeuvre. Yet this short essay didn't inspire any great desire to rectify my ignorance of the ''father of American drama''.Part Four deals pretty much with Olivier's complete career on the screen. Though often regarded primarily as a stage actor, Larry actually starred in quite a few movies, storming Hollywood at the tender age of 24. However, ''Early Hollywood'' and ''In Front of the Camera'' suspiciously resemble the IMDB trivia sections. There is little that is memorable. Most movies are barely mentioned, those discussed at some length (e.g. Wuthering Heights and Sleuth) are just a trifle too loaded with insignificant details. The only gem in this section - but it's a real one - is Larry's discussion of his Shakespearean movies.Modern film lovers who lack historical perspective may be surprised to know that ''Shakespeare on Film'' didn't start with Kenneth Branagh, nor with Orson Welles for that matter. Larry is quite well-aware that his ''trilogy'' was epoch-making. He discusses in detail the shooting and the ideas behind Henry V (1944), Hamlet (1948) and Richard III (1955), all of which he also directed and produced, and he has a number of fascinating things to say. All three movies have aged surprisingly well and despite a number of drawbacks by modern standards, such as extensive cuts or stilted cinematography, they remain classics well-worth watching, not just for sheer entertainment, but for providing substantial insight into Shakespeare's originals as well. The passage about Richard III is of special interest because Larry talks a lot about which lines in the opening scene he borrowed from part III of Henry VI.I was slightly surprised to see Olivier describing his Othello as ''tired''. If that amount of raw power and sweeping histrionics is ''tired'', I wonder what he looked like on the stage when he was in top form. But he is perfectly right to regret that they didn't make a full-fledged movie of the play. The 1995 version directed by Oliver Parker (with great Kenneth Branagh as Iago but inadequate Laurence Fishburne as the Moor) showed that Othello lends itself to lavish visual presentation rather well. Olivier's performance was firmly based on the 1964 National Theatre production and, despite the fine direction of Stuart Burge, is correspondingly static and monotonous. Nevertheless, whatever reservations I may have about his interpretation - and I have many but that's another story - the movie remains enthralling, not least because of the outstanding Frank Finley as Iago, the lovely Maggie Smith as Desdemona and the dashing (and quite young) Derek Jacobi as Cassio.In the end there is an extensive list with Olivier's roles on both stage and screen (including TV). It's an impressive list, to say the very least. It concentrates on Shakespeare, of course, but encompasses roles from Sophocles to Tennessee Williams, with Chekhov and Shaw thrown in for good measure. Larry's screen incarnations, apart from his Shakespearean roles, range from charming oddities such as The Entertainer and Rebecca to thriller-like dramas like Sleuth and The Boys from Brazil, and in between, thrown for a very good measure indeed, Fitzwilliam Darcy and Admiral Nelson. Among the stage appearances I was amused to notice even one play by Maugham, a 1969 revival of Home and Beauty, in which Larry played the crafty divorce solicitor A. B. Raham.In conclusion, this is a perplexing book. You never know what the next page will bring: a fresh and cool oasis, or a dreary and deadly desert. I allow myself a modest hope that Larry's autobiography is better. He could certainly profit from Getrude's advice to Polonius: more matter with less art."},{"Title":"On Acting","review":"This final book by Sir Laurence, generally acknowledged as the greatest actor of the 20th century, is equal parts memoir and acting instruction. Written only three years before his death in 1989, it provides a unique look into the acting profession on stage and screen by one who was in the middle of it from the 1920s onward. Alongside ideas about character development and stage makeup are reminiscences about other greats: Gielgud, Richardson, Wyler, Barrymore, Welles, and many more. I highly enjoyed this book and am grateful the author chose to record both his advice and memories before leaving us to return to the warm stage lights in the sky."},{"Title":"On Acting","review":"Sir Laurence Olivier offers advice for all aspiring actors. Written in 1984, five years before his death, the Master looks back on his 60 year career, dwelling mostly on the roles which made him famous: Hamlet, Macbeth, Henry V, Richard III, Othello, Shylock, Antony and Caesar. In his introduction to \\"The Great Shakespearean Roles,\\" he talks at length about Shakespeare and how \\"I wish to God I could have met him, talked to him-but most of all, listened.\\" I agree wholeheartedly with him. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to be an actor, director, writer and producer, like Kenneth Branagh is...and damn good he is too (please see my reviews on their excellent Shakespeare films). Rated G."},{"Title":"On Acting","review":"I didn't read it my self, but it seemed upon receiving, it might have been too advanced. But he liked the gift, anyway."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Death In a Hammock","review":"Over twelve years ago, Harry Brock worked as a Game Warden in Maine when he was forced to kill a poacher in self-defense. The media hung Harry during the subsequent trial, but he was ultimately acquitted. However, his wife, already frustrated with their life in Maine, filed for divorce taking their two children with her.Harry now lives on the southwest Florida Island, Bartram's Hammock. Katherine Trachey, accompanied by her two small children, asks Harry to take them to her runaway spouse, Willard, who is one of the island's recluses. Harry escorts the trio only to find someone killed Willard. As the prime suspect, the police lean towards either the wife for obvious reasons or the President of the Preservation league, Luis Mendoza, over a conservationist dispute are the two main suspects. Luis hires Harry to prove his innocence even as the loner begins to fall in love with the other major suspect.DEATH IN A HAMMOCK is an enjoyable investigative mystery that starts slow, but once it picks up speed, it never decelerates. The characters are an appealing group except for the odious developer Orville Boone. Especially delightful is the hero who though a loner takes the time to entertain two little children with a snake and works extra hard to solve the case. Readers will take pleasure in Kinley Roby's first-rate tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Key to the Kingdom","review":"I highly recommend this deck to anyone who collects cards. It lives up to it's name and more! Tony Meeuwissen has very cleverly used the suits to create wonderful illustrations of traditional rhymes and verses on every card. (It's not tecnically a transformation deck, but once you've seen it, you won't care) No written review can possibly do it justice, it really has to be seen to be appreciated. Well worth hunting down an (unfortunatly) out-of-print copy!"},{"Title":"Key to the Kingdom","review":"I bought this around the holidays in 1992, and it kicked off my interest in card collecting. This is a work of art, and of all the art I own, this is my favorite. Ostensibly, it's a transformation deck of cards with an accompanying book, but it's also a series of beautifully executed paintings (the ace of spades is a spider, the 3 of diamonds is the Titanic sinking, the 4 of spades is a yellow jacket), each with an accompanying verse. Hidden inside all of the verse, however, is a puzzle to solve. This is so clever on so many levels, it's amazing. If you enjoy intellectual stimulation in your art, track this down. It's a shame it's out of print."},{"Title":"Key to the Kingdom","review":"Each card is different, but carries on a theme of each suit. They remind me very much of a cross between the original illustrations in Alice in Wonderland by Luis Carroll (book), Tim Burton and Edward Gorey. The illustrations often have a dark edge and the humor can't be missed. They can be used for both divination and as normal playing cards. However if you might want to think about getting two different decks if you would like to use it for both purposes.While these cards are not a true tarot deck but more of an oracle. With none of the normal imagery you would expect, it leaves the user/viewer relying on themselves for the interpretation. While it comes with a small hard bound book, full of lots of quotes, sometimes even snippets of poetry, this provides more insight rather than providing a blue print for what the card is about. IT challenges you to delve further and provides something to ponder. Quotes and poems range from Ogden Nash, Luis Carroll to R. Kipling.As a divination tool it is more like reading the Gypsy Fortune Telling Cards. Cups are symbolized by hearts, diamonds are pentacles, and so forth.The card stock is typical for playing cards and fit comfortably in the hand. They also are fairly sturdy, but they are normal playing card stock. So if you are hard on your cards, you may find yourself buying more than one set."},{"Title":"Key to the Kingdom","review":"I've had a deck of these cards for some years and enjoy playing cribbage with them. Saddly, they are becoming a bit frayed around the edges as well-worn cards are wont to do. I was most gratified to find that the Key to the Kingdom deck is still available. So I got another deck to use on special occasions."},{"Title":"Key to the Kingdom","review":"BEAUTIFUL set. Absolutely wonderful illustration... SO glad I found this. First saw it reviewed in The Creative Review mag in 1984... could not find it then. Then the same pub advertised a show by the illustrator and I was able to find it on Amazon! Yipee!"},{"Title":"Key to the Kingdom","review":"This is a drop-dead gorgeous deck of cards and with the delightful accompanying rhymes is fun for use as a kind of quirky (free association) cartomantic deck as well as for regular play. A quality production & beautifully packaged book/card set. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Key to the Kingdom","review":"I was first introduced to this deck when it first was first printed some years ago. As a graphic artist by trade I was not only very pleased with the art, but also the incredible quality that the deck and the companion book had in the final, printed delivery. The poetry, prose and lyric associated with each card makes for a whole new dimension in playing cards. The only piece of information, or lack of information that left me wondering was in the product description as it did not say whether this was the original complete set or just the book, sans cards. An outstanding collectible for anyone who enjoys playing cards."},{"Title":"The Last Gondola: A Mystery of Venice","review":"The Last Gondola, number 7 in a series, is an exciting and intriguing mystery set in an ominous and also beautiful Venice and revolving around an expatriate Amrican detective named Urbino Macintyre, art, literature, music, gondola-making, Peggy Guggenheim, and the Armenian group of monks on a lagoon island. And more! Sklepowich takes two simple situations--objects missing from a Grand Canal palazzo and interviews with an eighty-year-old man with a notorious past--and embroiders them into a complicated story written in an elegant, old-fashioned style. He combines the classical mystery (leisurely pace, cerebral and eccentric amateur sleuth, interviews, tea, conversations, gossip) with Gothic elements such as strange noises and laughter, mad women, sinister mutes, hints of vampirism, etc. Giving more richness to the interesting multilayered story and unusual mixture are clever hints and allusions to other literary works (Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Byron's poems, mysteries, Thomas Mann's Death in Venice) in a kind of postmodern way. As Urbino says to his fashionable and aristocratic Watson, the Contessa da Capo-Zendrini, when they are gliding in his gondola down a canal, &quot;The writers about Venice have all done it before.&quot; In the face of this undeniable truth he says that he and the Contessa must make their contributions to the Venice symphony their own. The Last Gondola does exactly this. Not only is the mystery at the center a fascinating puzzle but there are many other facets as well to give extra enjoyment to the careful reader."},{"Title":"The Last Gondola: A Mystery of Venice","review":"Urbino Macintyre has become obsessed with the idea of writing a biography of a reclusive American living in Venice. His obsession has led to strange dreams about fire and destruction, but hasn't led to much else--until suddenly the recluse invites Urbino to visit him in his Venitian Plazio. What Urbino finds is a strangely deteriorating mansion, a strangely deteriorating man, and a mute servant with burned arms. A feeling of haunting surrounds the ancient home and Urbino feels that he is being made the butt of some monstrous plot, although he can't figure out the object.Urbino's other tasks, including the discovery of who has stolen his friend, the Countessa's clothing, take second place to unravelling the mystery of Urbino's fellow American in Venice.Author Edward Sklepowich writes knowingly of Venice--both the current (but not modern) city, and the city described by poets and philosophers of the ages. Indeed, much of the pleasure of THE LAST GONDOLA comes not from the mystery, but from the atmosphere of the city, of culture and secret knowledge. Hints of lost poems by Byron add to the feeling of sensation that fill this story. Mystery fans may grow impatient with the slow pace at which the mystery evolves, the strange coincidences that are contorted to make the story, and with Urbino's apparent willingness to leave all morals behind in pursuit of his personal goals, however.THE LAST GONDOLA is a strange and interesting story. Readers with a deep interest in the fascinating city of Venice will find that the novel rewards their reading."},{"Title":"The Last Gondola: A Mystery of Venice","review":"After his divorce and the death of his parents, there was nothing to keep Urbino Macintyre from accepting his inheritance of the Palazzo Vecello in Venice, Italy. The former New Orleans citizen embraces all things Venetian, so much so, that his good friend the Contessa da Capo-Zendrini gave him his very own gondola so that he wouldn't have to use public transportation. The two American expatriates are very good friends so it is easy to confide in Urbino that she is missing some clothing and inexpensive jewelry and is afraid she is sliding into senility.Urbino assures her that she is as sane as he and he will use all his skills as an amateur sleuth to discover what happened to the contessa's belongings. Urbino is also obsessed with the Ca' Pozza and it's owner Samuel Possle, another American expatriate. When he finally gains entrance into the house, Possle doesn't address the question of Urbino writing a biography about him but hints that he has something that the writer wants. Little does Urbino know that there is a malevolent evil permeating the very walls of the Ca' Pozza and it somehow involves the Contessa and her missing possessions.THE LAST GONDOLA is a very dark and atmospheric novel, gothic in scope with a brooding protagonist in the tradition of Jane Eyre's Heathcliffe. The author does such a good job of describing Venice that readers will feel that they have journeyed there. There are various subplots that slide into the main story line but readers won't realize how they intertwine until the last chapter when all the questions are finally answered.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Last Gondola: A Mystery of Venice","review":"You don't have to have visited Venice to enjoy the mystery, but if you're a Venice lover you will enjoy the author's setting of his characters and the portrayal of the character of the city itself. Sklepowich is an elegant writer although at times that can border on the dry side. If you enjoyed the Venice portrayed in Berendt's City of Falling Angels, you will appreciate the book."},{"Title":"Mandala, The","review":"Martin Brauen's The Mandala: Sacred Circle in Tibetan Buddhism, translated from the German by Martin Wilson . There have been 3 or 4 other books on the subject to my knowledge, but this is by far the most extensive. Prefaced by remarks from H.H.

It provides a complete explanation of the mandala in tangka form, in architectural structures such as various stupas and monasteries, as well as the mandala offered in preliminary tantric practice. Besides scroll paintings and the familiar sand-painting forms, we see a delightful 3-dimensional zhi kro carved model among the many beautiful photographs and illustrations. Brauen reveals in detail the Buddhist cosmogony and Hindu mythology that is the foundation for mandalas and the deities that dwell in them.An extensive researcher with profound understanding, the jacket reveals that Professor Brauen, who is chairman of the Department of Tibet, Himalayas and Far East at the Ethnographic Museum of the University of Zurich, Switzerland is currently working on a computer animation of the Kalachakra cosmos."},{"Title":"Mandala, The","review":"bought the book sight unseen- didn't know if there would be enough full color repros.

Come to find out almost everything is subject to question. Mertz is clear on what has been established, and what is theory. The time, energy and research put into Egyptian archeaology opens new avenues of doubt and make facts more and more elusive.Mertz warns at the beginning that this is not a text nor a complete history.

Mertz's book fills in the gap. A detailed, fact-filled and accessible book that all will find fascinating. Witty and whismical, and she's not afraid to tell you that she focuses on what interests her the most. Of course, a book the size can only cover so much of 3000 years of history, some parts won't get as much attention. She too quickly dismisses the \\"Hebrews in Egypt\\" investigations. Still, a great book that stands above many supposed Eqypt \\"history\\" books.

I never went to college but I enjoy reading about them."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"This very pedagogical book deals with the history of ancient Egypt in classic, chronological fashion.Though by no means earth-shattering, it is lively, warm, clear, unpretentious and sprinkled with touches of humour.The author comes out as both knowledgeable and amenable.In the audio version, the female narrator's voice and intonations are totally in sinc with this perception.Overall, this pleasurable work is strongly recommended to anyone interested in ancient Egypt."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"Ms. Mertz\`s narrative helps the reader to understand clearly what could otherwise be abstruse concepts.Great reading for amateur egiptologists.R. Rubio"},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"First off I want to point out that the three star reflects that I did not dislike this book, but I just didn't love it either. Let me explain....Not long ago I bought and read Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall Of An Empire by Simon Baker. I liked it very much because it was a history book, but read like a novel. He brought Rome to life. Now, one can't write a book about Rome without occasionally mentioning Egypt. So after this book I had my interest in Ancient Egypt piqued, and since what little I know about Egypt came from mostly the popular culture area I decided it was time to look into this some more. I went to the library and borrowed their copy (I will state right now that I believe it is a first edition copy, the current version for sale I think is in it's third edition, but I assume the overall substance has not changed very much). I guess my biggest disappointment was in that I expected, after reading the reviews here, to get the kind of picture painted for me as I got with Ancient Rome. This book indeed has plenty of information, which is why I will not fault it and indeed still give it a fair review. But as a layman I will be honest....with all the unfamiliar names and places thrown around I became lost. It was hard keeping everything straight, and the occasional odd spelling of what few names I DID know confused me more (for example, when Mrs. Mertz kept referring to Re it did not dawn on me until halfway through the book she was talking about the entity I had known as Ra....I never realized the name could be spelled two ways) So for me being a layman it was tough to follow along and keep up, and I guess for my first foray into Egyptology I should have looked for something a bit more \\"dumbed down\\" to get me up to speed before getting into this book.So I guess it comes down to this. Would I recommend this book to other people? Depends. I would say if you have at least a base knowledge of Ancient Egypt, then this book will probably do for you much more than it did for me. But if your a layman, like I, who has no real prior introduction to this time period then you might want to look for something a bit more introductory before diving into this one."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"Mertz, who also writes as Elizabeth Peters and Barbara Michaels, has turned her talents to a nonfiction work on Egypt. Though the stories she tells here are factual, they are no less entertaining than her Egyptian romps with Peabody and Emerson. Her lively style carries readers through the book effortlessly."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"Historians can be a stuffy bunch, and sometimes we take ourselves too seriously. It is refreshing, then, to come across a book that is not only a first-rate history (in terms of both historiography - the interpretation of events given historical evidence - and the quality of the history itself) but a book that is also accessable to lay-persons as well. The icing on the cake, as it were, is the light, almost humorus tone Mertz takes with her subject.Metz begins with an overview of the pre-dynastic period, explaining the changes in geography and climate that first drew neolithic man to the Nile river valley, and the associated creation stories of ancient Egypt. Her treatment of the Old and Middle Kingdoms and the first and second intermediate periods are excellent summaries, but she really hits her stride in writing about the New Kingdom - my guess is this is both her passion and her area of expertise. Throughout her exploration, Metz not only writes the history of ancient Egypt, but also gives some insight into the development and evolution of Egyptology as a discipline (often times, with charming candor, poking fun at the pet theories and interpretations of scholars. For example, in disucssing the historical controversy of the Hyksos, Metz writes, \\"It (one scholar's interpretation) all makes perfect sense, but so do the plots of good historical novels.\\" (129)) In fact, the informal tone of the book is one of the reasons I rate the book so highly.For example, in discussing the reign of Hatshepsut (and the possibility that her cheif advisor Senenmut was also her lover), Metz writes, \\"Was he the queen's lover? Serious historians migh come back wih another question: Who cares? ... But history is not only sterile events, it is people, and we are, most of us, gossips at heart. So let's gossip.\\" (156) This academic seriousness mized with a healthy dose of fun and the fact that she doesn't take herself too seriously reminds me of my undergraduate mentor who inspired me into the profession with a similar reminder that history, after all, is about who we are, warts and all.Certainly the lightness and lack of formality may be a turn-off to some; I found it charming. From a historical perspective, it is an outstanding introduction to ancient Egypt and Egyptology in general. Recommended."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"This history is wonderfully information. Mertz has a great prose voice that the reader will really appreciate; she is always relaxed and personal. However, I need to emphasize that this is an informal text. There are much newer histories of Egypt with far more organization and precision.

Though not directed toward scholars, her information is reasonably solid, even if much of it is a few decades out of date. (Many of the other \\"classics\\" of Egyptology are also dated, by the way.)For the lay-reader, the introductory student of Egyptology, and even for the expert, this is an enjoyable read.

The reason I bought \\"Temples, Tombs & Hieroglyphs\\" is because I knew that Barbara Mertz was the author Elizabeth Peters of Amelia Peabody fame - and Amelia Peters is a favourite of mine.Dr Mertz combines her wealth of knowledge with her personal style of writing, which makes reading this book just sheer pleasure to read. The book is informative, easy to read and, as already stated, pleasurable to the very end. She provides a reading list for those readers who want to pursue the subject further, and I for one, will be ordering some of these very shortly."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"This is a very fun, absorbing, quick history of ancient Egypt. The author unapologetically tells us that she's going to cover what's interesting to her - and in my opinion that makes for a much more interesting book for the reader as well. Could be a great way to introduce Egyptian history to a child. Also, for fans of Amelia Peabody, it's fun to see where Barbara Mertz (pen name is Elizabeth Peters) has developed her theories and interests in the realm of historical fiction. And yes, there are a couple historical mysteries too...On the flip side, I can't agree with every theory in here. But Barbara Mertz writes forthrightly and with no attempt to brainwash you into accepting her particular theories. I'd have no hesitation in recommending it."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"This book was purchased for my daughter, who has a fascination with history of all periods.

If you like Egyptian history, chances are you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"As a graduate student in Egyptology/Egyptian archaeology, I have a slightly different perspective on this book than some people. As other reviewers have noted, the text is a bit dated, having been written a few decades ago. However, the basic facts are still solid and Mertz writes so well and brings so much of ancient Egyptian history to life that a few inaccuracies can be excused, especially as one hopes that so well-written a text will encourage people to go on to do more research.Mertz also manages to capture and discuss, though not in detail, a bit of what it is like to study Egyptology professionally in a few humorous off-the-cuff remarks in the texts. If memory serves, she compares demotic to a series of frenetic commas. :)In short, this is a book I re-read on occasion, even as a professional, not for any particular research needs, but more to remind myself what my own writing *could* be and, sometimes, to remind myself why I decided to do this for a living."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"Firstly I must admit that I am not an expert on this subject. I learnt the basic stuff at High School and that's about it. My interest was sparked in Ancient Egypt after taking my daughter to watch 'The Mummy' and subsequently reading Bob Brier's book 'The Murder of Tutankhamen'.As it has been previously noted by other reviewer's this book is somewhat dated (orginally published in 1964) but that does not detract from the wonderful narrative that the author weaves around the Pharaohs and their place in history.The author does not get bogged down in technical details and you never lose interest in the story. She has a knack of writing about these far away times and people as if it was yesterday and draws you into her story. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to obtain a decent overview of Ancient Egypt."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"I picked this book up in an airport when I was a teenager, and it sparked an interest in Egyptology which has lasted 30 years. Mertz is a graceful writer, deftly mixing scholarship with humor and 'human interest'. The book is not intended for Egyptologists, (Hence 'A Popular History') and bypasses, wisely in my opinion, the wrangling between experts which makes the field so frustrating to the lay reader. Honesty prevails, however; when she is stating a personal opinion, she says so. The result is a fascinating, funny and intelligent look at the ancient culture of which we know so much and understand so little."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"If you're new to egyptology and are looking for a good book on the History of Egypt then you can't pick a better place to start than by reading this. Barbara Mertz writes in a conversational style and her wit and personality shine out from the page. Despite the \`light' feel of the text the author is obviously very knowledgeable on the subject and is not afraid of letting the reader know of her own, sometimes controversial, opinions. For example, she is particularly scathing of the New Kingdom Pharaohs that followed Thutmose III (including Ramses II) which might surprise some people but she backs this up with reasoned argument leaving the reader to decide for themselves. This book also contains what I feel to be the classic put-down for \`Pyramidiots' and I quote: &quot;He [the pyramidiot] is not using facts to construct a theory, but is selecting facts to support a preconceived and unshakable belief. Whatever the techniques a historian chooses to work with, he must use them without prejudice and be prepared to revise, or dismiss, his theory when he runs up against a fact his tools cannot handle.&quot; Graham Hancock please note! Despite being written some time ago I found this classic work a refreshing and informative read. Well recommended."},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"Writing under the pen name Elizabeth Peters, Barbara Mertz started the Amelia Peabody series of tongue-in-cheek Victorian archaeological thrillers in 1975. But 11 years before then this trained Egyptologist published the first edition of \\"Temples, Tombs & Hieroglyphs\\".Like many other books this traces of the history of ancient Egypt from the pre-dynastic to the Ptolemies. But Mertz brings her sense of humor to lighten what can be a dry series of lists of kings. She brings to life highpoints in the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms, as well as the chaotic periods in between. Moreover, she lifts the veil and lets the reader in on many of the scholarly disputes, like those over the woman pharaoh Hatshepsut and the role of Nefertiti in the succession to her heretical husband Akhenaton.It's also nice to see someone reveal the egomaniac Ramses II for what he was, a poor leader who lost the second Battle of Kadesh, and who covered his weaknesses by pasting his image everywhere.For anyone who has read the Peabody books, including the depiction there of Sir William Flinders Petrie (and his approach to feeding his staff), Mertz' homage here to the founder of modern Egyptology is interesting.In her forward to this Second Edition, Mertz says she thought she wouldn't have to do much to revise the earlier work. But then, she adds, taking into account four decades of new discoveries proved to be a challenge.

If she can bring fiction to life the way she does, you can only imagine what she does to non-fiction. Temples, Tombs, and hieroglyphs bring history to Egypt in the way only Ms. Mertz can!"},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"For anyone who has an interest in Egypt or ever wondered exactly who the ancient Egyptians were and why their dynasties lasted for thousands of years, Barbara Mertz's \\"Temples, Tombs & Hieroglyphs\\" is the perfect introduction. More commonly known to readers as Elizabeth Peters, Mertz is the author of the popular Amelia Peabody mystery series.Long before she started her career as a best-selling writer, however, Barbara Mertz began as a trained Egyptologist, with a PhD from the famed Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, the launching pad for many successful Egyptologists. These credentials make her the perfect person to write this history, as she is able to translate the rich Egyptian history of the pharaohs into something more easily understood by readers with no archaeological background, except an interest in Egypt.This is not to say that the book is always easy reading, although Mertz tackles her subject with a passion and humor readers are unlikely to find in any other, more typical history tome. She manages to bring the Egyptians of old to life, translating ancient hieroglyphs into fascinating stories of individuals, each with their own purpose, strengths and weaknesses exposed.She opens up the fascinating world of tomb robbers and archaeologists (which some claim are not so far apart in purpose or behavior at times). She demonstrates how information is extrapolated from archaeological findings and illustrates how history is revised over time as new facts and theories come to light.Despite the injection of personality Mertz brings, this can be dense material at times. For anyone uninitiated in the world of the Egyptians, there are more than 30 dynasties, each with several rulers, falling into 10 eras, dating from the Stone Age Archaic Period to the time of Cleopatra and the Roman invasion. The sheer length of time and individuals and events covered is staggering.With repeating pharaohnic names, unfamiliar landscapes and place names, conflicting historical research and theories, the book can be overwhelming at times. Yet the reward for sticking it out (dare I even say, re-reading parts) is worth the time and effort expended. Frankly, I read this book twice, cover to cover, and the second time around, I finally began to get a real sense for the overall arc of historical time period covered. And I would hazard to say that it seems even more likely that dipping in again would yield even more historical treasure and understanding.The richest gift that Mertz offers in her overview of Egypt can be found in the simple stories of the rulers described here, in illuminating for the novice the archaeological tricks of the trade (and weaknesses of such methods) used to determine exactly (or to the best of anyone's knowledge) what happened so many years ago. Mertz's infectious passion for all things Egyptian (well, except possibly pottery shards) can't help but influence her readers to want to learn more. Through her book, she has opened the door to her own exciting world, and readers can't help but want to share in that magic.Christine Zibas, Book Pleasures"},{"Title":"Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egypt","review":"Its list price is $16.95, it has 335 pages, but I don't know where Amazon.com gets &quot;April, 1990&quot; as the book's date. The book is the 1978 revised edition of a 1964 book and therefore misses some modern theories and has a 1960's slant (for example, the author apologizes every time she describes people with the word &quot;race&quot;).This was the first of a large number of books and documentaries I've read/watched in preparation for a visit to Egypt this coming summer.Before I grind my axe at some of the problems with this book, let me say that I learned a lot from it and enjoyed reading it. If this is your sole book it will enable you to identify many places, temples and tombs with the appropriate point in Egyptian history with only a few built-in mistakes! If someone asked me to recommend an informative, relatively inexpensive, but not too dry study of ancient Egypt I would recommend this one without hesitation.But some theories which are currently in vogue she misses or gives just a one sentence discussion: like the current idea that the pharaoh Smenhkkare was really the queen Nefertiti.She flatly states that the mummy found in Tomb 55 in the Valley of the Kings &quot;can't be Akhenaton.&quot; However, modern consensus agrees with turn of the century Egyptian Director of Antiquities (whose argument the author fails to mention) Authur Weigall: &quot;The body was lying in a coffin inscribed with Akhenaton's name; it was bound with ribbons inscribed with his name; it had the physical characteristics of [his] portraits...Those who erased the names (of Akhenaton in the tomb because he had been a &quot;heretic&quot;) must have thought it to be Akhenaton's body...finally, there is nobody else who..it could be.&quot;The author presents other opinions which, even given the information available 20 years ago, are highly debatable, but it seems to make the book more readable: it's purpose is not to exhausively evaluate every theory.Occasionally, she seems inconsistent. For example on p.148 &quot;Hatshetsut and Cleopatra...Elizabeth the Great.. She [Hatshepsut] was beautiful, of course; all great queens are beautiful.&quot; Then on p.216 &quot;...not all the great charmers of history have been beauties, and Ti certainly rates a place among them, with Cleopatra...&quot;There are a few places where the discussion becomes cloudy because the author appears to assume the reader has prior knowledge. For example, she mentions the beauty of Nefertiti without describing who she was. Then, after discussing &quot;truth in artistic technique,&quot; she mentions the &quot;king's devotion to his beautiful wife.&quot; Was she Nefertiti? I had to skim through to the end of the chapter to be sure she was.Despite the problems, they are few compared to the wealth of information, stories, and theories that are presented. This is NOT a book that will put you to sleep.

Since their publication, they have lost none of their freshness and vigor. Among other topics, Fr. Jim Geoghegan strikingly compares Therese with the photographer Edward Weston. Fr. John Russell examines, probably for the first time in English, the eight &quot;pious recreations&quot; (plays) Therese wrote for the Carmelite recreations. Joann Wolski Conn's &quot;A Feminist View of Therese&quot; finds Therese a mature adult who authored her own life vision and created relationships of mutuality. Fr. Redemptus Valabek's &quot;Therese's Approach to Gospel Living&quot; explores Therese's spirituality and reveals the warrior saint beneath her image. Sister Margaret Dorgan's &quot;Therese and John of the Cross&quot; explores one of the most intriguing aspects of Therese. Professor William Thompson's &quot;Therese: Challenge for Doctrine and Theology&quot; is a rich and provocative look at Therese's theological significance. Gracefully written and perceptive, this short essay plumbs the depths of Therese and suggests she is a forerunner to a &quot;third Vatican Council,&quot; that Vatican II was insufficient to permit the Church to &quot;catch up&quot; with the young woman who has since become its newest Doctor. Fr. John Sullivan has done a great service to the friends of Therese by making these essays available.

Second novel of Walter Van Tilburg Clark, author of the famed \`The Ox-Bow Incident, \` \`The Track of the Cat\` is also a masterful work by one of America's underappreciated literary giants.Like its predecessor, \`Track of the Cat\` is set in the pine and juniper dotted foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. An isolated ranching homestead is where the drama unfolds. It's the early 1900\`s and winter has crept in unusually soon to the Sierra. And something is attacking the Bridge family's prime herd of cattle.The mayhem of the panicked cattle caught high up in the Sierra snowdrifts mirrors the tumult back at the Bridge family ranch house. Of the three Bridge family boys, the first to notice something gone awry, \\"...to hear the far-away crying, like muted horns a little out of tune,\\" is the sensitive, introspective nature-lover, Arthur. But the eldest son, Curt, aggressive and cynical, brawn behind the ranch holdings, soon hears it too. Convinced that a giant mountain-lion----a \`black painter\` as he calls it---is harassing the family fortune, he soon drags his dreamy brother out on the hunt for the mysterious killer. While the maniacal Curt and otherworldly Arthur battle the elements in search of their elusive killer, another drama begins back home. Middle son Harold plays umpire in an increasingly tense conflict brewing between his nave and comely soon-to-be wife, hyper-pious mother, drink besotted father and hysterical little sister.While his brothers remain out hunting longer than expected, Harold attempts to calm the increasingly despondent mother and an increasingly drunken father. As Arthur's horse soon returns with its frozen and very dead master upon its back, the tense household evolves into a domestic free-for-all. Mother retreats into her citadel of fire and brimstone faith, blaming her son's demise on his \`godless\` and \`heathen\` ways. The father, like some inebriated Falstaff, attempts to mask his pain with false humor and ridiculous theatrics. Baby sister Grace disintegrates at the news of her favorite brother's death. Even the outsiders in the Bridge family saga, Gwen, Harold's barely tolerated fianc&eacute;e and Joe Sam, the ranch's Native American cowpoke, are caught up in the Bridge's dysfunctional family feud. Patient and kind, Gwen fights with her conflicted desire to both escape the maelstrom engulfing her in-laws and at the same time, help out Harold with his domestic struggle. The taciturn wise man of the high desert, Joe Sam stonily and almost contemptuously watches as the white man's family undoes itself with greed and pride.As if such melodrama were not enough, the novel climaxes with the unfolding of Curt's lonely and tragic tale. Left brother-less by the marauding and always unseen cat, Curt becomes obsessed with destroying the killer of his brother and devourer of the family fortune. The book's second half centers on Curt's drawn-out and painful demise from both an insane hubris and unforgiving Sierra blizzard. With each brilliantly crafted sentence, Clark painstakingly documents Curt's descent into a hell of his own making. Captain Ahab meets King Lear. This is page turning stuff and as one reviewer rightly remarked, the book's last half is reason enough to read the whole of \`The Track of the Cat. \` Forget Jack London, Walter Van Tilburg Clark is the master chronicler of man versus nature. With his translucent prose, the pinion-studded hills and basalt-strewn peaks acquire a personality all their own. The natural world becomes a near-sentient antagonist to Curt's bumbling and blinded Oedipus. While always exquisitely hewn, Clark's prose is never anything but accessible and straightforward. While reading \`The Track, \` I felt completely transported to Curt's lonely, surreal world, traipsing aimlessly through the October snow with bulky snowshoes, destruction and madness creeping ever closer.Despite occasional lapses into hackneyed melodramatics, \`The Track of the Cat \` grips its reader, never letting go. It is a truly engrossing tale spun in some of the finest wrought prose of post-1945 American literature. More than that, Clark's story provides an ominous parable for our troubled millennium. Its message is one espoused by the naturalist Arthur and shared by the aboriginal Joe Sam: those who refuse to acknowledge and accept their place on nature's mighty wheel are doomed to fall off it. The arrogant and rapacious Curt is not unlike us \`civilized\` folk who often feel we can manipulate the natural world to fit our own caprices. Clark's novel carries an ominous warning to the Curts of this world. With ice caps shrinking and precious resources dwindling, \`The Track of the Cat\` reminds us to give distance and respect to that giant \`black painter\` looming above, hungry, ready to devour us."},{"Title":"The Track of the Cat (A signet book)","review":"Clark's follow-up to City of Trembling Leaves and Ox-Bow Incident is an ambitious but not totally successful attempt at conveying the cold indifference of the natural world and man's supreme isolation in the universe. Often melodramatic, this tale of a clasically dysfunctinal family of ranchers living in the Sierra Nevada is most notable for one extended tour-de-force sequence: Clark's detailed, snowflake-by-snowflake description of a man's disorientation and eventual descent into madness as he tries to find his way out of a mountain blizzard.

Andy Carpenter, loveable lawyer (no, that's not an oxymoron,) is back and suffering from a severe case of \\"lawyer's block.\\" When you've inherited $$$ million dollars, it takes away your incentive to represent any old criminal who walks through the door. But things change when a cop of questionable ethics is killed. The same cop, Alex Dorsey, that Andy's lover, PI Laurie Collins, turned in when she was on the police force. Then a man strolls into Andy's office, confesses, and asks Andy to represent him. Meanwhile the police have arrested someone else, someone Laurie is sure is innocent. One suspect after another fizzles out until Laurie becomes the chief suspect. Circumstantial evidence abounds, and Andy finally has a client he can get behind. It's personal now and the stakes have never been higher as Andy has to find the real killer and exonerate Laurie. Somehow the laughs keep coming as tension mounts and the bodies pile up, no easy feat but a sure testament to Rosenfelt's skill. This fast, funny read will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you wanting more."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I read too much and too often. I picked up this book and was not familiar with Rosenfelt's previous work. I was hooked from the first page.There are many detective books that rely on humor that often falls flat. This is not the case. Many times, as I read into the night, I found myself laughing out loud and then quickling stifling that laughter so as not to wake up my wife.The lead character, Andy Carpenter, is engaging and enjoyable. You find yourself wanting him to meet up with different people to see how he reacts and what he is thinking about.The plot is smooth, interesting and entertaining. It is also enjoyable to see how Carpenter is going to handle new evidence or how he is going to figure out the answers. I enjoy Evanovich's books, but I find Rosenfelt's plot, characters and situations to be even better. When you read this book, you will get good action, great lines and a good, albeit short, read. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"David Rosenfelt's second novel, \\"First Degree\\", pretty much picks up where his highly acclaimed and immensely enjoyable debut, \\"Open and Shut\\", left off. Back is wise-cracking defense attorney Andy Carpenter, \\"Law-dromat\\" lawyer Kevin Randall, investigator/girlfriend Laurie Collins, and of course Tara, Carpenter's golden retriever. Even Willie Miller, the death-row inmate Carpenter defends in his first book, is back starring in a mostly unnecessary sub-plot. But if you enjoyed \\"Open and Shut\\", you'll certainly find the pace, style, and settings of \\"First Degree\\" comfortable. So comfortable, in fact, that reading \\"Open and Shut\\" is almost prerequisite, at least if you want to have any clue to the source Carpenter's mysterious inheritance and the imprisonment of his Senator ex-father-in-law which are frequently referenced in the new story.\\"First Degree\\" gets off to a fast start with the gruesome discovery of the headless and charred body of Alex Dorsey, a Patterson police lieutenant with a shady history. Shortly after the murder, a mysterious visitor shows up in Andy's office, confesses to being Dorsey's killer and, in the process, drops some clues regarding the murder that only those responsible for the crime would know. This leads to a series of events that ends in the arrest of Laurie Collins for the murder of Dorsey. Laurie indeed may have a motive: as a former Patterson cop, she blew the whistle on Dorsey's unsavory activities, but was unsuccessful in making the charges stick. With Laurie now in the hot seat, Andy and Kevin team up again, defending her against what appears to be a carefully concocted frame job. What follows is some compelling courtroom drama, spiced Andy's bizarre but now-legendary defense antics, paced with a satisfying blend of humor and cynicism. It is a well crafted who-dun-nit, with enough suspense and thrills to keep the pages turning. Like \\"Open and Shut\\", this is fast reading, and the sheer adrenalin will keep many reading cover-to-cover in a single setting. My only real criticism of \\"First Degree\\" is the ending. The book could have ended very successfully on page 224. Instead, Rosenfelt adds another seven pages - I guess he felt the need for one more twist - that falls flat in a wholly unbelievable &quot;second&quot; climax that was not only unnecessary, but casts a pall over an otherwise terrific story. Nonetheless, Rosenfelt has avoided the sophomore jinx, and turned out another first-rate crime novel. I'll look forward to his third, \\"Bury the Dead\\", to be released in June."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"FIRST DEGREE is a sequel that will delight the fans of David Rosenfelt's five star debut novel OPEN AND SHUT (review 10/23/2004). The following summary from my review of that book is equally applicable here. This is neither a novel of lasting historical significance or a truly overwhelming literary achievement. Rather it is a story that is great fun to read because of the enjoyable protagonist that the author has created to be the narrator. The story is related in the first person by attorney Andy Carpenter, who lives and practices law in Paterson, New Jersey. Andy's reputation is that of an excellent criminal defense attorney who is occasionally willing to engage in whatever courtroom theatrics and bizarre behavior are necessary to gain a verdict of not guilty for his clients. This methodology of course endears him to most defendants but frequently tries the patience of the opposing district attorney and more ominously on occasion puts him in risk of being held in contempt by the presiding judge. He is often compared, not always favorably, with his father, the legendary and respected ex-district attorney Nelson Carpenter.As readers of the previous novel will be aware, when this novel commences Andy is considerably richer and much more widely recognized than he was during that story. The wealth is a function of his receipt of a totally unexpected inheritance; the fame is a function of the central storyline of that novel - his success in the high profile reversal of the sentence of death row inmate Willie Miller (who had been prosecuted by Andy's father). If you are a reader who enjoyed OPEN AND SHUT and have looked forward to following Andy's further courtroom exploits, this book will delight you. Howver, if you have not read that book, there are two reasons why I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU READ IT PRIOR TO READING FIRST DEGREE. The most important reason is that paradoxically, in order to provide the information necessary to make this novel totally understandable as a standalone story, at various points enough background detail is summarized from the previous book that it would effectively act as a substantial spoiler to readers who became captivated enough by Andy and the other characters (and dogs) in FIRST DEGREE that they then decided to read the earlier book. Second, I believe that OPEN AND SHUT not only sets the table for readers of FIRST DEGREE, but is marginally more enjoyable for reasons which I will summarize at the end of this review. Thus, if you don't enjoy OPEN AND SHUT there will be no reason for you to read this book anyway; whereas if you do like the earlier novel as much as I did, you will have had the satisfaction of watching the plot in that book unfold as it was intended rather than already having summary knowledge of all the key elements of the story.Once again, the author has managed to create a compellingly fast read. One interesting and quite effective technique is that there are frequent section breaks (usually between every eight to fifteen pages) but no chapter notations to stop the flow of the story. Just as with the earlier novel, this book begins with Andy reminiscing with regard to the importance of the words \\"opening day\\" in his relationship with his recently deceased father. They had shared memorable times enjoying the thrill of many season openers at Yankee Stadium; he is planning to continue that legacy by \\"passing the sacred tradition on\\" to his only remaining family member, the irrepressible golden retriever Tara (who was an essential element of my enjoyment of the first novel given the resemblance of her personality to that of my own golden retriever). Of course, he realizes that this will require some creativity and adaptability on his part, and this event forms the delightful introductory four pages of the story. However, Andy's and Tara's enjoyment of the day is interrupted by startling news from Laurie Collins, the chief investigator for his law practice and the woman with whom he has fallen in love.Laurie stuns Andy with an announcement that former Police Lieutenant (and Laurie's boss when she was a detective in the Patterson Police Department) \\"Alex Dorsey is dead ... somebody decapitated him, then poured gasoline on his body and set it on fire.\\" Despite Laurie's contentious relationship with Dorsey, which was the reason that she had resigned from the Department, Andy is amazed at her totally atypical emotional response that she is glad that Dorsey is dead. Shortly thereafter, his amazement turns to shock when he is approached by a stranger, the mysterious Geoffrey Stynes, to be his legal representative in the \\"slight chance\\" that he is charged with the murder of Alex Dorsey. When the lowlife Oscar Garcia is charged by the police instead of Stynes, Andy is faced with the dilemma that crucial information which he possesses concerning the case is covered by attorney-client priviledge and therefore cannot be divulged to the police. Thus begins another murder mystery/detective story/legal thriller with frequent misdirection (of Andy and the police as well as the reader, who is seeing this unfold through Andy's first person narration of events). There are enough twists to keep the story interesting; then soon the case becomes even more personal to Andy than he could have imagined.All the main characters who remain alive from OPEN AND SHUT play meaningful roles in this story; hopefully the author plans to continue to evolve their personalities through future volumes of their exploits, combining the style of Robert Parker in his Spenser series with legal exploits more reminscent of Dismas Hardy in the books by John Lescroart. In addition to Andy, Laurie, and Tara, Willie Miller plays a significant role in this book including his introduction of a new friend to Tara and his discovery of a cause near the end of the story that will complete his rehabilitation and surprisingly engage Andy as well. Police Lieutenant Pete Stanton and disillusioned lawyer Kevin Randall (the owner of the Lawdromat which dispenses free legal advice while you do your laundry) also figure prominently in the story. To the delight of the author's fans, newspaper reporter Vince Sanders, Andy's secretary Edna, the \\"unchallenged crossword puzzle master of the Western World\\" and Judge \\"Hatchet\\" Henderson also reappear with their eccentricities integral components of this tale. .There is even a cameo apearance by Andy's former wife Nicole. In summary, this is another well thought out plot; the flow of the story is handled exceptionally well, the character development is uniformly good, the sports analogies provide marvelous insights, and Andy's wonderful pesonality makes the story sing and the reader smile.There are three reasons why I rated this book only four and a half stars in comparison with the full five stars that I gave to the earlier novel. First, the potential element of surprise of one of the really crucial twists in the story and its shock value is spoiled by the book jacket notes and some of the reviews which I read before purchasing the book. Thus, I suggest that if possible you avoid reading that information, but I suspect that most readers will have the same knowlrdege that I did before they ever start the story. While that is a minor factor in my downgrade, the other factors are more important. Second, even though the actions involved were a crucial element of the storyline, I was as stunned and saddened as Andy by the collateral damage to one of the good guys that resulted from the investigation of Dorsey's apparent murder. Third, and by far the most significant factor, was the fact that the mastermind behind Dorsey's death became obvious to me (and I believe many readers will share my insight) well before Andy made the connection. While admittedly sometimes it is easier for someone somewhat more removed from the frantic pace of the day-to-day investigative revelations and somewhat less emotionally involved than Andy to piece together the directions in which the clues lead, this fact nevertheless slightly detracted from my enjoyment of the story even though I still needed Andy to fill in the outline which I had glimpsed. Enjoyable characters, amusing dialog including Andy's wonderful sarcasm, moments of tense action, and the expected courtroom theatrics - highly recommended when you are in search of a fast paced light reading experience.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"As soon as I finished reading David Rosenfelt's first book Open and Shut which I thoroughly enjoyed, I thought this book cried out for either a sequel or series. I guess Mr. Rosenfelt accommodated me even before I read his first book because as soon as I finished this book I realized there were two more which were already written featuring the main character and other characters found in the first book.First Degree by David Rosenfelt is the second book in what I hope will be a long series which features Andy Carpenter, a rather unconventional and unique lawyer. But now Andy has inherited a large sum of money from his father and with little need to work for money, Andy hasn't worked in the legal profession in quite some time and has little interest in the cases which are offered to him by clients. As he puts if he's suffering from lawyers block.Then word reaches him that a missing and possibly dirty cop has been found decapitated and burned beyond recognition. Suddenly Andy is ready to go back to work. Not quite sure why this case intrigues him, Andy also never expected his client to be released so quickly after he claimed be the murderer. The next person who is arrested turns out to be a former policewoman who not only worked with the murdered man but knew just how dirty and corrupt he was while for worked for the police department Hired by the former policewoman will test every skill Andy has as a lawyer and there is no option about to win since this woman who readers may remember from Open and Shut is Laurie, Andy's girlfriend.As the author David Rosenfelt provided for us in his first book,this is a roller coaster of a mystery which will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this series for those among you who enjoy procedural legal cases. I did rate this book with a B+."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I'd never heard of Rosenfelt before picking this one up but I'll be actively looking for his other work after this masterpiece thriller. You think legal thriller or courtroom drama and the word usually boring comes to mind but Rosenfelt has found the balance between court room chapters and the more exciting outside world for events to happen in for the story to lose no substance. Andy Carpenter is a funny extremely likeable character, sort of like Harlan Coben's Myron Bolitar character, where Carpenter has to think on his feet to avoid either being killed, beaten up or outplayed in the courtroom making wisecracks at his opponents along the way. Dean Koontz style Rosenfelt gives Carpenter a loyal lovable golden retriever by his side as well.After a man confesses to the murder of Carpenter's girlfriend's arch enemy Carpenter faces an ethical dilemma of what to do as an innocent man faces trial. Oh and the innocent man also is a guy much hated by his girlfriend and ex cop Laurie. Much to the disgust of Laurie he decides to represent the guy but quickly learns this is only the start of his nightmare as Laurie also faces charges for the brutal murder. You won't be able to put this one down."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"and couldn't believe I'd missed the sequel. I had to find out about it from another Amazon reviewer.David Rosenfeldt has hero Andy Carpenter involved in a whodunit within a whodunit. There's a personal stake when lawyer Carpenter's investigator and lover, Laurie Collins, is accused of the brutal slaying of a cop who crossed her when she was on the police force. Andy's dog Tara is back, and we learn how his life has changed since he inherited $22 million of \\"dirty money\\" from his father. Solicitations from charities like the \\"Committee to Save the Otters of Guatemala Bay\\" impinge on his time, sometimes even interrupting the non-stop flow of NBA and college basketball games on his new large-screen TV.Rosenfeldt's biggest talent is not necessarily mystery, it's comedy. He has an incredibly funny way with words, and each character that Carpenter surrounds himself with is someone who connects with Andy's humor. Andy drops non sequiturs frequently, and gently baits people to keep up a running line of humor that is cynical and funny. Andy has an ongoing \\"song-talk\\" contest with Sam, his accountant, where they use song lyrics in conversation. Put this together with characters like sexy Rita Golden, the court clerk, and cousin Fred, who is the investment genius for Andy's money, and....well, you just have to be there for the humor.The plot does go over the top, from time to time, another Rosenfeldt comedic device. While characters are real, situations, in retrospect, go above and beyond the norm.Getting Laurie's house arrest, so that she stays with him while he defends her is one of these devices, but it enhances both the feeling of misery during the trial, and the odd situation Andy's in when Laurie can't help him investigate. There are other quirky couplings in the book -- Andy's client Willie Miller, from the first novel, is now sueing his ex-wife's father and his partner for over $10 million; it makes for interesting dialogue between Andy and Nicole. There's also the serious, in the way that Andy regrets getting his friends involved in his cases, when Sam's assistant Barry, is harmed while conducting part of the investigation.All in all, \\"First Degree\\" is a fast and enjoyable sequel, proving that David Rosenfeldt is not a one shot wonder (\\"Open and Shut\\" was nominated for an Edgar Award), and I look forward to more from him before the bestseller world finds him and turns him into a book machine.5 big stars!"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It was not too difficult to figure out 'Who done it', but the development of the main characters makes one want to read more about Andy Carpenter and his friends. I look forward to reading more of David Rosenfelt's novels."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"but I had to write this review to let the world know how very talented this author is. Each novel is more engrossing than the last. I say ...this is the last chapter for today and an hour later I am still reading. I am amazed at how his humor not only does not take away from the tense mystery and courthouse drama but enhances it. That little ray of sunshine injected at the right moment makes the drama more dramatic; the dark side, darker when you are confronted with it.Enough said...I just love his books."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"This is book two of the Andy Carpenter series. This is just as good as the first one. Here, the lawyer Carpenter has to defend his PI (and his lover) from a murder charge. Attacking the case with his usual sarcasm and wit, makes this an easy read. With his collection of slightly strange colleagues, Carpenter uncovers a twisting story that would rival anything Ross MacDonald might have written. His ending is excellent, a little on the edge but complete. And I am glad he worked his Tara Foundation into the story line. As a rescuer of five English bulldogs and three mixed mutts over the last thirty years, I enjoy reading about a similar person. Read this author...he is good."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I admit the dog on the cover caught my eye first, but this is a very good book. Rosenfelt is an enjoyable writer with a lot of humor."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"For the last few months I have been looking for a good mystery series that involves a dog. This is probably the best actual mystery plot I have read in my quest. It is an interesting story with several plots twists and interesting main characters. I like how the author handles his main character's sudden wealth. He uses the freedom but because of the dubious origin of the funds is somewhat put off by it all. The character's dog is his pet. He doesn't communicate with him or help solve the crime he is just a great golden retriever. Listen the author has set up a foundation that has saved 3-4,000 dogs. He could publish his dry cleaning bills and I'd buy them. But this is a good story and worth reading whether you are a dog person or not."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I really enjoy David Rosenfelt. His books are very cleaver and how could you not love Andy and Tara ? Just a very enjoyable read, I have not been disappointed by any of his books."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"This is the first David Rosenfelt book I've read and it sure won't be the last! I LOVE Andy Carpenter, his sharp wit, and his associates. The fact that he rescued and loves Tara, his golden retriever (even though I'm a German shepherd woman myself) also ranks him high in my book. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced mystery w/characters you'll enjoy instantly, First Degree is for you."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"\\"First Degree\\" is an entertaining, fast-paced legal thriller from David Rosenfelt, who was the marketing president for Tri-Star Pictures before deciding to write novels and screenplays. His debut novel,Open and Shut, won Edgar and Shamus award nominations. His second,First Degree, was a Publishers Weekly selection for one of the top mysteries of the year.The book at hand is the second in Rosenfelt's series about defense lawyer Andy Carpenter, who has inherited $22 million from his father. We also meet Andy's loyal golden retriever, Tara; and his lead private investigator, and love interest, former cop Laurie Collins. A cop's body is found burned and decapitated, and suspicion inevitably falls upon Laurie, who had repeatedly argued with her co-worker, and reported him to Internal Affairs for corruption and other various felonies. She is charged in his murder, and Andy, who had been suffering from \\"lawyer's block,\\" leaps to her defense, lawyer's block suddenly forgotten.I might quibble with some of the mystery elements, but the mystery is quite satisfactory. The book is well-written, inventive, dialog and narrative are deftly done, and its New Jersey setting is nicely-rendered. The legal details sound like the real deal. The clever plot is complex enough to hold interest, and it sure moves. What's more, the book is FUNNY. I found myself laughing aloud while reading it, and how often does that happen? It's definitely worth an extra star when it does.Also, of more than passing interest, Rosenfelt and his wife have established the Tara Foundation that has rescued over four thousand dogs, mostly golden retrievers. So far as I can see, there's no down side to the man or his book, and he was wasting his talents as a corporate suit. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Reviewed by J.Litman (New York)David Rosenfelt has done it again! This is the second book by this author that I've read in recent months; and it has certainly affirmed my belief that this author's books are worth reading. &#34;First Degree&#34; is a fast paced legal thriller. It kept my interest from beginning to the end. Andy Carpenter is a very good main character; and he is a dog lover too! Tara, his golden retriever, plays an important part in his life. As the mystery unfolds and the court case keeps the reader going, Tara reveals a major piece of the puzzle. With wit and clever investigating techniques, Andy has you on his side all the time. So what if the murdered victim was beheaded and burnt to a crisp! Or is he still alive? The author keeps you guessing on every page until the very end and that's what I like in a good mystery novel. Keep on writing Mr. Rosenfelt and I will keep on reading your books."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"This was another fun book! Some of the suspense had been removed for me since I discovered this series by reading the first thirty or so pages of the sixth book in the series (_Play Dead_). Still, this was fun to read and I was pretty surprised by the way it all turned out. I really liked the way the Tara Foundation is set up and I am excited to keep reading this fun series! It is kind of like watching a TV show in some ways because of the humourous narration."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"This is my 2nd Rosenfelt book and I've enjoyed them both very much. I'll be reading more by him.His mysteries have clever plot lines with numerous twists and turns that keep you guessing to the very end.I like that his characters, though seriously flawed in various ways, carry on in good and positive spirits. No dark, brooding characters, no complex psychological traumas, or no crazed or obsessive addictions. Just reasonably regular people - even the criminals are reasonably likeable and do things for sensible enough reasons and motivations.All in all, refreshingly straightforward and a great way to spend a few unplugged hours."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Rosenfelt's Andy Carpenter mysteries are great!I love his cast of characters. Keeps you interested in the story and delightfully entertained."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"What a funny funny guy. Great characters. Hilarious little barbs, quips, and comments intertwined with interesting plots."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"This series is a great series. This book has everything in it I like. A good story, great charecters, humor and mystery. I would definitly recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"This is an ejoyable book and wonderful follow-up to Rosenfelt's first Andy Carpenter novel&#34; Open and Shut&#34;.The author's humor made murder, if you will, fun!"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Andy Carpenter, Esq. is back and has become bored with his legal career. He is turning away business because he can, being the not-so-proud recipient of a huge sum of money, courtesy of his late (Judge) father's criminal activity payoff. Andy is just hanging around his office while his assistant, Edna, plays crossword puzzles and life just keeps moving along at a slow, boring pace. That is until his significant lady, cop-turned-investigator, Laurie Collins, proclaims a man by the name of Alex Dorsey was found decapitated with the remainder his body burned to ashes and his head nowhere to be found. Alex Dorsey was a dirty cop and the reason Laurie left the police force. Strange circumstances unfold with Laurie ending up being the prime suspect and Andy her defender. Lots of twists and turns and plenty of laughs as Andy and Edna come alive in the office, Andy's friend's dog, Cash, digs up the missing head in his backyard and Laurie receives a phone call from the dead man.David Rosenfelt is an extremely talented author, basing his storyline in the area of Paterson, NJ (my hometown) and the surrounding north Jersey towns. What a treat to read a story that keeps its reader not only hooked, but entertained to the very end."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"WHAT'S UP WITH THE PRICE OF THIS BOOK?? DID ANYONE NOTICE WHAT WAS ON THE COVER?SPECIAL PRICE...$4.99. MY RATING IS SOLEY DUE TO THE PRICE ISSUES. I HAVE NOT READ YET.DOES ANYONE KNOW?"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Love this audiobook. I would read (listen to) anything written by David Rosenfelt and the narrated by Grover Gardner, one of the finest narrators out there. In fact I search &#34;audio books narrated by Grover Gardner&#34; to determine what books I may purchase. &#34;First Degree&#34;, is the first of David Rosenfelt's novels which follow the charming lawyer Andy Carpenter, a wise-cracking millionaire defense attorney. Rosenfelt's second entry &#34;Open and Shut&#34;, is eaqualy as well writen and narrated. Next in the series is &#34;Leader of the Pack&#34;. I can't wait!"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Recently began reading the Andy Carpenter series by David Rosenfelt and am so happy I came across this author. I just finished this 2nd book (First Degree) in the series and found it even better than the 1st. I'm now on the 3rd book (Bury the Lead) and no disappointments. Mr. Rosenfelt keeps his readers amused with colorful characters and slick plot twists that surprise, yet do not confuse. Add in the dry humor comments from his main character and you've got the whole package. I suggest you begin with the first book (Open and Shut) in the series, and then move on in sequence as he refers back to incidents/characters from previous books. This book will keep you in suspense and make you laugh all the way to the end; great entertainment!"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I have now read all David Rosenfelt's Golden Retriever books. I have enjoyed them all immensely. I can't wait for a new one!"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author seems to have quite a sense of humor and it leeches into his main character. I love the wise-ass jokes that take you by surprise as you're reading the fast-paced, intriguing story. More than once I had to put my Kindle down and just laugh before I could read on. The witty repartee doesn't detract from the story at all, but rather adds to it as you find yourself relating to the protagonist. Based on this book, David Rosenfelt is now one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Andy Carpenter is the lovable lawyer of past Rosenfelt novels that hears about the murder of a notorious cop that walked both sides of good and bad. No sooner than he hears this news, than a man enters his office asking for representation for that specific murder which was a be-heading. Carpenter does not take the case, but soon realizes giving him that information was a ploy to have him dig deeper in to the case and possibly frame his lover.This novel moves quickly and is short. If possible I highly recommend you read it in just several sittings. Rosenfelt keeps the tempo fast but the attitude light with jokes and wise-cracks throughout. This is a beautiful straight forward legal thriller. Not the kind that will stick with you for years and years because of it's grace or maturity, but the kind that will make a flight from New York to Portland whizz by like you were a time traveler."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Extremely well-written. I've read a number of books that start out well-written but become hackneyed part of the way through. This book stayed well-written to the end. The narration and dialog are witty. The complicated plot doesn't slow the story down, just adds to the enjoyment. For those of you who are worried because there's a picture of a dog on the front cover, the dog doesn't speak or solve the crime - she's just a very appealing dog."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"We get a feel for laid-back lawyer Andy Carpenter when he is looking forward to \\"opening day,\\" that is, the day when a dog park is opening in his home town of Paterson, NJ, and where he is taking his beloved Golden Retriever, Tara, a rescue dog. He is soon surrounded by a gaggle of females, swooning at his compassionate act. He is in a new phase of his life, having recently inherited 22 million from his father, and, more importantly to him, proved a man innocent who was on death row. He hasn't had a client in months, but little does he know how dramatically his life is going to change when his love of a lifetime and private investigator Laurie Collins tells him of the brutal murder of a corrupt police lieutenant Alex Dorsey.If a visit a few days later from the self-acknowledged killer of Dorsey is not strange enough, then surely the arrest of another man for the crime, who Andy knows cannot be guilty, most certainly is. But the last shocker is that as a result of investigating this last accusation, it is now determined that Laurie is the guilty party. She certainly has motive - seeing her own police career go up in smoke when it became known that she had turned in the corrupt Dorsey to IA some two years prior, only to see him get no more than a slap on the wrist.Andy and his small crew - Edna, the office manager, and Kevin, a brilliant part-time lawyer - find themselves in the fight of a lifetime; the evidence, which Andy knows is manufactured, is seemingly airtight. But in this quick-moving, fairly short book, Andy leaves nothing unexamined. He chips away at the background and connections of everyone, no matter how remotely connected to the case, and steps on plenty of toes doing so, especially the prosecutor's. At least he managed to get Laurie released to his supervision, with electronic monitoring, even though Tara seems to have fallen under her spell. But a sobering moment does arrive - Laurie packs a small bag when returning to the courtroom for the verdict.The book is a good follow-up to OPEN AND SHUT, the author's first in this series. Reading the first is not mandatory, but does clarify some of what is referred to in this second book. This book has much to recommend it. Andy is a clever, witty, likeable guy. The plotting is intricate and crisp, equally split between the courtroom and outside developments. A last scene seems a bit tacked on, but can be ignored."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"David Rosenfelt continues his Andy Carpenter series - this the second installment after the superb \\"Open and Shut\\". A dirty cop's body is found - headless and burned. A man walks into Carpenter's office and confesses, asks Carpenter to represent him - which Carpenter declines to do. When another man is charged with the crime he feels he must take the case since he knows the man could not have done it. All of this sets up Carpenter's girlfriend, Laurie Collins to take the fall.Edna (the erstwhile secretary), Kevin (the laundromat owning legal associate), Willie (the wrongly accused from his first novel) and Tara (his dog) are back. Carpenter figures out he has been set up from that first visit from the \\"killer\\" and must play catch-up during the entire case.Rosenfelt builds the story and the suspense, leaving you wondering how he is going to carry the day. The story takes several unexpected turns and builds to a solid conclusion. Rosenfelt has gifted his protagonist with a dry sense of humor that, while not laugh out loud funny, leaves you wishing you could be as clever as quickly under pressure. Have downloaded the next novel already - can't wait to start it."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"This is a very well-done courtroom drama, kicked off when a bad cop turns up headless and burned to a crisp. Suspect(s) are named and a court trial ensues, featuring ace defense lawyer Andy Carpenter, whose rapier wit and irony is put to good use. You'll chuckle in more than a few places, and in others, you'll marvel at the author's ease in crafting a taut novel which crackles with authentic-sounding courtroom dialog. One criticism -- and a mild one at that -- is that Rosenfelt relies a little too much on serendipity and coincidence to develop his plot. Also, the blurb on the back cover implies that Carpenter's dog Tara will play a big part in the book. She doesn't, which is worth mentioning in case you think you're getting a dog book here. All in all, this is a delightful courtroom thriller, the first Rosenfelt book I've read, but certainly not the last."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I love the way he writes. He puts his personality into it and it's veryentertaining and easy to read. I read Open and Shut in four hours. Also, FirstDegree his second book. I'm looking forward to reading everything he's written.The story line is good and keeps your attention. I'm not easy to please but hiswriting is very pleasurable."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Attorney Andy Carpenter has been basking in the notoriety he gained by proving a client on death row innocent while living off the millions he inherited from his father. Andy has been more occupied lately with hanging out with Tara, the \\"best dog in the universe\\", and trying to find a worthy charity to share his money with, and isn't in too big of a hurry to get back in the courtroom. But when his investigator/lover Laurie Collins is arrested for the brutal death of a policeman she filed an ethics charge against, Andy's on the case and ready to defend Laurie against a frame-up. But the evidence against Laurie keeps stacking up and Andy is faced with a formidable challenge: how to convince the jury of Laurie's innocence.This witty courtroom drama bypasses many of the same genre simply because it's so much fun to read. Characters are well-developed and especially appealing is Tara, a dog Andy rescues from doggy death row at the animal shelter and to whom Andy is totally committed. There are plenty of legal maneuverings wrapped around a mystery that at times seems unsolvable. Rosenfelt's first-tense presentation is filled with witty cynicisms amid an intriguing, fast-paced plot."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I read the author's first book (Open and Shut) and enjoyed it so I jumped right into this book. If you have not already read the first book, you definitely want to go back and read the first book before this one because this book continues approximately 6 months after the end of Open and Shut and gives information regarding the ending of that book. If you read this one first, the ending of Open and Shut will be spoiled for you.This author isn't quite as good as Harlan Coben, to whom his writing has been compared. But if you like the Myron Bolitar novels of Harlan Coben, you will probably also like these books because Andy Carpenter is a smart-mouthed self-deprecating New Jersey guy much like Myron. Several of the minor characters from the first book are in this one as well: Laurie his girlfriend, investigator and accused murderer, Vince the newspaper editor, Kevin the Law-dromat lawyer, the \\"Hatchet\\" judge and, of course Andy's beloved dog Tara. The book has a nice blend of courtroom scenes and Andy trying to figure out how to prove his client's innocence.I enjoyed this book a lot and am going to start on the third book in this series."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"After greatly enjoying the first installment of the Andy Carpenter series, \\"Open and Shut\\" I was so hopeful that the next in the series would be just as solid entertainment. I wasn't let down. Court room drama mixed with dry humor with a plot that is fast paced, if a little familiar. Characterization is Rosenfelt's gift, if you like regular guy humor and an eccentric cast of supporting characters."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Most writers are annoying when they try to interject humor in serious topics. Butis author had me layghing out loud from time to time while I still remained intensely involved in his story."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"David Rosenfelt has such a wonderful and \\"real\\" sense of humor - you become involved with his characters and never want his stories to end. Read them all - you'll be delighted!"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Rosenfelt succesfully follows up his debut novel, Open And Shut, with First Degree. Rosenfelt is becoming one of the freshest voices among today's mystery writers due to his ability to provide interesting plots, credible courtroom drama, lots of humor and well-developed major and minor characters. Andy Carpenter, the main character who is a wise-cracking suburban New Jersey defense attorney, is one that stays in your mind even after you finish the book and is one that I'm looking forward to 'hang out' with in his future legal adventures. Plus, his dog, Tara, is one I wish I had. The only factor that keeps me from giving First Degree a 5-star rating is that Rosenfelt spent a bit too much time on humor to serve as \\"filler\\" to stretch out the length of this book (which is only 256 pages). Despite this very minor criticism I highly recommend First Degree when you're in the mood for a fast-paced, easy read. However, you might want to first consider reading Open And Shut, which I think will further your appreciation of First Degree."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"David Rosenfelt's books are a pleasure to read; as an author, he deserves more fame than he has garnered.His plots are clever and his legal information is compelling and pivotal. The dialogue is so bright that a reader will laugh aloud. Rosenfelt is that rare author who can write a mystery that actually holds its suspense to the final pages.His protagonist, Andy Carpenter, is well-formed.As with all of Rosenfelt's books that I've read to date, FIRST DEGREE was riveting in its complexity...and it's fun to boot."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"This book is truly un-put-downable. I finished it last night around 1 AM and there was no good place to stop from like page 100 till the end. So I would start it on a Friday night if I were you. Rosenfelt is one the best authors I've read, and I read a ton."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Please read the previous book in this series, Open and Shut before reading this book. It will introduce you to Andy and other main characters. This is the second book in this page turning series. There is a great story line, interesting and loveable characters, including Andy's dog, Tara. Don't bother reading the \\"what this book is about blurb\\" on the inside jacket, or Amazon summaries. Some of the humor is laugh out loud funny. If you are looking for a quick, easy and fun read I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"This second book from Author David Rosenfelt finds lawyer Andy Carpenter dealing still with various events of the first book titled \\"Open And Shut.\\" I am not going to explain those events or how they figure into the back-story of this book and thereby ruin this book for those so inclined to read it. Suffice it to say that this is a series and therefore this book should be read after the first.It has been six months as this novel opens and Andy's notoriety while fading somewhat seems to be bringing him clients that he does not want. This is especially true of one perspective client, Mr. Geoffrey Stynes. Andy wants to believe his clients are innocent and in a few minutes the strange Mr. Stynes not only makes Andy afraid for his own life, but completely shatters the illusion of innocence by confessing to the gruesome murder of Alex Dorsey.Alex Dorsey was a very crooked cop who apparently had connections in high places, which allowed him to get away with various activities for years. The discovery of his decapitated and burned beyond recognition body as well as the hunt for the murderer has been a major media story. Even if it weren't for the intense media coverage, Andy would know about the case thanks to his lead investigator and love interest, Laurie Collins. Laurie knew Alex was dirty and turned him to Internal Affairs. Soon she was labeled a \\"rat\\" as everyone in the Department knew what she had done. Her life as a Police Officer went downhill and when Alex Dorsey got essentially cleared of the charges; Laurie resigned in disgust several years ago. Andy isn't about to defend a confessed killer and that reason along with others, causes him to turn the case down and refuse to defend Stynes.Within a matter of days, Laurie is suddenly arrested and charged with murder in the death of Alex Dorsey. Andy begins to investigate in order to defend Laurie, secure in the knowledge that she didn't do it, and begins to have major problems. Not only is he unable to locate the strange Mr. Stynes because it seems that he doesn't exist, but what little he does find out makes it clear that Laurie as well as Andy are victims of an elaborate frame. A frame that may prove impossible to break as various parties at distance from the case begins to die.David Rosenfelt writes with a witty sarcastic style using various one-liners while at the same time weaving an intense thriller. His first book \\"Open And Shut\\" was very good and most of the characters involved in that book are back again in this one. His books are split between the ongoing mystery as well as courtroom drama and while he makes fun of Perry Mason style moments, he does have a few that border on the edge of that kind of situation. At the same time, his writing style gives depth and breadth to the characters and brings the major as well as minor characters to life. His books, including this one, are not peopled with stock characters but instead feature real characters that are fully drawn and evolving throughout the course of each intense book."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to realize that FIRST DEGREE contains most of the elements that I enjoy in a legal thriller. Protagonist Andrew Carpenter, a newly made millionaire, is an intelligent, self-deprecating, likeable attorney &quot;with enough sarcasm to dream about(using)a sarcasm patch&quot;.After months of refusing several potentially lucrative cases, Carpenter finds himself choosing to defend a small-time drug dealer accused of murdering a lieutenant on the Paterson New Jersey Police Force. Circumstances move rapidly as the charges against the defendant are dropped and re-filed against Carpenter's girlfriend, ex-cop Laurie Collins.The first half of this fast-paced legal thriller is used to set up the case. Rosenfelt introduces the characters with clever dialogue and literary devices. Carpenter and one of his friends engage in song-talking, manipulating their conversations so they can use the lyrics of popular songs to express themselves.Don't get the wrong impression though. FIRST DEGREE is much more than sarcasm and clever dialogue. Once the case is developed, Rosenfelt masterfully takes us to trial to watch and listen as Carpenter does his job to defend the falsely accused and embarrass the prosecution with a cleverly lain trap. There are thrilling moments with a theme of attorney privelege and Carpenter's responsibility toward the defendant and those he asks to help him. Rosenfelt has created a character that readers will want to follow and read more about. He has created a winner."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Well, for those fans of Mr. Rosenfelt, who have read his first one, buy this one too, you won't be disappointed. If you are new to this series, I hope you give it a try, you won't want to miss this one.I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed the first one, maybe even more because I so enjoyed visiting with these characters again. And of course, Mr. Rosenfelt again came up with a great story that when you thought you had it all figured out, he threw you a curve, and you were back to guessing.I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Other reviews have described the plot of First Degree: a bad cop gets killed and lawyer Andy Carpenter must clear his girlfriend Laurie, who has been framed for the murder. There are some plot twists -- a false confession and a possibility that the corpse might belong to someone else -- but for the most part, it's more of a light-hearted romp than a \\"legal thriller.\\"I was hooked when I read the opening, realized Tara was a dog and discovered the \\"grand opening\\" was for a dog park. And I kept reading, as I wanted to know how the end would turn out.Some books are strong on character or atmosphere. First Degree is a book of plot. Laurie, the girlfriend who was framed for murder, never became three-dimensional for me. The hero with \\"lawyer's block\\" was fun to read about -- like a guy who's fun for a date but not necessarily a relationship.What kept the book from five-star quality was the element of luck. Andy Carpenter's co-counsel just happens to know a Lieutenant Colonel in the army -- someone who can open all sorts of doors as well as files to secret information.And Andy has inherited a huge amount of money. Since the OJ trial, we've all learned that money can influence the outcome of a trial.The story behind the crime seems a little contrived as well. Framing an innocent victim and setting up red herrings is difficult and time-consuming. Few murderers go to all that trouble. The final confrontation is satisfying and well-done, but I think the real winner turns out to be Tara the dog.In a nice subplot, Carpenter wins a judgment for a man falsely accused of a crime. There's a humorous twist when we learn what he does with the money. Like the rest of the book, it's satisfying in a feel-good way, fun to read about and just on the edge of plausible."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I wish there were 1/2 stars to include in ratings, and that I could give this book 31/2, but I rounded up instead of down. Rosenfelt's first book was a pretty hard act to follow -- his experience as a screenwriter is evident. This would be a great series for Dennis Leary. I particularly liked the consistent references to sports which Rosenfelt has more than a passing knowledge of and which he has passed onto his character. The mystery at the center of the book is not as compelling as that in the first book, but I look forward to reading the third and wait for more to come."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I have added David Rosenfelt to my list of favorite authors. His writing is engaging and I look forward to his next novel! Write fast!"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I love Andy Carpenter. He is hard character not embrace. But former movie exec David Rosenfelt again writes a screenplay. It is a bit deeper than his first novel, but most of the characters and plot lines are flimsy. It is quick read and Andy keeps it funny. However, if you like the character type, you are much better off reading William Lashner's books about similar character. Not a bad book, but not worthy in my mind of consideration of great legal thrillers."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Great characters, dialogue and courtroom scenes are the strength of this book. Having grown up in Jersey (New Jersey, that is), I love books set there. I did figure out the bad guy farily early, so that was a slight weakness. But this was a quick, enjoyable read, with a good plot, suspense and a bit more depth that his first book, \\"Open and Shut.\\" I would, however, recommend reading the series in order."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"is what we learned to expect from DR's first Andy Carpenter installment, OPEN &amp; SHUT. Not one to disappoint, Rosenfelt comes through again and has firmly established himself on the top of many reader's lists who are faithful to the genre. The suspenseful turns are not to be outdone by protaganist, Andy Carpenter's, sharp wit &amp; humor. I actually found myself laughing out loud a couple of times. How often does that happen in the average legal thriller? Rarely ... my point exactly - this is far above average &amp; I hope we can look forward to more from this exceptionally gifted writer!"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"If you enjoy a good mystery with humor, you will really enjoy this book and this author. My husband and I have read both of Mr. Rosenfelt's books and enjoyed them very much. We are looking forward to his future books as well.

These are such books."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I've read hundreds of mystery, and my favorites could be counted on both hands. Rosenfelt's book, First Degree, blew me away. I loved it.

If you read these reviews Mr. Rosenfelt, get going on that next novel. I can't wait."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"America's love affair with the law is sweeping and pervasive.

Across America, daytime television features numerous judges conducting video trials on countless cable stations. Our fascination with the law extends to our reading behavior. A cursory look at any bestseller list will generally yield several courtroom-related efforts on both the fiction and nonfiction lists.FIRST DEGREE by David Rosenfelt marks the second appearance of Andy Carpenter, a New Jersey attorney whose personal history portends many future cases and clients. In order for a writer to have the luxury of a continuing character, there needs to be a hook upon which to hang succeeding novels. For Carpenter, Rosenfelt has chosen as his hook something easily understood by lawyers and non-lawyers alike: money. Andy Carpenter is wealthy, having inherited 22 million dollars from his father. This nest egg allows Carpenter the luxury of picking and choosing clients based upon a simple premise: whether the case and the client interest him.Before securing his eventual client in FIRST DEGREE, Carpenter must survive two false starts. Alex Dorsey, a local police officer of shady reputation, has been found murdered, his body decapitated and burned. Geoffrey Stynes appears at Carpenter's office seeking to hire him as his attorney. Stynes assures Andy that he will shortly be arrested for Dorsey's murder. That evening, a man named Oscar Garcia is arrested for the murder and Carpenter discovers to his amazement that Geoffrey Stynes does not really exist. An imaginary man has confessed to an actual killing for which another man is charged. By itself, this plot could be an outstanding mystery but Rosenfelt has a few more ingredients to add to the stew. As additional evidence is discovered, Garcia turns out to be the wrong man and charges against him are dropped. Suspicion now turns to private investigator Laurie Collins, a former colleague of Dorsey. Collins also happens to be Carpenter's love interest. Of course Andy will represent her, and the stage is now set for the trial that serves as the major portion of FIRST DEGREE.While David Rosenfelt has woven an intuitive and intricate plot, when his characters enter the courtroom to do battle in a criminal trial, they lose some of their appeal. Rosenfelt is not an attorney; he is a screenwriter and former president of a marketing company, which perhaps explains why his courtroom scenes sound more like talk show confrontations than legal encounters. Andy Carpenter as an advocate is just a touch too insulting to opposing counsel and acerbic in his demeanor to be believable as a trial lawyer. He is to the practice of law what Judge Judy is to actual judges. They just do not, and should not, behave as they do in their fictional world.This is however a minor criticism of a wonderful, well-paced mystery that keeps the reader guessing as to who actually killed Alex Dorsey. Andy Carpenter is an interesting character who will certainly have his share of intriguing cases in the future. A little humility in the courtroom, along with a touch more respect for the law, will make him a very readable character.--- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I am hooked on all David Rosenfelt novels... I particularly like the Andy Carpenter series, but always, whatever he writes, it holds me to the end and keeps me guessing (and rarely figuring out who dunnit). He is a master. This is just one more!"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"The book, First Degree, arrived quickly and was a good read. I look forward to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"This character is not like Alex Cross or Jack Reacher which is why I like the books. I wanted interesting, and not the same. Give it a try."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I like his style of writing and would recommend him to anyone. I have currently bought 6 of his books and intend to purchase more,"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I was tempted to make this a 3-star review but I enjoyed it enough to squeeze out a 4. The author does sarcastic smart-ass lawyer really well. That's fine for the first couple of chapters, but like syrup-drenched pancakes, you can only take so much in a sitting before you want something more substantial. I had to keep putting the book down. The plot is fast-paced if ridiculously implausible and the characters are mostly likeable if equally unlikely. Like most mystery writers without a legal background he gets almost everything in the law wrong -- lawyers objecting to the answers of witnesses (they move to strike), a state court judge issuing an order to the FBI to produce a file (never happen), and the FBI complying (really really never happen, take it from an ex-FBI agent) and an army Lt. Col. who can command state prison officials to make exceptions to their rules on visitors. The story will make you roll your eyes, but there will be a smile on your face."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Getting lost on the very first page of First Degree was easy. It started with talk of an opening day. You will be asking, Opening day of what?Rosenfelt will lead you to believe that it might be opening day of baseball season - but will then tell you that what he really meant was opening day of the dog park that he's now taking his dog, Tara, to visit.You'll hope this is not a sign of what is to come. And it won t be.You will learn, through that opening day fiasco, that Andy Carpenter loves animals and rescued Tara from death row of an animal shelter. He also has rescued a human from death row, Willie Miller.In fact, Mr. Miller's name comes up often enough that you will wonder if he's the murderer in this tale. You'll also be introduced to the love interest in Andy's life, Laurie Collins - an ex-cop turned P.I., and now works for Andy.Laurie comes into the story with a big bang, announcing that Alex Dorsey, a cop that Laurie had once provided evidence against, has been killed - decapitated and then set on fire. Not really sure in what order. Alex had been the reason Laurie quit the force and became a private investigator.Andy is then confronted with Geoffrey Stynes who comes to his office, confesses to killing Alex Dorsey and asks for representation. Andy declines.Shortly after, Oscar Garcia is arrested. Andy, believing that Geoffrey Stynes is the killer, takes Oscar's case.Just one more arrest in this case - Laurie. Oscar is freed and Laurie is brought up on murder charges. Andy ends up representing Laurie at her trial. His somewhat sarcastic sense of humor follows him right into the courtroom.From there on, expect the unexpected. There are more surprises to come.David Rosenfelt allowed us to know Andy on a very personal level as the book is written in first person. The good part of that was being able to eye every detail through Andy and thus have the same opportunity to figure out the case."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"A great mystery surrounded by characters that make you chuckle. This is a book that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"Paterson, New Jersey attorney Andy Carpenter enjoys the freedom of newly acquired wealth, though the accompanying fame from his previous OPEN AND SHUT CASE makes him a mark for every local felon in the city where Lou Costello was born. Still proving death row inmate Willie Miller innocent was quite a feat, but though bored and able to be selective in choosing whom he wants to represent, Andy selects no clients.Everything changes when private investigator Laurie Collins informs Andy that someone decapitated and set on fire dirty Patterson cop Alex Dorsey. Laurie once worked for Alex and tried to get him kicked off the force for his illegal dealings, but failed. Many folks on both sides of the law had motive and means to viciously kill Dorsey. However, PPD finds staggering circumstantial evidence that clearly points towards Laurie as the killer. Now motivated to work the judicial system, Andy and his help chase down every lead regardless of how small, but they either turn out dead, dead ended, or find more proof that his beloved client murdered the deserving victim.FIRST DEGREE is a tremendous legal thriller. This and his previous novel proves that David Rosenfelt is heading for a seat on the Supreme Court of sub-genre authors. The story line is fast-paced whether it is in the courtroom or on the street seeking clues. Even more important is his effortless switching between the legal machinations and the investigation. Still what makes this OPEN AND SHUT novel a winner is the strong, fully developed and personable cast who readers will like so they will root for a not guilty resolution.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"I generally rely on the customer reviews I read and make my selection based on them - boy was I thrown on this one. Andy is NOT funny, the plot does twist - in knots! All I can figure out about Laurie is she's a good cook and has no problems sleeping.

It was sort of funny in places but nothing to rave about. Won't be reading this author again."},{"Title":"First Degree","review":"David Rosenfelt does it again. In his first book, &quot;Open and Shut&quot; he made me his own with his cocky main character, Andy Carpenter and his dog, Tara. David is a male Sara Paretsky only better. By page 23 I'd laughed out loud three times. What's not to like about that?"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Thomas Hardy was never one to refrain from controversey in his writing, as is evidenced by his decision after the negative reviews that \\"Jude the Obscure\\" received to never write novels again but to devote himself entirely to poetry. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" opens with perhaps one of the most unique plot devices in Edwardian/Victorian literature, when Michael Henchard, a young haytrusser becomes drunk at a country fair and sells his wife and daughter to whoever will pay five guineas for them. What follows afterwards, for Michael Henchard, is a life tinged by regret, even as he finds himself prospering in all other manners. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a compelling story of how falsehoods and regrets can overshadow one's life if they are allowed to do so.After selling his wife and daughter, Michael Henchard vows that he will not touch alcohol for twenty-one years and manages to build himself up to the position of a prosperous businessman and mayor in the town of Casterbridge. As he nears the twenty-first year of his oath, his wife Susan returns, finding him in his exalted position, and Henchard knows the only right thing to do is \\"remarry\\" her since they have been legally married all these years, and therefore make it possible for him to claim Elizabeth-Jane as his true daughter, not just step-daughter. Yet life has many secrets for Michael Henchard - some he keeps, like the fact he is engaged to another woman, and one shocking one that his wife keeps from him that will desperately impact his dealings with Elizabeth-Jane. While Henchard has prospered up to this point, a falling-out with his foreman, the Scotsman Donald Farfrae, leads to his eventual downfall in both his private and his public life. As evidenced by the selling of his wife, Henchard allows his quick temper to get the better of him, and he sets his mind on revenge to all those who have wronged him, whether acutal or not. Therefore, he constantly finds himself at odds with Elizabeth-Jane, with Donald Farfrae (whom he would like nothing better than to kill), and with another woman from his past who has upset his life.Michael Henchard is truly a tragic character, for while it may be easy to dislike him for his roughness and his callow actions, he is not entirely an evil man. His fault is that he regrets his actions, just usually too late. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a surprisingly fast-paced read, with a vivid setting and an extremely intriguing character in Elizabeth-Jane. The web that Michael Henchard manages to spin for himself is compelling and familiar, as these characters and their motives transcend beyond the time period captured so effortlessly by Hardy."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"...but without the histrionics.One of the greatest novels ever written. Also one of the most suspenseful and (for those whose palates have not been ruined by trash) one of the most enjoyable."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Reread this one recently - what a great book. This is my favorite of all Hardy's books. The fascinating part of this novel is the protagonist, because he is such a mix of good and bad. He has good and even heroic impulses and acts, and bad and even evil impulses and acts. The way he manages to sabotage the good things he could get reminds me of Lily in the House of Mirth, although Henchard's sabotage is due to through bad temper and anger and insecurity, while Lily's are due to ambivalence. But the trip downward is quite similar. Basically it ends up being the story of a man's self-destruction. What a crime that Hardy's novels were unpopular when he first wrote them, and the bad reviews discouraged him from writing more! I have them all but wish there were more."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is undoubtedly one of the finest novels of the Victorian Era - quite a tribute given that the period produced a countless number of classics. The conflict between Michael Henchard and Donald Farfrae reflects a clash between tradition and modernity. This dichotomy is perhaps best encapsulated in their contrasting styles of record keeping; Henchard relies entirely on intuition and memory while Farfrae maintains extraordinarily meticulous accounts of all his transactions. Furthermore the struggle between Farfrae and Henchard reflects a conflict of vastly different temperaments. Henchard proves to be of a passionate temperament while Farfrae is rational and levelheaded. For instance, despite his modest means and limited experience, Farfrae boldly ventures into agricultural trading and through a series of shrewd bets manages to unseat Henchard as Casterbridge's preeminent merchant. In order to regain his erstwhile position, Henchard engages in rash and seemingly desperate speculation - in contrast to the prudent risk taking of Farfrae - that ultimately culminates in his ruin.While some AP students have chastised Henchard for his inability to overcome his animalistic nature, the more astute reader realizes that his inveterate character serves to illustrate a basic theme of most Hardy novels - the philosophy of determinism. The rise and fall of Henchard illustrates the unpleasant reality that one's life is subject to forces beyond one's control - in Henchard's case a deeply flawed character - and these forces often overwhelm the power of one's determination and ambition. This doctrine is certainly anathema to 21st century Americans who firmly believe in the concept of free will and a future holding great promise. While constantly lamenting one's ill fate is self-defeating, it would be naive to entirely disregard the power of destiny to shape one's life for worse as powerfully shown in the tragic tale of the Mayor of Casterbridge."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The mayor of casterbridge is a descriptive, sad, but fun to read novel that keeps the reader glued to the seat. In this novel, Tomas Hardy's skill for describing the enviroment is clear, and his characters are vibrant and true to life. I recommend this novel to anyone who is in search of a great read."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"This is truly a classic tragedy, and perhaps Hardy's very best. The opening is one of the most memorable I've ever read; Michael Henchard gets drunk and auctions off his family. The tale spins off from there, boldly and without restraint. Though Hardy is a pessimist, he knows how to craft a story of unforgettable characters inspired by all sorts of passions- some taking whatever they can find for themselves, and some giving generously and unconditionally. Wait until you meet and get to know Elizabeth; she is a beautiful human being! I always learn so much from Hardy. I'm grateful that he wrote the novels he did before turning exclusively to poetry. This one in particular is so well done that I don't know how anyone can fail to be impacted and changed by it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"A question about the source of human tragedy lies at the heart of The Mayor of Casterbridge. Characters frequently mention fate and providence as causes for tragedy (and joy), but Hardy offers more subtle and complex explanations for individual tragedy. At times, Hardy seems to indicate that circumstance and timing play a more important role than Providence in shaping the course of human destiny. Can people survive without the aid of luck or providence by pure force of will? Henchard (the Mayor) is a man whose loneliness, egoism, and pride cause him to make bad decisions. His faulty judgement certainly do not help him in his quest for fulfillment, either. Hardy's depiction of an ultimately unknowable universe is achieved partly through his characters' false assignment of meaning to meaningless incidents. Fate, human will, and faulty perceptions are central issues in much of Hardy's writing. Though not as moving and intense as Hardy's masterpiece Tess of the d'Urbervilles, The Mayor is not to be missed. Hardy's complex rendering of Henchard's multi-faceted personality is remarkable. In addition, The Norton Critical Addition provides excellent commentary and background information from noteworthy critics."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"In the novels of Thomas Hardy, tragedy can be an externalized force like Egdon Heath in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE or it can be of the internalized sort, the kind that Michael Henchard brings on himself in THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE. In either case, nature is unforgiving, a quality which is a given in any of Hardy's works. When tragedy is of the latter kind, then the protagonist is not unlike the doomed tragic hero from classical Greek drama wherein he is first seen as a great or simply a good man who suffers from a tragic flaw, the results of which drag him down so that by the end of the action, his state is so miserably pathetic that the reader/audience can do no more than shake their heads in sorrow at his downfall, that in another and less proud man need not have happened at all.Michael Henchard is the post-Victorian man of mixed qualities who like Oedipus, commits a sin and then spends the rest of the book trying to make amends. His sin is maudlin self-pity. He allows his current debased financial position to lead him to drink, all the while blaming his wife and child. At an auction, he offers his family for the sale to the highest bidder. He ignores the warnings from those present that he is courting disaster. An unknown man offers the highest bid and off he goes, taking Henchard's wife and child with him. Hardy takes pains to place Henchard squarely in the middle of this somber farce. Hardy gives no name to the successful bidder nor does he allow the reader to note the wife's actions. She, surprisingly, remains silent, but weeping. Henchard, by contrast, is loud, crude, and obnoxious. He occupies central stage until the next chapter when he sobers up, is filled with remorse, and then tries to set things right. He fails and winds up the leading citizen of Casterbridge. The image of the drunken Henchard and the mayor Henchard are startlingly unlike. The latter is sober, industrious, and respectable, causing the reader to commiserate with him. But the tragedy of Henchard does not lie merely in a series of vain regrets. Just as he seems to undergo permanent rehabilitation of self, his ex-wife shows up again, with a new child from the now dead bidder. Hardy complicates the plot with his usual unwieldy complications. As a result, Henchard plunges again into the depths of despair; this time he shows that his old sins of false pride and egotism have returned with a vengeance. He tries to bankrupt his business partner Farfrae, for reasons purely of jealousy. It becomes progressively more difficult for the reader to maintain the same sympathy that they had earlier. Later, at the novel's close, Henchard is made to wander like a wounded Lear, and this alone partially elevates him back to his previous stature of a tragic figure. He, like Lear, dies repentant. From his death, the audience discovers that the essence of a tragic fall lies not so much in how much sympathy that protagonist garners during that fall but rather in how true to life his fall was. Michael Henchard was neither saint nor reprobate sinner. He was the Victorian Everyman with a mixture of goodness and mean-spiritedness, either of which could emerge under the right circumstances. At his fall, the reader saw that the \\"right\\" circumstances were sufficiently ordinary so that anyone of us might have done the same. This is the essence of the tragedy of THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Read this novel after Far From The Madding Crowd and Return of the Native. It's a very bleak and depressing novel - without the comic flourishes and moments of his earlier work.The story follows Michael Henchard, a hay-trusser, who sells his wife and child for five guineas in an 'auction' during a fit of inebriety. He spends the next 21 years regretting his action, but during that time he does well for himself, becoming mayor of Casterbridge, a rural town. Years later, his wife and daughter reappear. This starts a chain of events that leads to Henchard's fall. He eventually ends up losing everything because of his pride, passion and stubborness. The main character isn't very likeable, but there is something of the tragic about him that commands your attention."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Mayor Henchard was drunk when he sold his wife and child. This instance of reckless cruelty would come to haunt him in his later years. Overall a pious and good man, his downfall was his reluctance to face his past. His will dictated his epitaph. He will never be heard from again. (The will is on the last few pages of the book.) Fading into nothing, it challenges the reader to find a term for death. Is death the physical end of life, or the emotional end of life. Readers will be challenged to determine their own answers to Henchard's damnation."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"This is a fabulous book written in classic Hardy style. It's full of twists, turns, and surprises. Just when you think you know where Hardy is leading you, he throws in another detail, which leaves you dumbfounded and believing that no other than Thomas Hardy could pull this off."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I found this book to be very enjoyable. It is an easy read. I did not give it 5 stars because there are parts of the story that are long and slow. The story picks up about 1/3 of the way in if you can make it that far."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I like this story the most of Hardy's works. An interesting tale with some good, realistic characters. I think I'll read it again."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"So many people have read this classic book that if you are one of the few who haven't then give it a try. Its an excellent novel of English life."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I found this book a very interesting read. Although I do not feel it is one of Hardy's finest, it was, never the less, entertaining. It did not seem to achieve the level of pathos, or engender the concern for the main characters that \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" did. There were numbers of similarities between this book and Dickens' \\"Little Dorrit\\", except Hardy appeared to see how many mistaken innuendos, statements never made that could have cleared up false impressions, and misguided moralistic pressures could be fit into one story. All said, I am glad I read \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\". I enjoyed it very much, I just didn't LOVE it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was a good mystery. The characters were \\"round\\" rather than 'flat' which generated an interest in what happened to them. Like most of Hardy's books, the main character was on a downward spiral from which he never recovered. This is a downer but it did hold my interest throughout. I am a fan of The Classics."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Thomas Hardy has written a surprisingly modern novel.I love all his classic stories.I can never decide which one is my favorite.His characters,his plots and his settings are very realistic."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"This book is difficult to read at first as it is written in a dialect we are not used to, however once that is established the story moves right along and the characters become familiar. I felt many of the characters were flat and not fleshed out enough. Elizabeth lacked \\"backbone\\" I wanted her to have a bit more of the spunk of her \\"friend\\". I really liked the mayor and wished that he could have just thought before he opened his mouth. Mr Hardys descriptions of the English countryside put me right there with him. A good read."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Though I expected sadness and misery, I was hoping for something more profound at the ending than \\"Happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.\\"This is a many chaptered narrative that shows how the results of good intentioned-or-not mistakes can lead to personal ruin. The reader also will lose all respect for the main character.A problem with Victorian Period literary giants I have is their long sentences. I counted one at 82 words.Would only recommend this to someone who likes a challenging read (big words and colloquial language) and who doesn't mind a depressing, predictable story.\\"The sun was resting on the hill like a drop of blood on an eyelid.\\" Best line."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Having just finished reading Thomas Hardy's Tess of the de'Ubervilles I just had to read another of his books.I found this one and enjoyed it just as much if not more so.I'm sort of on a run of reading classic books. Once you get used to the period of time and the style of writing ~ in old english, of sorts ~ one needs to continue this type. You get so much more out of a book that way.While this book may have been written in the 1800's I must say that the events taking place, the people and their responses doesn't seem to have changed one iota to the way society behaves today. This is a charming story of rags to riches to rags again. A story of humility, starting over, of pride, of desolation and back to humility again. It does have a bit of subtle romance, which keeps the story flowing.Both of the Thomas Hardy's books (Tess of the de'Ubervilles) and this one are wonderful stories and well worth reading.Interestingly it wasn't after I finished reading them that I discovered that these books were considered Young Adult reading. I guess someone rated it this way because it's a pure, non-smuttly book so ubiquitious of today's media.I don't care about the rating I just appreciated Thomas Hardy's contribution of literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"This is the easiest Thomas Hardy novel, but one of the most complex in terms of emotions. Being an English literature fan, I have to say that the story that goes on in this book is one of the most original and refreshing. If you found Tess of the DUrbervilles (another Hardy book) too difficult but loved the general storyline, read this, it's simpler for the simple minds out there."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I loved the book! It is not for the faint of heart as it takes a little more time to read....the old English. The story is classic."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Michael Henchard (yep - - later he's the Mayor, all right), having sold his wife and baby early in the novel for 5 guineas while in a drunken rage, gets what he deserves despite his valiant efforts at atonement years later after an initial rise in fortune and a 'chance' reunion with his long-abandoned wife and daughter. Not that an example of Divine retribution is Hardy's intention; Hardy was an atheist. But he stacks the cards so heavily against Henchard that it's hard to believe he isn't a True Believer after all. Chance? Irony? Coincidence? (Synchroncity?? Gadzooks!) Divine retribution? All grist for Hardy's deterministic mill, and a grinding mill it is for Henchard. It ultimately doesn't matter - - to prove his point Hardy orchestrates the narrative so obviously and nothing can stop Henchard's downward spiral, of course. Everywhere in the novel, it's plain he's doomed. Hardy created this character whose final wish, as Hardy has him spell out in his will, is that he be forgotten. And then Hardy titles the novel after him for the ages. Did I hear someone say 'Omniscient Narrator'? Pretty divine, I'd say."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The book is essentially a daytime soap opera. Except, none of the characters are likeable.My suggestion: read only the very last line of the book. The book's very existence strives to make this sentiment true."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I began reading this novel since it has such a great reputation as being a &quot;classic.&quot; However, after reading well over a hundred pages, the book failed to keep my attention in the least bit. The plot is weak and pathetic, and the characters are too one-dimensional. Although it may pick up later, it certainly is not worth it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I read this book for a class, and I am sorry to say that it was a disappointment. It is a silly tale, and totally unrealistic. I cannot believe that something like this could be considered a &quot;classic&quot;. Mike sure made some dumb choices, and it is unrealistic! No one could make that many blunders. It was bogged down by unnecessary details, etc. All-in-all, a 100% waste. Don't buy this book. You've been warned."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Thomas Hardy, while certainly an extremely talented author, seemingly had the knack of producing Victorian-era soap operas which never fails to depress even the most cheerful soul. Sometimes his depressing stories has a message that produces a somewhat cathartic reading experience (as with Tess of the D'Urbervilles), but with The Mayor of Casterbridge all we get is utter negativity. This mayor is one twisted, selfish and self-loathing individual. He seems to live with a rain cloud over his head, and doesn't quite understand how it is to be loved. Fun guy? Nope. And there isn't even a happy ending.Bottom line: nice characterizations and fine prose amount to lipstick on a sow. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I skimmed some of the longer descriptions of scenery/village life. There was still plenty to stir my imagination. This study of human character - especially that of Henchard - was very interesting. Really enjoyed the book!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge isn't really about a man who sells his wife and daughter. Yes, that is part of it, but 80% of the story has little to do with that fact. In actuality, it is about relationships, and the choices we make that can have an impact on those we love. The story twists and turns, and weaves several different characters' stories into one neat ending, but can be predictable at times.I personally enjoyed the book, but it can be slow and predictable at times, as I already mentioned."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I chose this book because I had never read any Thomas Hardy.

It came just in time."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"About two thirds through this undeniably great work, I began to question everything I thought I knew about this book. Kicking off in high drama and then barrelling on in that fashion with not even a stop for air, the twists and turns in Hardy's tale of morality, regret, and character seemed to occur due to the faults and failures of the principal actors, and not thanks to any plot contrivances on the part of Hardy. Which ever the case, this is a great testament to Hardy's writing abilities, but as the story progressed, the idea that Hardy was pushing the limits of \\"fate\\" and \\"tragedy\\" to its extreme seeped in. By the time I finished the book and sat puzzled over the complete change in tone for the last two paragraphs, I realized that Hardy had written one of the greatest pieces of satirical tragedy ever.Based on an actual inicident Hardy read about in a local newspaper, a husband, travelling on the road with his family, gets drunk and auctions off his wife to the highest bidder. After being offered a considerable amount of money, the wife is sold and she willingly leaves with the highest bidder, daughter in tow, as the drunken husband stays behinds and drinks.End first scene, cut to 18 years later. The man has become a teetotaler and has so righted his life, he has become the Mayor of Casterbridge. The wife enters the town, beautiful now older daughter in tow, looking for her former husband now that her husband-by-auction has died. They meet, work out a plan to remarry, and set about doing that.We then discover that the Mayor is already engaged to another woman. We discover that one of the Mayor's enemies is interested in wooing his daughter. We discover that the girl he believes is his daughter- has been told is his daughter!- is not actually his daughter. Discovery after discovery rain down upon us, each one forcing the characters to react in ways that while always consistent with their characters, creates further drama and eventually, tragedy.Hardy is an incredible author and even if this was nothing more than a tale about character and ethics, it would be an incredible read. When viewed as a satire of such tales, however- like an updated Job story without the God aspect, with the Mayor being Job- the work rises to another level. Hardy is funny, and even in the context of obviously serious works, there are occasional lighthearted moments. But once one grasps this complex work as a satire of similar works, Hardy verges on being hysterical. The Mayor of Casterbridge is a living character with obvious faults, but the heap of abuse that Hardy piles upon him in no way corresponds with his initital heinous act. Unless, of course, you're trying to be funny.Regardless of whether this is meant to be taken seriously or not, it is an underrated (as far as Hardy books go) classic.(And those last two paragraphs I alluded to above: their tone, syntax, vocabulary all sound like they come from a different book. To me, it sounded like Hardy was having one last laugh, foolishly trying to validate all the tragedy that occurred with two \\"intellectual\\" sounding paragraphs. One last bone to throw to those so absorbed in morality tales that they couldn't see that this whole journey was a farce.)"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Fast delivery and was able to enjoy with my daughter on a cross country trip. It came just as I thought."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Nineteenth century literary classic, details a man seeling his wife and daughter and the long term consequence. It's a pretty powerful and deeply ambitious story, one that makes up for a couple feeble plot stimulators with a powerful psychological representation. What's most interesting is the protagonist, the titular individual. A man so committed to drunk and evasion that he will sell off his own family. Also a man that works across the rest of the novel to redeem himself from this moment, but not without much backsliding and fresh egotistical mistakes. He's also capable enough to claw his way up into a position of wealth and authority, but then later lose that fortune, and the book is quite effective in showing the degree to which his admuirable qualities are tied in with his core defects. He's far from a monster, and for all the damage his pride and spiteful rejection cause to other lives there is much to admire about him, his strength of character, his general optimism and the way he's able to come forth with strong ethical choice at the most surprising moments. He's an intriguing, complex and overall plausible character, most notably in the way that none of his grand transcendetal moments lack, the way he continually reverts back partially to his earlier ways.More generally, the work shows an engaging cynicism about the status of class, gender and hypocrisy in contemporary England. There are some very strong critiques in here against Victorian society, to the extent that I'm surprised it attained the popularity it did in its own time, and these are always coonected to an engaging novel. It makes me a lot more interested in reading the other nineteenth century literary classics I've so far neglected.

Foreseeing its approach, I would want to put the whole novel aside, but morbid fascination led me to continue reading. That's the way it is with thrillers. At least most of the disasters befell the main character, a loathsome individual who, unfortunately, reminded me very much of someone in my own life.

The Mayor of Casterbridge is widely considered to be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel. It is a classic tale of the spiral and eventual demise of an essentially bad man. The story is rich with personal intrigue... sins, lies, cover-ups, love triangles, secret identities and so on... making it a continual pleasure to read. The regional dialect (spelled phonetically throughout) can be a bit cumbersome to wade through at times, though it certainly lends atmosphere to the novel.The characters are interesting and easy to relate to and Hardy did an admirable job of making most of them distinctly human: Michael Henchard is \\"bad\\" (as evidenced by the sale of his wife and child in the opening scene) but is also carefully drawn as essentially flawed and insecure, rather than a flat parody of evil. Donald Farfrae, who is as good as Henchard is bad, is also flawed in his own ways which adds depth to his character too. Hardy was obviously better at creating men than women because the women are a little more \\"Victorian stereotypical\\": the good ones are pictures of chaste virtue who can actually take ill and die over a nasty shock (puh-lease) and the bad ones are fat hags in bawdy houses. The women are certainly less interesting than the men in this book.The plot is nearly impossible to adequately discuss without writing a book of my own. After the initial unforgivable act, the book fast-forwards 19 years and we soon learn that the previously down-on-his-luck Henchard has made a success of himself in the rural town of Casterbridge, where he is a wealthy merchant and mayor of the town. At the same time that he takes on a quick and capable apprentice (Farfae), his wife and daughter reappear in his life. Farfrae proves to be better at Henchard's business than Henchard is, Henchard has to abandon another woman in favor of doing right by his wife and the daughter's paternity is quickly called into question. Intrigue, twists, turns and surprises ensue. And all the while, Henchard's selfishness, quick temper and poor-decision making contrive to bring about his eventual fall. It all makes for a very satisfying read... not as satisfying as say, reading about the Count of Monte Cristo dealing out his brand of justice... but it is interesting to see how things unravel for Henchard nonetheless.The Bottom Line: a very entertaining and complex story from the Victorian era. Worth a read whether you're plowing through the 1001 Books list or not.This review originally appeared on my blog. See my profile for details."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"\\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" captures a lot of what makes Thomas Hardy resonate with people today: hard existential truths playing out amid pastoral splendor; naturalistic descriptions of fantastic events; an agnostic worldview that centers around a sense of Christian guilt and loss. The countercurrents create a lot of creative tension.But what makes \\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" so powerful more than a century after its 1886 publication is its multifaceted, emotionally conflicted depiction of the central character. Like King Lear and Ibsen's Solness the Master Builder, Hardy's Michael Henchard has no one but himself to blame for most of the misery that befalls him. Still he compels sympathy and a growing sense of investment from the reader.We meet him, in one of the all-time great openings of noveldom, selling off his timid wife and child in a fit of rum-tinged pique. He regrets this almost immediately, but fails to relocate them. Instead, he swears off liquor and remakes himself years later as a prosperous leader in a town he chances upon in his travels, Casterbridge.Alas the dark spikes of his id are never far from the surface, especially after his wife and her daughter come to Casterbridge. \\"Though under a long reign of self-control he had become Mayor and churchwarden and whatnot, there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the rind of Michael Henchard as when he had sold his wife at Weydon Fair,\\" Hardy writes.Henchard is a portrait in grayscale, nothing too black or white. In one scene, Hardy shows him mercilessly humiliating a lazy farmhand, then tells us Henchard keeps the farmhand's mother stocked with coal in winter. When the wife returns, Henchard has a romance brewing but puts it aside to do right by the woman he wronged. He's definitely not happy about it, and prone to self-pity and lashing out, but Hardy's intuitive narration keeps you identifying with Henchard, never leading you too far from his point of view.For a character study the story moves fast, even if the prose style is ornate. Hardy's descriptive abilities are on constant display, with scenic rides through the country. There's much local Wessex color (Hardy's own quasi-mythical kingdom, where most of his novels are set) and a chorus of memorable townspeople, like a fellow whose theft of coins from the eyes of a corpse is excused thus: \\"Money is scarce, and throats get dry. Why should death rob life o' four pence?\\"Death is omnipresent in \\"Mayor Of Casterbridge\\", but Hardy justifies the novel's gloomy tone with a memorably powerful, courageously bleak conclusion. \\"Casterbridge's\\" greatness lies at its two ends. In between, the story keeps your interest but keeps hitting the same notes, with some sketchy melodrama and improbable coincidences amid brighter moments. Hardy even gets maudlin with a dead goldfinch metaphor.Most problematic of all is the absence of interest in the main characters beyond Henchard. Except for a jilted lover who forces her way back into Henchard's life with minxish self-possession, they are an entirely boring crew, existing only to be contrasted with Henchard's more forceful personality.\\"Casterbridge\\" may leave you wishing you chose something else to read in a lighter vein, say \\"The Painted Bird\\" or \\"The Bell Jar\\". But it's worth reading for that same emotional toll, a reminder of life's harder truths that may leave you sad but perhaps a bit more conscious of the truth behind the line: \\"There but for the Grace of God go I.\\""},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"In some ways this is a hard book to get into since it is set in a totally different culture from ours -rural England of the mid-nineteenth century. You would think that that is close enough in time to not be a problem. But to me the things like their courtship customs, or what is considered scandalous/honorable behavior, are really at a variance with the way we act today that I found it hard to relate to. Add to this some of the implausible melodrama and coincidences that make up the plot and I almost ended up putting down the book.However I kept reading and in the end I thought it was an excellent story. This is because it illustrated a truth about life that I could empathize with. How a man through pride, anger, stubbornness and alcoholism could end up destroying his relationships with all of the people he is close to and in middle age end up being alienated from everyone who was important to him in his life. Since this story was written there have been millions of guys like Michael Henchard. The details of their lives are different, their endings may have been different. But there is an underlying truth that is the same. That aspect of the story is timeless."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"this is the first book ive read out of thomas hardy's many works, and i thought it was absolutely brilliant. he uses his perceptive insight into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalites.each scene he describes is filled with vivid imagery that leave your senses tingling.i highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a well-written, easy-to-understand classic."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I have not read any of Hardy's books before - and chanced upon this one, and found no regrets.

When a man sells his wife and daughter to a sailor for five guineas, he becomes devastated. Finding a whole new life, he becomes the wealthy mayor of Casterbridge. Not ever thinking he would see his wife and daughter again, the inevitable happens. As the story goes from bad to good and good to worse, various characters explore the realms of fate.The work of Hardy allows his readers to have a better understanding of the world. Many people today are nave of the terrible things happening all around them. The exaggerated situations, such as a woman dieing because of embarrassment, allow readers to have a new perspective of life. A realization is created that everyone has two sides to them; good and bad. Whether it is a lie or the truth, people affect the lives of others.What if one secret could ruin the lives of many others? What if one secret could ruin the life of one? As lies and secrets lead to the downfall of many characters, life is taken advantage of and hearts are broken.

I'm a big fan of Dickens and Hardy and truly loved this magnificent piece of work."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"When one finishes \\"Casterbridge,\\" one is immediately struck by its place in the development of the novel. Hardy came after Dickens and before James, and his style intrigues as you connect parts of it to the former, parts to the latter.His plotting is sort of Dickens \\"lite.\\" There are mysterious benefactors, sudden tragic deaths, reversals of fortune, paternity mysteries, ect. His prose is cleaner and easier to read than both Dickens and James; \\"Casterbridge\\" scans better than \\"Bleak House\\" or \\"The Wings of the Dove.\\"The story begins when a pastoral laborer, in a drunken rage, sells his wife and child one evening (I hate it when that happens...). When he wakes the next morning, abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The novel truly begins eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, we witness the fall of the now Mayor of Casterbridge, brought about by his own character flaws and the interventions of fate.Henchard, the main character, is a facinating combination of hot-spirited volition and turn-on-a-dime repentance. He is quick to do things which damn him but just as quick to admit his guilt. He is a wonderful character and a precursor to the later \\"psychological\\" novels of James and Forster. The satellite characters remind one of Dickens, but they are not nearly as startling and interesting, but of course, a character such as Henchard never existed in all of Dickens.The novel proceeds to its forgone conclusion inexorably, albiet with a few melodromatic touches, yet it sustains its tone and readibility due mostly to Henchard, and the dramatic situations Hardy puts him through.Well worth a look."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Since I have decided to dedicate part of my time spent reading in 2003 to the classics, I started first with The Mayor of Casterbridge, not the most famous of Hardy's works but seemingly a good place to start. I will definitely read the other works by this author since I was so captivated by this book.The novel begins with the sale of Michael Henchard's wife and child to the highest bidder at a local summer fair. Henchard is drunk and his wife, tired of his habits, decides to leave with the sailor who bids on her and her daughter. Henchard wakes up the next morning, somewhat remorseful for what he has done and vows not to drink for twenty-one years.The very next chapter picks up the story nineteen years later, with the return of the wife and child into Henchard's life. Henchard is now quite wealthy and is such an important man in his community, he is now Mayor of Casterbridge. From here, a series of wrong decisions and misunderstandings lead to the devastating conclusion.Hardy is well known for his tendency towards gloomy endings and this book certainly fits the mold. But he is also well known for his lyrical descriptions of the English countryside and describing a way of life which had disappeared even in his own time. There were beautiful passages about the hay carts being driven through town, loaded so high that people on the second floor of homes could reach out and touch the top of the hay. Small details abound, describing the sound of rain on trees and the smell of the local foods. But perhaps the most significant aspect of the novel for me was the feeling that Henchard had wished for everything that had happened to him, and all of his wishes came true, and thus ultimately his downfall. These wishes were almost all made in a rash moment, when perhaps a minute or more of reflection could have produced a clearer head. Yet Henchard lives by his instincts, since for almost twenty years they seemed to serve him well.I would recommend this book to any serious literature lover and I believe it serves as a good introduction to his other works. His books serve as a bridge from Victorian literature to modern literature, with no happy endings guaranteed."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"At first I was forced to read &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; in school more than 12 years ago. Reading it slowly made an impact on my life. This book always served a special purpose in my life. It introduced me to the wide world of Literature. It sort of enlighten my interest and liking for English literature. Now re-reading it not only brought back fond memories of my yester school days but also renewed my liking to one of the greatest writer of all time Thomas Hardy.Through this novel I came to the understanding of Irony and oxymoron. Hardy totally wrote with a sense of awareness of human characteristic and he had a amazing style of mixed humour with tragedy.His protagonist,Michael Henchard's life was under the microscope of Hardy.I love the way the story began I quote:&quot;ONE evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex, on foot. &quot; I love the Englishness and the sense of intriguing events that would follow...In brief, Michael Henchard was a drunk who sold his wife and daughter at the fair. Later he realised his mistakes he work real hard and eventually became the mayor of Casterbridge. His life took another twist 20 years later when his wife and daughter came back to his life plus a few more other characters adding on the complexity of his life.Soonafter events unfolded and many things became to go against his way and then came his downfall. Indeed Michael Henchard's rise and fall were filled with compelling details and his encounters with numerous intestering people.What I love most about this novel was the way Hardy depicted Henchard's behaviours and thoughts and totally enhanced his weak character and irresponsibleness with dashes of ironies. His sardonic literary style were brilliant and at the same time he also vividly described the scenery and situations. Another greatest of Hardy was his ability to create innovative characters still account for in modern contemporary days and he was a pioneer in analysising human's weakness and blended it into his creation. It's a vintage classic,psychoanalytic and intriguingly written ,a must read for all books lover."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I'm re-reading this book that thrilled me years ago and thrills me today. Now, however, I realize just how &quot;modern&quot; it is, even more so than the works of Dickens, whom I also revere, but whose writing had a quaint quality that actually makes him the lesser artist, in my opinion. Hardy's writing is spare but nothing is left out. You feel it, you taste it, you live it. It has the firm, sure quality of a minimalist work of art, and yet the twists and turns of its plot are dizzying. I detect its influence on novelist Toni Morrison, I might add. I'd be willing to bet she's a Hardy scholar. I read many passages, many scenes, that reminded me of her &quot;folksy&quot; conceits. And I was amazed at Hardy's contemporary understanding of addiction, in this case alcoholism. In fact, Henchard is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot; He abstains from liquor for 21 years, but his character defects and lack of spiritual awareness catapault him right back into his disease when he begins drinking again. In fact, his life spirals out of control faster and faster with his first return to drink, showing that alcoholism, like all addictions, is a progressive disease. A reviewer here said the book was depressing, and that Hardy is dark. However, the &quot;light&quot; in Hardy comes with his wisdom, not unlike Faulkner's, of human nature. There are so many themes of the enduring truths that one is uplifted just by the reading. Sometimes I mourn for the writers I will never meet, the ones who have passed on. Their teaching is so important to my own spiritual and artistic growth, that I have experienced a great love from them and for them. Hardy is one of those for me. Wherever he dwells now, I send him my appreciation."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"When Thomas Hardy penned The Mayor of Casterbridge, he brought to life a very authentic character in Michael Henchard. He is possibly the perfect tragic character. The only other character I can think of to compare him to as I struggle to describe him and the story - for he is so much the story - is King Lear. But where Lear was a King who was foolish, Michael is the common man, a simple hay trusser, with several character flaws ... most notably shortsightedness and a desire to \\"be on top\\". He at no point feels something that most people don't but where we restrain our first rash and selfish actions (most of the time), he goes full out until he has cost himself everything and too late finds redemption. His flaw is insidious and all too common, so we relate easily even through his most outrageous misadventures.In a fit of drunken despondency, feeling that he is being pulled down by the responsibility of being a twenty-one year old husband and father, he jests that he would gladly part with his wife and daughter for the sum of five pounds. After having sworn this so vehemently for the entire evening, he has little recourse when someone takes him up on it and his wife, in shame and anger, agrees to go with the purchaser, taking their daughter with her. When sobriety brings full realization, it also brings a vow of temperance from Michael who in the following fifteen years builds himself up to a position respectability and public admiration in the nearby town of Casterbridge.Though he seems to have learned his lesson, we are only on chapter two and his story is just beginning as his wife and child return and his friendship with a trusted friend and critical advisor becomes a bitter rivalry. Time and again he demands allegiance when he need only ask it and return it in kind.Hardy's writing style is direct and straight-forward with no flourishes like you might find with Dickens or Twain. He has a story to tell and he tells it - no swashbuckling adventures like DeFoe or Dumas. However you feel about that, the character of Michael Henchard continues to skulk around in my head. He represents to me a very real possibility of personal failure and haunts my mind now just as Scrooge's deceased partner haunted him in A Christmas Carol. I would have given this book a fun factor of three stars when I first read it. Now I give it five stars because I have had the time to realize what a masterful job Hardy did when he created Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Having thoroughly detested Tess of the d'Urbervilles for its overload of melodrama and odious characters, I was hesitant to It often seems that to be considered a classic, a work must be both lengthy and tragic. Mayor is indeed a tragedy, but unlike start on another novel by Hardy. It was then a happy surprise to find that The Mayor of Casterbridge, though less famous than Tess, is an infinitely more enjoyable work.Tess, it succeeds in drawing sympathy from the reader. Thomas Hardy's irony is also much in evidence, and he comes across as quite witty. The result is a concise and interesting mixture of humor and tragedy in which characters are reasonably likable. Henchard is impetuous and comes to his end almost entirely through his own actions, but his actions are always motivated by realistic emotions and there is nothing overblown or melodramatic about his downfall. Because he is so human and flawed, it is far easier to feel sorry for him than it was for Tess, Hardy's embodiment of the perfect woman.There are, of course, elements in Hardy's style that do not change from novel to novel. His writing remains very Victorian and therefore rather ornate and longwinded. Nor is the melodrama absent from Mayor-- events often take on such an absurd turn that the reader is left momentarily with the impression of a soap opera. The plot relies heavily on coincidences, reminiscent somewhat of Dickens, and things work out so neatly and implausibly that incredulity must be firmly restrained.It is worth it, though. Beneath the superficial plot lie careful writing and hidden parallels. The elaborate Biblical Saul and David parallel with Henchard and Farfrae throughout emphasizes the unchangeability of human nature (the love/hate relationship between Henchard and Farfrae) and the cyclical rise and fall from power. Hardy also uses limited third person narration that allows the reader to know the characters and events only through their actions and conversations, further evidence of a meticulously constructed novel. In a refreshing change, Mayor moves along quickly with virtually no extraneous events.The Mayor of Casterbridge is an unusual book, and one that can be understood on multiple levels. On one, it is the simple story of the fall of a proud man; on another, it is a retold Biblical story, updated but not deprived of its original power. And though I never thought to say this about Hardy's novels, The Mayor of Casterbridge also does pretty well as entertainment...Ailanna"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The first book I read out of Thomas Hardy's many works was \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" back in my secondary school days. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. Reading \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" only confirmed that my liking for Hardy's works was not misplaced. The Mayor of Casterbridge is absolutely brilliant as the author uses his perceptive insights into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalities. For example, Henchard is an alcoholic who suffers from many of the accompanying afflictions that include low self-esteem, shame, guilt, self-castigation, self-punishment, loneliness, a death wish, and a tendency to depression.The book starts in the first chapter with a dramatic masterpiece that perfectly sets the tone and theme for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work. They go to a country fair where Henchard, an alcoholic, gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Once Henchard sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family. Abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The story unravels nineteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, Henchard who was now the Mayor of Casterbridge falls from grace, this being a result of his own character flaws and the hand of fate.I enjoy reading Hardy's impressive prose, which is strong, sharp and descriptive. The various scenes the author describes are filled with vivid and compelling imagery that leave one wanting to read more and more. Thomas Hardy is especially adept at describing the environment which he has a deep seated love for. The ironic twists of fate provide a setting that demonstrates the brilliant writer that Hardy is where he expertly weaves a plot that shows the themes of the balance between fate and individual choice. That makes The Mayor of Casterbridge very pleasant to read despite the sad story.For those who wish to study English Literature, The Mayor of Casterbridge is on the top of the recommended list. The book provides exceptional descriptions of England and its culture as well as exposing the student to themes of profound gravity and importance. The book provides clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy. It is well-written, is easy-to-understand and to follow."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Having never read Hardy before, I picked this book at random off a list provided by my Western Civilization teacher. I can't help but attribute my choice to destiny; this is quite possibly the best book I've ever read, written by the single greatest English author in history. While some other reviewers have classified his descriptive passages as somewhat dull, I thought they were rather intoxicating; I don't know how one could not enjoy the superbly vivid style Hardy employs. It's impossible to really describe his writing to one who hasn't read it.The plot in Mayor of Casterbridge is compelling throughout. I read somewhere that the book was originally published a few chapters at a time in a literary magazine, and this is quite evident, as every many sections seem individually complete with rising action, climax, resolution, etc. Hardy still manages to integrate these individual sections without flaw and create a wonderful composition of the life of Henchard. As everyone else has testified, the conclusion of the book is moving beyond description- without a doubt the most affective book I've ever read. Be forewarned: this is a book that will surely leave the reader in a depressed and brooding state. Going by Kafka's standard, that a book should be &quot;like a suicide... an axe for the frozen sea within us&quot;, The Mayor of Casterbridge is surely one of just a handful of the great books in English literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I can understand the polarity of opinion about this book. And you certainly don't want to be reading Thomas Hardy while listening to Leonard Cohen. Don't dismiss the negative comments out of hand - Hardy is probably not for all tastes.In my case though, as a student disinterested in reading, this novel turned me into a reader. It has a \\"heavy\\" style, but I think it was this depth that appealed to me most - that, and the obvious devotion Hardy felt toward his beloved Wessex (strange how this passion of the author for his countryside seems to me more forcefully written than most other stories where passion is thematic). Of course I have since read all the Wessex novels but this remains my favorite, and probably my favorite novel of all.Still, not an easy recommendation."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"a riveting read from the first shocking chapter. an amazing kindle read. thomas hardy has a profound grasp of human nature and sugarcoats nothing. this is a great novel."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Set in fictitious Casterbridge (Hardy's beloved Dorchester), the story evolves from the web of deceit spun by pride and drink--with serious consequences 20 years later. Traveling by foot with his stoic wife and baby girl, hay-trusser Michael Henchard arrives in Weydon-Priors during its annual fair. Having drunk too much laced furmity he makes an astounding offer to those gathered in the tent: he will auction off the unvalued females to the highest bidder! Fate protects poor Susan and Elizabeth Jane as the only bidder proves a decent sailor named Newsome. The simple-minded woman does not realize that such a contract is not binding, but remains with him--even emigrating to Canada for 18 years--until his reported death at sea.Somewhat sobered the next day Henchard feels deep remorse--to the extent that he enters an empty church and swears abstinence for 21 years in penance. Arriving in the major city of Casterbridge-site of ancient Roman ruins and some lugubrious customs-he works his way up in Society until he becomes a respected grain merchant and eventually the mayor. Though unwed he had a dalliance on the island of Jersey with a local girl named Lucetta, who nursed him through an illness--thus compromising her own reputation.The wheels of fate are grinding away when Susan and Elizabeth Jane-who may not be his daughter after all-arrive in Casterbridge. The latter has been raised in ignorance of the auction and Henchard's role in her life, but her mother is nervous, desiring to appeal to him quietly before deciding her next course of action and residence. On the eve of a big feast in town another newcomer arrives: a young Scotsman named Donald Farfrae, en route to Canada himself. Taking an immediate liking to the smart young fellow, Henchard convinces him to stay on and serve as his manager. Thus Hardy sets in motion the literary mechanism of a complicated plot: two men courting one woman; two women who are attracted to one man and eventually two men claiming to be Elizabeth Jane's father.There is a sense of fatalism in many of Hardy's novels; his characters strive against their destiny (the result of poor choices, as well as untoward coincidences) but they seem compelled to play out their dismal roles. Tragedy perhaps, pathos definitely. Hardy highlights the often unfair role of women in his society, set against a backdrop of snobbery, poverty, a strict class system and an undercurrent of superstition. A bit grim but satisfying for devotees of 19th century British literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, Thomas Hardy's great novel published in 1886, is a classic of English Literature. The main character, Michael Henchard gets drunk at a fair and sells his wife and child to a sailor.

If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"One of Hardy's best novels. The characterisation are excellent and the descriptive writing is superb. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" seems to be a moral allegory. In a moment of drunken callousness, young Michael Henchard sells his wife and daughter to a genial sailor. When he awakes from his drunken stupor Henchard sinks deep in regret, and swears not to touch the bottle again for two decades. He searches for his family, and unable to locate them he stumbles into the town of Casterbridge where he develops a successful farming business, becomes mayor and the pillar of the community. Eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter find him the single and temperate Mayor of Casterbridge makes haste in reclaiming his lost family, and it seems it's all well that ends well.At the same time a young dashing Scotsman Donald Farfrae enters Henchard's life, and the Mayor is determined to make Donald his acolyte. It seems that the two have much in common, but Donald proves he is in fact the Mayor's polar opposite. Whereas Michael can be both generous (he pleas with Donald to remain in Casterbridge to work for him) and stingy (he fires Donald after dancing with his daughter Elizabeth-Jane), loving and brutal, brooding and quick to anger, Donald is the model of the proper Christian businessman and husband. Donald understands, forgives, tolerates, and endures all of Michael's impetuous insults and attacks, and he is finally rewarded with Michael's lover, daughter, business, and mayorship.But ultimately Michael Henchard is the protagonist of the novel, and while he is certainly petty, provincial, and proud his fall is both epic and poignant. Michael had eighteen years of quiet prosperity in Casterbridge, but the novel makes no mention of it at all, and Michael must endure one tragedy after another. It seems that Michael's undoing is that he thinks and feels too much. He is quick to anger and proud of mind because he is first to love and steadfast in his loyalty; in comparison, Donald Farfrae seems cold and calculating, slowly and methodically building his reputation at the cost of Michael's. Yes, Michael did fire Donald, but Michael had urgently pleaded with Donald to stay in Casterbridge and given him experience, connections, and a reputation: if Donald had truly been good and loyal he would have left instead of staying to compete with Michael. And then there's Lucetta who was engaged to Michael but eloped with Donald: this one act proved the irreversible destruction of Michael's fortune.If this is a moral allegory, and ostensibly it is nothing but a moral allegory it is not certain what is being said. Should we really aim to be like Donald Farfrae who is cold in his generosity and calculating in his fair-mindedness? And yes there really isn't much to be said for Michael Henchard's pride and anger, but there was also something concretely good and stubbornly noble about the man. He was also capable of reflection, and in the end he sought to do what was good, even if it meant disappearing forever. Look under Donald Farfrae's smooth handsomeness, and you'll discover guile and duplicity. Look under Michael Herndon's rugged vehemence, and you'll discover love and goodness. Michael Herndon has wronged so he seeks to do right. But having never done wrong does Donald Farfrae know the difference between right and wrong?\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" marks a revolution in rural England, as the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution finally begin to set in. Calculating reason and Christian piety seek to overturn the rural tempers and superstitions that have dominated the England countryside for so long, and so Donald Farfrae must inevitably triumph over Michael Herndon. Yes, with Michael Herndon's departure, the world has become a calmer, more reasonable, more enlightened place. But \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" leaves us with a hanging question: are we better for it?"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"This was an ok novel.

Never have i read such a wonderful piece of literature. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The notes on the back of my copy of this book describe it as a &quot;Sophoclean&quot; tragedy. This is a very apt description. Like the plays of Sophocles, Hardy's novel proceeds directly from one mistake and misunderstanding to the next with very little padding in between. As a result, the plot can seem unlikely (as several below have commented). It's sad, however, if people reject it for that reason.This novel contains one of the more fascinating characters in literature. Michael Henchard is a man of the &quot;old school&quot; who conducts business on a hand shake and who constantly acts and reacts to the visible world. Despite this, he is often aware of his mistakes after the fact, yet is unable to use this knowledge to avoid future pitfalls.He's contrasted brilliantly with Donald Farfrae, who is a &quot;new man&quot; who trusts in the future. Ironically (and I suspect intentionally) Hardy make Farfrae seem a far shallower man than Henchard. Yet, the &quot;new man&quot; ends up on top.The end of this novel is one of the bitterest in all of literature. Henchard's will being an almost total negation of his existance. What could be more tragic than that for a flawed, but essentially good man?"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I loved the irony. I mean, how much worse could life get for the Mayor?

Now I've grown up a bit I recognize the superb perception he had. This one is no exception."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge is a story about Michael Henchard attempts at redemption and the many sorrows, pain, and misery that comes with his decision to uphold his pride and name. To say that Henchard is the only character that suffers in this novel would be a misrepresentation; almost every character at some point suffers immensely in some trial of life, whether it is death of someone close, pain of separation, or the frustration of a relationship. For these reasons, this work is not a \\"light\\" read by any stretch of the imagination, and will probably test even the optimist's patience in getting through. Still, Hardy's story, the descriptions of the countryside and the characters' inner feelings, as well as the way he ties together every character in this book, is a remarkable feat and makes for a powerful read.The story begins with Michael Henchard walking with his wife, Susan, to the fair as they cross the countryside. While there, in an act of drunkenness, Henchard sells his wife to a sailor, and seemingly sets in motion his irreversible bad fortune. Not being able to find his wife the next day, he makes an oath to not drink alcohol for 21 years, the exact amount of years he has lived. The novel then fast forwards 19 years to find Henchard the Mayor of Casterbridge, and a noteworthy man of respect. Susan finds him, marries him after forgiving him, but there are many secrets that both parties have and will have until the end of the novel. It seems that many of these secrets are the character's downfalls. Henchard, while Mayor of Casterbridge, meets a man named Donald Farfrae, who he comes to like and implores to stay in town; however, eventually he and Farfrae become bitter rivals in not only their business and society, but also in their relationship with Lucetta, a woman who had an affair with Henchard in the past.Henchard's fallacy of character lay in his stubborn pride and his foolish belief that name and appearance is everything. He sometimes tries to create a faade, or cover up one sin with another secret or problem. When he tries to persuade Lucetta to marry him, so as to not destroy her name, he retorts: \\"But it is not by what is, in this life, but by what appears, that you are judged.\\" He is a tragic individual who seems to not be able to change his views long enough to make something right occur; when something does go well, it is short lived. He even gets to a point where he connects himself with an ominous and unpreventable fate, at one point referring to himself as Cain. He never really heeds Elizabeth's attempts at love until very late in the novel when tragic occurrences seem to be set in motion.Still, despite all his problems, and all his pride, he is a \\"likeable\\" character because he makes the effort at retribution and is sorrowful each time he gets hit with a dilemma or makes an unfavorable decision. He has the willingness and conscience to try to amend his deficiencies, but, in the end, he just makes too many mistakes, and has too much pride to reverse his fortunes."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity. This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"An early fall afternoon in the 1840s bucolic world of Wessex. Michael Henchard, a young hay trusser, sells his wife Susan to another man for the paltry sum of five guineas. The 400 page classic by Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) goes on to chronicle the rise and fall of Henchard. The main characters are:1. Michael Henchard-The tragic Mayor of Casterbridge who loses all he values in life and all those people he loves to his rival. Henchard is a visible proof of the fact that fiction displays \\"the human heart in conflict with itself.' He is a Faustian striver who is ambitious in business as a corn chandler; politics as he becomes mayor and love losing the three women who have meant most to him. Henchard dies in an obscure hut near Egdon Heath desiring to be completely forgotten by the world. He has a death wish and wishes to achieve the oblivion of death in a universe controlled by fate, chance and irony. He is one of Hardy's great creations.2. Sue Henchard is the wife sold by Henchard to a sailor. She emigrates with him to America. When she returns 20 years later to Casterbridge she remarries Henchard but dies soon after the wedding. She is a simple-minded country woman lacking in knowledge and sophistication.3. Donald Farfrae-While Henchard represents ancient Wessex in folkways and beliefs, Mr. Farfrae is a young Scotchman who soon steals Henchard's supremacy in Casterbridge. He is hired by Henchard to straighten out the latter's business affairs but leaves him to start a successful rival business firm. Farfrae is the second Mayor of Casterbridge in this novel. He marries Henchard's mistress Lucetta. When Lucetta dies after being the center of a scandal caused by old loves letters to Henchard being revealed, Farfrae weds Henchard's stepdaughter Elizabeth Jane. He is a kind man who seeks to help Henchard to no avail.4. Eliaabeth-Jane-She is an intelligent person who returns from abroad with her mother Sue. She has been raised to believe that Michael Henchard is her father. Elizabeth-Jane becomes a hired companion to Henchard's quondom mistress Lucetta. Elizabeth Jane later weds Farfrae. This young lady learns her real father is the sailor Newson and Sue.5. Seaman Newson-The real father of Sue who returns to find her twenty years after the deal of exchange he made to purchase Sue as his wife from Michael Henchard.6. Lucette-The Jersey miss who had an affair long ago with Michael Henchard. Lucette is sexy and exotic. She weds Donald Farfrae dying after details of her affair with Henchard lead to scandal.The characters in this ironical novel are all puppets in an uncaring universe.The last word in the novel is \\"pain\\"! There is plenty of pain to share among all the characters.As with all of Hardy's classic novels, the descriptions of the town folks and the flora and fauna of Wessex are beautifully written. Hardy is the best regional novelist in all of English literature.The Penguin Edition of the novel contains excellent illustrations by Robert Barnes which were included in the original edition. A helpful chronology of Hardy's life; discussion of the textual history of the novel and a useful introduction by Dr. Keith Hardy are included. The novel is one you should read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"My second reading of a Thomas Hardy novel was every bit enjoyable as the first, if not more. Having a very limited background with this gifted author, it has taken years to appreciate his talents.The Mayor of Casterbridge starts with a very dubious event...concerning a drunken 'sale' of two persons by one Michael Henchard...bidding them a not-so-fond farewell; once Michael sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family.Flash forward 19 years, when a weary woman and her now-grown daughter appear near Casterbridge, searching for the woman's first husband, who has now become the mayor, and succeeded in keeping his 21 year pledge to abstain from drink following his grievous error years before.Susan Henchard, now the widow of a missing sailor, comes looking for Michael, and is surprised at what she finds. A sober, well-to-do, respected member of the community, and a leader. A far cry from the man who bartered her away years before. Also new in town is Donald Farfrae, who, once apprenticed to hay and corn merchant Michael, becomes more than Michael bargained for.To tell any more of the plot would be to deprive a reader of numerous twists and turns that occur along the way to the conclusion of this wonderful novel. Perhaps its due to a limited amount of experience with Hardy, but I found several jaw-dropping revelations along the way, and more twists than a television reality series.The story is never dull, nor is it mired in too much unnecessary detail or character introduction. Each of the 'dramatis personae' are well-realized, as is the notion that the past can always change the course of the future.For newcomers to Hardy's works, indulge in this page-turner, which is fraught with enjoyment. As this is a less 'dreary' tale than Jude the Obscure, I would recommend it as an introduction to Hardy's style...and a chance to meet a masterful storyteller."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge has so many plot twists and turns that it would not be an exaggeration to label this book as a \\"plot spiral.\\" With practically every new section, Hardy invents a new way to reveal some surprising (and sometimes not so surprising) twist to the plot line. Hardy creates a complex story about love, lust, relationships, economical hardship, family, shifts in power, and more in a beautiful and picturesque way. He concentrates so much on detail that it seems as if you are watching the events first hand. His style presents information as if you were reading it in the form of a play. He nearly always sets up the scene before beginning the action, which makes it so much easier to delve deeply into the action of the characters.Hardy also creates enormously dynamic characters that are subject to so many changes throughout the novel that they become like real people. The author's grip on human emotions makes his characters believable and easily loved and then hated. The fluctuating emotions of the main character, Michael Henchard, as he falls subject to disappointment in every avenue of his life is a true example of Hardy's gift for characterization.The contrast of the out-dated and underdeveloped town of Casterbridge vs. the complexity of the relationships that develop within it is brilliant and makes the reactions of the common townspeople to these relationships even more significant to the development of the setting and also the relationships themselves. Though not portrayed obviously in the book, the town of Casterbridge itself plays a very large role in the story. As Hardy thrusts outsiders from other cultures into this archaic town, things suddenly become very complicated and even more so when the newcomers begin to meet and mix together. The Scotchman, Farfrae, and Lucetta, the Jersey girl, as well as some others, react in such a way to the old ways of this society as to disrupt the harmony of this simple community, making this novel an avenue for Hardy to demonstrate his gift for rich dialogue and language, as created in direct relation to the character&#65533;s point of origin.Hardy has created a book about rises and downfalls of a small group of people and presents a very fitting theme about the events of ones life and how they affect everyone around them in death. I must say that I enjoyed this novel for its substance and complexity, as well as the timelessness of the general plot outline."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the &quot;evils&quot; of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, focused and simple the premise has been in itself, affords a quite convoluted plot that packs with events as the memorably niched characters play out their lives and unravels the novel. The book is riddled with a well-faceted theme of conscience: the purging of conscience and its reconciliation through an allusion to deceit and characters' shameless past that ceaselessly haunt them and render them despondent and guilty. The tragic actions revolve around one man who manages to establish prestige, wealth, and authority over Casterbridge and ironically the very elite status leads to the fall of the deeply flawed man.In a fit of drunken anger and delirium, young Michael Henchard sells his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor for 5 guineas at a county fair. Over the course of the years, though he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the town from literally nothing, Henchard still affords a ray of hope in reuniting with his family, until he meets Lucetta Templeman who nurses him in America. Such black spot of his youth as wife-sale caused by his fits of spleen not only renders him ashamed of himself but also wears an aspect of recent crime: something that will shame him until his dying day. Behind his success is always lurking such shameful secret of his troubled past shielded from the public and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper.Contributing to the suspenseful nature of the novel is the return of the mayor's wife and daughter some 18 years later whom Michael Henchard believed to have perished at the sea. The sentimental reunion, which marks Henchard respectable 20-year abstinence from alcohol, brings about a heartrending revelation and an ironical sequence of events that irritate Henchard. The very truth cruelly leaves in him an emotional void that he unconsciously craves to fill. At the same time, the regard he has acquired for Elizabeth-Jane has eclipsed by this revelation. The new-sprung hope of his loneliness (or \\"friendless solitude\\" in Hardy's own words) that she will be to him a daughter of whom he can feel as proud as of the actual daughter she believes herself to be, has been stimulated by the (yet another) unexpected arrival of the sailor to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her.All these ineluctable consequences of his past shameful transaction at the fair take a stupendous toll on Henchard and his conscience. He is also uneasy at the thought of Elizabeth-Jane's passion for Donald Farfrae, whose rising prestige and success in his independent business provoke in Henchard enmity and envy. Henchard quails at the thought that Farfrae shall utterly usurp her mild filial sympathy with him, that she might be withdrawn from him by degrees through Farfrae's influence and learns to despise him. The pricking of conscience subtly manifests in Henchard's solicitous love and growing jealousy. His fear of losing tie after the death of his wife is sympathetically understandable. Though he in his effrontery has been weaning Elizabeth-Jane from the sailor by saying he is her father, she understands that Henchard has himself been deceived in her identity.Lucetta Templeman, inescapably torn between her past disgraceful entanglement with Henchard and her love for a more refined gentleman, is also pricked by her conscience. In an impulsive moment, purely out of gratitude, Henchard proposes to the Jersey woman who has been so far compromised to him. But as the years gone by, Lucetta is more convinced that she has been forced into an equivocal position with Henchard by an accident. She has discovered some quantities in Henchard, who is either well-educated nor refined in manner, that irretrievably renders him less desirable as a husband than she has at first thought him to be, notwithstanding there remains a conscientious wish to being about her union with him.When Lucetta learns of the wife-sale, she immediately dismisses any possibility of being with him and realizes she cannot risk himself in his hands. It will have been letting herself down to take Henchard's name after such an ignominious scandal. But her past which she diligently seals, if not expunge altogether haunts her. The surreptitious history with Henchard becomes the torture of her meek conscience and the reconciling of which through a marriage with a second man remains also her secret alone.Subtitled \\"A Story of a Man of Character\\", Henchard's origins remain unexplained but he literally begins and ends the novel away from Casterbridge, where he achieves his prominent status ironically destines his downfall, through the lampooning and skimmity-ride. A psychological study, the novel accentuates the fury that causes him to lash out against both himself and those who stand closest to him. It depicts to the fullest the very self-destructive nature of the power that causes Henchard's fall, which is so obvious through his louring invidiousness.2004 (46) MY"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit. Suggest you try another kindle version."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"This 1964 Heritage Club Edition is a treasure! The hardcover is appropriately decorated with motiffs of Casterbridge. The wood engravings by Agnes Miller Parker are wonderful and unique! Of course, the story reads like a tragedy - Henchard is certainly his own worst enemy. On the other hand, Thomas Hardy's prose is certainly wonderful reading, unlike many 20th century so-called literary authors. Hardy's descriptive analyses of places and characters are exquisite, including the historical aspect of the English countryside near Casterbridge. The secondary characters are varied, some solid and some weak in spirit. Henchard seems to use them all to his detriment and the detriment of others. Elizabeth-Jane and Farfrae give the story balance and in the end are winners despite Henchard's downward spiral.This review is not in any way a descriptive review of the book's story line. However, there are hopes that your interest has been peeked and that you will give this book a complete reading. Also, there are DVD's of this story which can be accessed on Amazon. This writer watched a DVD initially and then read the book. After doing so I believe that reading the book first would be a better choice."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I read this book for my English exam and after reading it, I cannot understand how it can be described as a classic novel. The only possible reason that I can come up with is that people in 19th century England, did not have things like T.V. and so were absolutely desperate for anything to entertain themselves. This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere. I wish that I had not wasted some of my life reading this book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I have recently read this book (not out of choice) and I am at a loss to understand why Hardy wrote this and why anyone would willingly read this for &quot;fun&quot;. I agree wholeheartedly with the author of &quot;Classically Boring&quot; as this book is complete excrement. People are always going on about how we should stop cutting down the rainforest etc. and if this is what all those trees are turned into, then I'm with them 100%."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I had never been so against reading a book in my life. Everything about it seemed boring; the cover, the title, and even the way the pages smelled. It was only the fact that Henchard sells his wife and baby in an auction; that kept my interest alive.Even with a premise as weird as this one, the book's beginning was painful. It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared. The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge. This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book. After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble, \\"Sure...\\"Some people deem this book, \\"Depressing,\\" however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling. This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.I wouldn't recommend this book as a \\"free-read;\\" But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books, and this one happens to be on the list, then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first, but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be, that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair?"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Hardy was a naturalist in whose novels everything goes wrong. Michael Henchard is a drunk who \\"sells\\" his wife Susan and infant daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor. Susan doesn't realize the sale is bogus because she is \\"simple,\\" throws her ring away, and leaves with the sailor. When he sobers up next day, Henchard searches all over for his lost family, and finally enters a church and swears an oath over an enormous bible that he will not drink from his current age of 21 to double that age. Meanwhile, and 18 years later, when the sailor dies, Susan, with Elizabeth, comes looking for Henchard at Casterbridge. He is now a corn merchant and mayor of the town. As a teetotaler, he is described as drinking glass after glass of water at table for a town hearing. Eventually Susan, via Elizabeth-Jane, contacts Henchard and he pens a note suggesting that they meet at the \\"Ring.\\" This last turns out to be a ruined Roman amphitheater or coliseum, a 1500-year-old relic full of ghosts and whose very name symbolizes the dark past. Henchard and Susan agree to remarry, playacting a courtship for public appearances, and to keep the daughter in ignorance that the sailor was not her biological father. After they marry, Henchard and the manager of his business, Farfrae, have a falling out because the latter shows the former up and makes a fool of him, making himself more popular than the mayor. To make matters worse, Elizabeth-Jane falls in love with Farfrae.Frankly, that's as far as I've gotten. I know how it ends for Henchard, but I won't spoil the ending. Hardy is a mean naturalist writer, and has no sympathy for his characters whatsoever. _Casterbridge_ was first published in 1886, when alcoholism was little understood - least of all by people like Hardy who didn't have the disease. It's all too easy for this author to condemn and be judgmental of alcoholic people. I would suggest for an alternative reading Eugene O'Neill's _The Iceman Cometh_, since O'Neill was himself an alcoholic and could rightfully speak for alcoholics. The subject, no matter in whose hands, is by nature depressing. All my editorializing aside, Thomas Hardy is a great novelist who has earned his place in the canon. His poetry is good, too. _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ is worth pursuing to the end if you're not an alcoholic."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"This book was originally written to be printed in newspapers, newspapers were then used to wipe one's posterior. I feel i have already said enough."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Good story for a movie. In fact there was a movie set in the west during gold rush based on this story. Good, but I forget the movie title. Both are very believable, which I like."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Modern novels can be so pretentious, with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever. You learn nothing in the end, except life is cruel and if something can go wrong, it will. Read something else."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a \\"classic\\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \\"Blas&eacute;\\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull. I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way. Hardy describes Henchard as 'dogged' and i feel if you want to read this you too will have to be dogged and determind to start and finish this book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Michael Henchard, a 21-year-old itinerant farmhand, enters a refreshment tent with his wife and baby girl at a country fair.

This shocking event is our introduction to Michael Henchard's tempestuous character.Once sober, Henchard searches high and low for his wife and child, but with no success. He makes a vow in church to abstain from alcohol for the next 21 years, and he keeps that vow.We encounter Henchard two decades later, now a prosperous corn and wheat merchant and the Mayor of Casterbridge.Character is fate. Henchard's nature, violent and remorseful, jealous and generous by turns, will give him no rest in this life. We can't help pitying the man, deeply flawed though he is.The Mayor of Casterbridge is a classic of English literature. It's also a totally gripping story, abounding in reversals, romances and local color. Don't start reading it on a night that you hope to get to bed early!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"In Michael Henchard, Thomas Hardy created a tragic figure of Shakespearean dimension. The opening scene of a drunken Henchard selling off his wife and infant child at a country fair immediately establishes him as a rash and impetuous character. These qualities will return to haunt him and those nearest to him again and again as his fortune rises and falls.Henchard is contrasted with the genial and almost too innocent Scotsman Donald Farfrae who starts as his friend but becomes his rival in almost all things. Farfrae has an easy charm about him that makes him an unwitting competitor that stirs additional dark forces in Henchard as his rashness mixes with a growing envy.The Mayor Of Casterbridge is one of Hardy's great works alongside Tess and Jude The Obscure. Hardy's vision is dark and the relentless sadness in his work may put off some but in the end these characters he created are as strong as tragic figures as those of any writer in the English language.Finally Hardy's descriptions of rural England and the people who inhabit including their dialects of the time are priceless."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff. The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end. The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Hardy mixes the comical here with the sorrowful so you're at once, entertained and saddened by the events; the largest event which brings on the sale of one man's wife and child to another; a moment which both liberates and destroys the main character through-out the story. Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"This story STILL haunts me since first reading it in college, 20 years ago.

Everything he has built threatens to unravel when his dying wife shows up, almost-grown daughter in tow, seeking a guardian for her child.

This book turned me into a Hardy fan."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"What a story! What a tragedy! The Mayor of Casterbridge faces secrets told and untold, misunderstandings, betrayals, loves won and lost... a bona fide soap opera set in a faraway time! Yes, some of the coincidences are a little too convenient, but they kept me reading into the wee hours of the morning! And in the end I cried. This book's characters help us to consider the effects on others of the way we live our own lives.

The plot is a tad too complex and soap-opera-ish for its own good, but the twists and turns are interesting enough to keep people interested, and it really isn't a tough read.

Not just because it's filled with themes of major gravity or features extraordinary descriptions of England and its culture, but simply because it's a damn good read. One reads it at a breakneck pace, occasionally stopping only when plot twists have one's jaw dropping on the floor. This is one of the most truly amazing books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is a superbly crafted tale of youthful folly and the futility of repentance. Set in the early Victorian Wessex beloved of Hardy, the time and place still speak to audiences more than a century after the novel was written.The title character commits one huge act of drunken folly in his youth, to his eternal regret. He seeks to put it behind him and become a pillar of his community. But the consequences of his deed come back to haunt him and one by one he is stripped of all that he holds sacred and dear.The prose is so vivid and the tragedy of the ending so great that it is like being pierced with hot and cold daggers again and again as one reads the last fifty pages or so.Vivid characterization, realistic deeds, thought, and dialogue, and graphically depicted settings all combine to make this one of the finest novels in the English language.Even if you are not a Hardy fan, this novel is a must-read!

This trivialises it, for it is, to my mind, truly tragic. In a shockingly irresponsible drunken act, protagonist Michael Henchard sells his wife at a local fair. The consequences, stretching over a couple of decades, sweep away both him and other characters.The plot teems with journeys, coincidences, long-lost people showing up, and a strong vein of morality. In typical Hardyesque style, Henchard moves from the height of civic success to bankruptcy and alienation. A quasi-Greek-tragedy air of fate prevails, but Hardy manages to keep suspense alive. Protagonist and antagonist (Farfrae) are pitted against each other on civic and domestic fronts. There is not one Mayor of Casterbridge, but two, and success, failure and rivalry play a large part. There is also competition among the males as lovers, husbands and fathers.This novel gives an insight into civic life, the worthy burgesses of Casterbridge networking in their council-rooms and taverns. But the animal instincts of the wife-sale, the gutter-press viciousness of the locals' \\"skimmity-ride\\", and the proximity of the countryside, where so many Victorian characters wander to survive and to lay bare their feelings, reveal the fragility of civilisation and our urban constructs.Great stuff."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I read this novel in English class, like most people probably did. It was one of the best assigned to us.Hardy is a gifted author. He writes in a clear style with vivid descriptions that really bring the setting alive, without making the reader (at least this reader) feel inundated with borning, unnecessary detail.The thing that I look for most in a novel, however, is quality characterizeations, and this book had them in spades. Dialogue was used effectively to flesh out characters. These are not stock characters, either. These people have flaws and shades of grey. They seem as though they could be real. I found that I could relate to the characters, and I did empathize with them, even when I didn't agree with their choices. Everyone had clear motivations. The characterization of Henchard shows that Hardy clearly understood the notion of the tragic flaw and the tragic hero/anti hero.Students who have to read this book as part of their English class may find it a bit on the long side. I would urge you to stick with it; once you get through the initial chapters the book will pick up (a commonality that all British classics seem to share). The book is easy to follow and understand. It is a key novel that marks the shift from Romantic Age to the Victorian Age, so it's an important read for anyone who has a serious interest in English Literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for.As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones, lacking even Hardy's Preface, though it has a bibliography. The dedicated will want something more extensive, but the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Michael Henchard, a down-on-his-luck, unemployed hay trusser, succumbs to the siren call of alcohol at a country fair. Subconsciously feeling his wife, Susan, is holding him back from success in this world, he awakes to sobriety the next morning and realizes that, in a foolish fit of pique, he has auctioned her and his daughter, Elizabeth-Jane, off to a sailor. Despite his frantic efforts to find them, they have disappeared. Ravaged with guilt over his selfish, impulsive act, he swears he will not take another drink for twenty-one years.Whether his wife was indeed one of Henchard's problems is left for the reader to ponder as Henchard moves to Casterbridge, prospers wildly in business and eventually becomes the town's leading citizen and mayor. Henchard's wheel of fortune, however, begins to spin on a wobbly axle as Donald Farfrae, an enterprising young Scot travelling to seek his fortune, enters his employ as the manager of his business. At the same time, Susan and Elizabeth-Jane, re-enter Henchard's life believing that Michael Newson, the sailor who had purchased them some nineteen years earlier, has perished at sea. Henchard's life truly begins to come apart when Lucetta Templeman, a former lover, also moves to Casterbridge and, ashamed of her past romantic entanglement with Henchard, seeks to hold him to his promise of marriage!Hardy raises many issues but, not expressing his own opinion through an unequivocal direction in the story's plot line, seems content to leave these issues as topics for sober analysis by his readers. Hardy questions the conflict between the merits of tradition vs modernization. There is the enormous irony that Henchard's success as a business person seems clearly attributable in part to his tee-totalling vow but is founded upon the five guineas seed capital raised through the auction of his wife and daughter! Henchard seems to epitomize the constant personal conflicts we all face between decisiveness and strength of character as opposed to impulsiveness and stubborn bullheaded intransigence! One wonders whether Lucetta is flighty, coquettish, thoughtless and selfish or is she an early manifestation of modern woman sadly out of time and years ahead of the ladies around her? Is Farfrae to be admired or scorned for his meteoric rise to power in Casterbridge and his complete devastation of Henchard's place among his peers?Perhaps the most powerful moment of the entire novel comes with the discovery of Henchard's will and his words directing that the world leave him to rest in forgotten isolation and that no person mark or mourn his passing in any fashion. Once again, we are left to decide for ourselves whether Henchard's life should be pitied, forgiven, admired or looked upon with scorn and disgust.To the readers of the day, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" would have been perceived as a darkly pessimistic tragedy that might have evoked emotions akin to those raised by Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" or Sophocles' \\"Oedipus Rex\\". A classic worthy of the term, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\", certainly never cheerful or uplifting, is however many, many things - compelling, moving, disturbing, thought-provoking and poignant. Above all, it is worthy of being read and enjoyed by any lover of classic 19th century British Literature.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"This book has everything fans of the 19th century novel, such as myself, love-melodrama, romance, secrets, plot twists, mistaken identities, rising fortunes, and, of course, a tragic ending. I can't give much away because the novel rests on a series of shocking revelations-each more shocking than the last!However, since the book begins with the most startling event of all, and since it is given away on the back of the book, and happens at the very beginning, I will only deal with that event, which is what drew me to the book in the first place. This will set the stage and make you want to read the book as much as I did when my friend told me about it!The main character is a certain Henchard who SELLS HIS WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER. That's right, he sells them! To a sailor! Granted, he is drunk. It's an intriguing study of alcoholism, although some men wouldn't have to be one to want to sell their wives for some beer if they could get away with it. Henchard's wife is understandably furious, and leaves with the sailor. After this, Henchard vows to never again drink-although the introduction to my edition suggests that he remains a \\"dry drunk\\". I don't exactly know what that that entails, but the introduction assured me that it was one of the first books on alcoholism which is important enough.Henchard then redeems himself and in Jean Valjean fashion would like to both atone for, and hide, his shameful past. He tries to find his wife and daughter, and that's where all the fascinating plot twists come in. It's very well-written and kept my attention throughout. I have also read \\"Tess\\" by Hardy and I like his writing style. I cannot say that his works moved me in any profound way as other literature has, but I'm not sure why that's important. There's a lot of humor and farce in this book which is first-rate, and I just enjoyed his protagonist-it's not easy to create one so believable and yet so interesting at the same time.Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life? I'm sure all those who panned this book may have known someone who found a way to surround themselves with drama even in this day and age. All the book's drama is caused by Henchard and his mercurial personality-if at any time he'd played things differently he could have had a better life. But no, he had to be a lunatic."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"One of my favorites works of English literature. The opening \\"wife selling\\" chapter is one of the best in all literate, setting the major tone and themes for the entire book. The ironic twits of fate provide a wild, entertaining ride that shows off Hardy's themes of the balance between fate and individual choice in a non-didactic way. The Mayor must be ranked as a tragic character in line with Shakespeare's best work. A work that makes profound psychological and philosophical statement while remaining engrossing on every level."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"I began reading The Mayor of Casterbridge as an ISP (Independant Study Project) novel, as it was reccommended to me by my English teacher. At first, I found the book to be unbearably boring, but beautifully written. The language is something to be admired. But I soon became absorbed in the story, and I have to say it was one of the most compelling ones I've ever read. I might just say it's the best book I ever have read. And it's sad. I'm a 16 year old guy, and I cried at the end. I don't want to sound prissy, but it's true. And you will cry too, I'm sure. If there is one thing I can say to you, it's this: read The Mayor of Casterbridge. It would be a great injustice to one of the most profound stories of our time."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"For being written in 1886, this book felt surprisingly modern and completely engrossing. The twists and turns of Henchard's life enthralled me and though many of his actions proved him reprehensible, he was still somehow likable... Farfrae also was an interesting character, though Elizabeth-Jane truly stole the show. All in all, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed reading this and I will certainly keep an eye out for his other works. Hardy is one of those classic authors that genuinely isn't a chore to read!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" es a truly remarkable novel. Interesting throughout, it is the story of the rise and fall of a man named Mechael Henchard. Ay the beginning of the novel, Henchard is a volatile, twenty-one-year-old hay-trusser. He becomes drunk at a fair and sells his wife and daughter to a sailor in an auction, which originally began as a joke, turns serious.Upon realizing that he has sold his family, Henchard searches for them to no avail, and takes an oath to give up alcohol for twenty-one years. After the supposed death of the sailor, Michael's wife, Susan Henchard, and her daughter began a search for Michael Henchard, who has become the mayor of Casterbridge.The novel proceeds as many soap-opera-like events unfold. The unique plot-twists made reading the novel a very entertaining experience. An unfavorable trait Henchard possesses is not letting go of past mistakes. Although he tries to atone for the past indiscretions, fate always seems to catch up to him. These factors and others contribute to the downfall of Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Thomas Hardy has a reputation for writing bleak, sad stories. The Mayor happens to be my first Hardy read, and I can't tell you how saddening I found the overall tale.Many points are made by Hardy: dealing with the past and its haunting effects; pride before the fall; and even the folly of mental inflexibility.I couldn't shake the parallel of the King Saul/David story from the Bible while reading this. You have the powerful man who takes in an apprentice then becomes overcome with jealousy and envy as his apprentice eventually outshines him. And rather than putting his usurped life in perspective, allows his anger and envy to make matters much worse.I saw Michael as a flawed man who is redeemed by his sense of duty and obligation.I think the theme of duty to world versus self is important here. Michael's duty to his first family overrides his desire to be with his new girlfriend Lucetta. He probably would have been happier with Lucetta; but wouldn't we as the audience have seen him as selfish if he had chosen her instead of Susan? Both women were manipulative, one aggressively, one passively, so it probably didn't matter. But it does raise the question of how much of our personal happiness should be sacrificed for societal duties.Donald Farfrae, the Scottish apprentice is put here purely to provide Michael Henchard with a foil. I don't feel he is developed at all, and is kind of dull, as is Elizabeth Jane.There are character driven stories and plot-driven stories. And in plot-driven stories, you know that the characters' personalities or decision-making won't really matter in how things end. That's an aspect of Mayor...that some may find the most frustrating. You never could shake the feeling that destiny was unalterable. I, however, had no problem with it. It was a good ride."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS BOOK, SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND WALK INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC NOW!

In the wake of the industrial and intellectual revolutions, he gives us an idea of what man's guidelines would become. It such a wondeful novel, that is full of insight and wisdom.

Ross has written a gripping yarn about extraordinary men and events. He's done so in a conversational style that reads like a post-mission \\"debrief\\" in a base Officers Club. Five stars to the author.Sadly, Yucca Tree Press has done the author a grave disservice by printing a book utterly rife with typographical, spelling, grammatical and other errors. This sort of technical foul-up is inexcusable in a publishing company. For some readers the publisher's incompetence here may rob the book of some of its impact and enjoyment. The book loses a star entirely because the publisher didn't do its job.

The title is apt. He pays tribute to those he served with, gives full credit to those behind the scenes who kept the planes airworthy, and along the way reveals what it means to not only send others into battle, but to go with them. He is candid with his opinions and having done two tours in Viet Nam, is more than qualified to back up anything that he says about the conduct of the war. He sought combat, volunteering for it twice, and became a squadron commander. He was also shot down twice.This is an engaging book on many levels. It's a great story of both war and test flying. It has humor. It is thoughtful and at times very articulate. It distills in simple terms what being a leader means. All of this is done in an easy, conversational style. One thing is abundantly clear: he's proud to be a warrior. He's grateful to have served with others of that elite brotherhood.He says that his favorite missions were those where he helped troops in contact. Those of us who received that help will be forever grateful! To you, COL Ross, may you never have to buy another drink.

The author uses her own unfounded opinions such as calling the Egyptian gods \\"Names of Netjer,\\" as if Netjer was the Egyptian High God.

Another reviewer mentions the poetry of Egypt mentioning \\"O such and such in your name of so and so.\\" Certainly such poetry existed, but one god having various titles in no way implies that all gods are Names of a god called Netjer, anymore than saying that Bob Smith has the names Officer Smith, Officer Bob, Mr. Officer, Mr. Policeman, or just \\"Hey cop!\\"Not only is the book lacking in relevant or interesting information, and not only does it push such phony notions as a One God called \\"Netjer,\\" but the fact is that Ms. Siuda runs the House of Netjer, and this book is the Dianetics of her cult.

After so many years of poorly-researched books and manuals that used Budge or 70's romance novels as their references on the subject, it's good to see someone out there worth her salt putting effort into the matter (and amusing to see how many people imitate her pronunciations and use her definitions without giving her any credit whatsoever).

The author is a graduate student of ancient religions and a priestess of the House of Netjer. Thus, she writes of the Gods (Neteru) with both scholarly background and personal experience. This combination gives her material that sense of truth so often lacking in other recent books on this subject.The introduction deals principally with the religious practices of Kemet (ancient Egypt) and touches on those of the House of Netjer. The bulk of the book consists of 13 vignettes devoted to the most universally known Neteru. Each vignette contains Kemetic texts, visualizations/meditations, illustrations, and a discussion of the Neter being described. Following these is an excellent bibliography and a brief glossary.

Ulrich manages to give meaningful yet simple overviews of various methods of establishing &quot;types&quot; of learning styles and people. She uses the Gregorc model of mind styles as the premise for the entire book, dovetailing it with some other well-known and scientifically researched theories. Her manner of presenting the information in terms of parent/child really was insightful for me and very useful in understanding my strong-willed young children and myself. HOWEVER, after she peaked my interest I was driven to find out more about the Gregorc Mind Styles which she so heavily relies upon for the book and in the process of doing so discovered that Dr. Gregorc, the creator of the Mind Styles model used by Ulrich, quite adamantly abandoned the model for use with children and students due to unreliable scientific results and &quot;danger&quot; to children. It would do one well to visit Gregorc Associates Inc. on the web and place Ulrich's information in context and read Dr. Gregorc's own lengthy comments on why he does not use the Mind Styles delineator with children. In light of Dr. Gregorc's reservations about using his own model with children I think it's quite surprising that Ulrich would use it as the basis for her entire book on how children learn. I think you'll find this book a fun read and most likely helpful in many of your relationships, not just with your children. But Dr. Gregorc has convinced me to be cautious in how I apply and assess these styles with respect to my children. I intend not to take it too seriously, and certainly not to label my children with one particular &quot;style.&quot; I wish Ulrich had addressed Gregorc's research-based reasons for not applying it to children in order to put things better in perspective. But alas, I guess the book wouldn't sell as well that way would it? It's certainly an easier read than Gregorc's own work and many of the folks Ulrich reaches with her book might never have been exposed to Gregorc's work otherwise (myself included.) In any case, I intend to recommend this book to others with certain caveats because I believe the book is well written and there is certainly something to Dr. Gregorc's model when it comes to the way adults parent. The other scientific research and models she uses in the book are all controversial on some front (Gardner's \\"seven types of intelligence\\" comes to mind.) but if one approaches this book with a light heart and an understanding that you will have to incorporate each model into your own framework with a dose of skepticism then I think you'll find it useful."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"'The Way They Learn' is an excellent book on the learning styles of all children AND adults. It is written so that parents can understand it and begin to identify and search out the strengths of both their children and themselves. Ms. Tobias is careful to warn parents of the dangers of having children inaccurately labled as having a learning disability, when in fact it may be that the child simply has a different learning style than both his teacher and/or parent. No matter what learning style your child may have... when all is said and done, they are to be held accountable for the end result. I may need absolute quiet to concentrate on my homework, while my sister needs that stereo going and food to munch. If both our assignments are completed on time... then 'that was the point!' I am not a 'reader', but I read this book in one night after having the good fortune of hearing Ms. Tobias speak in Northern New Jersey this weekend. My husband and I have one daughter, we work full-time and have taught Bible classes for many grade school ages over the past 10 years. Having read this book we feel it will help us better understand and be able to more effectively deal with our daughter and our co-workers. It will also help us to be sure we are reaching all styles in our classroom rather than just concentrating on the 'majority'. Ms. Tobias is an excellent speaker as she is both insightful and entertaining. I highly recommend both her book and the opportunity to hear her speak."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. I feel every parent should be given one in the hospital and every teacher should be required to read it before certification. Tobias' insight and explanations of learning styles saved me from pulling my hair out (or having it all turn gray) with my wonderfully bright, definitely analytical/structual son. Her ten comandments for each style helps the reader see what affects, both bad and good, a person's actions can have on different learning styles. Her suggestions on various approaches to learning have opened a whole new world for both my son and myself. I believe this book offers insight that will allow EVERY student to be successful."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"This book provides valuable information about how children deal with new information as they grow and develop, which also lends to pratical application for understanding adult behavior. It explains different learning styles with examples of how to best assist the learner in his or her growth, both personal and intellectual. This book is written in an easy to read, interesting format that involves the reader while providing a wealth of information. I feel this book is extremely helpful for parents, teachers and anyone interested in taking an active role in fostering a child's education and development."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"Tobias's book, &quot;The Way They Learn&quot; is a well structured composite of the five most useable theories of learning styles. Being an experienced teacher, and having focused on my students' styles of learning over the past years, I have seen a remarkable increase in student involvement in the learning process when the activity is matched to the learning style of the child. The introductory chapters give a good foundation for understanding the learning style models, but I particulary like parents to read and discuss with me the chapters on how we concentrate, how we remember, and how we understand. Parents are often amazed that their children can learn very easily in a completely different environment than they need to focus and concentrate. This book not only gives the basics, but along the way gives lots of good tips for working with children on specific learning problem areas. All teachers and parents should know this research exists and is accurately useful."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"I am so impressed with the simplicity and utility of Ms. Tobias' book. Suddenly, it makes sense that one kid can learn with the radio on (which always drives me nuts) and another always studies best while lying on the floor. Every teacher should read this book.

It explains in a very easy-to-read format how everyone has a different way of taking in and processing information. This should be a must read for all teachers and administrators.

However, we differ in how we understand information with one of us being kinesthetic and the others visual. It's useful information to have. However, this book is definitely not geared toward younger children. I could figure out my older 2 children's styles, but my just turned 6-year-old there isn't enough data to assess, even less so with my 4-year-old. The quiz questions are more geared toward older children and adults, both in understanding and in the ability to evaluate themselves.Despite it's subtitle (\\"How to discover and teach to your child's strengths\\" this book is unfortunately relatively light on helping you determine how to teach to your children. What to do with my quite intelligent 9 yo that can read beautifully but is a horrible speller and is a kinesthetic learner? This book has little to help me with that question. This book is of more help in understanding the basic framework than in implementing a plan of action based on it.Still this was very enjoyable reading. Each style and way of thinking and understanding was really brought to life for me. She looks at each of the styles from the perspective of a parent with that style, which is very helpful as well. I would recommend this book to parents and students, but in targeting any trouble areas that your child has, you may need to look elsewhere for more detailed information about how to teach to their learning styles and strengths."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"Great book for parents and teachers in helping bring out the best of your child's skills and talents."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"I first saw this book with my professor in school so I bought it (because it seemed interesting) but when I read it, I found it to be an amazingly fun to read book.

Along a similar topic, I prefer work discussing the four temperaments by Tim LaHaye, although his books don't focus just on learning as this one does."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"I loved this book! I purchased this book when my son was 4. I wanted to know how he thought and what made him tick. It wasn't much good to me then. He wasn't developed enough in his personality yet for me to see the behaviors of each style. He is now 7 and this book has helped greatly!He was starting to stuggle in school this year. He kept falling behind in class, wouldn't get his work done, easily distracted, very social, etc. I had paragraphs highlited and wrote his name in. There were things in there that fit him to a \\"T\\". C.U.T. notes in her book that no one is specifically one learning style. I have found that it depends on the subject with him. In phonics, he's auditory, in math he's visual, etc. The big deal for me was that I finally understood how he PERCEIVES his world!!! He's global and random. Once I got the definitions of what those were, we got a long MUCH better. I am the polar opposite of him and there were many times we seemed to be speaking two different languages. This book, for us, was like having a translator.One note: We have not discovered his environmental preference. I'm not sure he's developed a pattern for me to discern this yet, but I'm sure it will come as he gets older.I can see why some said that the book was out of context, but for now, it's one of the best books out there, even if Gregoric doesn't believe in applying it to children across the board. Everyone changes and develops and different levels and stages in life. What we might do and not think about at 17, we would rethink at 30. All in all, though for us, it's been a LIFESAVER!!"},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"After slapping my forehead a few times. My boys and I sat down one evening and found out each one's domninant style. Not only is it insightful for me, but for them also! C.T. is right. They don't learn the same way I do...duh!

Now I know what the differences are and more importantly, how to capitalize on the differences to their advantage (and mine)!"},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"Cynthia Tobias uses several models to help readers identify their thinking, learning, communication, and information processing styles. The book is a quick and easy read so you don't have to spend time reading &quot;fluff&quot;.Several reviews have commented about the controversial nature of the models the author refers to. The controversy about models challenges us to continue striving toward a better understanding of our intellectual development. No model is or should be without controversy over time because our intellectual abilities change as we evolve as a species.Readers will appreciate the straightforward nature of this book and use the information along with insight gained in other areas of human development (emotional, spiritual, physical, areas of nutrition, etc.) to help them understand themselves and others better."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"As a homsechooling mom, this book helped me understand that I like to learn -- and teach -- sequentially. I know my daughter, as I am sure most parents feel they know their child, but I learned something about her that I did not really understand before, thanks to this book.My daughter and I are both abstract thinkers, but we differ in that she learns randomly. Teaching her sequentially was boring her and she would stall during lessons, even though she could easily understand the material. I learned that she needed to have her lessons \\"mixed up\\" more, in a style that I would have found absurd while constantly trying to figure out what the point is. But, my daughter \\"gets it\\" and we get better results in a short time with better retention. My daughter does not need logic as I do, she needs to feel good about it and for everyone else to be happy, too. And lesson time is happier now that I understand the best way to keep her attention and further motivate her.In addition to this book, I recommend \\"The Spirit-Controlled Temperament\\" by Tim LaHaye. You may find, as I did, that the Hippocrates four temperaments and the Gregoric four learning styles are easily associated. Is it merely coincidence that there are also four blood groups? Throughout the last ten years I have been doing research on these concepts. I have found that Blood Type O children tend to be Concrete Sequentials with the Phlegmatic Temperament; Blood Type A children tend to be Abstract Sequential with the Melancholic Temperament; Blood Type Bs tend to be Concrete Random with the Choleric Temperament; and Type ABs are typically Abstract Random with the Sanguine Temperament.I also believe that each person is unique and there are many other factors to explore, like birth order has its facets in the personality also. Therefore, you could have a three children with the same blood type and seem to be all different in learning style and temperament. Learning styles as the Gregoric Model is not an absolute. No one fits perfectly into such boxes, but we do gain a different perspective about others, including children, when we are able to look outside the box we have built around ourselves.This book is a permanent reference book in my library."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"I purchased this book to help with my son who is 5 and really struggling. I got a very thorough lesson in the learning styles of my older children. I had my children draw pictures of their ideal study conditions and was blessed to be able to fulfil those drawings. The result? Homework done in record time each night with better classwork during the day."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"My daughter has been struggling with reading and I found this book by accident. I could not put it down and read it in two days. It has already helped us so much! As I read about various qualities of auditory and kinesthetic learners, I would think 'that's her exactly!' This book offered some hands-on practical tools. For example, now we do hand motions when we are practicing a new word. She gets it immediately (the spelling) and retains it!The book also gave me a good starting point to do additional research on learning styles, and I found several helpful websites and articles on the topic. I think now of all the times we told my daughter to sit still while practicing reading, and now I get that she actually needs some movement, however small, for her brain to learn in the best way for her. Thisd is a great resource!Christine Mitchell, author and illustrator of:Welcome Home, Forever Child: A Celebration of Children Adopted as Toddlers, Preschoolers, and Beyond"},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"Very interesting read. I thoroughly enjoyed the book; it was easy to discover my own way of learning, but figuring out my children's styles of learning is/was a little more difficult. Overall, this book is a valuable resource which I'll read and refer to often."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"So, I bought the book to understand my child's learning style. Instead, I learned about mine. Is that so bad? No, not at all. I still can't classify my son's learning style. Oh well...."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"This book has helped me significantly both as a teacher and as a person. Some parts are a little overemphasized, and she's not always consistent in presenting people as composites of many styles, but the information is basically sound. As a non-Christian and a liberal, I consider it one of the few good things to come out of Focus on the Family."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"I found this book to be very enlightening and it has influenced me greatly. However, I bought it to find out how my child learns. I was disappointed that I was unable to make any determination. Perhaps he's too young--the tests and examples seem to be geared more toward adults than small children. Maybe as he gets older I can identify his learning style. In the meantime, I've discovered my own and my husband's, so that certainly justified the purchase of this book!"},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"This book was suggested to us by our son's teacher. It is very insightful. At first, we learned more about ourselves than our children, but with the help of the teachers, we are able to learn our children's learning styles to pass along to the teachers in the next level. With this as yet another tool in our box to educate our children, we feel we are giving them the best environment to learn. Amazing how they flourish when the right doors are open to them."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"I went to a seminar by Cynthia Tobias (the author) and laughed so hard I cried, as she described herself and other strong-willed people to the audience. She was also describing me, my husband, and at least one of my five children.I read through the book in about a week, and pencilled in my children in the diagrams, and quizzed my husband on all the questions. The best part about each chapter is the \\"ten commandments\\" and \\"In a nutshell\\" section for each learning style. A lot of these ideas and truths, I already was aware of, as a teacher, but I had never applied them to my own family; just to my classroom and to my own curriculum. Having everything laid out so simply has been wonderful, and I have learned better not only how to treat my students in classes and my own children, but also how to discipline more effectively as well as communicate with my husband! A must have, I think, for any mother, homeschooling or not.Thank you Cynthia, for a fanTASTic seminar, and a great resource!Sra.

This was such a great read, for those of us who you want to understand ourselves & others and the way we learn, memorize, understand, etc. I learned a ton about myself & my husband. A little bit about the children, but that may take more time. I'm a sequential person as she categorized it, so I'll list out the features:1. Learning Stylesa. Perception: Concrete or Abstractb. Organize it: Sequential or RandomI finally understood how my husband thinks and organizes (or the lack thereof), because he is very random & I'm sequential - papers & books spread out haphazardly works well for him.2. Memory Stylesa. Auditory - verbal typeb. Visual - image typec. Kinesthetic - movement type (this one was a new concept to me, and I've actually used this style for many years, unknowingly)3. Concentration StylesMany styles here - this really helped me with my child and the study style that works best. You basically find your best way to be comfortable & that is the best environment you can concentrate & learn in - couch/bed/table/floor - night/day - music/silence/background noise - public/private - group/individual. The 'sit down at a desk with a lamp in total quiet' homework time is busted!4. Understand Stylesa. Global - need the whole pictureb. Analytical - need detailsI definitely have heard this before, but it was nice to read the details on it - I'm guessing I'm analytical :)5. IntelligencesShe explains how our talents can be applied for a career or hobby. Linguistic, Logical, Spatial, Musical, Kinesthetic, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal. I love the categories of interpersonal & intrapersonal, because it explains the differences and talents of social vs. introverted people.I do like that fact that the author does clarify not to categorize ourselves & others 100% in one area. We can all be a mix & match - it's not mutually exclusive."},{"Title":"The Way They Learn","review":"This book has helped me so much.

It helped me understand my child's way of thinking, as well as understand he is very normal, and not the only one in the world who thinks the way he does.

It also covers military equipment going back to the early days. It brings together a wealth of hard-to-find information and the author is very definitely an authority on the subject.

The historical perspective is interesting -- does help understand how terminology evolved from scanned single detectors to staring arrays."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Hunger","review":"This book presents an account of the Donner Party, a wagon train of about eighty-seven people who in July 1846 started off for California via a new, untried route through the Sierras. Unfortunately, this particular wagon train of pioneers would go down in history due to the horror and tragedy that it was to meet along its way. Stranded in the Sierras amidst its harshest winter in years, with unparalleled snowfall and frigid temperatures, only little more than half, mostly women and children, were to survive their unbelievable deprivation and suffering.This wagon train was a loose confederation of strangers who originally were part of another wagon train, but who collectively branched off by consensus to try a new, though untried and unproven, overland route through the Sierras that was alleged to be shorter. Their decision to take this new route was one that would haunt them for the rest of their journey, as it was not what it was purported to be. The inexperience of these travelers, the poor decisions that were sometimes made, and their seeming inability to truly unify as one entity contributed to their ultimate debacle. They were, after all, representative of humanity at large. Some of them were good, brave, and unselfish. Some were people with whom one would not wish to shake hands.Beleaguered by thirst as they trekked across a desert, marauded by Indians along the way, plagued by the loss of necessary oxen and cattle, beset by accidents and personal squabbles that would sometimes turn deadly, they would finally reach the Sierras and begin their perilous crossing, only to find themselves snowbound at the summit while within sight of the pass that they needed to cross to be home free. Trapped by the weather in early November, they would set up a make-shift camp, never thinking about just how long their encampment would last. With minimal food supplies at their disposal, these intrepid, westward-ho emigrants would find themselves trapped for months, facing incredible hardships that would tax them beyond human endurance. Some would resort to cannibalism in order to survive.This is a riveting story about survival of the fittest, about personal sacrifice, and human foibles. It is a story not only of those ill-fated pioneers but of those who would attempt to rescue them, often at great personal cost. It is a story that reflects the human spirit, both good and bad, in time of crisis. It is a story of often selfless heroism. It is also a story of greed and craven opportunism. While some of the book is politically incorrect, it is reflective of the times in which these pioneers lived, as well as that of when this book was first written.It is, however, remiss that the maps included in this book do little to illustrate the deadly journey undertaken by these pioneers. Still, the lack of comprehensive maps does not unduly detract from the powerful impact that this story has on the reader. Moreover, although the book was published in 1936, the author, a trained historian, added a supplement in 1960, which is included in this edition of his book. This supplement serves to correct errors, as well as incorporate additional relevant material not available at the time of original publication.Those who enjoy tales of survival will, undoubtedly, find this gripping tale well worth reading."},{"Title":"I Have a Secret","review":"This kid's book is so cute.

Treatment is generally clear and thorough, but an advanced math and stat background is an absolute prerequisite for understanding the materials.S-Plus/R code is given, but strangely, there is very little on *why* and*when* one uses each of the techniques. Under what cirmcustances should I use or not use GARCH? What exactly is PCA good for in real-world applications? These important questions are not answered, in other words, you don't get a sense of the real-world context for these topics."},{"Title":"Analysis of Financial Time Series (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"Professor Tsay is a student of the Wisconsin school of statisticians where he learned time series from Box and Tiao. He is an excellent lecturer and a good writer. I have attended one of the short courses he taught on time series. New models have been developed to deal with the special behavior of financial time series. Professor Tsay is always at the forefront of that research and teaches at Chicago in one of this country's top business schools. If I am correct George Tiao is also there at present.This is the second edition of a popular text. Financial time series play an ever more important role in our lives during these turbulant economic times. Tsay cover the tradition Box-Jenkins models but these models are not always appropriate for financial data. So he also introduces the GARCH models and some nonlinear models. The book includes some models that I am not familiar with. I have done research in time series but never with financial data. There is some theory involving stochastic differential equations that explains some of the turbulant behavior of financial series. The text by J. Michael Steele provides thorough coverage to this theory.Tsay also deals with the pesky problem of outliers. A very practical problem that is often ignored in other econometric texts. He also has a chapter on Bayesian approaches. Some computing in SPlus is also included in this revision of the text."},{"Title":"Analysis of Financial Time Series (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"This is not a reference book, and it's not about &quot;big&quot; theory either. It's pretty practical, and good for self study. You should have access to some econometric/statistical software (i.e. EViews, S-Plus, etc.) to fully understand this book."},{"Title":"Analysis of Financial Time Series (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"I had a detailed study of the whole book before finally deciding to buy in on web. As a statistician and a beginner on Math Finance, I would say this book deserves every penny I spent on it.The author's intention to make it a reference book can be appreciated by both educators and practitioners. It starts with a couple of chapters on the ARIMA and the GARCH models. Little theoretic depth was explored yet the algorithms and the procedures for solution are emphasized. After that, the topic switches to the nonlinear time series modeling and high-freq data analysis. This part is, and will be, rather confusing to readers with less training in financial economics and theories are reluctantly clearly stated. What follows is a single chapter of so-called continuous time models and it is actually a sketch of the first few chapters of any mathematical finance textbook. Literally, this chapter is all about Black-Scholes and a little jump-diffusion model. The major reason why I called it a reference book is because it includes one chapter on VaR between the math finance chapter and the multi-variate time series models part. The author didn't say much more than that VaR is essentially some quantile calculation, which is fine in the statistical meaning. However, this description seems really \\"shallow\\" as compared with Jorion's book on VaR and risk management.After all, I would give it a five star because its comprehensiveness and the author's effort to incorporate so many things in order to re-define the framework of financial time series analysis."},{"Title":"Analysis of Financial Time Series (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"This book is an excellent toolbox for anyove dealing in the field of financial engineering, however, as a real toolbox, the author doesn't explain the exact use of all tools and how to interpret the results.

The Splus code is welcome."},{"Title":"Analysis of Financial Time Series (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"This book is awesome. It starts with bedrock concepts needed for analysis of financial data and it takes the student up to the most recent and important techniques used in the industry today.

There is a little theory, clear explanations, and quite a few real world examples. (I don't think any text would tell the reader what model to use when, because that's application-specific.) It assumes some knowledge of finance and basic econometrics/statistics, which is fair enough. To get more theory, Hamilton (1994) remains the authority, and Campbell, Lo, MacKinlay (1997) is a great introduction for PhD students, and generally an ideal companion volume to this one."},{"Title":"Analysis of Financial Time Series (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"The coverage of the topic is broad and deep.

It is written with a very deep understanding of the subject matter, so the author can explain or provide solid intuition about specific topics and techniques in just a few pages, which is very rare. The theoretical treatment is supplemented by data-driven examples.For example if you want a refresher on continuous finance and derivatives pricing, the Ch 6 provides a quick (not necessarily completely rigorous) overview of derivation of the Ito's lemma, its application to pricing of derivative securities, and provides numeric examples as well (among other topics). While this book does not go deep into specific topics (not should it), it is very useful for a quick review, as a reference, and as a set of examples."},{"Title":"Analysis of Financial Time Series (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"The book is okay for a relatively advanced practitioner.

It was one of my favorite books, and 20 years later I still remember it. I was disappointed to see it was out of print. This story is about a girl, Ronnie, a nickname for Veronica, and Rosey, a boy who has the misfortune to have a flowery last name. They meet and become friends and move awkwardly toward a deeper relationship. Then suddenly just as Ronnie thinks her world could not be any better, her father is killed in a car accident. Her mother becomes a depressed recluse and does not want Ronnie to go anywhere. It drives Ronnie to sneak out of the house to be with Rosey and that's when trouble happens. This story has a lot of common elements with many teen novels; however, the author does a great job of showing healthy relationships between a girl and her parents, a girl and her teacher, and a girl and the boy she loves. Although some misguided choices are made by mother and daughter, it shows how love, communication, and forgiveness can bring a family through the worst pain - a death in the family. It also shows that bad things can happen to good people and how they cope and learn to survive. I highly recommend it to any middle school or high school girl who likes a good love story."},{"Title":"Ronnie and Rosey","review":"My third book for reading workshop was Ronnie and Rosey, a book by Judie Angell. Ronnie, believe it or not, is a girl whose real name is an old-fashioned name from her grandmother. She is an only child, and she moves to a new town with her parents. All is going well; she makes some friends, develops a crush and begins to feel at home. Everything is going fine until disaster strikes. Ronnie's father is killed in an automobile accident. The accident and her father's death changes everything. Her mother is depressed and is very strict now. She makes up impossible and unrealistic rules that Ronnie is forced to follow. Ronnie attempts to go around them, even bend them, but it just ends up getting her into more trouble and getting her more rules. It seems everything she does seems to give her a harder time than she started out with.I really liked this book. It not only shows the hardships of going through middle school and moving to a new town, but also the affects of the after death of a loved one. Sometimes it was exciting, other times it was not. For instance, when Ronnie would sneak out to be with her friends or Robert, her boyfriend, it would be exciting because she wasn't allowed to do it and it made you wonder what was going to happen. There are some other exciting events, but you'll have to read the book yourself to find those out. I did feel like I was in the book because you knew so much about the characters and it felt like you were really in Ronnie's head, like you were her. The main conflict did interest me because I have yet to lose a loved one, or someone close to me, so it was interesting to see how someone copes and how to deal. The characters seemed very real. The book's ending was okay-it could have been better. I guess overall it was reasonably satisfying.The \\"voice\\" was through Ronnie's point of view, though it wasn't a narrative. There wasn't much interesting or different vocabulary words. I knew pretty much all of them. It was a pretty easy book to read. All of the language was like the daily language we use now. There weren't any very unique characteristics, though it was very realistic. The writing styling was really average; not anything special. There was a lot of dialogue, and a lot of description, too. If there wasn't dialogue, which there normally was, it was getting into Ronnie's head. Even though Judie Angell's writing was not very special nor unique, I did like it a lot. She used a good amount of detail and I loved how she got into Ronnie's head. Sometimes it was as if you were Ronnie.I'd rate this book a 7 out of 10. It was pretty good, and I liked the plot and the story itself. The writing was good, too. I would recommend this book to the class. It's probably more of a girly book, though. I highly doubt that any of the guys would really enjoy this book. I also kind of knew how Ronnie felt because I had a similar moving experience, so that helped. Also, there were twists that you weren't expecting at some parts, like Ronnie's mother being selfish and making a up a stupid rule, such as she could only talk to her friends ten minutes each on the phone. Then she'd try to bend or go around the rule, but only end up getting into more trouble. It wasn't the best book that I've ever read, and I don't think that it's one of my favorites, but it is good. If you're a girl, looking for a dramatic read, I suggest that you choose this book.Often, there are books for our age group that are silly and happy or very much so a fantasy, so it's interesting when you finally find a good book that maybe shows a different side. One that you can actually read, and actually understand, unlike many of the more dramatic books out there that I've read. Also, it's funny how the author made the names-Ronnie is really a girl, and Rosey is a nickname for a boy name Robert's last name, Rose. It's switched, and it kind of throws you off for a second when you're reading the back cover."},{"Title":"Egyptian Religion","review":"Lucia Gahlin's book is split into two primary sections. In the first, the author initiates us into the organised state religion of ancient Egypt, including the importance of the afterlife to ancient Egyptians, their funerary customs, the Book of the Dead, and of course the pyramids and other burial sites. The second part covers popular religion, and explains the importance of magic, ritual, and the power of the temples in the lives of ordinary folk.The author starts with the burial chambers of the pharoahs, and the funerary customs surrounding them. Death was not the end for ancient Egyptians who believed very much in an afterlife, and their customs were designed to protect and prepare the recently departed for the trials to come. Objects were placed within the funerary chamber that would help or give comfort in the afterlife.Preparation for the afterlife wasn't restricted to mummification, although this was important. Priests would utter prayers and spells, and coffins would be painted with chapters from the Book of the Dead and other mystical emblems. The author takes the time to explain this process in detail, and includes chapters on burial sites, mummification, weighing of the heart, coffins and texts, the Book of the Dead, the funerary equipment used and so much more.Much of the first half of this book has been written about by other authors, but few books cover the lives of the people in quite as much detail as Gahlin. She makes the point that magic and superstition were crucial in daily life, and that every aspect of life was affected by this. Ancient Egyptians would regularly consult wise people, oracles, priests. Dreams played an important role in determining their futures. Reading the chapters on household dieties, rituals, rites of passage, festivals and music, and the role of the temples in society gives a far different impression of Egyptian life than I would have expected.Anyone interested in religion at the state and popular level in ancient Egypt will find this book very informative. The author has taken the time to format this book into short focused chapters making it an easy read. Every page includes full color large-sized images, and many also include little snippet boxes that bring the content to life. I would also personally recommend this book for school libraries and would be an excellent project book or resource, but is probably more suitable for children 8-9 years or older."},{"Title":"Testaments Betrayed: An Essay in Nine Parts","review":"This is one of the most important books I've ever read. It is of interest, of course, to people involved with literature, music, translation, or who are interested in Kafka, Picasso, Hemmingway, Stravinsky, or others Kundera talks about. But I think the real importance of this book applies to any reader. It has to do with Milan Kundera's beautiful illustrations as to how we as humans try to make our own heroes everyone else's heroes, too, and in the process destroy many of the things we value and love about them. This is a vital idea in the modern world, where celebrity, biography, and voyeurism are always so present. Also, the statements Kundera makes on the nature of friendship inspire deep reflection on the qualities of our relationships with those we hold dear."},{"Title":"Testaments Betrayed: An Essay in Nine Parts","review":"In Testaments Betrayed, Kundera describes the waning days of modernism (focusing on the novel) in an historical (and at times hysterical) light. But what makes this book of interest to people who usually like to read novels rather than critiques of novels, is Kundera's marvelous ability to combine the lucid explanation and analysis of ideas with marvelous wit that seems almost foreign to serious tone of most modern literary criticism. In reading Testaments Betrayed I repeatedly experienced the wonderfully paradoxical feeling of laughing because of the profoundness, the very seriousness of Kundera's ideas"},{"Title":"Testaments Betrayed: An Essay in Nine Parts","review":"This is a moving book, written in Kundera\`s clear, humorous style which talks about the novel and warns us from distortions of novels\` meanings by translators who do not understand the authors. Kundera\`s love for his art and breadth of vision is astounding and his teachings on life and philosophy on which this book is based on are very inspiring. Reading this brilliant masterpiece we will learn one thing: history- we can never get rid of history: &quot;how sweet it would be to forget that monster&quot;. The suitable book for lover\`s of Milan Kundera."},{"Title":"Testaments Betrayed: An Essay in Nine Parts","review":"The fact that friends or opera bosses didn't respect the scores or the testaments of artists or had the power to impose their own vision on other's work, is for Milan Kundera an occasion to reflect on the history and rules of art and the novel, the freedom of the artist and ultimately, on freedom of speech.His main examples are Franz Kafka (Max Brod didn't respect his testament which ordered to destroy all non published work) and Leos Jan&aacute;cek (whose opera score was \`adapted' by an opera director).Art has an autonomous status, its own laws. Art is not an imitation of reality. It is a unique expression of an individual. It is therefore logical that this individual possesses all rights over a work that emanates exclusively from him.Moreover, one doesn't need biographical furor (Sainte-Beuve), to know the writer, painter or composer in order to understand his work. As Marcel Proust states: 'a book is the product of a self, other than the self we manifest in our habits.'Milan Kundera detests also those critics who interpret a work of art with their own political, philosophical, religious convictions (see Adorno's scandalous critic of Stravinsky's music).Essential for the novel are the facts that it is a realm where moral judgment is suspended, that there are no dogmas of psychological realism and that it breaks through the plausibility barrier with fantasy and humor (Rabelais, Cervantes) in order to apprehend better the real world.It is evident that in these conditions art can be a dangerous weapon in the hands of political, religious, social, cultural, sexual, -in one word -, critical opponents of established powers. In the Rushdie case, \`the guardians of the temple were powerless against a novel.'I have a few remarks about this text.Firstly, art is indeed an individual expression (of the artist's emotions), but true art is the craftsmanship to arouse emotions in the spectator, the listener, the reader.Secondly, writers have normally a (few) friend(s) whom they ask to evaluate their work before submitting it to a publisher (in the case of Kafka, one of these persons was certainly Max Brod).Thirdly, in \`The Critic as Artist' Oscar Wilde expressed perfectly why art is so dangerous: \`For when a work is finished it has as it were, an independent life of it own, and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its lips.'Therefore, it is absurd that an artist should fanatically impose his own \`vision' on his work.And lastly, Orwell's 1984 has not only a political dimension, but also a social, des(human)izing, Kafkaesque one (important facts happening or that happened in the world are only known by an all-powerful \`secret team'). Its main theme is freedom to live, to know (\`who controls the present, controls the past') and to speak. It is perhaps a bad novel, but an immortal good bad one.This is a thought-provoking book and a must read for all lovers of art, and of literature in particular."},{"Title":"Testaments Betrayed: An Essay in Nine Parts","review":"The book itself is good, but the copy sent to us left a lot to be desired, since it had been used in a library."},{"Title":"Testaments Betrayed: An Essay in Nine Parts","review":"Expanding upon the delightful discourse of &quot;Art of the Novel&quot;, &quot;Testaments Betrayed&quot; serves up a feast of appreciation for some of the greatest WORKS of the modern age.

And while I personally don't think a literary hermeneutic is the only good way to read the Bible, Pratt does a good job of demonstrating that such an approach has much to commend it.Traditional evangelicals and liberals alike tend to like dissecting the Bible into little pieces (verses or even words within verses) as its primary technique of Scriptural examination and interpretation. While this is certainly not bad at all, Pratt properly believes that such an emphasis carries with it the very real danger of contextual tunnel vision, where we miss the larger picture and end up missing a lot of what the Bible intends to teach us. Pratt's hermeneutic in this book emphasizes the importance of investigating the 'original meaning' of the text - how the text was to be understood by the original historical audience it was being written to. For example, if Moses wrote Genesis during the time of the exodus as the Israelites were either at Mt. Sinai or in the plains of Moab about to enter Canaan, this historical background helps the modern reader gain added insight into not only what Moses said, but why he said it. While there are dangers with this, as I will discuss below, when handled properly, much that we either didn't understand or particularly care about in the Old Testament become extremely fascinating and meaningful. Such an approach requires us to read the Bible as a piece of literature that is telling stories - inerrant stories that are purposeful and contain timeless truths that are in part flushed out better when we understand the particular cultural and historical messages that the Bible contained for the original audience and writer of each canonical book.For readers who want to understand the relationship between the Old Testament and the Christian today in the 21st century, Pratt's approach is most instructive. Epochal, cultural, and personal adjustments are a critical part of his hermeneutic and help explain why we don't sacrifice bulls today or worship at a temple in Jerusalem, while showing how these things are still nonetheless significant and instructive for us today. Consistent with Reformed covenant theology, Pratt also insists that the Old Testament needs to be seen in the light of redemptive history, culminating in Christ. Kingdom and covenant are major organizing principles of Pratt's hermeneutic, and while readers should understand that this is far from the only good Christian model of approaching the Bible, Pratt provides a solid presentation of it here.As with both the systematic and 'biblical' theological approaches, the literary approach is not perfect and contains some weaknesses and dangers. The major danger is that a literary approach, if not sufficiently controlled, can easily spiral into ungrounded speculation that could prove just about any point anybody wanted to make, regardless of whether that's what the Bible actually teaches or not. Pratt's book, while quite good at laying out a literary hermeneutic sprinkled with Biblical theology, could have been better in warning its readers of the danger of this approach when applied unrestrained. Pratt affirms that Scripture is the lone final authority to which we all must submit, but the book is a bit sparse on defining what exactly this means within a literary context in terms of establishing good controls that constantly force our literary musings back to the Bible as the final arbiter of legitimacy and truth.But overall, this is an insightful book that will greatly challenge many of its readers to read the Bible in a fundamentally different way than they have up to this point. For the most part, this is a good thing and worthy of attention."},{"Title":"He Gave Us Stories: The Bible Student's Guide to Interpreting Old Testament Narratives","review":"In He Gave Us Stories, Dr. Pratt introduces Old Testament interpretation in an approachable way. His aim, as stated in the preface, is to provide \\"motivated lay people and beginning theological students\\" with a method for biblical interpretation that is more practical and less technical. Through this approach, He Gave Us Stories appeals to a wider audience than a more scholarly volume would.The principle idea of He Gave Us Stories is that the Old Testament narratives provide not simply a history of the Jewish people, but a revelation of God and the imperatives He has given man. However, because these truths are in story format, they must be interpreted to be of use to God's people today.The backbone of the book is Dr. Pratt's three-fold approach to Biblical interpretation. The first four chapters cover the subject of \\"Preparing for Old Testament Narratives,\\" the middle eight chapters deal with \\"Investigating the Old Testament Narratives,\\" and the final four chapters are on \\"Applying the Old Testament Narratives.\\" Dr. Pratt likens this approach to an archaeologist, who much invest a great deal of time, thought, and effort as he prepares for his project, searches for his treasures, and transports his discoveries home.He Gave Us Stories provides more a simple method of hermeneutics than a formal system of biblical theology. With the exception of Chapter 12: Overview of Old Testament Narratives, the purpose, structure, and content of this book are pointed toward the exposition and application of individual texts.This book is a useful tool for students and teachers of the Bible alike. Dr. Pratt has succeeded in making it accessible to those who are not textual and hermeneutical scholars. In particular, his focus on the stories of the Old Testament make the overall approach to understanding all the more appealing. Surely no person, learned or not, would be uninterested in stories. And certainly not these stories, since they are from God himself and teach us how to live our lives. The thread of stories weaves its way throughout the book.The structure of He Gave Us Stories is also commendable. Dr. Pratt takes the principles of hermeneutics - a very complex subject indeed - organizes them, and states them in an uncomplicated way. And the ability to make the profound appear simple, according to C.S. Lewis, is the mark of true genius."},{"Title":"He Gave Us Stories: The Bible Student's Guide to Interpreting Old Testament Narratives","review":"This book requires mental work, but it is rewarding. Dr. Pratt's hermeneutic is revolutionary in the sense that it allows the reader-student (you must study it to get the meat of it) to unlock OT narratives like never before. His three-prong paradigm for interpreting a OT narrative text (and any narrative text) is simply profound. His hermeneutical adjustments from original meaning (epochal, cultural &amp; personal) are very useful and helpful tools in the quest to rightly interpret any OT text. I heartily recommend this book to any serious student of the Bible. If possible, it would be best to read the text along with Dr. Pratt's audio or video tapes as he teaches through the book, if those are available.

I find 'He Gave us Stories' to be much more useful than the bulk of these books, besides, as I said, focusing on the actual issue I was studying."},{"Title":"He Gave Us Stories: The Bible Student's Guide to Interpreting Old Testament Narratives","review":"Although I agree with most of Dr. Pratt's ideas and beliefs, I found this book extremely toilsome and, in some points, downright bland.

The Nine Tailors was good but this one is so complete. So satisfying in every way. There is the culmination of Wimsey's long-suffering courtship of Harriet. There is the beauty of their expressions of love to one another. There is the mystery. Who killed the dude in the basement? Was it an accident? The climax and conclusion are extremely satisfying. Get this book! And every Sayers book you can find!"},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"I have been re-reading several of the Sayers novels in conjunction with watching the DVDs -- not that I have a DVD of Busman's Honeymoon. But anyway.The letters written by friends and family of Harriet and Peter about the Vane-Wimsey nuptials were entertaining, but when the novel itself picks up after the ceremonies, and Peter and Harriet are at last in their honeymoon cottage, I began to get restive. There was endless yakking by all the various interlopers who appeared, each with some necessary function, but all going on about it to wretched excess. This is a pattern that carries on throughout the book. I decided then to read about the book, in a collection of Sayers' letters, rather than read the book itself. That was when I learned that Busman's Honeymoon was originally written as a stage play, and all that talking was the \\"amusing dialog\\" that was to give sparkle to the drama. And perhaps it does, to a live production.One of the reviewers here said that this novel could as well have been a story, and I see what she meant. Still, it is clear from the letters written by Sayers at the time, as well as a sympathetic reading of the series, that she was trying to accomplish more in the book than could be well accomplished in a short story. She had been leading up to this climax in the relationship of Peter and Harriet for the past several novels, and she couldn't write it off too briefly. This is possibly the most intriguing of literary romances; its subtlety is the essence of it. Many of her readers couldn't understand the attraction of Harriet, which shows they have a very shallow conception of Peter. Peter is a character who occupied a significant part of his creator's imagination; he is, in essence, Dorothy Sayers. She has made him a fully realized individual, after initially presenting him as the \\"silly ass\\" Bertie Wosterish character popular at the time. Harriet's objections to marrying him manifest the kind of sensitive morality that is a mirror of his, and his wooing of her is the perfect fantasy of the perfect high-moral-plane romance. So although in Busman's Honeymoon Harriet and Peter don't have much to say, or maybe I mean they don't have very many lines, and the lines they do have are about the murder, and murder in general, these lines make it clear to the reader what is going on between them. This is a romance based on a great commonality of intellect, respect, and appreciation -- and this isn't the stuff of modern popular fiction."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"This is the final novel that Dorothy Sayers wrote in the Lord Peter Wimsey series. In it, Peter and Harriet Vane have married and, escaping from their wedding reception, make their way to Talboys, a house Peter has bought for Harriet. Although Peter had made arrangements for the house to be in order upon their arrival, they are locked out, with nobody there to greet them. Nothing is ready. They make do, but the next day Bunter, Peter's \\"man,\\" discovers a corpse in the cellar. It's the former owner of Talboys, and Peter and Harriet get to work solving the question of who murdered Noakes. Hence the title, \\"busman's honeymoon\\" -- a busman who drives on his vacation isn't really on vacation and, presumably a couple who solve crimes in daily life and then have to solve one during their honeymoon, aren't really on a honeymoon.When I first read this novel, I thought it seemed \\"talky\\" in that there were many static scenes of people talking to each other, usually within Talboys. Later I learned that Sayers had written this story as a play before she wrote it as a novel, so that explains the \\"un-novel-like\\" nature of this book. And then later still, I saw the story as a play. It is, in fact, much better as a play. But if you like the Wimsey novels, you will certainly want to read this book because it concludes the series."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"This is the last novel in the series featuring Lord Peter Wimsey, talented amateur sleuth, and that's rather a shame. At the very end of the previous novel, Gaudy Night, Peter proposed yet again to Miss Harriet Vane, whom he had saved from the gallows six years before and had been pursuing avidly ever since. Only this time (things being different), she accepted. The first part of the book is the mostly lighthearted story of their wedding and the lengths they had to go to in order to get what they wanted. (It's not always easy, being the younger brother of a duke and constantly in the public eye.) But they manage it and head off to what they hope will be a private honeymoon in a house they've just purchased in the Norfolk village where Harriet grew up. They meet a number of locals, of course, and Sayers, a master of characterization, does a terrific job with all of them. But Lord Peter just can't escape Fate and when the previous owner of the house turns up dead in the cellar, the happy couple is drawn into the police investigation whether they like it or not. The local superintendent is particularly good in his quotation-competition with the newlyweds. And the solution to the crime is certainly original. It's a pity Sayers declined to continue to produce these marvelous books. I'd much rather read a Peter Wimsey mystery than a translation of Dante."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"Picking up where \\"Gaudy Night\\" left off (with Lord Peter Wimsey's marriage proposal), \\"Busman's Honeymoon\\" beings with the lord's marriage to mystery writer Harriet Vane. As much a mystery story as it is a story of their relationship, \\"Busman's Honeymoon\\" is a showcase of Sayer's intelligence and masterful storytelling. It is a quick paced romp of a mystery filled with detours and severely lacking in clues that all leads to an ingenious ending.Having eluded the press (not to mention several members of Peter's family) with a quiet wedding in Oxford, the newlyweds head off to a cottage called Talboys that they have recently purchased from its previous owner. Harriet has a past connection with the house, having stayed there when she was a young child. Yet upon arrival, the house is locked up, the recent owner away and no one is expecting the couple who shows up late at night. Once they can finally take possession of the house, they find that nothing has been made ready for their arrival, and to complicate matters further, the next day, the body of the previous owner is found dead in the cellar. Could it possibly be an accidental death? With a famous sleuth and a famous mystery writer in residence, of course not. But as Peter and Harriet get more and more involved in the case and with the town's inhabitants very few clues come to light. They can speculate all they want, but without proof, they have no case.\\"Busman's Honeymoon\\" is a delightful mystery, intricate in its knotwork. Yet this novel also offers readers a chance to see a different side of Lord Peter Wimsey, a fitting coda to his adventures as a sleuth. He and Harriet are perfectly suited for one another, and readers will enjoy their banter together as well as the characterizations of the town's unique inhabitants. Dorothy L.

Sayers has her points but she is neither a great writer nor a great crime novelist. This is, in my view, the worst of her Lord Peter Wimsey books. Nearly 400 pages in my edition - yet the mystery could have been set out and solved in a 20-page short story, which is what Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle would have done. Most of this book is about the relationship between Peter and Harriet, and I find this tedious at best - it often verges on the emetic. The unchallenged snobbery that runs through all the Wimsey novels is at its worst here. If I hadn't set myself the task of re-reading the whole series I would have put this one down after the first few pages.If you must read a Sayers novel, go for Murder Must Advertise or The Documents in the Case instead."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"For Dorothy Sayers fans who have been following the Lord Peter series, this story gives us a sigh of relief.

Then the wedding and the the honeymoon, which means adjusting to married life after Lord Peter, at least, has wanted something for so long.

The inclusion of Harriet Vane (mystery-writing wife of Lord Peter Wimsey), into the Wimsey series was, in my opinion, a big plus.

Like several other novels that involve both Sayers' sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey and mystery novelist Harriet Vane, the novel is as much a portrait of their relationship as it is a murder mystery, and while these two elements occasionally seem at odds in other works (most notably the unworthy Have His Carcass), Busman's Holiday strikes a perfect balance between the two as we follow the couple through the first few days of their honeymoon as they deal with the shock of marriage, domestic disasters, and an unexpected body in their honeymoon home's basement. As in other novels, Sayers draws a great deal from her setting--in this case rural England on the eve of World War II--and presents us with a memorable cast of supporting characters, and the result is as fine a novel as she ever produced, particularly notable for its wittiness and sly humor. A greatly satisfying finish to a highly enjoyable series.There is, incidently, an extremely well-made 1930s film version of this particular work starring Robert Montgomery and Constance Cummings. Although Montgomery is not quite the image of Lord Peter Wimsey, he plays quite well, and Cummings is Harriet Vane brought to life on the screen. Sayers fans should enjoy the film almost as much as they enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"I am glad to find so many favorable reviews of this, Dorothy L Sayers' final detective fiction novel, on the internet. It failed to find much favor with the public or the critics when it was written in the late 1930s. In actual need of the income that her earlier works in this genre had generated (she had to support not only herself but also a non-productive husband and an illegitimate son), she negotiated with her publisher to \\"once again try my hand at detective fiction\\" after he had pointed out that the market seemed to have become saturated.Just as a busman's holiday is a vacation where the busman is likely to be as involved with driving as he is throughout the rest of the year, a busman's honeymoon (a phrase which she coined) is one where the busman (in this case Lord Peter Wimsey) is likely to spend his honeymoon checking alibis, interviewing murder suspects, observing rigor mortis, and all the other tiresome activities of an amateur detective.Lord Peter and Harriet Vane are the honeymooners. After their wedding (reported in a series of letters that begin the novel), they travel to \\"Talboys\\", a country house chosen by Harriet. Their reception is not as predicted. Eventually Lord Peter's butler, Bunter, discovers a corpse in the cellar.The novel began life as a play, as you may infer from the many static scenes involving a large ensemble of characters entering and exiting. The prose is as rich in wit, classical illusions and sophistication as you will ever encounter in detective fiction. Dorothy L. Sayers was an honours graduate and capable of writing as well as George Eliot.Don't expect the kind of fast food satisfaction that Agatha Christie provided so successfully. You will find instead the full silver service dining and wining experience here."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":". . .although whether the genre should properly be romance or mystery is a point up for debate. Either way, this final book in the 4-novel Harriet Vane/Peter Wimsey series is wonderful and utterly satisfying. Not only is the murder mystery extremely tight and well-done (as per normal for Sayers), but this is one of the few books of any genre I've read that really gets love right. The problems and beauties of newlywed life for two people who've been trying to come to terms with their relationship for five years are very well done, and Sayers maintains her commitment as an author to be as utterly honest and realistic about love and its complications as possible.Oh, and the roughly 6,000 tons of unresolved romantic tension built up through the first three Wimsey/Vane books are finally resolved here, to the great relief of the reader. Just reading accounts of the wedding (which was described through a series of letters between various friends and acquaintances of the couple), I felt as if I'd finally been allowed to breathe after having my head held underwater for an interminable period of time.I plan to keep my copy of this book for the rest of my life--if you like mysteries and enjoy a good love story, this is a safe pick."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"This book is one of the most enjoyable mysteries ever written, but it has to be approached in the right way.

This is definitely NOT a good place to begin the series.BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON begins shortly after GAUDY NIGHT. The opening chapter consists of letters and diary enteries from their family and friends concerning the wedding. For fans of the series these are hilarious portraits of the various characters, the delightful Dowager Duchess, the obnoxious Duchess of Denver, the unflappable Bunter and others.The newly wed Wimseys take up the action after their escape from the reception as they drive to their honeymoon destination, their newly purchased weekend cottage, 'Talboys'. The carefully arranged plans for a peaceful honemoon begin to come apart at their arrival. The house is cold, dark and locked, the former owner nowhere to be found, and no one apears to be aware of their pending arrival. These obstacles are overcome, the family takes up residence but the next day the missing former owner turns up - dead in the basement.Naturally the Wimseys solve the crime as they sort out the details of their new life.The only flaw I see with this novel is that the mystery aspect is a bit labored. Sayers was quite fond of the 'time-table' sort of mystery but tended to belabor the point. This, coupled with the array of characters/suspects that appear and are all given quite a lot of action, cause the story to drag a bit. Still, the solution is clever, the characters are charming and the scenes between Peter and Harriet are gems, finally resolving their 5 year (and 4 book) romance.The biggest problem with this novel is that it is the last full-length book in the series. Even though we were given farewell glimpses of many old friends from earlier books it is still sad to say goodbye."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"As a DLS Groupie, I love all of her books, but especially those books that pertain to the Harriet Vane character. This book, as well as 'Gaudy Night' by Sayers, is primarily about the relationship of Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. The extraordinary thing about all of Sayers' books is her beautiful amd sensual use of language to paint a picture with words."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers' &quot;Busman's Honeymoon&quot; can be considered her finest &quot;all inclusive&quot; Lord Peter Wimsey novel. She skillfully combines the culmination of the Wimsey/Vane romance and a &quot;domestic mystery&quot;. Whereas other of her novels (The Nine Tailors, for example) could be considered her best mysteries, this book is beautifully written. The reader is expected to have a passing knowledge of England at the time and the life to date of the characters, as well as a classically literate education. Don't let this put you off, however; the book stands perfectly well alone. It's old - it's not outdated."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"Summer 2004 Reading List - Mini ReviewI was intrigued by the premise of this book: An accomplished detective and a famous mystery writer marry, only to discover a corpse in the cellar of their recently purchased home the day after their wedding.This book is subtitled &quot;A Love Story With Detective Interruptions&quot; and lives up to that billing. I had not read any of the previous books in the Lord Peter Wimsey series but I did not find this an impediment. Sayers did a good job of making Busman's Honeymoon accesible as either a stand alone novel or part of her Wimsey/Vane story line. I so liked the characters that I am going to try to read previous installments in the series."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"I admit that there is not a single Dorothy Sayers which I do NOT like, but I think this one is especially good. The mystery is satisfyingly tangled, readers of the drawn-out Wimsey-Vane romance finally get some satisfaction, and the book contains one of the funniest scenes in all of the Wimsey books--who knew such fun could be had while cleaning soot out of the chimney??"},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"Lord Peter and Harriet Vane are married. In a series of letters we learn the details of the wedding and honeymoon. Due to the malicious meddling of Lord Peter's sister-in-law and the hounding of the press, the bride and groom decide at the last minute to be married in a small chapel in Oxford. Harriet has asked Lord Peter to buy her a beautiful and ancient farmhouse in the country where they decide to go for their honeymoon.The adjustment to marring someone with money is a hurdle for Harriet. She buys him an expensive wedding gift that is just right, and with the last of her money she buys a gold designer wedding dress from Worth which suits her dark beauty perfectly. Lord Peter has made her independently wealthy but she has difficulty understanding the details. All that matters is that she has completely given her heart to Peter.However, the honeymoon is not the quiet country idyll the Wimseys were longing for. The discovery of a body in the basement of their new home causes Lord Peter and Harriet to be swept up in a murder investigation and the press are once again at their door. While distracting, the investigation does not keep them from sharing many deep passionate moments. It does, however, cause them to confront difficulties in their personalities and temperaments.Sayers writes with her usual wonderful characterizations and evocative style. The reader is transported to 1930's England, a simpler more elegant time. The intricacies of a grisly murder investigation throw into relief the charm of the simple life. Yet somehow this story has a more somber tone than the other Lord Peter mysteries, perhaps because it is the last book of the series. At any rate, once again Sayers delivers prime entertainment and an enchanting detective mystery, only this time Lord Peter is finally in a settled relationship with his beloved."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"She is one of my favorite authors.

Set in the 1930s, they start their honeymoon in the country but, unsurprisingly, there are twists and turns, some of which turn out to be of a sinister nature. Throughout Harriet and Peter find out how two people who love each other can still have a lot to learn about living together in a way that permits both of them to follow their own work and commitments. Although this novel was set in a much earlier time the issues it raises are as valid today as they were then.

You get to see a more light hearted Lord Peter, at least until the murder.

You will have to sit through a lot of letter and journal reading in the beginning, but it is worth wading through for the background.

Now the reader watches so see if Harriet can still maintain her sense of self and at the same time deal with the upper class life which she has married into.This novel was originally a play and although perhaps Sayer's very best novel was Gaudy Night, there is obviously a very real sense that Sayers is now aware of her reader as an audience. The philosophical introspection of Gaudy Night has been replaced by a much lighter tone. Peter Whimsey is now fighting his personal demons (shell shock and horror of bringing criminals to their death) with a much more aware Harriet who seems to be able to support him without submerging herself.Interesting social perspective on the dynamics of marriage."},{"Title":"Busman's honeymoon: a love story with detective interruptions","review":"This would have been a great addition to the Dorothy Sayers series shown on PBS.

Thus, the emphasis is on practical issues of the language. In other words, it eschews lengthy and digressive forays into the history or context of certain linguistic developments (though it does touch on certain essential matters) and focuses instead on the issues most pertinent to one who wishes to begin mastering the basics and intermediate elements of the language, such as inflexions, cases, syntactical issues. One does not need to bring a broad basis of linguuistic training/experience to bear; but one should keep in mind that it is presented like a traditional lexicon one might encounter in Latin or Greek, i.e., no handholding through the practical elements of the language - nor is it riddled with practice sentences or parallel examples in ModE. For those, however, who want to undertake a rigorous and systematic study of the basics of OE, this is a very handy and practical Grammar reference with which to begin such an endeavor."},{"Title":"AN OLD ENGLISH GRAMMAR","review":"This is not the most well-organized Old English Grammar in existence, but it does serve a certain purpose.

A fact-filled easily searchable reference source."},{"Title":"House of Childhood","review":"This is a story of a Jewish boy, raised in an Austrian small town by a well-off family in a beautiful house, until at the age of 5, his parents and their three sons head off to America before the Nazi takeover forces them out. In the new world, his father, formerly a penniless Polish Jew, takes his in-law-paid medical education and drifts away from wife and children, leaving the boy's mother, Mira, severely impoverished, and the children confused. They spiral down into ever-cheaper rooms into, finally, the Bronx. Our narrator is not unhappy there, as he roves the streets and filthy alleys, for he is a true AUGENMENSCH, a person who lives for the visual.He grows up to become a designer, quickly becomes famous amongst the wealthy in NYC,and makes his fortune. He is able to elevate his struggling mother, now long given up hope on life, to a better home, to get his schizophrenic brother into good care, and even to attend to his long-absent, remarried father. He is unable, however,to commit to any woman very long, especially shunning the idea of having offspring. In his 30's he has one true love, but forces her to have an abortion, which ends the relationship. THe usual string of luke-warm loves follows that, until he makes a fateful journey to the suburb of Vienna, called only \\"H.\\" in the novel, where he becomes obsessed in reclaiming his mother's former home. To do so, he becomes involved in the remnant of the Jewish community still there, the bare trickle of people who came back after the war, if they had survived at all. All his own relatives, approximately 40, were killed one way or another. He finds the Austrian culture alien,and the people of the town potentially all evil, these many years later. The house is occupied, of course, by the daughter of the Nazi official who'd gained the house when his mother's people were kicked out.His is a battle royal to reclaim this house, an Austrian bureaucratic nightmare, not the least of which is proving that his grandparents were truly dead - there are no death certificates, so the title hangs in the air. He chases all over until he gets enough paperwork stamped to prove that they did indeed own that house, and that they did die. He meets a woman, only 23, who is a lost soul, daughter of a Jewish woman and gentile man, whose mother died while young. With her, he has a relationship, and invitees her to NYC. He sets up a scholarship for her to attend a school outside NYC, then slowly during that first semester, she spends more and more of her weekends down in NY with him, hating her school life. When she demands a more stable and real live-in situation, he ends it, as usual.She goes off to succeed as a photographer, eventually to marry a pharmacist and settle down.Now in his 50's, he cannot imagine staying in NYC anylonger - he is fed up, and realizes that he could go to Austria and move in. The legal matters are clear, the Austrian family is forced out, and he moves in.This is where the book delves into the emptiness of his life, how very detached he has always led his life. He wanders alone through the town, connecting only with the Jews and half-Jews there. HE gets involved with the Jewish community, especially attached to its cantor, a mild and weak man who had come back after the war.Finally, the strings of his life do slowly come together,in his 70's, but he knows he is an old man and that it is too late for much more anyway.What this pair of authors has done is a masterful evocation of a highly intelligent outsider's drifting through life's emotions. He is successful, he does attract women, but he cannot attach himself anywhere. His interest in his own people's religion is very, very weak; he has no faith, was not raised in it. Ultimately this is a very sad story, almost a morality play, to show the reader that caring about someone and caring about contributing to others is critical to happiness. Loneliness and isolation come with the detached indifference he shows to the many who had tried to love him. Like many men, regardless of age, he cannot help but notice mainly the visual in women. Therefore, as he ages and becomes much less attractive, the women cannot attach to him anymore. THey do not want to make love to him or live with him, and yet he suddenly longs for it. He now experiences what they had, when they wanted to stay with him in his younger years.Does our hero learn from this? Does he find redemption in taking over the old house of his mother's prosperous family? Does he feel at home in Austria, rejoicing to be back in his \\"real\\" culture?Obviously, not....So many stories of people who have gone back to Europe after the war are all in this vein. The Jews were not and are still not welcome, in spite of anything anyone has or has not done in the time between. There is no real trust or openness, so the seeker of the past finds himself in a semi-hostile place, where he feels himself an unwelcome visitor, an invader, at best a temporary resident.The stories the mother, Mira, planted in his head, of her easy and well-off childhood, as opposed to the grim reality of making a living on her own in NYC with no education or preparation to do so, tantalized him, mesmerized him, sent him into dreams of ectasy. The reality was an old house, with an old yellowed sink and small rooms, changed garden design.What is the moral? Shrug off the past?It appears so.Interesting that the writer is a female who can enter the mind of an aging male egotist so well. Or did the other writer fill in these parts?"},{"Title":"An Anthology of World Poetry","review":"This is the best anthology I've encountered of World Poetry, an area Americans are either forgetful of, chauvanistic toward, or have been talked out of by theorists arguing the impossibility of translation.

I found this quite helpful because most individual Chinese study materials feature either one or the other. The sentence examples are in handwritten characters, not in pinyin, which makes you learn the characters much more quickly than you otherwise would.I'd recommend this book in conjunction with a book-CD combination like Kan Qian's Colloquial Chinese (Routledge). This one focuses on grammar, as the title indicates. A bargain, as well."},{"Title":"Basic Chinese Grammar and Sentence Patterns","review":"This book is devided into 20 lessions. At the beginning of every lession, as another reviewer said, is a list of new vocabulary words for the lession listing new words/charaters giving pinyin pronunciations, traditional forms, simplified forms (if different from their trad. forms) and finally, the english meaning. Then, on the next page it explains grammatic useages and giving examples of how words are used. Finally, at the end of the lession is a small list of exercizes for the student to do to get the full grasp of the material.A few notes I have to make: this book focuses on *traditional* characters although it gives simplified forms in the vocab. lists, in the actual lession material it solely uses trad. forms, so if your focus is solely on reading simp. Chinese you may want to try a different resource. However, for those of us wanting to learn both forms or just trad. forms this book is a fine choice.Also, this book could be in plainer English; it uses a lot of linguistic terms that could potentially confuse the user, although the example sentences tend to clear up that confusion pretty quickly, you may find yourself going \\"well, why didn't the authors just say THAT in the first place!\\" quite a bit once you figure out what they meant (and don't worry, you will) which can potentially be annoying though, in my opinion, it does NOT detract from the overall value of this book.It gives examples of most common grammar useage of the lession topics and makes it easy to pick up the basic grammar (hence the book's name!) and also is a good way to get a jump start on reading the characters as ALL of the example material uses characters with next to no pinyin useage past the vocab. lists (which, imo, is a GOOD thing).If you want to write out the exercizes at the end of the lessions as opposed to just reading them aloud I reccomend a book like \\"Reading and Writing Chinese\\" by McNaughton which teaches stroke order and these two books I have found to be complimentary to each other in helping to learn how to read/write Chinese.Overall, I give this book 4/5 stars because of the previously touched upon useage of lingustic terms and also, the example text (which is all handwritten and therefore carries a certain charm for that) could be slightly bigger, for such a large book {height} the text is surprizingly small, though still ledgible. Though I DO like this book and highly reccomend it for beginners!"},{"Title":"Basic Chinese Grammar and Sentence Patterns","review":"I bought this book and was disappointed. The grammar lessons and vocabulary are great. But the use of traditional characters (not simplified as used in China (PRC)), and the fact that these are handwritten and small, make it exceptionally hard to learn the characters or understand the exercises.

My copy, too, has clearly been &quot;used&quot; a LOT. My only major criticism is that the accompanying disk does not contain very many of the sample images used in the book itself. This would be extremely helpful in learning each technique (without having to spend a lot of extra time trying to locate an image to work on with similar qualities to the ones Mr. Willmore uses in his examples.) And when the disk DOES contain a sample image Mr. Willmore uses in the course of demonstrating a certain technique, it's very difficult and time-consuming to locate. Images are not organized by chapters, but rather in separate folders according to the image's original source."},{"Title":"Official Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 5.0 Studio Techniques","review":"I received this book at a 3 day seminar put on by Ben (of which was, by far, THE best seminar that I have ever been to).

Not only does it contain most of the information you will need, but also insights and techniques you will have a hard time finding anywhere else. PLUS, it is WELL-WRITTEN; a quality missing from 95% of the Photoshop books out there(and I've read more than my fair share!)"},{"Title":"Official Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 5.0 Studio Techniques","review":"This is the first Photoshop book that ever made sense in NORMAL English. The author seemed to go throught great lengths to try to de-mistify the secrets of Adobe's Photoshop 5.0 without going into lengthy chapters of technical information. Information that only an Adobe Certified Expert would need or even want to bother memorizing.Not only has the author avoided as much technical babble he has included a 'magic decoder ring' at the end of every chapter to explain exactly what he means with some of the more confusing terms for the beginner.What really sets this book apart is though it's simple to read as common english, it teaches the reader about the tools, their functions AND some great techniques on how to use them in nearly any given situation.Filled with great tips, tricks and FULLY COLOURED pages though the whole book, I couldn't think of a bad point the book has (other than it not being coffee stain proof). The CD on the other hand... Could use a little more usefull stuff instead of demo filters and a trial version of photoshop.

The adobe user guide, adobe classroom in a book, and adobe photoshop studio techniques. Out of all these books, the photoshop studio techniques is above all the best. Ben Willmore puts you at ease and provides humor throughout the book. He relates the unusual and hard stuff about photoshop in lamen terms that anybody can understand. I now understand layers, shadows, drop shadows, color correction, RGB, CMYK, GRC, Levels, Curves, Channels, getting rid of color casts, and understanding what the differences between &quot;ppi&quot; and &quot;dpi&quot; are. He provides an excellenct theory behind the things he is going to explain. So you have the best of both worlds. Adobe has done an excellent job in finding someone that can write a book about photoshop 5.0 and relate it to the general public. Do not buy books on photoshop, just buy this one and you will become a master in short of amount of time. It is too bad they cannot do this for Illustrator and GoLive by Adobe."},{"Title":"Official Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 5.0 Studio Techniques","review":"After much debate at a local bookstore I finally desided to buy this book, based largely on the chapter dealing with text effects. Soon after reading it while in Photoshop I soon discovered that I was reading a fantastic book. Very presice in its explanations and very to the point without what Ben calls &quot;Techno Mumbo Jumbo&quot;. While reading any book I often &quot;tab&quot; important pages, I had to stop doing that with this book, I found myself tabing every page!!!.

I've been using Photoshop to do photo imaging, greeting card, enhancing or fixing damaged photos, etc. and thought I knew enough about these subjects.Willmore's book taught me more things that I never really knew or understood and I can now work more efficiently."},{"Title":"Official Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 5.0 Studio Techniques","review":"This book is not disappointing. It is not the &quot;greatest ever&quot; by no means either. It is written in a nice, down-to-earth manner, which will make beginners at ease.I do have to confess that I didn't install the accompanying CD, so I can't say anything good or bad about it. The good points of the book are that it does teach some very useful tricks. (His chapter on shadows and text effects is almost worth the money alone). For the people who intend to go into graphic design and are going to use Photoshop relatively frequently, the chapter on Selection tools is a must, because these are one of the most used features of the program, and he did a great job of covering them. The book is fairly priced too and you will get your money's worth. I'd say buy it, the book is adequate but it shouldn't be the one and only book that you have for Photoshop (if you make a living with the program, that is)."},{"Title":"Official Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 5.0 Studio Techniques","review":"This is the first Photoshop book that instead of just giving you examples of features actually tells why and how the most important features work. The first part of the book deals with all the Photoshop tools, the book really details the tools and gives the reader a good overview of the tools along with some great tips. The book then digs into some of the best yet hard to master filters, levels and curves. These are the meat of Photoshop and once you've read about these you'll have a great understanding of these tools. For me just learning more about these tools was worth the price of the book. The book travels along and takes you through color correction and channels. It then gets fun with creative exporations.Covering such things as shadows, blending images,and more filters. It ends up with using the type tools and many other effects. I really enjoyed the book and once I got started I couldn't put it down. This a such a great book for anyone who really wants to understand more about Photoshop. Great job Ben!"},{"Title":"Official Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 5.0 Studio Techniques","review":"Ben Willmore explains the principles and theory of why Photoshop works. His work is concise, quick to the point, very informative and fun to read. It's a medium sized book, but packed with all the information you'd find in all of those 3 inch thick books put together.If I only bought one Photoshop book, this would be the one. The first section 'Working Foundations' is like a Photoshop 101 class. It gives you the basics of Photoshop (and in a very fun and easy way, too!). I found lots of great tips to speed up my work! The second section, 'Production Essentials' covers the most important stuff for a working studio or graphic business. This is the topic that often gets skipped in other Photoshop books. Willmore covers the principles behind color correction, sharpening, curves, working with grayscale, and other techniques neccessary for producing professional output. The third section, 'Creative Explorations' goes into different techniques for enhancing your image. It covers image blending, retouching, using type and other filter effects.Occassional Photoshop users will find everything they need in this book.

I only had a foggy notion of what could be done with the various filters, but not specific applications.Ben's book teaches all of this and more in a friendly, fun, effective presentation that begs you to read on and discover more.

Author Carl Van Doren presents a rich and detailed portrait of Franklin - printer, writer, philosopher, scientist, inventor, politician, statesman, and one of the founding fathers of the United States of America.By tracing the major influences on Franklin, and the key events of his life, Van Doren presents this self-educated genius as the apotheosis of the 18th century &quot;Enlightened&quot; man. Imbued with an insatiable intellectual appetite, a keen scientific mind, a high sense of morality, and a fervent patriotism, he was shrewd, wise, witty, and always confident in his own limitless abilities. The author describes in detail the great events of Franklin's life - his youth and young adulthood as a printer and writer of Poor Richard's Almamack; the philosopher, scientist and inventor of note; Postmaster General for Pennsylvania, and later for all the colonies; representative of the American colonies to Great Britain at the time of the American Revolution; signer of the Declaration of Independence; U.S. Ambassador to France after the Revolution; and signer of the U.S. Constitution.As good a biography as this is, &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; is also outstanding history. Van Doren skillfully &quot;paints&quot; Franklin's portrait against the backdrop of the tremendous social ferment, scientific awakening, and tumultuous political events which occurred during the second half of the 18th century. I gained not only a fuller understanding of Franklin's life and great genius, but also a greater appreciation of the times in which he lived.&quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; is written with grace, clarity and obviously great scholarship. Winner of the 1959 Pulitzer Prize for biography, it is a brilliant masterpiece - one of the best biographies of any person I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"My summer project was to read biographies of our Founding Fathers. I was not looking forward to this rather daunting book and have never been so completely turned around on a subject. Van Doren masterfully handles an immense amount of factual information in such a way that makes this biography read like a novel. I love Ben Franklin! Thank you Carl Van Doren."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"Van Doren's biography of Franklin is nothing short of remarkable. While the author may be faulted for the near veneration of his subject, Franklin's continuing reputation supports the author's obvious admiration of Franklin. Franklin's life is reviewed from start to finish almost as a metaphor for the 18th Century enlightenment, the early colonlial life in America, the beginnings of the industrial revolution, the decadence and decline of British Imperialism, as well as the making and maturation of a true genius and renaissance man. Parallel with the swiftly changing account of the myriad activities of Franklin is the story of a truly fine human being; a man whose essentially humble and self deprecating nature belied his strength of character and integrity. Anyone who reads this book will come away awed by this unique individual and the question: Where are the Franklins of our time?"},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"1991 Penguin Books reissue of 1st edition (1938), 862 pages (of which 782 pages form the main body of the book).I read this book because of Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's partner). Benjamin Franklin is the man Charlie Munger admires and has attempted to emulate most. Franklin's autobiography was one of the twenty books Munger recommended at the back of the second edition of Poor Charlie's Almanack (the most useful book I have read). After reading Franklin's autobiography I was very interested to learn more about him - which I'm sure was Munger's intention. Thus I was led to this biography (one of two on Franklin that Munger has recommended), which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1939. I chose to read Van Doren's before Walter Issacson's newer \`Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,' as I liked the idea of being able to see what new material might have been discovered since 1938.With each of the large biographies I have read over the last year, I have found it has taken quite a lot of reading before I really got into the book. This one was no different. It was only when I was about half way through, reading about Franklin's activities dealing with the appalling British government/monarchy in the run up to the American War of Independence, that I found myself gripped. That may have something to do with me having already read Franklin's autobiography, which was the main source for the early part of Van Doren's book (as the author said: \`Plenty of other men could find materials for the story of his latest years. Only he had known about his obscure youth...').I suspect another significant reason was that up until roughly that point there was very little information on what Franklin was actually like and how he spent his days (as opposed to things he had done or places he had been). Without this information I find it difficult to mentally associate or connect with the subject. This is one of the two key areas of weakness I identified in Van Doren's otherwise admirable book and is also the reason why I preferred Ron Chernow's biography of Rockefeller, Titan to Joseph Frazier Wall's biography of Andrew Carnegie. From about halfway through Van Doren's book we do get very interesting snippets, from Franklin himself and also from other people, about what Franklin was actually like (on pages 405, 419, 521, 600 & 649/650, in particular). I wish there was more, but perhaps the material was simply unavailable.The second weakness was in the account of Franklin's finances. Franklin became quite wealthy through his printing activities before he left business and went to Britain. At sixty years of age, after many years of easy living and generosity, he found himself with money worries. His most important business partnership ended in 1766, depriving Franklin of a significant proportion of his income. He was also concerned that he might lose his position at the post office around the same time. Though this did not happen and he was actually appointed as agent to three further states, I was rather surprised that Franklin left a significant financial legacy when he was close to being hard up a little over twenty years before his death.He did not appear to live frugally for the latter part of his life and so I am not sure where the funds came from. I would much have preferred it if this apparent paradox had been resolved. It seems of particular importance here, as Franklin was a man who preached the gospel of frugality, but also said: \`frugality was \\"a virtue I never could acquire in myself.\\"'I suspect that Van Doren was correct when he said of Franklin: \`That he talked about them [industry and frugality] so much made it clear that they came less from his nature than from his discipline.' So, after frugality had served its purpose he perhaps left it behind (though long held habits almost always leave a residue).With those caveats, Van Doren's biography of Franklin is an impressive piece of work. I am not surprised that \`The final writing of the book called for almost daily use of the New York Public Library over a period of two years.' And that \`This book, full as it is, is a biography cut with hard labour to the bone.' The difficulty (as well as the interest) in writing a biography of a truly extraordinary man like Franklin was that he was extraordinary in many different areas. He was a successful businessman, an absolutely pre-eminent scientist and philosopher, as well as a remarkable and successful statesman (and that in a place and era when rank by birth was of paramount importance).I am not paid for them and so write these book reviews primarily for myself. I thus like to include the most important things I have learned and that I wish to retain and include into my life and conduct. In this case - because of the subject - there are far too many to include here. And that is surely the reason why Franklin is Munger's biggest hero: he was not only successful but he was also wise, generous and benevolent with it. Unlike Rockefeller, for example, he seemed to really enjoy his life. And unlike Carnegie, who appeared to fail Solon's warning (I might rather call it Taleb's warning, as that is where I learned it) to Croesus to call no man happy until he is dead.I do not wish to be happy because I have a distorted view of reality, but because I have seen the world as it is and can accept it. Franklin's life is thus a message of hope: he saw the world with exceptional clarity and was able to love it anyway."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"Van Doren's biography, long the definitive biography of Franklin, is rich in detail (sometimes exhaustingly so), yet accurately portrays the life of this fascinating multi-faceted man. From the statesman's humble beginnings in Boston, to his journeys to Philadelphia and ultimately abroad, Franklin is seen in very human terms, yet within the rich tapestry of the historical period.The author's style is typical of many historians of the 1930's, very linear, precise and detailed with a wealth of background information on every facet of Franklin's life. This may be a difficulty for many readers; the book is so comprehensive that many will be put off by its sheer volume. I found myself reading the book in starts and stops, only because of my personal time limitations. After the first 400+ pages, I found myself skipping over sections to get to portions of Franklin's life I found more fascinating. Fortunately, Van Doren's writing is such that one can do this without any significant loss of continuity."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"This remarkable, scholarly, and readable book brings the reader face-to-face with what seems an impossible life. The usual picture we get in school is intriguing, but here we meet a man whose range is staggering. Franklin the young, self-educated adventurer, writer, apprentice. Franklin the printer, entrepreneur, community activist. Franklin the pioneering scientist, delegate, historical visionary. Franklin the publisher, the spy, the sometimes invisible hand steering the birth of the modern republic. The inventor of a musical instrument that Mozart and others composed for. The outrageous wit who shocked Abigail and John Adams. Franklin the friend, free-thinker, and moralist. Creator of the stove, the lightning rod, the watertight compartment for ships' hulls. The first to understand how weather systems move, and ocean currents, and continents. Designer of roadways to connect the colonies and then the nation. Richly incorporating excerpts of Franklin's own voluminous writing, Van Doren's account is clearly factual, yet appropriately awed and inspired by a man \\"unsurpassed . . . in the range of his gifts or the important uses to which he put them.\\""},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"Sure, this book was written before my parents were born, but it seems to stand the test of time very well. If I hadn't checked the copyright date when I bought it, I might have thought this worek had been published only recently. The detailed information the author provides is fascinating and is presented in such a way that it avoids clouding the writing or boring the reader. One gets a feel not only for what Franklin did, but for what sort of man he was. The author is sympathetic to the object of his study, but not to the point where it becomes distracting. All in all, a wonderful read which contains an immense amount of fascinating information."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"I'm a big Van Doren Bio fan, and a bigger Ben Franklin fan. Carl captures the essence of the scoundrel Franklin. This is a bigger than life, juicy life. I almost don't recognize the Ben I learned about in school. The dried up old husk of a man who was part of that long ago effort to free our nation. Read this and laugh at the ways Franklin manipulated and succeeded against many odds."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"After reading &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;, he would be the one person -- dead or living -- who would make the most fascinating dinner guest for an evening. His list of accomplishments is practically endless: printer, writer, philosopher, postmaster general, inventor, scientist, diplomat, statesman, traveler, and conversationalist. The majority of people who are ultimately successful have a key talent in one area, focus on that talent, and rise to the top. It is so inexplicably rare to find someone of such vast talent who also excels in all his (her) talents. Benjamin Franklin was such a gifted individual and, thankfully for our nation, focused much of his energy and time into serving the public. Carl Van Doren has written an incredibly well-researched biography of one of our key founding fathers. Van Doren's style can sometimes be dry and too academic, but keep in mind that this book was initially published in 1938. Today's reader may expect a more conversational tone and faster moving story. However, Carl Van Doren's biography is heroic in its effort and the author's admiration clearly shines through for Mr. Franklin."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"With this hefty tome, Carl Van Doren succeeds in authoring a compelling biography equal to the intellectual scope and achievement of his subject, Benjamin Franklin. The title 'renaissance man' was perhaps never more aptly bestowed than on Franklin, whose pursuits ranged from printing to (most famously) electricity to temperature patterns and ocean currents to politics.Following the sweep of Franklin's advancing renown, first in the United States and then in Europe, the narrative never descends to a mere recounting of the man's many achievements (though this would undoubtedly make for fascinating reading in its own right). Rather, Van Doren devotes substantial attention to the greater social context in which Franklin works; in particular, the thread of family life in Philadelphia and later in France helps to anchor the broadening pace of his scientific and political thought, culminating in the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the establishment of republican government in America.Fittingly, the treatment of Franklin's death sounds only the faintest of elegiac tones. Van Doren recognizes the triumph of Franklin's life in the contributions to science, philosophy, and politics that would long outlive the man himself.A must-read."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"In my many years studying the history of our great nation and others, a carelessness of sorts followed my endeavors on Benjamin Franklin. As I finally considered closely examining the great philosopher/politician's life and accomplishments, I set out to find something written from a point of view somewhat unbiased yet informative. Carl Van Doren's accomplishments here should be considered in a manner befitting high esteem by any colleague serious enough to take the time out to comprehend his work. The facts of Franklin's life are grounded in traceable formatting, generously unbound with a sense of Mr. Van Doren's recurrent commitment to uphold a standard sometimes arguably overlooked by today's historians. Although I would have enjoyed added information on Franklin's later Constitutional convention involvement, enough was presented to obtain the idea of his role in shaping our important beginning. You will not be disappointed if you were to add this fine book to your collection."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"I read Franklin's Autobiography years ago and loved every word. Now my interest led me to Van Doren's work and a truely wonderful book. Filled with Franklin's whitty quotes and substantive research, Van Doren gives you a great book packed full of interesting facts and a great view of history. It is a very long book, as the preface tells you in its first line, but a page turner which reads quickly and envelopes you into Franklin's life. One of my favorite biographies I have ever read."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"As I get around to it I read Pulitzer Prize winners and when I came across this one I decided to read it, tho Franklin did not seem too interesting to me when I first learned about him in 4th grade.

He was a great man, and the most famous American of his time."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin (Compass books)","review":"I have not read Cabel's bio from 1918 on Franklin but this one by Carl van Doren might be the best. I tend to discount autobiographies as they tend to be highly partisan & even revisionist. The version Franklin's autobiography I read, & there seems to be dozens of them, was fairly modest.This is a whole life biography & is taken in large part from Franklin's own writings, letters to from & about Franklin. The unabridged audio version was a real treat & the amount of research must have been staggering, considering it was written in the thirties.This is a very through book. Where it treads lightly, whole books have been written. That is Franklin's lovers & the numerous children from these liasons, mostly in France. Mr. Van Doren is skeptical, keeping in mind when this book was written. Franklin loved woman & woman loved him but not nessarily in that way. He had many friends & \\"daughters\\" refering to his many, young female admirers. He keeps the wise grandfatherly image I had of him. In fact he was a neglectful husband & an absentee father to his own daughter deserting his wife during all those years overseas.There is so much to him, a true citizen of the world. He was a self-made wealthy merchant, inventor, scientist, philospher & statesman. The title he was most proud was master printer, an individual who started from nothing. He had many roles in life & van Doren covers them all.His most important years were spent in England & France. He loved London & Paris. He may have been tempted but he was always loyal to America, keeping her interest in mind. He was the face of America in Europe. He played the part expected of him; a rustic American philospher with a fur hat & was all the rage in the royal court of France.The colonies were fortunate to have Franklin in England before the revolution & France during & after. That is where with, Franklin's connivance, the major decisions concerning America were being made.His accomplishments ranged over various disiplines, as the inventor of the lightening rod, the Franklin stove used for heating, bifocals etc. He founded the first public library & fire department in America. He was the major contributor to the Albany Plan of Union in 1754. A document way ahead of its time, was a useful reference during the constitutional convention in 1789. He assisted Thomas Jefferson with key phrases in the Declaration of Independence. He was important in reaching consensus when the U.S. Consititution was being drafted.Had he stayed in Philadelphia, he may simply have remained a popular, loyal, prosperous printer & businessmen. He saw first hand the disdain King George III had for him & the colonies. To him America was merely a source of taxes without the rights accorded to all free Englishmen. This & the humiliation he suffered at the hands of British Parliment, turned him into a uncompromising (for one of the few times in his life) rebel. With his patience, gentle diplomacy, wisdom & sense of fairness, America was well served. With apologies to Washington who never left North America & Jefferson, Franklin may be the greatest founding father.While writing this review it occured to me that there are many similarities to Winston Churchill. Franklin was not a warrior as Churchill was but both men were visionaries & peace makers. Both were geniuses & prolific writers on any number of subjects. They were both statesmen & active in public service to a very old age. Both men dominated the times they lived in.Read or listen to this fine book, then move on to other newer biographies.

Bell. I read and reread these books as a teen, and found them very appealing. The central characters were strong girls/young women, who were growing up in the wilds on coastal islands of the Pacific Northwest in the late 1800's. Ms. Bell wrote both from the point of view of a young white girl, and from the Native American/First Nations perspective as well. I would love to see these books become available again, so newer generations of young women could read about the pioneering spirit of 100 plus years ago.I wish that my daughter had had the opportunity to read these books, but they had disappeared from library shelves by the time she would have found them interesting."},{"Title":"Daughter of Wolf House","review":"This was a great favorite of mine growing up as a kid.

She loved it, too and wants me to find other Margaret E. Bell books. What a writer! She pulls you in to empathize with the character, and makes a child realize how big the world really is, and what these people went through. It made me want to be strong and adventuresome when I was a kid! So worth reading.....even as an adult!"},{"Title":"More Bread Machine Magic : More Than 140 New Recipes From the Authors of Bread Machine Magic for Use in All Types of Sizes of Bread Machines","review":"Somebody wondered what the magic was in this book--well, I bought a Cuisinart convection bread machine and was terribly disappointed with the recipes from the accompanying booklet. Half the time I opened the lid to see an unmixed, hardened mess. Then I read customer reviews and people recommended getting another recipe book as the Cuisinart one was off in many of the proportions. I got Bread Machine Magic, and relatively speaking, it is.

Truly, what is the use of buying a recipe book if you might only be able to use a third or less of the recipes and very likely the ones you bought the book for you can't even use?What also is very pleasing is that there is hardly any call for dry milk powder in these recipes and they use standard ordinary dry yeast"},{"Title":"More Bread Machine Magic : More Than 140 New Recipes From the Authors of Bread Machine Magic for Use in All Types of Sizes of Bread Machines","review":"The recipies gave ranges for liquid and recommended that you check your dough and add more os whatever in order to make the recipe work.

That might suggest to you that I approve of the authors. In particular, I approve of the fact that they tested each recipe on a variety of different machines so that they could find out if there was a problem in some machine, and the recipe needed to be modified for that machine.I haven't had this one long; I can tell because it doesn't have more paperclips bristling than a porcupine has quills. Any cookbook I like and use very long is full of paperclips, because in a certain mood I sit and read cookbooks as I would novels, and paperclip each recipe I want to try. But don't take that to mean that I haven't tried any recipes out from this book; I have. But when I look up a recipe in the index, I don't paperclip it; I just set it in the cookbook holder with the pages open to what I want to try next.What I wanted to try next was a delicious tomato bread that included 3/4 of a cup of tomato paste in a two-pound loaf of bread, along with a variety of open spices. Then I forgot to put the book away immediately, and it was still in the cookbook rack when I went to get it to write this review. The bread is yummy, especially with my homemade pimiento cheese spread made of grated Cheddar (4 pressed-down cups), two 4-ounce containers of diced pimientos [undrained] and as much mayonnaise as it takes to mix it together well enough that it won't fall apart on the bread).The tomato bread, unlike one I tried last week from a different cookbook which included only a small amount of sun-dried tomatoes and had no tomato taste whatever, was tender-so tender I have to cut the topless sandwich in quarters so it won't fall apart, even if I toast it, as I sometimes do. There are many other recipes I intend to try soon, even if I have to give them away because my husband can eat only so much bread and no more.This book is just what I expect from these writers--thorough and succinct, with no wasted words and no instructions omitted, so that either a novice baker with her first bread machine or a highly experienced veteran baker will find the recipes equally easy to follow. What a way for a novice to build confidence! Even a veteran will be pleased to offer some of this bread to special guests--but I reserve it for special guests. Our computer techie, who was here when I got it out of the oven, is also a close friend of both my husband and me and a much better cook than I will ever be, took three slices home with him. I wouldn't have cut the loaf that soon after taking for very many people.I highly recommend this book, and now I am going to go over and The Bread Machine Magic Book of Helpful Hints.

I stuck it in the oven on my pizza stone and was rewarded with the most incredible tasty loaf of bread I ever ate anywhere. I am particularly anxious to delve into the Savory Bread section that this recipe came from. There is an interesting \\"pizza loaf\\" which incorporates the ingredients of a pizza into a bread loaf and the same for a breakfast loaf with bacon, eggs and cheese incorporated in the loaf that sounds good too. There are really many recipes here which are mouth watering to read and pique the mind to sample.I can't wait to get through them all. The book is great to explore for those bored with standard recipes for their machines. You will find new and exciting avenues to explore and play variations on.

So, it was a little disappointing!"},{"Title":"More Bread Machine Magic : More Than 140 New Recipes From the Authors of Bread Machine Magic for Use in All Types of Sizes of Bread Machines","review":"I love my bread machine and have enjoyed using it for several years without a cookbook, but when Cook's Illustrated, which is generally scornful of breadmakers, recommended Lois Conway, I decided to pick up this book and the duo's earlier &quot;Bread Machine Magic.&quot; Though I found four or five recipes in &quot;Bread Machine Magic&quot; that I will continue to make, a publishing date of 1992 means that earlier work is seriously outdated. (One of many drawbacks is that 2 lb. recipes are nonexistent, as 2 lb. machines didn't exist when that book was written, plus lots of model-specific advice is given for models that no longer exist.) &quot;More Bread Machine Magic,&quot; published in 1999, remedies that somewhat by steering clear of maker-specific information and adding 2 lb. versions to every recipe. There are a lot of interesting recipes in here and the few I've tried have turned out fairly well, but I can't say that this book breaks too much new ground. If you already like and use your bread machine frequently, you probably already have a lot of these recipes (and the ones you don't, you might not want). But, if you're looking to add usefulness to a bread machine that's just gathering dust on your countertop, this volume will probably provide a lot of new ideas for you. I would warn though, that most (all?) of the best recipes in this book are &quot;dough,&quot; recipes, i.e. not cooked in the machine. Conway and her partner have gone the route of most &quot;serious&quot; cooks and turned their machines into kneading and proofing boxes, instead of all-in-one ovens. That doesn't make these recipes bad--in fact I think that mixing and kneading is a great use for a bread machine--I just wanted to warn those who want to throw some ingredients in a machine, walk away and return to hot, baked bread that this book might not be for you."},{"Title":"More Bread Machine Magic : More Than 140 New Recipes From the Authors of Bread Machine Magic for Use in All Types of Sizes of Bread Machines","review":"I started out with the first book, Bread Machine Magic and, great as it was, I just couldn't pass up another book by this wonderful author. As someone who uses a bread machine on a daily basis, I welcome new ideas and recipes and this book truly has it all. One of the best things about it (other than all the delicious recipes, of course) is the fact that the recipes are adaptable for all types and sizes of machines. If you own a bread machine, this book is an absolute must have.

Now, we go though a loaf almost every day.The 'tip' section is a great feature and so is the 'sources' section but, I think two of the best features are the wide variety of recipe types and the fact that the recipes are all given in three sizes, 1lb, 1 1/2lb and 2lb. Being able to make a small loaf makes it easier to have fresh bread every day without wasting any, especially if you have a small family.This book definately has something for everyone and is a must for all bread machine owners!"},{"Title":"More Bread Machine Magic : More Than 140 New Recipes From the Authors of Bread Machine Magic for Use in All Types of Sizes of Bread Machines","review":"I purchased this book because I recently decided to start using my dormant 7-year-old Breadman breadmaker again.

I was not disappointed. Almost every recipe I've tried has been a winner, save for one (Rum Raisin Almond Bread) that has consistently turned out like a brick. I've tried the recipe twice with the same result. The best thing? My recourse is to e-mail the authors directly and ask for some guidance. They have a web site where you can contact them and get other information pertaining to their books. So far, this is the only breadmaker cookbook I can truly recommend.

Each recipe has come out just right, and each one lists ingredients for either a small, medium or large loaf.

We feed our bodies at least an hour or more every day, but what do we do to feed our souls? I read at least an hour or more every day from the Bible and a half dozen other spiritual writings. While this book pales in comparison to other books I'm reading, for its genre--meditative quotes for each day of the year--it's the best in my opinion. The insightful quotes are concise and deep, and makes you think. It's perfect for people who make little time during the day to feed their souls--and in a case like that, any food to a starving soul is good food. And in my opinion this is the best \\"fast food for the soul\\" I've personally come across. And as St. Augustine is one of the saints whom most Christian denominations respect, I've given this as a gift to many of my Protestant friends. Everyone I've given this too has enjoyed it. I highly recommend this book.

The outcome of the war was not at all clear. African-Americans were enlisting in the armed forces to join the fight. At that time they could serve only in segregated units, and they knew their unequal treatment, even in uniform, did not match the high-minded ideals proclaimed by America's leaders. Hughes' response was to celebrate the community, the dream, and the unity of America in this striking poem.Community and dream were consistent themes in Langston Hughes' poetry, though different poems expressed them at different times, in different voices, and with different moods. Scholars are still mining Hughes' poems to grasp everything he meant whenever he wrote the word \\"dream,\\" for instance. Of course, Dr. Martin Luther King (who was 14 at the time \\"Freedom's Plow\\" was published) used \\"I Have a Dream\\" for his great 1963 appeal to all Americans at the Lincoln Memorial. Both Hughes and King looked for Americans to make a society united around a full realization of the nation's founding ideals -- to make good on the promise of the Declaration that all men are created equal.When you read this poem, remember it was written in 1943, when fascism and its murderous racism stalked the world. In the 21st century, many people, to use the poem's words, now own freedom, brotherhood, and democracy. But at the time, many nations were conquered while others still yearned for independence. Langston Hughes called America -- a flawed America, yes -- to rally around its ideals, the dream. In another two decades, Dr. King would do the same.-30-"},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"The main charcters in this book are Lysander,Titania,Helena,Bottom,Puck and Oberon.You can tell that those names come from a book.Well their are two couples and one of them which is Lysander and Titania are having some problems.Titanias father doesn't want her to marry the man that she really wants to marry or the man that she really loves.So Titanias and Lysander plan to run away so that Titania won't have to marry someone that she doesn't love.Also someone in the book turns into a donkey.I would tell pepople to read this book because ,its interesting and has alot of pictureds.If you like funny stuff or weird stuff that happens in books then this is the book for you.The book is a easy book ,to take a test on also.If you like some weird love stories then this is a good book.Its also a short book.Some pretty strange charcters in this book.If I was gonna start all over again I wouldn't read this book becauseof?Its not something that you wanna keep reading.It doesn't have people that you can actually belive in.Somethings that happen in the book are unusual and probly won't ever happen in life ."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"I'm surprised that none of the reviews I've read (I didn't read them all, but about 25) even mention the pictures in this wonderful edition by Bruce Coville. I've read the play and adore it, seen it several times, etc. But the reason one would buy this book rather than Shakespeare's words is for the clear, modern English storytelling and the gorgeous images. This is a wonderful book to introduce Shakespeare to anyone. I personally love the poetry of Shakespeare's lines but know that they are difficult for children and Shakspeare newbies. This book tells the story in clear words and great pictures, full of classical fairies and beautiful maidens and valorous youths (plus some great facial expressions on Bottom). Worth every penny."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"Be warned, if you're looking for the original text of Shakespeare's play, this is not it - this is a retelling of the play by Bruce Coville in the attempt to introduce younger readers to the realm of Shakespeare.In attempting that, he succeeds very well in bringing the text to a new format - all the components of the tale are here (though obviously abridged), and are clearly and smoothly told, keeping most of the spirit of the play, as well as the most important of quotes, for instance - \\"The course of true love never did run smooth,\\" and \\"What fools these mortals be\\".Three plot threads run throughout the story set in ancient Athens under the rule of the Duke Theseus about to be wed to his own Amazon-bride. Foremost is the love-tangle between the virtually indistinguishable Helena, Lysander, Hermia and Demetrius. When Hermia and Demetrius decide to elope, racing away into the woods, Lynsander follows (who has been promised Hermia by her father), and chasing after him is the spurned Helena, desparately (and pathetically) in love with him.Meanwhile, the King and Queen of Fairies, Oberon and Titania are having what can only be called a domestic over a young changeling boy that Oberon wants to join his service, but who Titania is determined to keep in remembrance of his mother, her devoted friend. To punish his Queen, Oberon sends his servent, the hobgoblin Puck, to fetch a flower capable of making anyone under its spell fall in love with whatever creature they behold.Finally, the group of players led by Peter Quince and joined by Francis Flute and the famous Nick Bottom journey into the forest to practice their play to perform on the Duke's wedding day, and fall the victims of Puck's prankish nature, when he transforms the head of Bottom into that of an ass. Of course, it is he that Titania first spies when she awakens from her slumber...It is a complicated and intricate play, full of mayhem and havoc in which everybody falls in love with everybody else, but Coville handles it well and keeps it simple to the point of abridging much of the final act in which Bottom and the players finally get to perform. However, such a scene is somewhat un-neccessary in the \\"storybook\\" context of this retelling, and its removal was probably a good idea. The themes of wayward love and its fickleness is still in place, whether it be the mis-matching of the young lovers, the quarrels between husband and wife, or the ridiculousness of the romantic, suicidal couple that the actors play \\"Pyramus and Thisby\\" (on which Shakespeare based \\"Romeo and Juliet\\").The illustrations fit the story well. Though some might hope for intricate, highly detailed work that we usually see in fairy-books these days (such as the work of Brian Froud or K. Y. Craft), here the watercolours are in soft pastels, very clearly and simply planned and rendered. To help the reader along, there is an introductory page of the main character's busts, and the four lovers can be easily identified by their colour-coding (just remember - the blonde girl goes with the blonde boy and the dark-haired girl goes with the dark-haired boy). Bottom is hilarious with or without his ass-head, and you can tell just from his expression that he's a complete buffon.Most of the fairies are as they are usually portrayed - small, winged, barefooted and delicate, but their impish faces and spindly bodies save them from appearing as those silly, cute, adorable little fairies that you might expect in Enid Blyton. To my mind, fairies must have a little of the mysterious and potential for malevolence about them. The potrayal of Oberon and Titania is somewhat odd - Titania appears as a full grown woman (though in a couple of pictures horribly stick-like, almost anorexic) but Oberon seems almost child-like, as if he's a boy in an over-sized sheet. Like the four lovers, many of the characters are portrayed as incredibly young, a theme that runs through into Puck.It is Puck who is the centrepiece of this retelling, both in the narrative and in the pictures. With tangled hair and a fuzzy loincloth, the cheeky toddler whizzes about the air, sometimes the very picture of innocence, other times with a devilish grin. He can't help but make you smile when you see him.Altogether, a good start to introduce young readers to the play, with nice clear pictures just this side of an art and/or fairy-lovers collection."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"Most adults who read this know the basic story of the book: how King Oberon schemes to use magical lust to solve a dispute between himself and his bride Titania and how Puck, the sprite entrusted to carry out the scheme, manages to entangle four mortal lovers into the mix and nearly ruins everything. It is this scheming between Puck and Oberon that presents the main source of humor in the story; when you see two hapless men professing love to the same baffled woman and two women fighting like cats over men, you can't help but grin at the mayhem the now exasperated Oberon has caused.However, I was never quite able to completely enjoy the humor that occured at the expense of Titania and the mortals. Call me old-fashioned, but I personally can't have a good laugh at the idea of using others like puppets in a play and my main concern here is whether all the humor in this story is appropriate for a child audience. Sure, Coville breaks down the adult dialogue, but that's only part of it; some of the main characters in the story simply don't have very strong morals. King Oberon humiliates his wife, steals something from her, uses a form of mind control on her, manipulates the humans in the story like they're nothing, and never shows any regret or pause! In this version, he doesn't even express pity for Titania's condition like he did in the original tale; he just pulls her like a puppet until he gets what he wants, then grins and tells Puck to undo everything, which I found infuriating and unsatisfying. Is this really a good story for kids? They should know it's not nice to take advantage of people, play tricks on them, and all the other various things characters do to each other here with no consequences.I'm not a hater of this tale in general. I love the Rupert Everet version of the film, particularly because Oberon and even Puck show a trace of conscience while still retaining their typical mischievousness and Titania's actually treated like a fleshed out character instead of a cut-out made for Oberon's humor. I just wish Coville had treated Oberon and Puck like more than a plague visited on those they inflicted their tricks on. It's not an awful tale by any means, but I suggest reading with your kids.On to a positive note, though: the illustrations are absolutely lovely and perfectly faerie. In fact, this was the reason I got it. The fairies are gorgeous, the humans classical Roman beauties, and Puck an adorable child who bears a striking resemblance to Oberon. (This is a particularly interesting note, because Puck was actually acknowledged by one source of research as Oberon's son by a mortal woman. Apparently, Coville chose to acknowledge this.) As a lovely visual treat, this book is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"Beautifully illustrated--especially Puck and the fairies--and a nice introduction to Shakespeare. There are a few details in the story that are scary or sexist (capital punishment, inability to choose one's own husband) that have to be explained or elided by the reader, but you can't blame that on this edition of the story!"},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"I had my doubts about introducing Shakespeare to my 7 year old...until I got hold of Bruce Coville's book! My son loved the story and was really able to follow the complicated plots. He has a picture of each character at the beginning of the book for them to follow and we kept reviewing who was who and who liked who. Wonderful! He still likes to pull the book out and look at the beautiful pictures and review in his mind the story."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"My 5th grade students reading the original text of Romeo and Juliet love this book and the same author illustrator's version of that story for the simplicity of the language and for the phenomenal illustrations. The girls are especially interested, and wait for a turn to read the book.My own 4 and 5 year old children love the book, and ask to have it read to them every night at bedtime. They love fairies in general, and that was their original draw to the story (along with the amazing pictures). They now play \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" at playtime, and the 5 year old actually watched (and loved)a DVD of the original language production after several readings of this.I also highly recommend the same team's version of Romeo and Juiet for the same reasons, both 5th graders and preschoolers love them."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"I chose this book for my 10 year old as our nightly reading book one week. My 6 1/2 year old listened intently each night, not wanting me to put it down. It has fostered an interest for both of my children in reading more Shakespeare. I only wish there were more of his works translated like this as it was a wonderful experience to share such a great piece of literature. I would even be interested in reading many more Shakespearean works for myself in this format. Beautiful illustrations. Great gift for your local school."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"This book is a must-have for anyone who loves classic literature and wants to share it with their children. The pictures are gorgeous and the text is done in a way that the storyline is easy to follow, while still in a semblance of shakespearean style. This book contains no offensive material, but has all the mischief, folly and happy-endings that all good fairy tales have. It will make a wonderful addition to your library"},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"Bruce Coville does a masterly attempt at making A Midsummer Night's Dream comprehensible and more understandable for younger learners of Shakespeare. The illustrations are beautiful and really helps tell the story. I have to admit I'm still confused about all the details in the story but it helped a lot. The story is still pretty charming and romantic."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","review":"I wonder if &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; is Wild Bill's answer to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and works like it: instead of being passionate, life and death, as-important-as-the universe, here love and romance is light, frivolous, fickle and funny.Love is in the air; love is everywhere. But at the middle of it all are two women with frustratingly similar names: Helena and Hermia. Hermia loves Lysander but is engaged (by a controlling father) to Demetrius. Helena loves Demetrius, who can think of no one but Hermia. Until a fairy god and an impish spirit step in and sprinkle some love-juice around: suddenly it's all a mess, everyone switches partners like at a square dance. But, naturally, it all works out in the end, and two pairs of lovers emerge to live happily ever after.Two subplots add to the silliness of love: Titania, the fairy queen, under a spell sent by her husband, falls in love with a man with an donkey's head. (read: there is no objectivity in love, no &quot;ideal lover&quot;.) Then, a bunch of fools perform a hilaroiusly awful play for the king, a play about tragically separated and suicidal lovers...something like Romeo and Juliet. (read: tragedy and love together are hilariously overdramatic.)A enjoyable, funny, light, fairly fast play to read and perform. You gotta love Puck. The only real difficulty I had was keeping Helena and Hermia straight -- now, who loves who?And really, in the end, it doesn't matter who loves who, just that all are loved.Make sure you don't read one of those nasty prose or abridged versions here. Half the fun is the meter, and it's definitely short and sweet enough not to need abridgement.a passage from the play:PUCK: If we shadows have offended,Think but this, (and all is mended)That you have but slumbered here,While these visions did appear.And this weak and idle theme,No more yielding but a dream,Gentles, do not reprehend;If you pardon, we will mend.And, as I am an honest Puck,If we have unearned luck,Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,We will make amends, ere long:Else the Puck a liar call.So, good night unto you all.Give me your hands, if we be friends,And Robin will restore amends.&quot;"},{"Title":"Full House: The Definitive Guide for Successfully Promoting School and Community Theater","review":"I've promoted a number of theater events using this guide, and it works. A major benefit is that the author does not assume that you have a lot of money to spend. He creates a plan that delivers results but doesn't require a fortune."},{"Title":"Them","review":"... but I love this book. jules, maureen and loretta are the most foolish, pathetic and delusional narrarators that you will ever come across. almost every sentence is painful and will make you want to slap some sense into them. unfortunately, after a while you wind up thinking like them, and in the end you actually agree with their unsettling point of view. This book will haunt you.."},{"Title":"Them","review":"Before I read 'them' all that I had read by Mrs. Oates was 'We Were The Mulvaneys' which did not impress me all that much. Hearing all the hype about Oates being such a great writer, I thought that I should give her another chance. So I picked 'them' because it won the National Book Award.I was amazed. With this work Oates proves that her writing stands well next to works by Doestoevsky, Hesse, Mann and most other great writers. This is definetly one of the top ten books written in the twentieth century, and perhaps the best book written post-war twenteith century.Many times American's ask themselves, &quot;what does it really mean to be an American?&quot; One thing that this book does is answer that question in a very harsh way.Are the characters in this novel hero's, or are they villans? Are there any hero's in the world? What is a hero, is a hero defined by one act of goodness, or is a hero defined by an unatural perfection? All of these questions arise in your mind as you read this incredible thought provoking novel.The novel is very true to life, it is about a lower-class family in Detroit. Life for them is a struggle, a long obstacle leading to the comfort which is death.The book is not one that will lift your spirits; it is very depressing. But sometimes a book like this is nessesary.I highly reccomend buying the Modern Library Edition to anyone who is planning to buy the book. It is only a few dollars more and it has a lot to offer. It is the new revised edition and it has a very nice afterward by the authour. The Afterward is excellent! I'm not sure the Paperback edition has the extras that the Modern Library Edition has. But just buy the book in whatever edition.Now I will rate the book from a scale of A-F in some certain catagories as I do in my book reviews:Character Devolpment: APlot: B+Thought Provoking: A+Suspense: A-With an overall grade of an A, you can see that this has become one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Them","review":"Although this work shows Oates in surprisingly good early form, her sentences don't have the rich roll of her later work. I feel had she written the same plot today, she could have accomplished it in fewer pages with much richer language. Also some of the more squalid details she could have presented with less shock value (See &quot;because it is bitter...&quot; for a great example of what I mean). She wrote this when she was only 30 and it gives every indication of the master she was to become. In my opinion, Oates is the greatest living female novelist in English."},{"Title":"Them","review":"This book describes the state of American turmoil during the 1960's with vivid imagery. Being in my mid-twenties and not alive to experience the 1960's, I feel this book provides an important account of these times. I truly felt the eerie adrenaline-induced excitement of this tumultous period. Jules' character chilled me to the bone; his evil sexuality reminiscent of the character of Arnold Friend in 'Where are You Going, Where Have You Been?&quot; This is a beautifully written book, one of JCO's finest works to date."},{"Title":"Them","review":"I read this book many years ago and the memory of it is still with me. It is one of my top 10 favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Them","review":"I have talked in other reviews about books that haunted me for years and years. I decided with all of them, to get copies and find out why they still stayed in my mind. I was certainly on the right track with this one, which, as a prolific Oates reader, I rate as her best book.I first heard of Joyce Carol Oates in the early 1970s,, while at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. At that time, Oates was an English Professor at the University of Windsor, Ontario. Students were raving about her writing, and about THEM, in particular. So I bought it and read it to see what the excitement was all about. I have been reading Joyce Carol Oates ever since.Let me say that one has to have strong nerves to tackle her novels. In one, &#34;The Falls&#34; she begins with a suicide and it goes down hill from there. There are few redemptions - or odd redemptions in the ones there are - from this Gothic style novelist. She has been likened to Edgar Allen Poe in her scenarios of decay and doom and gloom. But Oates does it so well and her stories are firmly rooted in a hard-edged reality that it is worth the reading experience - if you prefer social reality to fantasy in novels.THEM is the best. It is set in Detroit for about 20 years up to the race riots in the late 60s. It is the story of a white family struggling against poverty and their efforts to get free of it. There is no miracle and many times, when they thought they were succeeding they would be shot down again - sometimes, literally.The book presents no miracles for success. It does show great effort in trying to live their day-to-day lives and, at the same time, try desperately, in their own ways, to overcome their harsh reality. At the end of the book, they are still striving. Do they succeed? Who knows? Oates doesn't present solutions. It is the trying that matters and what shapes a life.I have learned why this book stayed in my mind all those years. I was absolutely right to let it haunt me. Years later, I uderstand its depths better and am even more appreciative of it.This is her best book in my opinion. It did leave me with a feeling of deep sadness for the people who struggle so hard to win &#34;The American Dream&#34; and never seem quite to make it, after being slapped down by one thing or another, time after time.I thought, &#34;My God, why can't things be better for them?&#34; I can't answer that question. It's too complex. But as a professor of mine once said, &#34;There are no answers: only good questions.&#34;Joyce Carol Oates was born in Lockport, NY and her books are often set in the upper Great Lakes Region. I Know the area well since I was born in Canada just a few miles across the border from Buffalo, NY. It is somehow comforting to be in NJ and be able to read books set in the region you've known well since childhood. For me, this adds a depth to my reading.If you don't know the area, this would be a good time to read this book and learn some history of Detroit in its tumultous years.And it's always a good time to read Joyce Carol Oates."},{"Title":"Them","review":"Perhaps the greatest trick which Oates performs in Them is her ability to take emotions which human beings have been examining for centuries, like love, and pull them apart, elongate them to such an extent that they are barely recognizable from their pedestrian definitions. There is an excruciating, unrelenting quality to Them, and it is found in this inscrutable ability to take the banal and make it rich, painful, grotesque. This novel of great pain laid bare is not so much an exercise in exposing human universals, but showing how distressingly small human concerns are; in the great sweep of events little people remain little, no matter how large their emotions."},{"Title":"Them","review":"As writer Joyce Carol Oates states in the introduction of her \\"them\\", this book is \`the only kind of fiction that is real'. The gimmick in this book is that she tells the story as if it were reality. According to her early note, the narrative is based on some letters she received from a former student. This so-called student wasn't a good writer, but she thought her story worthy telling therefore her teacher assumed the task.The student is Maureen Wendal, one of \`them'. The narrative is about her and her mother, Loretta, and her older brother Jules. Oates follows a couple of years in the lives of these people. In their lives there are many ingredients that could turn the novel into a soap opera -- rape, love, lies, prostitution --, but this writer does not deals with the cheap prose. Her sentences are crafted, and her characters thoroughly developed, making all of them very real.Political and historic background lend the book more relevance. The famous Detroit riots in the middle 60's are part of these lives. Oates seems to be interested in the subtle relationship between reality and fiction. She borrows \`real' lives to construct fiction that has as basis real facts that change the lives of her characters.As she points out in her introduction, nothing in the novel was exaggerated in order to increase the drama. Not matter if her work is real or not -- this is not her point, after all -- the fact is that she wrote an incredibly good book populated with fictional characters that read like real. And this is more than any reader can long for."},{"Title":"Them","review":"I liked this story for two reasons. One, because I think that the people are very real. Despite the fact that so much of the plot seems far fetched the characters are always believable to me. Also, I think it is an important historical artifact which explores a period of time when the country was experiencing many changes. I was captivated by this book."},{"Title":"Them","review":"them, written at the beginning of Oates' illustrious career, remains as one of her finest, if not, her finest novel. Its a dark tale of love and passion that will keep you hooked until the very end. I guarantee you that, once you've read them, you'll start reading other works by Joyce Carol Oates."},{"Title":"Them","review":"This has to be by far the worst novel I have ever read. The plot drags to the point where I nearly ended up in catatonic state like Maureen in the novel. I grew up in a Midwest working class neighborhood, lived in the Detroit area and worked for an automaker. While much of Oates story rang true, too much of it did not. Others have praised her story telling, I don't see it and have not picked up another of her novels since."},{"Title":"Them","review":"Apathy is a weapon. Not speaking about their disappointments - as working class kids traditionally aren't supposed to do - make the two main characters of this story, Jules and Maureen, victims of silence and isolation. As Jules and Maureen grow up they learn to use apathy themselves as a weapon with which they can obliterate the outside world, disconnect themselves from a society they find ugly and incomprehensible. Alienation nearly kills them during their adolescence, a time in which Oates names them \\"Children of Silence,\\" when they're forced to conform and to submit to performing tedious, repetitious routines, taught to accept a supposedly concrete and unchangeable reality of poverty and inaccessible higher education.Apathy is a way to do away with an imposed reality. They use the same weapon that once was used on them, and they begin to understand why their parents avoided intimacy and emotional connection. Expressing feelings and the intimacy that thereby follows clears way for inner dreams to come into the open. And to share dreams is dangerous, because the world tears them down. It's because Maureen can't help but dream of a different life that she wants to die in the powerlessness and futility of it all. As Jules and Maureen themselves are betrayed and see what apathy can do to the hopeful, who wish nothing more than to have real, authentic love, they realize they aren't innocent themselves and have no one to blame. If no one taught them to be true to a higher ideal, if they have no moral imperative to live up to, then how can they expect the ones they love not to hurt them? And, as the weapon backfires on them, they realize that they too are guilty of victimization and that they have become as heartless as their parents.As they meet apathy now, young adults, Jules searching for guidance and rescue, Maureen seeking escape and refuge in passive serfdom of middle class life going nowhere fast, they struggle to cope with the silence and the void of feelings. Jules refuses to make this his inescapable destiny and becomes as lost and broken as his parents, while Maureen denounces and runs away from her family and past. She stares into a mirror and sees nothing staring back at her and knows what they have done to her and what she in turn will do to her children if she doesn't somehow break the destructive pattern.Jules and Maureen feel the pain of not having their expectations met and know that their suffering is real but don't know how to communicate it because of their parents and their own submission to silence. And so they pray for someone they can open up and be vulnerable to, someone to share their desires and dreams with. Their actions become the loud scream they have been keeping inside their whole lives. Too late they realize their actions are hurting those on the outside they've been reaching for their whole lives, though they never thought of those outside their shared history as anything but \\"them.\\" In the end they see that they are \\"them,\\" that they are the ones on the outside, because they have never connected with anyone, as their destuctive, isolated family and its history is all they've ever known."},{"Title":"Them","review":"When I read this book it takes a hold of me and doesn't let me go. I've read it twice and both times I couldn't put it down. Makes for late nights when I have to get up early for work the next morning, but well worth it. Joyce Carol Oates is my favorite author, everytime I pick up a new book of hers I'm so thankful that I found her. Her style of writting is a joy to read. The world of literature is a much better place with her in it."},{"Title":"Them","review":"The reviewers above miss a central point in this, her greatest novel. How can we give our individual lives and the society about us structure? Can we assume life has a strucutre that will make itself apparent to us in time? And what of the people who seek to destroy social order, who revel in chaos?"},{"Title":"Them","review":"I first read Them in the mid '80's and was drawn to read it again in the mid '90's.I have just read it again in the year 2002. I can't seem to forget these charactors.They haunt me.This is my all time favorite American novel and I would encourage everyone to read it at least once."},{"Title":"Them","review":"I was assigned to read this book for my English Honors class. It was very painful. I have never read anything by Oates before. It was very difficult for me to get through the book because she left so many things hanging. Something happens and then you find yourself in another setting and what happened back there. My English teacher felt it was worth reading."},{"Title":"Them","review":"This busted in half when I opened it! Wonderful novel, though. Wonderfully written novel, though. I bought a new one as to not read the busted in half one. I read all of the new one."},{"Title":"Them","review":"\\"Them\\" has an intriguing and even risky premise: Joyce Carol Oates, who was teaching literature at the University of Detroit in the 1960s, receives some rambling, emotionally revelatory letters from a former student and fashions a novel out of this poor girl's life story. The girl was not a good student--Oates had flunked her, and it's easy to see why if her epistolary manner indicates the quality of her literary essays. But the passion and the pain in her letters cry out for a story to be told, one that is probably more interesting than any that could have been furnished by a better, happier pupil.The girl is given the pseudonym of Maureen Wendall, and \\"Them\\" is the saga of her dysfunctional lower-class family from 1937 to about 1966. A laundry list of domestic turmoil--rape, murder, attempted murder, assault, accidental death--devastates the Wendalls as they migrate throughout the poor neighborhoods of Detroit, chasing solvency and dignity in vain. Her older brother Jules, a restless, rebellious spirit, can't stay away from bad influences or out of trouble, and her younger sister Betty is a mischievous tomboy whose delinquency seems to arise from familial neglect--they only take notice of her when she's doing something wrong, which of course is most of the time.Maureen herself is bright enough and behaves well; she likes to read and makes the public library her sanctuary, where in the permanence of the words of Jane Austen novels she finds a comforting reality lacking in the instability of her home life. Her innocence is destined to falter, however; as a teenager, she begins meeting an older man and accepts money for having sex with him. When her ogreish stepfather suspects her of misdeeds, he beats her severely, incapacitating her to a bedridden, emotionally withdrawn state for about a year.Jules, in the meantime, has quit school and begun living the life of a job-hopping, potentially dangerous drifter, part Frank Chambers, part Studs Lonigan, and (to be kind) a little part Tom Joad. He is hired as a chauffeur by a blundering rich (or once-rich) man named Bernard and through him meets his pretty niece, Nadine, a girl residing in an affluent suburb representing a world he has never before been able to attain. She runs away with him, and what happens to them on their cross-country journey and then afterward is too sad to be comical and yet too absurd to be tragic in the classical sense; too gross for the conventions of fiction, it could be expected to happen only in real life.Oates culminates this novel filled with various kinds of violence in a race riot, against the backdrop of which the ideological diatribes uttered by several characters newly introduced to the story, advocating large-scale social changes for the nation, seem oddly removed from the more private concerns of the Wendall family. But, after all, the Wendalls' privacy is impacted and influenced by the public force of human presence, the people we don't necessarily know: \\"them.\\" Much of the novel is uncomfortable to read, not so much with regard to the physical violence as when the characters use abusive language to hurt each other, but it resonates with a power and realism rarely seen in fiction."},{"Title":"Them","review":"This is one of Ms. Oates' earlier works set in Detroit.It is a book of excellence as one generation is rolled into the other. A very true to life book where as the characters advance in reaching their destiny however small, they are always setbacks and stumbling blocks, not allowing them to see the light at the end of the tunnel, reminding us of the pathways we've walked before and are forever walking in. This was a very emotional book for me with great depth to the story line.It is a long book and should be read with patience in order to get the gist of the Detroit the author penetrates in that century with it's poverty, racial and violent concerns. You won't forget Maureen Wendall who some will empathise with you see her desires and the things she yearns for with all her heart and soul.......and you won't forget her brother Jules either...intelligent and so very intricate you wonder what he is about to do next with that brain that never stops ticking. I cannot help saying what a brilliant writer I have found in Ms. Oates, and I encourage those who love her as much as I do to try THEM. I recommend it to all her favourite readers who haven't read this one as yet.Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 02/03/02)"},{"Title":"Them","review":"This book was somewhat of a struggle for me, though I am a giant Joyce Carol Oates fan. I thought it wasn't possible, but &quot;Them&quot; is more of a brooding, dark, and realistic novel than Oates has pulled off anywhere else in her career. Here is a lot of characters that are in constant danger of falling to pieces, of escaping one another, of realizing their limits as individuals and as a family unit. If you are not a reader who can take a kick in the stomach, don't read this book. However, if you are willing to realize there is a hard edge to life which goes unrecognized each day, pick this book up as soon as you can - Oates creates a world fatalism and human conditions that are at once terrifying, yet beautiful: it is hard to look away. I was held breathless and scared until the last word dropped like a boulder."},{"Title":"Them","review":"Them is a great book. Don't get my wrong. I enjoyed it very much and was fascinated by even the characters that didn't arouse much sympathy. But it also took me by surprise. As a fan of Joyce Carol Oates, this book was not what I expected. It's very down-to-earth without many of the gothic elements that can be found in her other novels, short stories, and plays. But that doesn't mean it isn't very dark in places as well. The story starts out in the early part of this century with Loretta - a teenage girl living in the inner city with her carousing brother and alcoholic, widower father. She is concerned mostly with having fun and meeting boys until her brother committs a murder that will change her life and the lives of her future family dramatically. The bulk of the story is centered around Loretta's son, Jules, who struggles with his family and the harsh environment of the city. The pace got a little slow in the middle, but it was appropriate for the lives of the characters. Real life doens't happen at a whirlwind pace for many, and one of the striking things about Them is how Oates captures the mundane nature of daily living even as life-changing events occur around the characters. So if you want to read Joyce Carol Oates save this book for another day and pick up Zombie or Foxfire instead. But come back to it"},{"Title":"Them","review":"Joyce Carol Oates is a novelist of the first order. Her novel of postwar Detroit (really of postwar America), Them, is her best. Nothing she has written, before or since (even including her newest, the fictionalized biography of Marilyn Monroe) brings the reader the emotional power, or the superb prose of Oates' immortal classic. Readers who read Them when it was first published years ago deserve to study the new Modern Library edition. Readers unfamiliar with the best of Oates should run, not walk, to their bookstores or their personal computers and order this classic. It is as simple as that. Them is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Them","review":"In this novel the characters seemed to be desperately trying to escape from each other, but unable to escape the past they share together. Joyce Carol Oates descriptions of the characters lives are vivid and oftentimes disgusting. The characters rarely seem to be able to make the right choices and are often victims of circumstance. Still, I was constantly intrigued during the novel. This novel is an excellent view of the sixties. Another wonderful novel by Oates is &quot;Because It Is Bitter and Because It Is My Heart,&quot; whih is set in approximately the same time period. &quot;Because it is Bitter...&quot; adds the aspect of race relations and has a more solid ending than &quot;Them.&quot;"},{"Title":"Them","review":"To read this book is a pure pleasure. The writing is amazing, descriptive but not so much that your imagination is constricted. The characters are so complex and well developed, it makes reading along with them realistic and enjoyable. However, this is one of those \\"good\\" books with a depressing plot. That's how I would describe it, depressing. Over the course of the book things just keep getting worse, and at the very end - well, I won't give anything away. If you're the type of person who likes to watch movies like \\"Schindler's List\\", extremely well done but emotionally taxing, then you'll love this book.One thing I was amazed at, however, was how Oates talked about things I have never before read in a book for school. She doesn't use any euphimisms, that's for sure. I suggest you read it, overall the writing and powerful emotions conveyed to the reader are far more amazing than anything else I have ever read."},{"Title":"Them","review":"Jules, Loretta, and Maureen Wendall are three of the most tormented and tormenting characters from modern American literature. These people, even Loretta but especially Maureen, have the capacity to advance themselves beyond their lower-class roots, yet each allows himself or herself to be doomed not just by the turmoil of events outside their lives, but by the limitations of their own personalities.When Oates composed this aggressively frustrating novel some forty years ago, the material about which she wrote--whites living in poverty relocating from a rural setting to the Mecca of Detroit--was revolutionary and ground-breaking. The murders, sexual assaults, cruelty, kidnapping, government corruption, even the undermining of the American Dream, was all presented without dramatic enhancement or judgment, it was simply spoken of as any other event would be. This lack of commentary on the part of the author makes all that comes to pass within \\"them\\" so much more startling. Unlike many of her later forays into fantasy, this novel aches within the confines of the realism with which she wrote it.Beginning with a cold blooded slaying in a bed and ending thirty years later in the ashes of the Detroit riots, \\"them\\" reconstructs much of the unpleasant side of mid-century American lower class life. Time and again we see glimmers of hope for Jules and Maureen, and (starting with the move to Detroit itself) for Loretta, and in every case---but one---we watch as the characters themselves let the chances go unused, or worse, warp them past recognition.The novel \\"them\\" is powerful and disconcertingly real. The fact its author tells us about such terrible things in literary prose makes it seem all the more offensive to our sense of complacency.The chapter near the end in which Maureen Wendall writes a letter to her teacher, Joyce Carol Oates, might confuse many, but this, too, is a literary construct, and represents an unusual Oatesean technique, a kind of letting the story rupture and protrude outward into what we think of as \\"our\\" world.It's been a dozen years since I first read this novel and to this day I think it stands out more than any other Oates work as her most alluring trip into the superconsciousness of the twentieth-century American nation."},{"Title":"Them","review":"Oates can write. She has a steam of consciousness style that makes you feel like you are in the head of a person&#65533;and, when her characters happen to be a bit off kilter--Oates takes you off kilter with them. This isn't linear story telling--it is a compiling of information about lives with an undertone of helplessness. What is happening won't change, can't change because there is not a bit of reflection going on -- the characters just spin into the future with no plan, no goals, no idea why their lives are as they are and making no effort to change. Oh they spout platitudes but the distance between even their limited idea about what is right and wrong and their actions is enormous. Well, one character in this story does aim to change--and boy does she go through a gauntlet of painful changes to try and find her way out&#65533;eventually she must separate from 'them'--but is her life really so different? She stumbles on the power of a young female&#65533;s sexual attractiveness and she uses it as a kind of ticket out. But she is far from a model showing the way out of the miasma of life on the steep edge of poverty. &#65533;Them&#65533; is not a fun book to read. It is hard to take at times...just like many of Oates stories--not because it is boring, or hard to understand, but because it is a bit too real. Oates makes the pain found in the ordinary slap you around. Who wants to get slapped around anyway?? Well, lots of people tell me they can't read Oates--she is too heavy. Yes, she loads her stories--there is nothing light about them--at least none that I've read so far. But there is something she is doing that calls to anyone who cares about the world: She sets up shop in common places, with real people and then makes you say how can this be real--when you know it is--otherwise it wouldn't bother you. She writes real horror stories without in supernatural elements. You don&#65533;t need anything supernatural to scare yourself to death--real people create horror--and Oates makes us look &#65533;them&#65533; in the face. &#65533;Them&#65533; accomplishes that. No education, poverty, racism, violence, obsessions, unfilled needs these are the ingredients of horror fiction--and Oates stirs the pot with all of them and more. Read her. Think about what she is saying about human potential and what can happen to people who are left spinning and rotting in the empty corners of our land. Thank you Ms. Oates--for making us uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Them","review":"Probably my favorite of Oates books, and I am a HUGE fan. Starts off kinda slow, but I found myself staying up until all hours of the night because I didn't want to stop reading it. Clearly, Oates writes like no other. Her portrayal of the characters are all too real, with a disturbing edge to them. But that's what makes them fascinating. I was captivated by Jules. Reading her books make me wonder about her sometimes. She can be so wonderfully, deliciously.....disturbed."},{"Title":"New Suns Will Arise : From the Journals of Henry David Thoreau","review":"It is obvious that the present day photographer, John Dugdale, has been greatly influenced by the 19th century Transcendentalist writer, Henry David Thoreau. In this superb book of Dugdale's photographs and selections from Thoreau's journals, it is as if the writings were done specifically for the images, not over 100 years previously.Dugdale has, for many years, been one of my favorite photographers. He uses a process for printing his photographs called cyanotype which was invented during the time that Thoreau lived and worked. The wonderful elegance and simplicity of his subjects and images fits perfectly with Thoreau's philosophies of life. Dugdale, because of HIV, is 80% blind, but, somehow, uses what sight he has combined with a pure spirituality and sight beyond the physical to create images of rare beauty.So, we see a single rose alongside these words of Thoreau: &quot;Love is the burden of all Nature's odes...&quot; A still-life of flowers, two birds, which may be made of milk glass, and a human hand are viewed with Thoreau's &quot;Perhaps what most moves us in winter is some reminiscence of far-off summer...;&quot; a solitary man with one hand against an old, tall tree by a pond and a field are perfect for Thoreau's &quot;Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influences of each...&quot; And perhaps most moving of all, part of the back of a nude man is used with Thoreau's &quot;My life was ecstasy. In youth, before I lost any of my senses, I can remember that I was all alive, and inhabited my body with inexpressible satisfaction...&quot;The book begins with two short, wonderfully written appreciations of the artists by Frank Crocitto.This collection is magnificent beyond any contemporary words. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"New Suns Will Arise : From the Journals of Henry David Thoreau","review":"I would recommend this for some one looking to explore some of Thoreau without tripping over some of his verboeness.

Also a great book to get the meditative juices flowing."},{"Title":"Heart on Fire","review":"Diana Simmonds is a great storyteller. I really like books where you don't so much read the story as live it. The characters are real and have depth.

I also just read 'Forty Love' and I can't really say which one I liked best (I ordered an extra copy of this book too). If you like Diana Simmonds' 'Heart on Fire' and 'Forty Love', you might want to try 'Under the Southern Cross' and 'Silent Heart' by Claire McNab, and of course 'Curious Wine' by Katherine Forrest"},{"Title":"Heart on Fire","review":"This is definately a great book.

I loved the way it was written, you get caught up in the struggle between the two women to become lovers. The author takes you into the heart and soul of the women and the beauty of the area that surrounds them. Makes it a special place. One I would like to visit."},{"Title":"Heart on Fire","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Jody is a seemingly atypical country star (i.e., she doesn't sleep with just any adoring fan) with an interesting band. Her bus breaks down in the middle of the Australian Outback and they find themselves stuck at a small truck stop for a few days. Grace, the owners' daughter, is a 28-year-old divorced virgin who immediately has unfamiliar feelings for the singer. After a little time and soul-searching on both women's parts, they find happiness with each other.This is a lovely book with which you will not be disappointed. It is well-written, thoughtful, and believable. I'm only sorry I waited until 8 years after it was published to discover it!"},{"Title":"Heart on Fire","review":"There are lots of novels that promise a story of love discovered, but so few deliver it as well as this one. Jody thinks it's just a momentary diversion on an unexpected layover. Grace allows it to happen as a part of her self-exploration. Neither of them believes that love is even in the picture and yet the reader knows it, with every kiss and every caress. Both of them are so certain that their encounter will lead to nothing that they leave themselves vulnerable to feelings that demand a future.The Australian setting of the novel is wonderfully conveyed, and the music that surrounds Jody a compelling part of her story. But the centerpiece of this novel is the unexpected love and the way these two women pursue their chance at happiness."},{"Title":"Heart on Fire","review":"It is a little dated but a nice sweet romance. My only complaint is the extended angst of the main characters. Love is love, it's rare and should be cherished."},{"Title":"Heart on Fire","review":"I've got a pile of about a dozen books that I bought for Summer reading. This one was recommended for those that enjoyed Curious Wine (my favorite Lesbian Romance). I had read Diana Simmonds book Forty Love many years ago and re-read it at the beginning of the Summer, so I was already familiar with her work and the Austrialian Setting. I wasn't sure I was going to like this book as it first began, but then I found myself reeled in. After I was done I re-read it from cover to cover (which I'm finding myself doing with about all the books I've read this Summer ... including re-reading the really good parts over and over). What I wish for all the Lesbian Romances that I've read this Summer is that there is a sequal or the story continues after the pair finally realize that they have to be together. I always have to use my imagination after the last page to think of \\"what's next for these two ?\\""},{"Title":"Heart on Fire","review":"The biggest obstacle this book faces is in the comparison of it to Curious Wine. I personally don't think there is or ever will be a better lesbian love story than Curious Wine, but standing on its own merits, Heart on Fire was a good read. I base my opinion on whether I finish the book in less than a few hours. It means I couldn't put it down, or didn't want to. Granted, being an English major I've learned how to read fairly quickly, but believe me, I usually savor good love stories. There are many books from Naiad I've bought, and there are some that I just couldn't even finish because it didn't grab me. This one did. Just one lesbian's opinion."},{"Title":"Heart on Fire","review":"I couldn't put this book down.I read in one night and loved it. She really made me feel the story. I'm looking forword to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Heart on Fire","review":"I read &quot;Curious Wine&quot; one day then the next &quot;Heart on Fire&quot;, and all I could say is that there is no way possible &quot;Heart on Fire&quot; can compare. &quot;Curious Wine&quot; was my first novel of this sort and boy talk about exquisite. I think I have read and re-read it about 3 times, in that week, while I've only read &quot;Heart on Fire&quot; once and then I skipped around--- alot. I guess the reason the story was not interesting was that the chemistry between the character's was not there for me."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"After reviewing this item, the title is now not available. I am reviewing \\"Bear Island\\" by Allistair MacLean.I am going to do my best to review this in a way that does not spoil any surprises, because there are plenty in this book, which should not be a surprise for those who read much of MacLean.This book is unique among those I've read by MacLean. The first half of the book has a unique feel. This is added by the fact that this story is told in the first person by one of the characters.One other distinction of this book is that it has more of a feel as a murder mystery rather than a suspense novel, which MacLean is best at. For me, I don't think he gave enough clues for one to figure it out on one's own, but maybe I'm being too critical, and he did better than I thought. That's up to you to decide.One drawback of this book is that there are too many characters. At one point the viewpoint character comments there were 22 present, and this does not count the characters that were not a point of the action at that point (both among the living and the dead). Four of the characters had not too common last names starting with \\"H\\". For me, this made it difficult to follow. I also found it useful, because I'm starting plans for a novel which by necessity for the plot I have in mind will also have several characters, so I have things to think about to make them stand out more.This was not my favorite MacLean novel. The ending was not great, but there are few MacLean endings I like. If you are not a MacLean affeciando, I would pass this book. If you are, you probably will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"\\"Bear Island\\" is a solid thriller by master story-teller Alistair Maclean. A converted fishing trawler carries a movie-making crew across the Barents Sea to isolated Bear Island, well above the Arctic Circle, for some on-location filming. En route, members of the movie crew and ship's company begin to die under mysterious circumstances. The ship's medical officer, one Doctor Marlowe, finds himself enmeshed in a violent, multi-layered plot in which very few of the persons on board are precisely who they seem. Dr. Marlowe's efforts to unravel the plot become even more difficult once the movie crew is deposited ashore on Bear Island, seemingly beyond the reach of the law or any other help.This novel reads like a closed house murder mystery, with the interesting twist that the scene of the crimes is the high Arctic. In addition to the murders, blackmail and some World War II events are part of the mix. \\"Bear Island\\" was not Maclean's best effort in that the plot seems overly contrived at times and many of the characters come off as cardboard cutouts. Nevertheless, the book makes for fascinating reading. Maclean was a polished writer and a past master at creating a twisting storyline. Readers will be kept guessing to the end as Maclean slowly unspools the clues and frames the story for an exciting ending.This book is highly recommend to fans of Alistair Maclean and to readers looking for an entertaining story."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"'Bear Island' has the dubious distinction of being Maclean's last truly great book. Following this, he went into a steep decline; the drop-off in quality between this and his next book 'Way to Dusty Death' is jarring. As some reviewers have mentioned, signs of his failing talent are already evident, such as the unncessary descriptive padding and cliched dialogue. But the book easily rises above these minor flaws for several reasons.Firstly, the setting is once again in the Arctic and at sea, two locations where Maclean is at his best. Secondly, this is a first-person narrative, as all of Maclean's best books are. And while Maclean's writing style can grate at times, it actually fits the main character quite well. Marlowe is older and more world-weary than the usual Maclean hero (perhaps a reflection of Maclean himself?) and relies more on brains than brawn to win the day. 'Bear Island' is a change from the usual Maclean, more of a murder mystery thriller than a straight-out action book.With such a large cast, it is true some characters are poorly sketched. But Maclean weaves several different sub-plots into the story, meaning most characters are important in some way, and therefore potential suspects. This fact and one red herring early in the book keep us guessing about the identity of the killer. It does seem that Maclean gives too much away with an exposition about halfway through the book, but in fact the progression of the story and the connection between all the sub-plots is handled well and makes sense.Personally, 'Bear Island' is one of my favourites. All the best Maclean elements are present, with a slight twist. That he followed this, one of his best books, with such a creative drought is surprising and sad. Perhaps he sensed his own decline, and focussed all his efforts on this one last book, then didn't care any more."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"I read this book because I'm attracted to stories set in windswept arctic places, and had also read and liked one of the author's previous books, \\"The Guns of Navarone.\\" I found Bear Island to be very much a second rate thriller. There are a lot of characters, most of whom are not very well fleshed-out (I found myself confusing one with the other, and wishing for a scorecard). They spend most of their time sitting around and drinking hard liquor (especially Scotch). While I don't know anything about Alistair MacLean, his fixation with alcohol in this book seems to suggest he may have had a drinking problem, himself. Two of the female characters are constantly referred to as \\"Mary dear\\" and \\"Mary darling\\" respectively, a usage which I found patronizing and annoying. The plot, involving several murders and an illegal quest for Nazi gold and securities, is not as interesting as it sounds. Although the book is short (243 pages), I found I had to work to finish it. In conclusion, unless you're really hard up for something to read, don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"If you've read one Maclean book, you've read them all (outside of the very earliest). Same plot used over and over, no suspense, carboard characterizations--and way, way, way overwritten (the books are padded beyond belief--if he wrote cleanly they would be reduced by two-thirds). Maclean himself said that he hated writing, churned out a book in about a month with one draft, and it shows. The later you read in his bibliography, the worse the books get.Don't bother."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"There's nothing wrong with this book but there are so many better books to buy. I had this book as a young child and don't remember ever asking my mom to read it to me.The story is cute, the pictures are nice but I would advise you to purchase somethig a little less average."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"I think the previous reviewer from California has this novel confused with some other book. I certainly wouldn't give Alistair Maclean's Bear Island to a small child and I'm not aware of any illustrated editions.The book in question does, however, feature multiple murders committed during a trip to the arctic circle. A group of filmakers are going to Bear Island (a snow covered wasteland) to make a new movie, but only the producer and screenwriter know what the script is. Poisonings and drownings give way to blunt instrument trauma as the cast and crew diminishes quickly. Only the film crew's doctor can investigate the mysterious occurences. Except he's not all he seems, either.I usually enjoy Maclean's writing and that's true here as well. The only problem I had with Bear Island was that it bogged down in the middle when the shipboard deaths had already occured and they still had not reached the island.All in all, though, a good solid read."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"Hm, I'm a little disappointed in the reviews, here. I suppose everyone expects a classic thriller par MacLean.Bear Island is less a thriller than it is a mystery, which explains the somewhat slower-than-usual pacing. MacLean brings back Captain Imrie (from When Eight Bells Toll) who is a good guy this time. Rather, he's a sub-character, piloting the Morning Rose to Bear Island. Aboard is a film crew and the producers/directors of the most anticipated film of the year.And then people start dropping like flies. I love it! It's very reminiscent of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None or William Dietrich's more recent Dark Winter. The classic premise: a bunch of people somehow completely isolated, and it's just not the best week for any of them.Bear Island is written in first-person (an immediate MacLean favorite), written with that ubiquitous dry wit found in his other novels. Despite the obvious -- more whiskey and scotch downed than there is water in the ocean, and that Bear Island only appears halfway into the book -- I found myself enjoying every page. And it turns out Bear Island is actually a very beautiful island. I recommend Googling for images (see \\"customer images\\" for book cover). Don't expect MacLean to describe it too well, since it's dark, cloudy, windy and rainy during the tale."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"\\"Bear Island\\" is a solid thriller by master story-teller Alistair Maclean.

Well, first of all, I like the movie \\"Bear Island\\" much better than I liked the book. I suppose that's unusual to begin with. Anyway, as for the book goes, it is a pretty typical Alistair MacLean offering. Though I've read only a few of his books, maybe this is the second, they seem to follow a similar pattern of presentation. It goes something like this...The first 100 pp or so of the book are spent introducing characters, seeing some of them drop off right and left to a variety of villanous acts, and some just disappear. There seems to be no common thread amongst these deaths, and the reader is left wondering, perhaps wallowing, in an effort to make sense of things. Before long, however, one character emerges as being quite clever, and not who he is painted to be in the beginning. Then, once you hit about 3/4 of the way through the story a few, then a building momentum of revelations start to be offered. Finally, at the end, one of the characters engages in a prolonged monologue (15-20 pp) that explains what happened, who did it, and why, to the readers who are not at all likely to have figured it out on their own. I know I couldn't have come up with the whole story without the monologue.If you like mysteries you may like this one, but I plowed through, mainly because I wanted to see how the book ended up, compared to the movie of the same nameBear Island [VHS](starring Donald Sutherland). Thus the luke-warm rating of three stars...it was \\"OK\\". Cheers."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"\\"Bear Island\\" may be long on atmosphere and short on plot, but that is a far from fatal situation with author Alistair MacLean employing some of his crispiest dialogue and most descriptive prose. If you like mysteries that use humor and suspense in near-equal amounts, this 1971 novel will entertain you most of the way through.Dr. Marlowe is the ship's doctor aboard the Morning Rose, a converted trawler presently being used as a kind of private yacht by megalomaniacal film director Otto Gerran. The ship is plowing the icy Barents Sea en route to Bear Island, an arctic Norwegian territory of steep and rugged coastline where Gerran plans to shoot a movie. En route, people begin dying mysteriously, a situation that continues after they make landfall. Dr. Marlowe has his hands full finding out who's responsible.Right away, MacLean sets the book's tone of black humor, not only with the varied reactions to the opening murder but the backstory involving a somewhat inept movie production replete with more cattiness and fragile egos than \\"All About Eve.\\" No one has a kind word about Otto, for example, even as they cheerfully avail themselves of his private stock of Scotch.MacLean at times seems to be channeling Joseph Conrad, what with the narrator's name and his writing of a sea swell, \\"black and veined and evil,\\" that breaks across the Morning Rose's beam at a dramatic moment. His writing is that good, especially early on. Bear Island comes alive less as a setting on account of the near-constant October darkness, but one gets a feeling of being here as well at odd times, with beetling cliffs that plunge straight down into icy waves, offering shelter only for the hardiest sea bird.\\"Bear Island was black,\\" he writes, \\"black as a widow's weeds.\\"MacLean also gets good mileage from his characters, not only Marlowe with his double-sided persona but Otto and the many others along for the ride. Everyone seems to have a secret or two, and for once in a MacLean novel, this actually amps up the story rather than detracts from it as being too contrived. One of my favorite lines in that vein could almost be a song lyric: \\"She gave me a little smile but there was a touch of winter in it.\\"Though it loses steam near the end, and is wrapped up with MacLean's customarily overneat quickness, \\"Bear Island\\" is a solid showcase for what makes the author so much fun."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"Great old book, I have read it on and off for a few years while working on boats in and around Alaska, A GREAT read when a storm is brewing."},{"Title":"Bear Island","review":"This is not a great book by any means and suffers from some major flaws. I read it not long after \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" and right away noted the similarities. A British professional who may or may not be all he seems finds himself trapped on a small ocean bound vessel that is suddenly beset by a series of suspicious deaths and \\"accidents\\" that aren't accidents.In this case, \\"Dr\\" Marlowe, our hero, is working as a ship's doctor on board an old converted trawler that is off to the remote Bear Island to do some filming. Barely have we been introduced to the more than two dozen other characters than they are expiring, many in a nasty way. Here's the first problem with the book -- there are so many people floating around that you don't know who is who and therefore don't care when they turn up dead.The scenes on the boat drag on forever and involve a vast amount of alcohol. No one seems to drink anything weaker than bad Scotch. In fact, barely two pages of the book go by without someone getting drunk. This is unconvincing. Once they get to the island the deaths continue and the storyline, never strong to begin with, gets ever more lost in stories of World War Two and lost treasure and long-ago fatal car crashes and who was behind the wheel one night when the family of one two-dimensional character -- or hang on, did it belong to another of the two-dimensional characters? -- suffered great tragedy and don't bother with that because here's an even more unbelievable story of blackmail and intrigue and . . .And you're best off just forgetting it.

John Harper's personal action with the 1st Marine Division fighting in North Korea beginning in 1951. It's a straight forward account of what it was like, all sugar-coating and political correctness aside. It was what it was, and it was war and it was hell. The so-called 'static' war being fought at the time was a meat-grinder reminiscent of the trench fighting days of WWI, and Lt. Harper describes the monotony and horror of it all in good detail.Chapter 8 was an excellent 'matter of fact' letter (published in Life 12/3/51) that, again, just tells it like it was. All of the confusion and senselessness and humor and frankness of war found in one letter home to Dad. Unless I had military experience myself, I can't imagine reading a letter like that from my son. Definitely don't show it to Mom!Chapter 9 reads more 'polished' than the preceding chapters. It describes preparation and execution of a local attack.

Having picked it up recently, I find it has aged fairly well. While it probably needs revision to bring it up to date, its core thesis is still cogent.Hougan's &quot;decadence&quot; is actually a conservative critique of contemporary capitalism, and its dance with countercultural style. He points out how its notion of style and &quot;lifestyle&quot; represent an inheritance from the various cultural movements of the 1950's and 1960's, and chronicles the breakup of the original &quot;counterculture&quot; into its various balkanised subcultures as seen today. The vast majority of these subcultures, moreover, are coopted by high capitalism, which uses them as marketing opportunities. This part seems quite prescient.The part that fares somewhat less well concerns his vision of technological stalemate. There are, indeed, problems that technology cannot conquer; but we don't seem to have hit any of them yet. Hougan's basic faith is that when technological breakdown comes, the balkanised culture and the people who inhabit it will find themselves unable to cope.Written in a bizarre but readable and indeed vivid style, this book remains a memorable social critique. His argument contains quite a few gaps, but you can probably fill them in given the inclination; a more connected style would make the book drier and duller.His criticism of subcultural balkanisation, the superficiality of it all, and how it is cultivated by marketing, remains memorable. These are things that do not feed the soul.A reissue, or better, a revised edition would remain welcome."},{"Title":"The Shetter family tree","review":"Excellent book! Lois Ann Mast also has other books on theZook and Brubaker family lines."},{"Title":"Gilbert Keith Chesterton","review":"Any serious work about Gilbert Keith Chesterton (I'm writing my Thesis about him) must start with this incredibly comprehensive biography made by a close friend of the Chesterton family.Access to rare letters between Chesterton and his wife Frances, George Bernard Shaw, quoted passages of his most well-known and beloved books, novels, essays, articles and poems (even personal notes). Interviews with childhood friends, co-workers, friends, rivals. All of this make this over-600-paged book a must-have for anyone that wants an up close and personal account of this incredible human being.From his early childhood, to his parents, his first friends, his first thoughts, his first writings, his first job, his wife, travels, his great books, joys and frustrations both personal and professional, everything up until his last day on this earth when after he died \\"Gilbert's pen lay on the table beside his bed and Father Vincent picked it up and kissed it.\\"I cannot stress enough the importance of this book. By far, the best biography of Chesterton ever written.If you like Chesterton's books and feel compelled to know more about this man, this should be your first stop."},{"Title":"Lille and the Dutch Revolt: Urban Stability in an Era of Revolution, 1500-1582 (Cambridge Studies in Early Modern History)","review":"This book can be seen as a masterpiece. The story of Lille is not well-known, even if the sources are important and accessable, and that's why this study is of a great interest. As the title says, the book describes the economy and politics of the (now) french town of Lille, then one of the biggest towns of the Low-Countries. Robert S. Duplessis made very complete research and extended the use of the sources to their maximum. The result is astonishing, and very surprising. We can see the tension between catholics and calvinists, the difficulties of the relations between central power in Bruxelles or Malines and the &quot;Magistrat&quot; (the town's council), and the way money and birth regulate the power in town. If you are interested in politics, in the Reform, or in the way people made fortune in the Renaissance, this book will interest you."},{"Title":"A Journey Through Texas or, a Saddle-Trip on the Southwestern Frontier with a Statistical Analysis. Burt Franklin: Research & Source Works Series 348. American Classics","review":"Bought this at a museum gift shop having been previously unaware of it. The book is subtitled \\"A Saddle-Trip on the Southwestern Frontier.\\" It was written by New Yorker Frederick Law Olmsted in the mid-1850s and describes a trip by horseback through a large swath of Texas, including a trip to the Mexican border. As a longtime Texas resident, I can safely say that for him to have traveled as far as he did over the types of terrain that he did without major incident was an amazing accomplishment in itself. The author was then a newspaperman reporting on slavery in the South, but he later became a famous landscape architect who would help design Central Park in New York. The book is like a time capsule from the pre-Civil War frontier. His descriptions of the natives and settlers in Texas are detailed and revealing. If you are from Texas, his descriptions of the early days in familiar places (Austin, San Antonio) will be especially enjoyable. His accounts of visits to small towns in Texas (New Braunfels, Castroville, many others) are also quite entertaining. Lastly, his observations on the corrupting influence of slavery and on the variety of peculiar relationships between slaves and masters (including former slaves holding slaves!) are absolutely fascinating. Anyone wishing to learn what it was like in the \\"Old West\\" in Texas will enjoy this book. Those interested in the history of slavery in the antebellum South will also find this book valuable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Journey Through Texas or, a Saddle-Trip on the Southwestern Frontier with a Statistical Analysis. Burt Franklin: Research & Source Works Series 348. American Classics","review":"The writer's descriptions of places, things and people are so good that it is the closest thing to being there. People, like me, who tend to look at the Peculiar Institution through rose colored glasses will have to struggle through his continuious comments on it's all too apparent evils, but it is well worth the struggle and the stark lesson. He makes it easy to also see how the feelings, North and South, had obviously chrystalized to a point where the Civil War was bound to happen. Texas in the 1850's, with all it's raw beauty, was no place for the faint hearted. If you love animals you will want to buy a mule and name it Mr. Brown! This is 1850's Texas with the bark stripped off."},{"Title":"A Journey Through Texas or, a Saddle-Trip on the Southwestern Frontier with a Statistical Analysis. Burt Franklin: Research & Source Works Series 348. American Classics","review":"Take a journey through Texas in the early years of statehood with famed reporter, biodynamic farmer and future landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. Olmsted traveled on horseback across Texas in the mid-1850's as a reporter for the New York Times just ten years after Texas attained statehood. Texas was big, wild and untamed.There were three trips taken: east Texas; west Texas; and along the Gulf coast. The three journals have been combined into a book, a first-person travel narrative. With Olmsted's keen eye for culture, landscape, crops, farming practices, diet, persona and folkways, your reading chair is transformed into a horse named \\"Mr. Brown.\\" Several times, \\"Mr Brown\\" nearly drowns in fording Texas rivers. However, most evenings after each day's travel, \\"Mr. Brown\\" collapses into deep slumber in a rough camp or next to a settler's cabin, utterly spent.Described as one of the best books ever written about the American West, \\"A Journey through Texas\\" does not disappoint. Olmsted's predictions correctly point to where Texas would stand when the Civil War became reality just a few short years later.His observations about the last of the free-roaming American Indian tribes, German settlers in the Texas hill country, Mexicans who had settled in Texas long before it was occupied and absorbed by Americans, slaves, escaping slaves and free Negroes, the Cajuns from Louisiana who settled in east Texas and American settlers from played-out farms in the old South, states like Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky are rich with detail. In the 1850's people knew what GTT stood for: Gone To Texas.Observations of Texas character and culture described by Olmsted stand to this day. His narrative is full of intrigue, danger, charm and insight.This is a great work that brings history alive in a way that few textbooks could ever hope to match. Five stars!"},{"Title":"A Journey Through Texas or, a Saddle-Trip on the Southwestern Frontier with a Statistical Analysis. Burt Franklin: Research & Source Works Series 348.

The author provides an array of humorous and often poignant examples of our human foibles in a style that allows us to identify our own.As a clinical psychologist myself, I am always interested in books that have broad appeal that I might recommend to my own clients. I have &quot;prescribed&quot; ROADBLOCKS to dozens of my clients over the past several months and have found that the usual response is quite stunning. Firstly, many of them report having made a paradigm shift in perspective regarding their tendencies to be self-critical, filled with guilt and shame and, generally bogged down with taking their own short-comings too seriously. Once they begin working with ROADBLOCKS, they often report that they can see the humor in their own failings, and that this shift in perspective helps them turn a corner towards greater self-acceptance and begin to move towards their goals more steadily,quickly and with more positive results.I highly recommend ROADBLOCKS to anyone who loves to learn more about human nature, laugh, and enjoy the process."},{"Title":"Removing Your Roadblocks to Love, Happiness and Success","review":"What a great time to pick up a book like this.

Bridget does run into some problems with a &quot;friend&quot; (and I say this loosely) named Rebecca, she is trying to get her talons into Mark, she is a snooty, backstabbing, wannabee who gets her comeuppance in the end.Bridget does run into legal problems in this book.

This is one book that will have you chuckling out loud.I found the characters in this sequel better drawn. Fielding really gives life to Bridget's mom (who is QUITE a character) and her friends Jude and Shazzer. Fielding makes sure we still don't really care for Mark Darcy (why DID she take him back? ) and that we cringe at Bridget's boss. The interview with the actor who plays Mark Darcy is downright hilarious....I could only hope to be as funny!While I did enjoy The Edge of Reason as I did the original, I will say that this one seemed to drag on in one particular spot, specifically the Thailand holiday. Had that whole section not been included, I'd say we have a winner. With the excursion out of London, this one goes on just a little too long.

Gaaah!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding's books have made me laugh until I thought I would pass out from lack of air. Literally. The books which can make that happen can be few and far between and when I find one I pass it on and on and read it over and over. And every time I read certain passages in this book, or think about them, even days later, I laugh hysterically. Read it! If you are a woman in your 30s, and single, especially, read it!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I never thought this book could be as good as the original Bridget Jones book, but if anything it's even better. There are several passages in this book that had me gasping for breath I was laughing so hard! (The interview...that's all I'll say since I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it!)Helen Fielding has managed to create a cast of characters who are crazy and absurd enough to be constantly hilarious, but who are also human and real enough to be touching. Like a lot of other singleton women out there -- I am Bridget! Read this book -- it won't disappoint you."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Pashminas, cell phones in dustbins, a hysterical interview with (sigh) Colin Firth, bridesmaid gowns, a Thai prison, and a home renovation project from hell. Who else but Bridget Jones could combine these all together so well? Read this in what seemed like ten seconds flat, but have enjoyed remembering it over and over. I found it even more fun (and on-target) than the original. yes, bridget is a little more stupid in this one (even I could foresee what was going on with Mark Darcy), but Helen Fielding is wickedly clever. Especially loved the continuing nods to Jane Austen (Persuasion, this time). Yay!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Well, the first book was a laught, but Bridget really does get a bit too dump for me. At her age I really expected her to have a bit more reason, and common sense. Her lack of straight forward thinking drove me up the wall in different parts of the book, and her friends became more of a nausance than a support system for her, driving her in all the wrong directions. I really had very high expectations for this book, and I have to say that allthought I enjoyed parts of it, all and all it was a drag to read."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I found out about the book \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" from a friend that swore it was one of the best books that she had ever read. I borrowed her copy and fell in love not only with the character of Bridget, but with Helen Fielding's style of writing. As soon as I found out that there was going to be a sequel to the first Bridget Jones, I started stalking the book stores waiting for it to arrive on the shelves. Finally I just pre-ordered it from Amazon.I think I recieved the book \\"The Edge of Reason\\" the day that it came out. I rarely am this excited to read a book. And I am pleased to say that Fielding didn't disappoint me in any way. Her writing has a style all of it's own. It seems like you are actually reading a diary, not an author's poor rendition of one. Fielding makes Bridget seem real and her thoughts, no matter how crazy, make sense to the reader.Some parts of the plot in the novel are a bit hard to believe, but Fielding makes up for it with Bridget's quirky character. With this girl, nothing is too hard to believe. She's one of those people that things just happen to. It's a wonderful story and an interesting trip through a 30-something's mind that even I as a 19 year old can enjoy and sympathize with. Every woman has her insecurities and Bridget displays hers in such a way that it's hard not to laugh at them and even yourself as you realize just how horrible you are for completely over analyzing everything.The book sends a positive message to all of it's readers, but delivers it in such a way that you don't feel like it's being stuffed down your throat. I hope Bridget's adventures continue on all the way through crows' feet and gray hair. I'll be reading every step of the way.Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding's \\"Bridget Jones: the edge of reason\\" is the sequel to the popular book \\"Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;. The2nd book continues where the first left off. Bridget is now dating Mark Darcy and is in heaven. However, thingssoon turn for the worse. She's having troubles at work, still has doubts about Mark Darcy, and other problemstake over her life, including a home remodelling gone wrong.Her mother in the meantime has gone to Africa and brought back a native. Her father has started to drink a lot. And a so-called friend, Rebecca, tries to steal Mark away from Bridget, which at one point causes her to turn to Daniel Cleaver, ex boss and ex boyfriend from the first book. Throw in a trip to Thailand, and you've got another wonderful Bridget Jones' novel.I found this sequel as good as the first. I love the characters and I am wanting more after I am done reading these books. I would definitely read another sequel and am looking forward to the next movie, too!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding is a comic genious. Prior to her works, I had never read a thing that made me laugh out loud. This book, and its predecessor, however, did! While it took a bit longer for me to get into this book, it is as good as the first Bridget Jones.It is an uproarious read, full of that same charm and wit as the original. Bridget Jones is again, a character true-to-form. She does the things that most of us can only wish we did [or, are glad we didn't do!].Men and women alike will enjoy this book. Men-- it holds great insight, again, into the female psyche! Enjoy it for what it is though, a great work of literary hilarity!I can't WAIT to see the film."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This is no great work of literature, in style and content both. My main gripe with the former is the narrator's tendency to lapse (and lazily so) into shorthand accounts - &quot;For four weeks and five days now have been in functional relationship with adult male thereby proving am not love pariah as previously feared&quot;. It might engender realism but makes the flow of reading difficult.With the latter, it's the one-dimensional characters who take up their stock roles with gusto (Evil Boyfriend-Stealer, Wacky and Worrisome Mother, Supportive Advice-Giving Food-Bringing Best Friends) and the out-of-this-world twists and turns in the plot. Still, such a book requires a certain suspension of disbelief for true enjoyment; and within its genre, it's among the best for sustainability of reader interest and humour.Bridget as a character is very sympathetic, if somewhat unbelievable with her extraordinary bouts of stupidity that no educated working adult could possibly suffer from. She's genuinely nice, very funny and the underdog - it works everytime. Mark Darcy *must* be the perfect guy; allusions to Mr Darcy from good old 'Pride and Prejudice' are obvious, and writing in Colin Firth as a 'guest star' is both clever and hilarious.The book even ends happily ever after (and, strangely enough, starts that way as well). It's easy reading and it makes one laugh out loud; perfect for a fun, frothy and mindless read."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding was one of the original chick lit authors when the genre first started in the 1990s. I have to give her points for originality. This book is funny, Bridget is just as bumbling and unsure of herself but optimistically charming as she was in the first."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding's \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" is a delightfully quirky return to Bridget's perpetual misadventures and obsessive attempts at misguided self-improvement. Focused around Bridget's budding relationship with Mark Darcy and its rapid unraveling, Bridget finds herself balancing between maintaining an independent womanhood and avoiding an unfortunate spinsterhood. While deep within the throes of troubled romantic seas, Bridget must also navigate the choppy waters created by her friends and family. With adventures that take her from gaping holes in the side of her flat to jail time in Thailand on to death threats, Bridget's bumbling exploits make for a captivating novel.Fielding allows Bridget's personality to emerge and flourish contrasting it against a cast of likeable, but remarkable human characters. She captures the most unstable parts of her characters allowing the reader to see the clash that happens when they interact with one another. The plot is intriguing shifting constantly as Bridget undergoes various stages of self-evolution. I did find that the story dragged on during the middle of the book, but overall Fielding provides an entertaining story that provides a glimpse of British politics and pop culture."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Brilliant character (isn't she a bit like you and me?) Helen Fielding is giving us a spicy slice of life. I'd like to point out the soul of the whole audio project : Tracie Bennet who plays the part like her life depended on it. Read critics about histerical interpretation... matters of taste and cannot be criticized. What I LOVE in an audiobook is an actor/actress (because it really needs good acting skills) living the story. Makes me want to go and search all Tracie has played and watch/listen to it. At the moment would gladly isolate myself from rest of the world with audioplayer and relisten to both books."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"(Note: This review is by a person who has enjoyed viewing the movie on numerous occasions prior to having the pleasure of reading the novel. However, because the movie version and novel version are vastly different, there is likely to be very little partiality or prejudice in this review, if any).In this gloriously funny sequel to Bridget Jones's Diary, readers find themselves, once again, immersed in the chaotic and comedic world of Bridget Jones. If you expected Bridget to lose some of her neuroses or her proclivity of winding up in humiliating and awkward situations because she is now in a relationship with Mark Darcy, you were wrong my friend! Bridget is still Bridget, weighing herself daily and smoking too many cigarettes; but this time instead of obsessing about finding a boyfriend, she is consumed with doubts and insecurities about the relationship she is already in.The signs are there... Mark Darcy is a commitment phobic! With the help of her relationship experts/best friends, Shazzer and Jude, Bridget's eyes are opened to the fact that her relationship with Mark is precariously hanging by a thread. She realizes that she is his \\"Just For Now Girl\\" and that he is probably thinking about sleeping with other women due to his \\"Mentionitis.\\" Not to mention that he is oblivious to this other woman's attempts to get her claws on him. After some unfortunate misunderstandings and misconceptions, Bridget decides the best thing for her to do is to \\"detach\\" from Mark Darcy. But when Mark no longer calls her and is rumored to be seeing this other woman, Bridget wonders if this \\"detachment\\" theory was a good idea after all...For me, this is one of those times where I enjoyed the sequel more than the first novel. What I liked most about Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason is that there was more of the sexy and intelligent Mark Darcy! I was delighted that Mark Darcy's character was distinctly developed and received more page time in this novel. I greatly enjoyed how the reader was able to discover and perceive things about Mark Darcy that Bridget was completely unaware of (like his feelings for her).Another aspect of this novel that I loved was the frequent use of references and plot devices borrowed from both Pride and Prejudice and Persuasion. For example: Bridget being persuaded to break up with Mark by her friends; Mark's work colleague Giles Benwick (Captain Benwick) relying on self-help books (not poetry) to help him through his difficult divorce; and, Rebecca, the woman chasing after Mark, possessing some of Louisa Musgrove's flirtatiousness and stubborn willfulness.I found Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason to be a delightfully and amusing sequel. If you have seen the film, be prepared for the book to be nothing like it. In my opinion, the book beats the pants off of the movie! I loved all the absurd and amusing escapades Bridget gets herself into, my favorite being the Colin Firth Interview. Eight brilliant pages of Bridget asking Colin Firth questions like: \\"How many takes diving into the lake did you have to do?\\" and \\"Do you think Mr. Darcy would have slept with Elizabeth Bennet before the wedding?\\" I highly recommend this novel!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is fantastic. I think I enjoyed even more than the first book. Too bad Hollywood had to go and make such an insipid movie with almost none of the humor or warmth of the book. I understand the need to change a few things, but for Pete's sake, why would they totally change the villainess and make her a nice girl in the movie. In my mind, Rebecca's machination is the driver of the story plot. And to see her get her just desserts was so wonderful (in the book). Don't even get me started on the enhancements to Daniel Cleaver's presence in the movie. This is just a wonderful book and they (movie folks) just ruined. Get the book, skip the movie."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I remember sitting in a darkened theater all alone and watching \\"Bridget Jones' Diary.\\" I loved it so much, I looked and found the novel, read it, and loved it even more. It isn't often when a book makes you laugh out loud, not just a giggle, but a true belly laugh.When I saw the sequel was out, I squealed in delight. By then, Bridget felt like a long lost friend and I wanted to know what happened to her and good old Mark Darcy.I was NOT disappointed. Hilarity from beginning to end. There is one scene with an asian boy on Mark Darcy's bed ... oh gosh, enough said, I read it over about 100x and laughed hysterically each time.Helen Fielding, my glass is lifted to you. Terrific, comedic writing once again.If you need a good cheering up, get this and the first book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"One of the best books I have read (listened to) in a long time. I read Bridge Jones' diary several years back and really enjoyed it, but this was even more fun than I remember.I listened on audio and Barbara Roseblat does and amazing job bringing Bridget to live. Adored her at it.It's got a nice mix of everything romance, career, friends and tons of humor. At the very end I found myself laughing histerically listening to what she wrote in her Christmas cards after having a few drinks. It's absolutely hillarious.I will definetly give this one a listen to again. Probably on my top 10 list. Only down side and is I got out of library and would like my own copy. V. difficult to find.

It's alot of fun and will keep you smiling! It's pretty close to the movie but of course things are a little different and closer to the book version."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read both this book and the first before I watched either movie. Both were great movies; even better books! It's the same old thing, the book is always much better than the movie. More of the plot reaches your eyes and is left to great imagination. I loved these books so much!! I'm so ready for more of Helen Fielding's books!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The only thing keeping me from giving this book 5 stars were some of the stressful moments which made me SO tense, out of empathy for the characters. Though, I think that the fact that I was able to get so involved with the characters speaks volumes for Helen Fielding's writing. Read it and then recommend it to a friend."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"well, the first book cracked me up and this one did too.I always enjoy good writing, no matter the age or gender of the author. Therefore I will say that I am unlike most of the other reviewers, a man,and even though I haven't experienced the same things, I can still appreciate all the details and nuances that make this such a rich work. So, please stop marginalizing Ms. Fielding as some ''womans&quot; author. Us guys think she's funny too&quot;.I mean when you're talking funny novels she's right up there with Asher Brauner's &quot;Love songs of the tone deaf&quot; or Joseph Heller's &quot;Catch 22&quot;.When you've got it you've got it, and Fielding's got it. Can't wait for her next."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I discovered the much touted Bridget Jones books very recently. The first one had me in stitches and this, the follow-up, is even funnier. The trials and tribulations of this neurotic 30-something year old are hilarious. You can identify with all her insecurities and yet laugh at the situations she puts herself into. I couldn't put this book down and it will be one I reach for anytime I need a good laugh. Buy it, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I heartily recommend the audiobook for &quot;Bridget Jones, the Edge of Reason&quot;, as not only is the dialogue wickedly funny and satirical but the delivery of it by Tracie Bennett is superb. I can't praise it enough. I can't wait to hear or read other books by Helen Fielding!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones books have been delightful reads. The Edge of Reason was a great follow up to Bridget's first book. I found myself smiling in appreciation of the realistic development of Fielding's characters and their feelings and actions. Any person can easily identify with Bridget and her mood changes, relationships with friends and family, and her constant internal conflicts. The diary style is perfect for this book and its plot. It's great to read a book that is relaxing and entertaining. It reinforces the ways that we cope and how we are on a continual journey of self-discovery that makes each day and experience special."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I eagerly anticpated the release of this book for many months secretly worrying that it would pale in comparison to the original. I could not have been more wrong. This book was just as, if not funnier than the first. Ms. Fielding is a wonderful writer and Bridge is the easiest to love character I have encountered in a long, long while. My only hope is that this becomes a trilogy!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I really enjoyed Bridget Jones's Diary and was looking forward to the sequel. The Edge of Reason seemed to follow the same rules as movie sequels - not as good. I guess the middle of book is what turned me off - beginning and ending were very entertaining. Still a good read but didn't live up to it's predecessor."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"fielding is an expert at pacing. at exactly the right moment, she changes the scene so nothing in this book-an entry, a setting, a line-wears out its usefulness. this makes 300+ pages fly."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I wasn't convinced after the first diary, but now I am.

I can see our Singleton era being studied one hundred years down the road using literature like Edge of Reason and Bridget Jones's diary as textbooks! From Bridget's hillarious and realistic struggle against rebecca, to innocently getting high on magic mushrooms, getting \\"famous\\" among prostitutes in prison, and writing some rather \\"excess\\" christmas cards (process involving alcohol) Bridget Jones holds the attention of her reader hostage from page one. Although I was a little bit disappointed of her failure to properly reconcile with poor Daniel Cleaver, I enjoyed very much this 'monumental' work of fiction, which makes the reader doubt whether or not this is fiction at all! Read it Read it Read it!!!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Having read the first Bridget Jones novel some two years ago I thought I'd go out on a limb and be one of the few guys in this world to read both in the series. True, they are very much 'girlie books'. But in this genre they are rather polished pieces.In 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' we have Bridget struggling with the man (Mark Darcy) she won in the first book. A predatory femme fatale plus Bridget's unwarrented paranoia places this relationship in jeopardy. Of course catty gossip and bizarre interludes (including a strange vacation to Thailand) makes this a funny yet harmless (and, alas, ultimately forgettable) read.Bottom line: Helen Fielding decomposes the modern Brit 'chick' with panache. Even guys can like this kind of book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Just not *quite* as good as the original - but I still loved it. Every single girl ofer 20 will devour it."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is great. I would actually venture to say on par with her first Bridget Jones novel. Bridget goes though similar problems from the first book - as well as some VERY different problems. She as always over analyzes everything. Messes a lot of stuff up. And yet keeps moving forward. If you liked the first book you will love the second. A must read for any Bridget fan."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I was somewhat reluctant to read this book because I had to make myself finish the first book, but this one was suprisingly decent."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Another great &quot;Bridget&quot; book from helen fielding. this book picks up 2 weeks after BJ Diary ends and let me tell you it had so many twists, turns and hilarious surprises that will leave you laughing to the point of tears. this book is V.V. entertaining. Enjoy~it's a winner!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Though the first book was better, this sequel is something you can't put down either. Although some of it was a bit to unrealistic, like when she spent time in prison. I doubt they are that nice. Little things like that sort of ruined the mood for me while I was reading it. With that aside, this is another good book worth reading. If you love to laugh and be entertained by a good story, read this one."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I love this book! I was in the airport and a man said, &quot;My wife read that book and she laughed her head off.&quot; I immediately bought it. This is laugh out loud fun. A refreshing change from the typical 'relationship' stories. Bravo Helen!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"You'll never get any sleep! This book is a laugh and guffaw out loud, sure to wake the neighbors. I don't recall the first book as funny as this one, or maybe It's the groove of enjoying Helen Fielding's thoughts as Bridgette. Her relationship with Mark Darcy continues, as does her obsession with the scale. I found myself wiping tears off of my giggling cheeks as I never put it down and finished it before the sun came up...Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read Bridget Jones' Diary in an afternoon. It moved so quickly and I found myself choking back giggles as to not disturb my boyfriend. I had been hearing great things about this book for over a year and I'm so glad I finally read it for myself. Every great thing you've heard is true!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I just finished this book today and found it thoroughly enjoyable and a page-turner. I lost several nights of sleep, unable to put the book down -- just reading and laughing at Bridget's many antics. In some ways, I found it funnier than the first book and I originally had my doubts. I thought I even detected a hint of Jane Austen's Persuasion in some of the scenes. Helen Fielding's fans will NOT be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Poor Bridget Jones, she just can't win for losing. First she gets her man, Mark Darcy, then she loses him to Rebecca, a woman with baby giraffe thighs, who aside from having absolutely no girlfriend etiquette whatsoever, decides to steal Bridget's friends as well. And to make matters worse, her ex boyfriend Daniel Cleaver decides it's time to worm his way back into Bridget's life. Will she get back with Daniel or will Mark come to his senses and see that Bridget is the woman he loves and needs?Aside from Bridget's love life, other crazy events seem to be unfolding around her every second. First her mother and Auntie Una bring back a tribesman with them from Africa. This, of course, forces Bridget's father Colin into taking up drinking in the shed outside. Second, while on a trip with Shazzer to Thailand, Bridget unknowingly traffics cocaine at the airport and ends up in a nasty prison where she must fend off lesbians and sing Madonna songs for survival. And last but not least, Bridget gets a mysterious death threat and is forced to leave her apartment and go into hiding. Oh yes, who can forget her interview with the sexy Colin Firth (the original Mr. Darcy) where Bridget constantly asks about his wet shirt and his Italian girlfriend? It's hilarious!!!Her friends also seem to be having a weird year as well: Tom is between London and San Francisco(and boyfriends), Jude and Vile Richard are FINALLY getting married, and Shazzer, the most staunch of feminists, is...GASP...in love!! And during all of this our little Bridget is alone and heartbroken over Mark Darcy.I don't think that Helen Fielding could've handed us a better Bridget book if she tried. This one was so wonderful! We've already fell in love with these characters and it's nice to see theirs lives and loves progress another year forward. After reading &quot;Edge of Reason&quot;, I was nothing short of blown away. I found myself laughing hysterically, crying, and banging my hands on the couch in anger as Bridget takes us through another year of her life. I also found myself wanting to shake some sense into Mark and wrap my fingers around Rebecca's neck until her boney little face turned blue. Coniving wench!What I enjoyed most about &quot;Edge of Reason&quot; was Bridget's progression into a woman in complete control of her life. She finally realizes that no amount of counting calories, cigs, or pounds will ever equal happiness. Being yourself is all that matters and those who really love you will see this as well and love you all the more for it. I recommend this book to anyone who's already read &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;. I hope that Helen Fielding decides to grace us with another Bridget book soon. We just can't get enough of her.Gennie Bailey-Rogers"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Such a perfect account of the signleton's life, in London or the US.

Well after looking on amazon, to my delight I could read what happened with my favorite British chick and my man Colin-I mean Mark Darcy. I was not disappointed. If anything, it made me wish I had read the first installment first. I loved the minute bliss Bridget had until her normal misadventures began! A boy in Mark Darcy's bed! v.bad Landing in jail due to looking for a man! v.funny. I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"It was excellent getting to read even more funny adventures of Bridget. It is always great reading sequels, it is like having a happy reunion with some good friends. Sequels bring back good memories (with books, the memories are from the previous novel). There is a wonderful essence about sequels. This sequel impaticular, was a great one, one a person can read a thousand times.It was different from the first one because it was more fun. It wasn't better or worse, it was just different because we got to see a more detailed version of Bridget with an actual relationship (as opposed to her meaningless &quot;romance&quot; with Daniel Cleaver in the first novel). We got further into seeing her with a career in television and with her family, although still crazy, is not falling apart with divorce. The Thailand extravaganza was a really fun thing, something some of us would like to laugh about, imagining ourselves with our girlfriends in the same situation.'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' , overall, was a very fun novel to read,a perfect addition to the first novel, starring our favourite heroin, the one we can relate to."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I picked up this book because I wanted to see the movie, but I hate seeing the movie until I read the book. Anyway, this book made me laugh out loud, a rarity. It's a fast, light read that a woman in her 30's can relate to. Bridget's attempt at dinner parties is great. Her friends are funny and her mother is hysterical. I can't wait to read the sequel."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This sequal was just as wonderful as the first Bridget Jones novel.

I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good laugh!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I bought the audio version of this book as soon as I finished the first one &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot;. It is amazing how Helen Fielding can make the sequel better than the first one (which was great already). Tracie Bennett, again, is a very good narrator. This time someone is trying to destroy her relationship with Mark. Moreover, Bridget is accidently involved in a serious legal trouble. You will love the way she look at her life in the good side in every situations. Although the ending was predictable as usual, the story still kept me laughing all the time.At the end, You (and Bridget)will know (and love) Mark much more."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This sequel to Bridget Jones's Diary is hilarious!

I can't wait for the third book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Better titled The Euthanasia of Bridget Jones, this disappointing sequel abandons the momentum of the first book's happy ending. Instead of enjoying Bridget's and Mark's deserved happiness, which could have incorporated a diverting plot and unforced comedy, we get more of Bridget's insecurities, Mark's stupid faithlessness and a ridiculous, trumped-up story.If I could unread a book , it'd be this one!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I wanted to like this book. I really did. I liked the original, and I loved the movie. THE EDGE OF REASON is testament to the fact that just because someone can and even may be urged to write a sequel, that doesn't mean she should write one.The first half of THE EDGE OF REASON was pleasant enough, especially since I could imagine the characters from the movie each speaking his or her own lines. That was not, however, enough to sustain the second half of the book. And when, to my unpleasant surprise, Fielding took the plot from the movie Brokedown Palace and put Bridget Jones right smack into the middle of it, I debated about even finishing the book.I did finish it, and in my opinion, once it went downhill, it stayed on that course right through to the end. It seemed obvious to me that Bridget Jones and Mark Darcy were not and never would be well suited for each other. To make them seem so was an exercise in futility and made any romance between them seem contrived.When I finished this book my only hope was that Fielding allows Bridget Jones, Mark Darcy, and all the other characters who fill up her pages to rest in peace for good."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I bought this book because of the editorial reviews, but I was so disappointed with it. The stories are so trivial and boring that it was a struggle to finish reading the whole book.

I would give that book to someone who is willing to pay postage."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I loved the first book. I could identify with Bridget, I could sympathize. The second book takes a very odd turn. Bridget get what she wants and we only see Mark in the very beginning and end of the book. Then she goes to Thailand where not even strange but stupid things happen. This part of the book is copied from the movie Broke Down Palace. I found myself skipping to the parts with Mark. That was what I wanted to read, their romance. And Daniel Cleaver comes out of no where and seems like just filler. Bad book. Don't waste time on it."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The first novel, Bridget Jones' Diary, was interesting for being new -- a chatty, self-obsessed memoir that was a send-up of insecure women who are not in control of their lives, who are desperate for a man to give them the value that they should recognize that they already have, and that are suffering from co-dependence on their friends/family. Bridget was mad for dieting, mini-skirting, and getting herself into absurdly funny situations that made the book blend into one huge laugh. The Edge of Reason has lost the charm of the first book, so that I found (you may not) the characters annoying -- too much self-pity and dodging into alcohol-oblivions. Bridget hasn't grown as we like to see characters develop into more mature perspectives. She's devolved, getting silly rather than amusing. Her relationship with Mark Darcy is shallow. There is no real intimacy beyond the constant shagging (not that anyone would begrudge her that). Mark and Bridget don't share at any depth. It's all surface, and Bridget is madly insecure about her relationship (no wonder), given to whining and fantasizing doom, when just sitting down and having an honest talk about things would set the two up for an adult relationship. I realize it is meant to be funny, but it gets tedious awfully fast. When Mark tells Bridget that he loves her, I want to shout &quot;WHY? &quot; There are still some very funny scenes here, described with the original Bridget style. Bridget gets into a predicament on vacation that is well presented but gets solved too easily. Wellington, who wanders into her mother's life, is terribly interesting and disappears far too soon. Mark Darcy comes off the hero, but he seems to be in all the scenes, with Bridget co-dependent, desperate, and foolish. I'm hoping the next sequel allows Bridget to grow up, take charge of her life, get a better job (she deserves it), and get some self-respect."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I saw the movie first and hated it so much, I nearly didn't read this brilliant piece of comedy.A screamingly funny and honest look at the insecurities that plague most women and self-help books that sabotage our lives, the funniest bits in this book center around the relationships between Bridget and her friends.some of the higest points: the break-up emergency team (complete with wine, icecream and a tape of Pride and Prejudice), the insecurites of her married friend, Magda, and the way her single friends misinterpret her disomfort as smugness and the emergency phone sessions between Bridget, her friends and Mark's recently divorced friend.The thing about Bridget Jones is that she isn't fat. She just thinks she is. She relies so heavily on the \\"wisdom\\" of self-help books that she's nearly guaranteed to always think less of herself.Even if you hated the movie, read this book. You won't be dissappointed!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I really enjoyed reading BRIDGET JONES. It was funny, slightly quirky, and full of British charm. The book is a modern take on Jane Austen's classic novel and is thoroughly successful at what it does. I enjoyed it so much I was delighted to hear that a sequel had been penned, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON. I've owned the book for over a year, but with the new movie arriving in theatres, I wanted to make sure I finally read the book. When I read the first page, I was excited to read the further adventures of Bridget Jones.I was quite disappointed. The first few sections of the book start out alright (however, unlike BRIDGET JONES, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON isn't divided up according to a monthly calendar). At first Bridget seems to be the same old Bridget that everyone came to love and adore. Then the characters stop acting like they are supposed to act. We all know that Bridget is kind of a basketcase and slightly neurotic, but does anyone really believe that even Bridget could be dumb enough to dump someone like Mark Darcy over the things she ends up dumping him for? Sure there would be fights, arguments, and disagreements, even with someone as remarkable as Mark Darcy. However, no one would actually dump him they way Bridget ends up doing. It's completely out of character, unrealistic, and unnatural. However, Bridget isn't the only one who starts acting crazy. Her friend Tom ends up moving to the United States (he must have a pretty penny to be able to do that), Bridget's Mum has brought an exotic foreigner home to England to visit for awhile, Bridget's Dad is sent to a rehabilitation home, and on it goes. It's as though Bridget and everyone in her world are all suffering from a midlife crisis at the same time (well, except Mark Darcy). Yes, people have midlife crises, and sometimes bad things happen all at once all around us, but not like they do with Bridget. Things get even more bizarre when Bridget goes to Thailand and gets arrested for drug smuggling. It's like a warped version of the limbo--how far can we go.BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON isn't a terrible book, but it's not a terribly good one either. The story has some good writing and there are memorable moments in the plot. Still, it's just not the same Bridget. Until the last fourth of the book Bridget doesn't grow at all and instead regresses. She makes some improvements just before leaving for Thailand, but by that time she's fallen so far, just about any decision could look like an improvement. Whereas the original BRIDGET JONES was witty, humorous, charming, realistic, and believable, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON just isn't reasonable. It should have been entitled BRIDGET JONES: BEYOND THE EDGE OF REASON instead."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Hurrah! Bridget is no more a poor thirty-something Singleton. She has a perfect boyfriend in Mark Darcy. However, only weeks into the relationship, Bridget is worried, for the evil Rebecca has her eyes on Mark. Rebecca is what Bridge and co. calls a 'Jellyfish', someone who seems all nice and happy and then lunges out at you and stings.But, her problems with Mark are often pushed into the background, as her friends and family wreak havok over themselves and poor Bridge. Her mother heads to Africa with Una Alconbury and comes back with an African tribesman, to the horror of her husband, Jude attempts to settle down with Vile Richard, Tom is stuck in his on again off again relationship with Pretentious Jerome, and Shazzer is having one of those 'just friends' shagging habits.Even though her job's ghastly, her ex-boyfriend gets drunkk and tries to get back together and she somehow ends up in a Thai jail, Bridget makes it through the year, every year.Best book ever, made me laugh more than the first. Better than Harry Potter, less pretentious."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Honestly, I found this book trying to hard to mimic the success of the first novel. The &quot;diary style&quot; writing was present but not as well executed as in the first book. There are many more extraneous details and some portions of the book become bogged down. It is easy to read and offers significant plotlines building off of the first book. However, some of the situations were literally unbelievable.If you were a fan of the first book, it is worth your time to read this one to follow Bridget's life. But don't expect the same lovable writing style as the first."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Absolutely loved this one. This is the sequal to Bridget Jones Diary... See what happens to Bridget after she gets together with Mr. Darcy also see what happens when she1- Interviews Colin Firth2 - Goes on Vacation to ThailandI laughed the way through this one also. She is so much like a real person and has the things happen to her that many people do (the insecurities and the Self Help Books). If you want a light hearted read and want to laugh this is the one for you."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"What will I do without Bridget to come home to at night? This was the best sequel I've read in ages. Helen Fielding has managed to surpass even her own first book. Bridget has gained wit and inner poise in book two and jumped many more hurdles in her attempt to remodel her flat, vacation in Thailand, and to attempt life as singleton with and w/o Mark Darcy. All the while she still has to deal with riotiously overbearing mother and whithering father, standfast friends Sharon and Jude, long suffering Tom and poor Magda, who has too many children. Between drinks and cigs and daily weight reports, one can't keep from laughing through the entire book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"In a world of depressing new novels about dead husbands with secret wives, drowned toddlers, raped girls who become obese, psycho twin brothers, mothers dying in child birth...this book (and its predecessor) is as refreshing as spring sunshine after a Canadian winter. Thank you Helen Fielding for your hilarious books. A popular novel doesn't always have to dwell in high drama to be entertaining."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This novel was a great read, it was hilarious. May I say that I think it's funnier than the original. Of course, it is not very different from the original -- she is still trying to quit smoking and trying to lose weight, but the heroine seems a little more together this time around.There was a setback, the whole death threat thing, for a minute there I thought I was reading a mystery novel (I hate mystery novels) -- but other than that, it is great! I was cracking up on the subway train on my way to work this morning while I read the chapter in which she was interviewing Colin Firth -- the actor who played Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. The people on the train were staring at me, but I couldn't help it, it was too funny.I know it sounds insane but I do wish Miss Fielding writes another Bridget Jones novel. I would happily buy all the Bridget Jones novels available!Oh -- and I loved the whole Jane Austen feel. The original was Pride and Prejudice, and this time around, Persuasion. There were also the essential Jane Austen elements, such as the gossiping, giggling, and obsession with men. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget is back and she hasn't changed a bit, she is as hilarious as ever! Her best friends, Jude and Shazzer, are still around to offer comfort and self-help book quotes when things go wrong...and they do. Life is such an adventure for this heroine, from her daily life in London to a holiday in Thailand, she will have you laughing out loud. This was an easy weekend read and a real treat for any fan!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"If you've read any of my other reviews (click on my name above to see them!), you'll know I don't read &quot;fluff&quot;. But I got a few laughs from the movie, and decided to give this book a go, without even having read the first, or Fielding's earlier novel, &quot;Cause Celeb&quot;.All I can say is I laughed from start to finish. This book's terse diary-entry format and its guileless, often-clueless heroine reminded me of an Adrian Mole book more than anything else -- only all grown up (and yes, I KNOW there are &quot;adult&quot; Adrian Mole books, but I didn't enjoy them...!).Life can get pretty depressing on a steady diet of &quot;literary&quot; fiction and non-fiction. Sometimes, I need a break, and a book like this is the perfect opportunity to immerse myself in pure reading enjoyment. Since reading &quot;Edge of Reason,&quot; I have reserved the first Bridget Jones book from my local library, and am waiting on the edge of my seat for (hopefully!?) the THIRD installment in Bridget's madcap adventures."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"It's been a while since I read the first Bridget Jones (which made me laugh outloud and I lent out until the spine broke), but I'm quite disappointed with this new offering. It's just the same old same old. Perhaps the problem is that I'm past all the &quot;will he call&quot; ridiculous dating stuff and Bridget is not. I wish she'd grow up a little. I'm still reading this book (though I considered stopping) to find out what happens in the end, though I already know, but still I keep reading--but I find myself skimming and skipping pages; sometimes Bridget will just go on and on and I don't want to hear it. I think this book could have been shorter and Bridget could have used some actual character development."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget Jones is at it again in Helen Fielding's fabulous follow-up to Bridget Jones' Diary. Edge of Reason follows the same humorous format - each diary entry headed by her caloric intake, number of boyfriends, cigarettes, drinks and minutes since she last had sex.While the second book is a little out there in the sense of reality (some of Bridget's predicaments are just a tad too over the top and one wonders how she can be SO dense some of the time in life and in love) one still feels for Bridget and the book is a fun read.Year in Life of Bridget: Pages - not that many, number of calories burned from laughing ?, number of people who begged to borrow book upon completion - at least 100...The book begins with Bridget's budding relationship with Mark Darcy (sigh), and her neurotic friends Shaz, Jude and Tom are back with a vengeance. She has read EVERY self help book available but still must figure out how to keep her man (gahhh!), her career and her figure while fighting mad hair, scary pants, money issues, crazy boss (fwaw) and monster-woman Rebecca (who is after Mark Darcy). Bridget must also learn to live the life as a Singleton and not hate the Smug Married's (her conversations with married pal Magda are quite funny), while also dealing with her wacky mother and her friends.The book takes place over a year or so in Bridget's life - once she has her man, can she keep him and her sanity? Once again, Bridget's exploits will make you laugh and make you realize that you don't have it that bad. All in all - the wait was certainly worth it."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Even better than &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;! Loosely based on Jane Austen's &quot;Persuasion,&quot; &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; had me laughing out loud in a way that I hadn't in years. Even though I am married (though I hope not smug!), I can relate to Bridget and thoroughly enjoyed her outlook on life.Read &quot;Persuasion&quot; first, then reserve a couple of evenings to sit down and enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"After having thoroughly enjoyed the first Bridget Jones book, I was all set to love the second. What a let down. The charm from the first book is completely lacking here. This reads like a strained attempt to get a second book on the market quickly -- hurried and without true feeling. Many of the same situations from the first book are repeated here, and they just seem ridiculous the second time around. Many of the British words and phrases which gave the original Bridget Jones its personality have been done away with. No more &quot;stones,&quot; now Bridget is weighing herself in pounds. We already know that Helen Fielding has talent to spare . . . hopefully she will choose to USE it in her next book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is even better than the original (v.g., v.v. funny). No, I wouldn't have believed it, either. But once I got into it I realized that Bridget had become a multi-dimensional character I cared about. So many laugh-out-loud moments of her hilarious misadventures that I lost count. (I. Am. Not. Kidding.) This will surely develop into a cult -- reminds me of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous.&quot; How can you NOT love Bridget? And even her bizarre, oh-how-you-love-to-hate-them enemies. And so many plot surprises! Just when you think the bizarre quotient has been reached, AAARGH! I will definitely recommend this to everyone I know. And I'll read it again."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I actually read Edge of Reason before I got to read the first book by Helen Fielding because I borrowed it from a friend and I loved it. It made me laugh almost every page and kept me interested and I wanted more. I did read the first book later on but I still love this book more. I have read it so many times and I never get tired of it. It's written so well that you can't take your eyes of the page and you don't lose interest. Love Bridget and love this book!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Generally, I read a book before watching the film version; however, it was the opposite with this book and film. I loved the first Bridget Jones' film and enjoyed the book even more. When I saw the second film, I was a bit bored and found that it was written with a very unrealistic plot. Edge of Reason: the book is far better than the film and even better than the first book! I could not put it down.Go out and buy it or rent it immediately!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I liked Bridget Jones's Diary, but I LOVED this one. The first was fun, but this one was laugh out loud funny. I enjoyed the movie of the first book more, actually, than I liked the book. I am so happy that I read this one instead of seeing the movie. If you have seen the movie version, don't be dissuaded. Read the book. The book is completely different and far superior. I only suggest that before you read this, you rent the A&E version of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Unless you are a P&P fan, much of the humor will be lost to you. If you haven't seen P&P, be prepared to enjoy one of the greatest works of fiction ever written."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding has done it again in this clever sequel that chronicles the life of Bridget Jones. This is a MUST READ sequel! But do not read it unless you have read the first book.This series is in my top ten of best books for women to read. It is all that a sequel should be, but not boring.If you have seen the movie but not read the book, the two are entirely different! The movie took license with the plot, and I enjoyed them both equally."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read the first book a week before The Edge of Reason so both are fresh in my mind. I found the second book more of a page turner. I was laughing out loud in bed on Sunday morning while reading the Colin Firth interview! I also saw the movie and naturally, the movie leaves out and changes many of the scenes in the book. I loved the movie, but it is a rare treat to read a book that makes you laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"\\"The Edge of Reason\\" is twice the fun and humor of the original. I read this in one night. Easy reading just like the first, but this sequel has funnier humor and plot twists and turns that you wouldn't believe. Too funny. I loved it. Absolutely!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read this book over a period of two weeks whilst on holiday, absoloutley fantastic read.Especially with the cliff hanger ending,can't wait to see if another Bridget Jones book will be hitting the stores soon.- loved itReading Olivia Joules at the moment to see if it competes well against the standard of Helen Fieldings other books.- will definetly invest in other Helen Fielding books again- highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"For some reason, I liked this second BJ than the first. Maybe it was that I already knew the characters so I didn't have to spend time learning who they were, I could just jump in and enjoy. Fielding once again manages to capture the ups and downs of Bridget with humor and care, making the reader feel like Bridget could be the girl next door."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget's back and better than ever. That old thing about characters being played out and burned out in sequels doesn't play out in here. Helen Fielding did a great job of bringing Bridget back.True, her &quot;year&quot; is longer this time around, maybe due to the overhwelming popularity of the previous one. Also, a few of the things happening here seem like cheap shots put in merely for show (our Bridge in jail?) BUT I have to admit, the overall achievement is wonderful.The characters retain their marvelous structure from the first part and obviously, if you've read the first book, you'll catch right along with this one as far as characters' psychology goes. They're still loveable (some of them), hateable (the rest of them) but all utterly human and relatable.As far as the story and the narrative style go, I don't think I ever laughed so hard at any book ever before, not even the first Bridget book and I loved that one. Cheap shots or not, the truth is I've read it twice already and it's a fun read sure to pick me up anytime.Thoroughly enjoyable whether you like the Bridget Jones movie or not. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"...it wasn't 100% on par with Bridget Jones' Diary. That said, I really did enjoy the book despite all the games poor Bridget went through, and the end was satisfying."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is one of the funniest, silliest books. Far better than its counterpart, event hough both are great, I laughed out loud by myself on a rainy day as I read this book from cover to cover. I was turned off to the original book until seeing the movie. After that I rushed out, bought this, and had a great time reading it. Bridget Jones is a character everyone should be able to relate to, appreciate and laugh with."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"All you really need to know is that this is a satisfying sequel. You've probably read the first one and are just worried that the second may be monotonous and redundant. Well, it's a little redudant, but in a thoroughly enjoyable way. Who doesn't want to watch Bridget fumble through a relationship in much the same way she fumbled through being single?Liked the first one, you'll like the second one. 'Nuff said."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is hilarious! I laughed out loud at almost every page. Being a single female in her late 20s, I found reading about Bridget Jones and her escapades with dating, work, and friendship totally entertaining and inspiring. This is the first Helen Fielding book I have read and I can't wait to read the prequel. The book is a pretty easy read, perfect if you are ready to relax and enjoy some good laughs."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"A superb sequel to a great book. I love series, and Fielding has real potential to extend the hilarious life of Bridget into several more novels (especially considering the movie deal, v.g.). Bridget is every woman-- her blunders, mishaps, and desperation make her just as real as the women you meet every day. We singletons now have a fearless role model-- Bridget, who triumphs over the inevitable screw-ups of every day life! Sit Up Britain? Make that Sit Up World! After the first book, Bridget will become your friend... but after the second she'll become your sister. Buy this book and laugh out loud!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This was a perfect follow-up to &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot;, maybe even funnier and more outlandish than the first if you can believe that! There was one point I was laughing so hard it made me cry and I could barely see the pages through my mirth! I even read it out loud to my friends and family. If you thought Bridget was faced with horrors in the original, you will be pleasantly surprised by this new onslaught. Anyone who has ever had a crush on a movie star will sympathize with Bridget in this novel. Plus, I definitely want to re-think how I am writing my Christmas cards this year!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This was such a funny and good book. I enjoyed it very much. Bridget Jones's adventures are much more witty and endearing than in the last book, although I do think that the escapade in Thailand was a bit far fetched, but it was all funny and lovable anyway! And I just love Mark Darcy, the man of our dreams right? He was awesome, and totally handled everything, v. cool. And Rebecca, we just want to rip her eyes out, anyway, read this book, better than the first, and definitely more funny!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Excellent sequel, (although the middle lags, the end makes up for it) esp. if you have read Jane Austen's &quot;Persuasion&quot; - Helen Fielding again uses an Austen framework to great success.NB Mark Darcy's conversation with Rebecca in the shrubbery, Admiral Darcy slipping that a (wrong) Darcy son is getting married, Rebecca jumping and getting hurt, and then falling in love with another invalid, Mark Darcy giving a letter to Bridget, after he &quot;forgets&quot; his pen, etc."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The only bad thing about this book is that it had to end! I was entirely enthralled by it. It is absolutely one of the most hilarious books I have ever read. The story and the format of the book is unusual and excellent. It further follows the trials and tribulations of &quot;30 something&quot; Bridget Jones who is a &quot;singleton&quot; and lives in London. Whether you are married, single, or what have you, you can totally relate to the things she goes through. They are things you think in your head or say to yourself but she writes them. I did not read the first book but saw the movie first, which in itself was hysterical, too. I think it helped me as I was able to put pictures with the characters. I have gotten all my friends hooked on this. I would sit on the train and come too dangerously close to my stop home because I couldn't put it down, not to mention the strange looks I would get because I would be laughing so hard! I HIGHLY recommend this book to ANY female. You will not be sorry, except that you will then be a &quot;Bridget Junkie&quot;. Please write the next one and do a sequel on the movie with the same cast! GAHHHH!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I loved this book as much as the first one. I felt like these were friends of mine. I cannot ever remember laughing as much with a book as I did with the Bridget Jones books. It you are in the mood for a light-hearted, silly read, this is the one for you. I recommended this book to many of my girlfriends and their husbands read them as well, probably enjoying them more. They're not just for women, although many women, such as I, can relate completely. I hope you enjoy them."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"What starts out as a voyeuristic glimpse at an addictive personality that makes the reader feel so superior and in control, actually turns into a disaster-ridden route to maturity with actual character development.One caution-if you don't know that silk cuts are cigarettes or what snogging is, you'd be wise to be armed with a British English-American English dictionary. Otherwise you'll stumble around in amusement looking for clues to the meaning of quirky British-isms like I did.\\"The Edge\\" is fun escapist reading."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"What can one say about Ms. Fielding's endearing character Ms. Bridget Jones? Another hilarious romp with Bridget. She remains as good hearted and as good natured as she was in the first novel and there couldn't be a female alive who wouldn't relate to Ms. Jones and her experiences. There should be nothing but gender pride for the honest and light hearted way in which Helen Fielding writes of female complexities and the chaotic emotions it can create. Although in this novel, Bridget's hijinks carry her a little afar, I continue to pass her adventures onto reading friends who may need a little lift and a few giggles, maybe just to remind them of who we are. . . and, hey, who ever said we all had to be so serious about everything anyway? Let's all sincerely hope this will not be the last that we'll hear from our dear friend -Ms. Bridget Jones. (Oops. Tumbled over.)"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Halarious---that's all you need to know. A laugh a minute!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Lots of fun.... more of the same Bridget we've all grown to love. Also fun with Jude, Shazzer, and Vile Richard.

Hurrah!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"My cousin sent me Bridget Jones's Diary. I loved it. When I found out there was a sequel I ran to the store to get a copy. The Edge of Reason is a MUST for any Bridget fan. She will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I just finished reading this book the other day. I cannot believe that Helen Fielding was able to produce another diary of Bridget Jones.This character just gets better and better. Her misadventures with Mark and Thailand was so hilarious.This books just shows there is a Bridget Jones inside all of us. BRAVO!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"But a definite read in my opinion. Perhaps it was because I read the first book just the day before I bought the second, but it seemed that many of the things that had me ROTFL in the first, were used again in the second (such as the tumbling bit). Much like the first book had been rewritten and made longer.Also, for all of you who think Bridget is shallow, etc.: I think it is terrific that Bridget knows that she shouldn't smoke, drink, etc., and that she has goals to improve herself. You that criticize must have such a boring life, in addition to being unremorsefully full of bad habits."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding is the funniest British author-- I love Bridget Jones! We Americans are not keeping up -- except Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, which is very much like Bridget Jones, in that both are about the funny, desperately tragic business of love.I recommend these books to anyone who wants to laugh while reading a great book!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I truely adored this book. I liked it so much that I read it in just one day. I thought the sequel was better than the first simply because I thought this one was funnier. The only problem I had with it though was the whole trip to Thailand. The part was just silly. The book would have been 10,000 times funnier without it, but I digress. Do your self a favor a check out this book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Although not packing quite the punch of its predecessor, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is still relatively witty and amusing as poor Bridget bumbles through her life and the series of many mishaps, coincidences and a strange, out-of-place, but intriguing ending. Definitely a good book to pick up when you're feeling the effects of Bridget Withdrawal!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is one of the funniest, silliest books I've ever read.

I was laughing so hard I starting snorting! No novel in recent memory has made me laugh so much. The first half of the book is non-stop laughter and Bridget's relationship woes throughout the book are a comic delight. The book becomes a wonderful comedy of errors and misunderstandings that could happen to anyone of us. I will say I was disgusted with the Jed subplot. The Thailand holiday mishap was not only unrealistic, but it brought back memories of a recent movie with the same plot. However, this book is so hilarious it hardly registers.Kudos to Helen Fielding on writing one of the funniest novels in recent years!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I was a little apprehensive to read a sequel to one of my favorite books, but this surpassed my expectations. It's too bad the movie failed to capture some of my favorite moments of both of the books, but Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones is often funny (I have laughed so hard I cried in both books), touching, and I'm sure can remind anyone of themselves at some point. If you're normal."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read Bridget Jones' Diary and Edge of Reason one after the other and it's unfair to compare since it's really like one big enjoyable book. It was so sad to see the first one end, but Fielding does such a great job of just continuing where it left off and giving readers more of what they want: Bridget &quot;Caught in the middle of trouble&quot; Jones. Bridget and men; Bridget and her mom; Bridget and her friends and enemies; Bridget and her job; Bridget and her diet; Bridget and her self-help books; and finally, what everyone hoped for from the beginning, Bridget and her success. In terms of comparison, I couldn't help but think of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; while reading both books, and without a doubt Bridget Jones wins hands down. If you miss laughing out loud (not the &quot;lol&quot; kind) pick up both books, a bottle(s) of wine and dig in. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is sheer bliss. The second Bridget book is far more focused than the first while even funnier. If you liked the first one you will adore and highly appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I laughed so much out loud that it was embarrassing! There were pages I shamelessly turned back to just to laugh again. I saw the original Bridget Jones at the movies, then had to read this sequel right away. This book has a wonderful way of making you feel very good about your life, there are things we all need to do, ie.loose 5 lbs. CONSTANTLY, and Bridget admits it!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I purchased this book immediately upon completion of Bridget Jones's Diary. I could not wait to see where her life would lead, and if she would be able to work out some of her problems. Bridget, Shazzer, Jude, Tom, and Magda also help the reader see the importance of friends. Although Bridget encounters more disasters in this book, things definitely seem to be looking up for her. Once again, the reader will catch a glimpse of herself in the book's characters. V.G. book. Can't wait for the next episode."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The Sequal to the famout Bridet Jones's Diary is even better than the first! She gets into even more akward situations than before! Guarenteed to make you laugh twice as hard as you did in the first one!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"If you loved Bridget round one and have a special place in your heart for Colin Firth, you too will love this book. The Bridget duet became a quick way of life as I started to see aspects of her life in mine. From the mundane to the absurd, Helen Fielding nows how to tap into the crazy, aways hectic lifestyle of late twentysomethings and thirtysomethings. Treat yourself to a weekend of indulgent laughter, great foods and best of all, one of the best chick books I've ever read.I'd also highly recommend a weekend of Pride and Predjuice with Colin Firth. What great eye candy! Enjoy."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book was a laugh riot! I read Bridget Jones's Diary, and finished it craving more. When I opened Bridget Jones edge of reason I couldn't put it down. She is always getting into something, or trying to get out of something. I love this book, and hope that there will be more to come from Helen Fielding."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I have not read the first book nor did I see the movie. It was a real treat to meet Bridget and her friends in this hilarious book! The great thing about it is that...any woman can relate to Bridget in some way or another. The book was a very quick, easy read and a great escape throughout the day. Whenever things got boring, I'd just take this book out...it was a great refresher (somehow my life just seemed so much better...yet, when stepping on the scale in the morning...Bridget's life seemed way too familiar ;). This book should be taken lightly even though some of her &quot;adventures&quot; seem out there, just remember...it's a FICTION book :) HAVE FUN...and even splurge on the hard cover...it's on sale;)"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Loved both the Bridget books. This one didn't suffer being the sequel.I laughed out loud at some of the scenes. I stay up and read in bed on weekend nights - I woke my husband up laughing so hard at this one! The author has a really visual sense of humour. The story was good and it moved quickly.Really fun."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I laughed my head off while reading this book. It's absolutely hillarious. Fielding definitely has a wonderful sense of humor. Briget is such a likable character. She's every woman. What she thinks about, I have thought about. It is so refreshing to see a woman be normal. Fielding goes into more detail with Briget's and Darcy's relationship, too. There are some very funny scenes in this book that really knock your socks off. I know that this is unthinkable, but this is better than the first. Enjoy it and be prepared to laugh, cry, and lust (after Mr. Darcy that is)."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"As Homer Simpson said &quot;It's funny because it's true!&quot; This story of an urban woman hits the mark."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"In this book, there is one thing that is worth pondering upon: when we are overwhelmed by our sense of insecurity, do we not make our judgment based on the understanding of the characters and situations but rather on the fear of losing one's ego? And in fact, when insecurity comes to attack us, few can escape from that fate. However, if we have found our true love, no matter how mischievously fate has acted upon us, we would eventually come around, let go of the fear and embrace our good luck with a full heart. I love the metaphor of Velveteen Rabbit. In real life, don't we all feel the love and anguish just like that little Velveteen Rabbit?"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I was excited to read this book after having finished the first one. I absolutely love the relationship between Bridget and Mark. He is such a tiger under all that hard, cold aloof exterior, as portrayed in the 1st book and in the movie, (which Colin Firth played wonderfully). Bridget is exactly what he needs, someone who can show him the bright, fun side of the world. She never fails to make me laugh, especially the horse incident at the beginning (as with the fireman's pole in &quot;Diary&quot;). This is not a sequel, merely a continuation. Fielding once again writes brilliantly. If you liked Diary, you will love and laugh once again! It's wonderful to see Bridget so happy!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I knew I would never love a book like I did Bridget's Diary, but Helen Fielding proved me wrong. This sequal had me laughing too many times to count. It is a hilarious look into Bridgett's life the year following her first diary. We see the same folks-- including Mark Darcy, Shaz, Jude &amp; Vile Richard-- and some new ones are thrown in there too. Poor Bridgett's life is just a series of downs, but her drunken/self help kind of attitude just keeps you wanting more."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I'm one of those readers that finish things to the bitter end. It's telling that the first time I read The Edge of Reason, I chucked it. I was so disgusted with Bridget's psychotic ramblings on her thighs. As sweet and hilarious as she can be, it made me wonder just how stupid she could be. The first fifty pages of Edge of Reason answered that question far too well (really, can you fully love a character who doesn't know where Germany is?). While its longer length delighted me at first, once I began the book, I couldn't wait for the end of the year.It's probably worth 3.5 stars and isn't a complete waste. I re-attempted the book a year later and didn't find Bridget's neuroses nearly so annoying, although some of the events Helen Fielding conjures up are so far from the realm of realism, that it didn't feel quite like I was getting to know Bridget. The diary format worked so well in the original, but the sequel lacks the narrative structure and insights of BJD (probably since Fielding borrowed so heavily (but creatively) from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice for the first Diary). This one is modeled after Persuasion, also by Austen, but it's done in a haphazard, careless way that only begins to dawn on you in the middle of the novel.What makes this one fun is a familiarity with the ever exasperatingly adorable Bridget, the deliciously befuddled Mark Darcy, and the usual cast of side characters - all tinged with British humor. It's better as a stand-alone because you can't help but be disappointed if you follow up the prequel with The Edge of Reason. Good beach or plane reading, but no need to run out to the store for this one."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Number of minutes since finished delightful Bridget Jones sequel,&quot;Edge of Reason:&quot; 127. Hated to see it come to an end. If you liked the movie, you'll love this book. Inspired to start own diary. Probably won't, as am too lazy and dread thought of personal shagging record falling into wrong hands."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"...so much so that I ordered the follow-up from the UK so that I wouldn't have to wait months more for the US release. I should have waited. Our Bridge has become self-conscious and both too sleazy and too posh. Her problems have become a bit non-relatable and she's more of a pain with fewer mitigating traits. Yes, I really liked &quot;Diary,&quot; and I'm much more likely to read that one again than this..."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"&quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason&quot; picks up 4 weeks after &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; left off. Bridget is now in a relationship, but the honeymoon is definitely over, and they're with each other. Bridget is still concerned with her weight, and is whining just as much as usual.While this was a good book, I enjoyed the first one much more."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"For those who thought that the original was funny, this one is HI-LARIOUS!!! I just could not put it down, and when I would constantly wake up my boyfriend with raucous laughter, I had no one to blame but Bridget and Colin Firth."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I liked the first installment of Bridget's misadventures in singleness a great deal, and I had high expectations going into round two, &quot;The Edge of Reason.&quot; Despite my high expectations, Fielding's sequel delivered on every count, perhaps going even further than the first novel in its engagement with the more comic side of contemporary gender relations in British culture.If you liked &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary,&quot; I have a hard time believing you wouldn't like this book just as much as the first. The tone is similar but more assured (the diary data at the outset of each chapter, for example, are far more varied and inventive in this second book), and we get more hijinks with our favorite wackoes from the first book (including the pathetic Daniel Cleaver) and meet even newer wackoes, like Gary the professional Builder but impassioned part-time...angler?What I liked even better about this book, though, was that Fielding pulls no emplotment punches and riddles the narrative with one out-of-left-field surprise after another. These surprises often amount to little more than local episodes that are opened and wrapped within a chapter or two, but others become jokes that run (and run well) for the duration of the novel, including the mishaps in Thailand, the speculations over the sexual orientation of one of Bridget's uncles, and the ridiculously exoticist treatment of a young African man by Bridget's mother.Which leads me (in a roundabout way) to the final thing that makes this novel, for me at least, as timely as it is fun: &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; seems more willing to address (even if only via satire) contemporary social ills than Fielding's first novel did. While &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; seemed to confine its attention to Bridget's relationship woes (and I'm not complaining about that focus at all), &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; parodies British attitudes toward race, globalization, sexuality, and broader discussions of gender (the constant pokes at Nick Hornby's figuring of today's British male are especially funny). While the engagement with these topics is far from thorough, I do think that it broaches its chosen social themes in a gentle way.In short, I am confident that fans of the first volume of Bridget's diary will like this second tome at least as much. Does Fielding have another one in her? I hope so."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book was even better than the first one! It had me in stitches! As usual, Bridget is constantly struggling with work, her (keeping her) boyfriend, (losing) weight, (quitting) smoking and (quitting) drinking. One thing that was much more evident in The Edge of Reason than BJD was the way Fielding shines in writing about normal things. She really makes them seem spectacular.I have to admit that my favorite part was Bridget's interview with her favorite actor--and wearer of wet, white shirts--Colin Firth. I was literally laughing aloud. The book is worth it just for that part alone! Also memorable is Bridget's stint in jail. Women all over will relate to Bridget. Great fun!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"As a fan of the first novel, I was anxious to read Fielding's sequel to Bridget Jones's Diary. I found her follow up very disappointing. While there were a few funny moments that almost every woman could relate to, this installment of her diary was filled with the most insane events. The strength and appeal of the first book was that it Bridget's life seemed to mirror the lives of so many women. However, this book makes one believe that Fielding was desperate for something to give Bridget to do."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I saw some critics review this book before I read it myself, and none of them had anything good to say. I debated even reading it at all, thinking that if the critics were right, it wouldn't even be worth it. Fortunately, I let my remembered enjoyment of the first Bridget Jones novel outweigh the degrogatory critical comments. This is a fun book! All of your old aquaintances are back, and Bridget continues to do more embarrassing things than you ever would, so you end up saying to yourself &quot;Well, I may do idiotic things, but at least I've never done THAT!&quot; It's almost as if Bridget becomes the sacrifical lamb of ancient times, making all possible embarrassing mistakes on the behalf of single women the world over so we don't have to - and the best part is, after all those flub-up's, she still gets her happy ending."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I loved Edge of Reason, particuarly the Thai jail sequence and Colin Firth interview. All in all I thought it was a great follow-up despite certain repetitions of what we'd had before. But it was a good, funny read and I was pretty much engrossed in Bridget's misadventures. Also have to recommend The Trials of Tiffany Trott, another singleton/dating novel - a complete scream!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I was thrilled with this sequel. I love the style in which Fielding writes; it gives the reader a real since of what life is actually like through Bridget's eyes and leaves out all of the \\"fancy fluff\\" that can be tedious. Once I began reading this book I could not put it down until 4 hours later when I realized it was 3am! It is so much fun to read and the ending leaves you feeling all warm and happy. We have all been in \\"Bridget Situations\\" and I'm sure we can all totally relate to her daily life. It is wondefully witty and, in Bridget's drunken terms \\"blurdy hurd terput down!\\""},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Yes, Bridget Jones is indeed back. As before, she's just flaky enough so that we can all empathize with her when she's facing problems and still all laugh at her, not with her, when she tries to solve them.Those self-help books give Bridget ideas. As only she can say, \\"They are a new form of religion. It's almost as if human beings are like streams of water so when an obstacle is put in their way, they bubble up and surge around it to find another path.\\"Bridget wonders a great deal about the deeper issues of reality, such as whether Men think about Women.My biology textbook says that the invention of sex made life more complex. Well, it sure has made Bridget's life more complex. We're all lucky that there aren't several more sexes, given the problems Bridget has coping with only two of them.I highly recommend this very entertaining book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This sequel to \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\", is one that exceeds all expectations, being that it is far better than the first one.In this book, Helen Fielding cleverly gives her character a whole bunch of new experiences, some of which are truly ingenious (e.g. jail).Most of the other characters appear and a few new ones as well, while the book offers more pleasure, being thicker than its prequel.You will definetely enjoy this!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding's latest offering, \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,\\" picks up from where it's predecessor, \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" left off. We are instantly plunged into the normality of a committed relationship, as Bridget and Mark ebulliently commence their lives together. While you may speculate the turbulence of Bridget's life to be over, now she is curling up beside the man of her dreams, let me say that there are few clich&eacute;'s Helen Fielding subscribes to and this situation promises to be no exception. It doesn't take long for the preposterousness that is her life to resurface and we then return to that fantastic and unpredictable roller coaster ride, that has become synonymous with Bridget Jones's life.Although being in a committed relationship for a month, Bridget soon senses her relationship to be in jeopardy with the arrival of a leggy, exquisite looking stick insect, by the name of Rebecca. A long time arch enemy, who happens to coincidentally appear in all the wrong places In true Bridget style her insecurities begin to flourish and the incident with the Filipino boy in Mark's bed, doesn't exactly alleviate the stresses in her life. Not to mention the fact that her mother is up to her normal tricks and looking to once again dump her father for a few weeks while she experiences Kenya with Una. Her old friends of course return to give her the much needed advice that she could honestly do without and her self help books are of course again in close proximity.Neurotic Bridget's life quickly becomes the formulaic chain of disasters readers previously have come to relish. It is at this point you don't believe that Bridget's life could possibly get any worse. That is until her first freelance interview in Italy with Colin Firth, which in essence can be described any way but successful. And what about that large hole in her apartment wall where it looks like a bomb has hit. Not to mention the death threat made on her life and where is that weird smell in her apartment emanating from?Helen Fielding has once again delivered a novel that I could easily exemplify as literary, romantic comedy perfection, by challenging the genre. Something which seems to be synonymous with the author's name. A tradition which started in the mid 1990's with her lesser known offering, Cause Celeb. Another comedy which also alters the perimeters of the genre, by basing it's lead heroine Rosie Richardson in Africa running a relief camp, after breaking up with her celebrity boyfriend. This story line also proves to be anything but by the book. However, Bridget readers will relish in this latest installment which has more sharp turns in its content than ever thought imaginable.I would have to say that if possible this book promises to be an even better read than its original counterpart. The story line is far more dramatic and comical and Bridget manages to entangle herself in a great deal more trouble than she did in the first. Especially when reflecting on her time in Thailand, where Bridget's life takes a highly unpredictable, yet surprisingly comedic, turn for the worst. And will the handsome Mr Darcy once again prevail to be her night in shinning armor or will it be Danielle Cleaver's turn ? You'll just have to read it to find out."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Having read the first book, I thought it only natural to read the second.In the first I was laughing like a hyena and in the second I was splitting my sides.This book is an absolute improvement on the first, the fact that she is with Mark, then not with Mark, then arrested by Thai authorities for a really quite ridiculous reason and then once again Mark Darcy comes to her rescue is just brilliant.Fielding describes Bridget's escapades with a very witty eye and an unique sense of humour, even if they are sometimes quite far fetched.How can one not love Bridget Jones? And how can anyone not love Mark Darcy?"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I was just looking for an easy vacation read, and wound up getting a new obsession! I just loved this book, thought it was better than the first and was v. proud of our heroine and her humanity. Brillant writing, hilarious, funny, sad and so, so true.I have reread the end dozens of times,and wound up taking the Pride and Prejudice videos out of the library just to sink even more into Bridge's world! Can't wait for the movie or another sequel!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"It's hard to top a great book. The Edge of Reason wasn't quite as good as the original Bridget Jones' Diary. Bridget and Mark Darcy are still loveable. And Bridget is closer to the edge of insanity than the edge of reason throughout the book. It made me glad that I'm not still single! What saved the book was when Bridget was wrongly imprisoned in Thailand. This is one book that will probably be better as a movie."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I thought the first one was good, but I could not put this book down. I was up until 4 in the morning reading it. The sequel continues from where the first one ended. This is a laugh out loud, page turning, plot twisting story. I loved it and want to read it again. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding has done it again. I didn't think she could top the first book, but she has done it with style.Th edge of reason is compulsively, readable and good for the Singleton soul. After reading it three times, I come home after a rough day with my psychotic bosses and clients and read a few pages, it always rouses me out of despair.If Bridget can find humour in her life and work, which sound like pure torture compared to mine, so can I.Bring on the next one Helen!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The life of Bridget Jones is enchanting. i read it on the plane and kept getting weird looks from the other passengers when I burst out laughing. It's a riot. I'd reccomend it to anyone who needed or wanted a good laugh."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I adored the first Bridget Jones novel, so naturally was very eager to get my hands on this latest one. What a disappointment! Bridget is just silly in this one. I found myself not really caring what happened to her. And let's face it, in this sort of book, it's not like there won't be a happy ending. The whole way through, I couldn't shake the feeling that Helen Fielding was only in it for the money in this instance. Not the worst book I've ever read, but disappointing given the pleasure I derived from the first one."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"For all of you waiting to hear about Bridget's latest travails, take heed: this book was worth the wait! Bridget's back and with a vengeance. Admittedly, I worried that having a boyfriend would change her, make her complacent but that is decidedly not the case. Her romance with Mark Darcy is anything but happily ever after, and is filled with typical male/female miscommunication, signals gone awry, and an upper-crusty upstart who trys to hone in on her man. Her friends inevitably help make matters worse. While Bridget agonizes about love and getting shagged, she is talked into renovating her apartment with hilarious and devastating results. A vacation trip to Thailand becomes the trip from hell. The only downside to this delicious sequel is that we don't see enough of her gay friend, Tom. He was wonderful in &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; but his character's role is significantly reduced here. Still, that is no reason to miss this book. This is a must-have and a must-read, whether you're a smug married or not!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I had been waiting and waiting for the follow up to BJ's diary. I couldn't wait for the US version so I picked up the book from Amazon.uk. It was worth it. Bridget is as neurotic as ever. Compared to the first book it isn't as good but it is still worth reading and is a lot of fun. I have seen a few reviews, mainly the People Magazine review that panned the book. But that reviewer says just about everything sucks, so buy the book and decide for yourself. True fans of Bridget won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"First off...if you are thinking of purchasing this book because you saw the first, or more to the point, the *second* Bridget Jones movie, stop right there. While it's typical for an adaptation of a book to the big screen to take creative liberties, Helen Fielding's second Bridget-book is nothinggg like the second movie. Period.I first saw the original Bridget Jones movie, then read the book was was fairly disappointed by the extreme erraticness Bridget displayed in the book that was cut down for the big screen. Afterwards I watched the second movie, fell asleep about 3/4 of the way in, and felt bad for Renee Zewelleger for having to sing Madonna with a tampon as her microphone. I recently settled down the read the second book, and re-watch the second movie and they are extremely different!Essentially in both cases the book picks up a month to a month and a half after Bridget Jones and her leading man from the previous book end up together. She is blissfully happy, but at teh same time extremely paranoid, judgemental, and constantly seeking the advice of her romance-handicapped friends.Eventually Bridget and said man break up, under a series of accusations and misunderstandings, and most importantly, fears. The big difference here between the movie and the book is in the film, Bridget breaks up with her guy under vague suspicion he is having an affair with a co-worker, Rebecca, who ends up being a lesbian that fancies Bridget. In the book however, Rebecca really is trying to seperate Bridget and her fella, and more or less successfully does so.The rest of the story from there follows Bridget's depression, subsequent attempts to cheer herself up, and a couple of 'major' events including her best friend getting married, an interview with Colin Firth, and a trip to Thailand. Didn't see those first two in the film? That's because they never happened in the movie version. As well, the role of the 'other' man in Bridget's life, who shall also remain nameless, takes on a MUCH smaller role in the book than in the film - but that one you can chalk up to star power quota.All in all the second book is an improvement over the film, unlike the slightly disappointing first novel in comparison to the movie. If you like the writing of Helen Fielding you'll be pleased to find it still entertaining, slightly easier to read, and as wacky as the first book. I found much of the story bogged down with weird sub-plots and Bridget's complete psychoticness at times, but it was certainly better than the first book, and second film."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Ok so I liked... no LOVED the book, it gets you from the begining to the end... YES it is better than the first. I didn't want to put it down and I didn't want it to end. It is sooo grippingly real, it has you on the edge of your seat... I could feel what Bridget was feeling,...When reading it, I am Bridget, that's good writing. I can not wait for the movie to come out. I know it'll be great fun... Please do yourself a favor and read it!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I thought the first book was a little more realistic and you can relate with the characters, well maybe except for Bridget's Mom (A very annoying character). With the second book there were some parts that were laugh out loud but I find myself getting irritated with the characters more often than not. Bridget just became this dumb girl who didn't have any common sense, not knowing what is right and what is wrong; and the part when Bridget and Mark broke up, I didn't feel like there was any valide reason behind it. I'm pretty dissapointed with this book, I had high expectations after reading the first book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Like most of the reviewers, I enjoyed the first Briget Jones's Diary because her insecurities and fumbling we all have been through at one point in our lives. I was really looking forward to the second one but I found this Bridget just awfully stupid! My god, how many times can a person shoot herself in the foot? The interview part with Colin I couldn't even finish because you knew she was going to screw it up. Why must Fielding make Bridget perpetually incompetent? After a while you could telegraph the plot because you knew Bridget was going to make a dumb move. I hate to say it, but she is an borderline idiot with friends who undermine her relationships and self-confidence.I couldn't relate to Bridget in this round, and I yearn for the day when more women writers will make a more complex heroine, whose goal in life is not just about reducing flabby thighs and catching a man before her eggs dry out!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I finished this book last night and miss it already. I liked it better than the original, and that's quite a compliment considering how much I enjoyed that one. Mark and Bridget make a great couple....I can't wait to find out what happens next!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"What I loved about the first one was that it was simple and &quot;real.&quot; The situations were hilarious and the hilarity was subtle and exquisite. The first book was also very chipper - even though she had some bad times, you knew she would be &quot;ok&quot; at the end.This one began slowly and got more and more depressing as it continued. I was very disapointed in the portrayal of Mark Darcy who is &quot;meek&quot; and &quot;didn't know he was being hit on&quot; etc. He plays the &quot;poor man who was seduced by a woman and had no choice in the matter&quot; inanely.Bridget is a strong char - and to make a weak mate for her is as unreal as her getting arrested in Thailand- *ugh*."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Who says sequels are never as good as the original. Edge of Reason contains all of the wit, satire and, yes, originality of Bridget Jones' Diary. Bridget Jones is such a memorable and likeable character that it's impossible not to be engaged by Ms. Fielding's works. She has created an entirely entertaining and fresh look at the whole thirty something singleton scene. Along with Fried Calamari and Shopgirl, this is the best book I've read in the past year. Now, we'll have to wait and see if the movie version of Bridget Jones' Diary can live up to it's lofty expectations."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I have waited soooooo long for this book. Thank goodness Helen Fielding has done it again! The first Bridget Jones was fab and this one comes in a very close second. Although there are times you wish you could hit fast forward, there is so much going on with each chapter, you feel that if you do, you will surely miss something hysterical. I must say....the final chapters are by far the most superior. I laughed out loud on numerous occasions and even stooped so low as to take my book to work so I could finish! Hurrah for Bridge! She's someone we've all been at some point in our lives(or currently are)to one extent or the other. It definitely is a feel good book. I passed the first one around to so many friends that I'll have to come up with a waiting list for the second. Keep them coming Helen!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Up for another dose of bridget and her pals? You will love this book, it's funny and touching. Fielding once again takes the reader into Bridget's somewhat unorganized and caotic lifestyle. You will laugh at how Fielding makes the everday ordinary absolutely hilarious!Edge of Reason takes off right where Bridget Jones's Diary ends. Bridget and Mark Darcy are together but keep reading to find out what happens with them. The cast is once again funny and their everyday antics will have you laughing uncontrollably!This was an excellent book to read. I loved Bridget Jones's Diary, but this was so much better!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Fans of Bridget Jones diary will not be disappointed by this hilarious sequel. Helen Fielding has done it again. She has crafted an entertaining and truly funny novel that is sure to entertain all but the most grumpy of readers. Where as most comic novels I read make me think their jokes are very clever, Fieldings jokes make me think they are clever and I am amazed at how creative she can be. This sort of humor is probably very difficult to sustain, but Fielding is a master. Bridget is a slightly silly person, a bit on the unrealistic side, but I suppose diaries (as this is) may include ones ultimate unrealistic fantasies (like being rescued by Colin Firth or Prince William). While Bridget is on the edge of reason, her on-again off-again boyfriend is the voice of reason and the perfect comic foil. Her friends are as wacky as she is and their antics are sure to amuse as are Bridget's comments about everyone and everything around her. Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is solid entertainment and certainly worth reading. I seriously could not put it down after the first 50 pages. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"So often, sequels fail to live up to the promise of the original. Luckily this is not the case with &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; which is as good as, if not better, than the original.This time around, Bridget finds herself singing Madonna lyrics in a Thai prison, waiting for the dustbin to ring dressed in nothing but her knickers, and falling in love with a certain Mr. Darcy. More of a romance and funnier than the original, this one is a winner (v.v.g.)"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I was so looking forward to the new adventures of Ms. Jones after finding her to be a loveable and indentifiable character in the previous book. However, Edge of Reason has turned her into a characature of an altogether rediculous human being. Her adventures are not the slightly blown versions of the real thing, but plain outlandish (Thai prison, naked youth with rabbit in boyfriends bed, death threat, etc). Unfortunately, this book came off as a hurried attempt to reap in on the profits created by the first Jones book. Surely most fans of the original novel will find it a sad sellout, and a poor representation of the character they have come to adore."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I eagerly awaited the sequel to Bridget Jones Diary and it did not disappoint. Warning: Do not read this book on the bus. I did and the book was so funny, I had to bite my lip as I shook with laughter so the other passengers on the bus would not think I was some 'talk to myself' mental patient. Once again Bridget and her friends analyze all relationships through a myriad of self-help dating books which provide conflicting advice. (I'm glad I got married 29 years ago before it became necassary to analyze all actions of the opposite sex to determine what they really meant.) Bridget compulsively sets daily goals and resolutions and then does whatever she wants. This is the funniest book I've read since Bryson's A Walk in the Woods, which I also recommend. This book has universal appeal-my wife, daughter, son, and daughter -in-law all read Bridget Jones Diary and enjoyed it as I'm sure they will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I found this book just as enjoyable as its prequel. Beneath the humor there is something sweet and simple about Bridget Jones that make her, despite her flaws, a very lovable character. In the book, Bridget continues her relationship with the dependable Mark Darcy and is sure she has finally found the path to being loved. Reality, however, would prove her wrong. The intrusion of a traitorous friend into their lives shatter her and Mark's relationship, although it is obvious from the reader's point of view that they are still very much in love with one another. Misunderstandings, scary parents, and self help books weave in and out of the story line, adding incredible humor to Bridget's upside-down-whirlwind life. In the end it is Bridget--loyal, gullible, naive, and at times embarrassing--who perseveres. And with that Helen Fielding has restored my faith in the order of this chaotic world."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"You don't know how much I loved this book. I was pissing myself laughing from page one!! I put off reading it, because I didn't think it could live up to its predecessor, but it was better - there was more of a journey to it, more a feeling of being swept along in the chaotic, but wonderful (I think) life of Bridge.It was also sad at a couple of points, but mostly it was side-splittingly, painfully familiarly, hilarious!!I fell in love with Mark Darcy's character. I went and saw the movie of the first book soon after I finished this sequel, and I wanted them to tack part two onto the end of it!! I couldn't stop talking about it.Bridge also shows her vulnerable side a little more in this offering, growing up a little (but don't fret - not too much!) along the way. Her friends Jude and Shazzer also provide us with plenty of laughs, as does her Mum with her new project - an African tribesman!!One of the funniest parts is Bridget's interview with one of her most beloved celebrities. You've gotta read this book! (Read the first one first of course) It's beautiful!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Diary style ever more implausible (reminds me of Henry Fielding's satirical novel Shamela) but still plenty of laughs at expense of earnest but misguided career gal looking for true love.While the first Bridget Jones Diary made a splash as funhouse mirror reflection of Sex and The City type gals, this time the plot goes just a little too wacko. At times, text could seem a bit embarassing and truly degrading of women, but Fielding puts in enough humanity and tenderness to avert a real disaster.This sequel has a little less for self-deprecating readers to humorously identify with, simply because Bridget has become almost a caricature of her silly but truly satirical debut. I don't want to spoil the bizarre twists and turns of vol 2, so I'll say no more about those.Cetainly plenty to laugh at, so those readers who were wild about the first novel should still find enjoyment in this one. It's got the now-familiar humor addressing diet, overindulgence, dress and makeup disasters, career advancement strategies, and list-making.Movie treatment of this novel rather different from the text!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"the sequel is definitely much better than bjd. it is more interesting n the story is more exciting with rebecca, the boyfriend-snatching ex-girlfriend who tried to wrench mark away from bridget. i kept reading on to find out what happened in the end and was very satisfied with the ending. i totally agree with cindy that mark darcy is definitely the man of our dreams, kinda envy bridget for having such a wonderful boyfriend. n i like the parallels (found in the sequel) with persuasion by jane austen. i wish helen fielding can write a second sequel soon cos i can't wait to find out what's going to happen to bridget, mark, jude, shaz etc. i recommend this book to anyone who's wanting to relax with a funny, light and endearing book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I was so excited to see the sequal to the famous Diary, and I was not disappointed! I took this book along with me on my recent honeymoon to Jamaica, and I couldn't put it down! There I was, perched out on a beach chair at the beautiful Carribean Sea, and all I could do is keep my head in my book! I had to find out if Bridget wins against evil Rebecca or survives strange happenings in Indonesia. This is one of the few books that has made me laugh out loud!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Both &quot;Bridget Jones Diary&quot; and this follow-up, &quot;The Edge of Reason,&quot; are v. funny reading. How someone as clueless as Bridget can keep coming out on top of every difficult situation in her life -- from a crazed mother to a disappearing builder to an incompetent boss, a menacing ex-boyfriend, rotting meat, an international drug incident, and a nice-guy boyfriend -- leaves me shaking my head and smiling. I want to find Bridget annoying and dim, but I can't. It's a good author who can make a bumbling character so beguiling and endearing. These are delightful, funny books!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"After reading and loving the first book, there was much excitment to read Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. However, it was a big dissapointment. It is not funny, or even entertaining. I give it 2 stars only for the last pages, of Bridget's christmas cards (which were hillarious). However, I don't think the joke is worth a whole book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was like sitting and having a chat with an old friend."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding did a good job when she wrote &quot;the diary&quot; but she shouldn't have written The Edge of Reason. Chasing a man and being jealous of other women is a lame plot and the book adds nothing to the first one. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Cigs smoked while reading this book- 7 (vg). Calories consumed while reading this book- 1,000 (v.bad) Times I laughed out loud while reading this book: who can count that high? What can I say? Unlike the masses, I actually enjoyed this book more than the Original! Bridget is funnier &amp; has more bizarre problems than in the initial book.... I found myself laughing out loud by the third page and finishing the last page that same night. I could not put this book down.... I can't wait to see the movie, but hope that they will replace Renee Zelweger with someone a little more Bridgetesque.. Pick up a copy of this book. You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Am I the only person in the world who is sick of hearing every new book compared to the Bridget Jones Diary? Reviewers have even shortened the book title to BJ or BJD. For as much praise the book is getting, you would like that an unpublished Jane Austen manuscript.Don't get takeninto the Hollywood hype. This book isn't that great! Pick up a copy of Jane Green's Mr. Maybe. Or if you have to, rent it on DVD. Atleast you get to look at Hugh Grant and Colin Firth for your money."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read to page 10 and thought I could care less about this story...a young woman who thinks a six-week relationship that involves sex is a form of commitment...where has she been? She may need a copy of The Rules, a health exam to be sure she hasn't a dread disease, and some help getting some confidence in her own life. This is no longer funny, but rather pitiful. The first book seemed funy, but she learns nothing and is obviously doomed to repeat her life in daily notations that add up to little or nothing. ..................."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"After reading \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" (which I HIGHLY recommend), I was thrilled to learn that Helen Fielding had written \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" as a sequel! After reading it, I was definately disappointed.Although this book is filled with Bridget's quirky insight and tendency to find herself in comical situations, I found that some instances where too over-the-top. I think the author tried too hard by making Bridget even more forgetful, klutzy and irresponsible - so much so, that I found it so annoying at times that I would put the book down. That was opposite the case while reading \\"Bridget Jone's Diary\\", I LOL and couldn't seem to put it down!But good ol' Bridget: she's still counting her... bad thoughts, good thoughts, and recording her weight on a daily basis! Regardless of my above comments (a.k.a. warnings) Bridget is still great - but this book isn't worthy of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Why did BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY need a sequel? So everyone could cash in. In a blatant attempt to make a ton more money, Helen Fielding, penned this needless sequel. Still fat, Bridget finds contrived reasons to break up with Mark Darcy, stretch misunderstanding ala I LOVE LUCY, and then get back together 338 pages later. Nothing new here, but it was an entertaining read.Anyone looking for insight into Daniel Clever will be disappointed. He appears in about 2 pages of text."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Lo, how the mighty have fallen! This isn't Jane Austin, but it is a wonderful trot for busy post-moderns.

And before the second film comes out, I wanted to read the second book and get my own take on it before the film makers produce their version. While &quot;Edge of Reason&quot; is not as good as the first book, it still holds a lot of humor and charm for the reader. While Bridget has her man, there are lots of bumps in the road...naked chinese boy in Mark's bed, being stuck in a Thai prison and her Mum's new friend, Wellington, met while she and Una made a trip to Africa---to name a few. You can always count on Bridget to get in some pretty bizarre but funny predicaments. A good and easy read. Make time for it and you are guaranteed some laughs!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I just love that woman, and her relashionship with Mark Darcy...and in this book...it takes a funny turn for a while...the kind that makes you got &quot;what&quot; and smile!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Am literally aching with laughter!! Never read &quot;B.J.'s Diary&quot;, but thoroughly enjoyed the movie, although don't usually enjoy comedies. Can't remember ever being so convulsed with laughter from a book. The situations in which Bridget finds herself are so humorous, and well, hey, it could happen!Find myself wishing I was 30-something again and Bridge was my best friend. Except, wait, I want Mark Darcy too, maybe he has a twin brother?BTW, when will this diary-style writing/speaking go away??Hope there's a sequel - &quot;Bridget Jones Goes To California&quot;.Thank you, Helen Fielding."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason is a captivating story about a woman in her early thirties. She is hard working, caring, unselfish, sometimes a little crazy, but without all these things she wouldn't be herself. She is Bridget Jones.The title fits the book very well. It is about everything that she endures at work, listens to her friends problems, does her best, and still manages to keep a boyfriend some of the time at least).Bridget seems to go through things that could happen to anyone, but are definitely not normal everyday thing. Some examples of this are having to track down barn animals at a 3-year-olds birthday party while still trying to impress and ex-boyfriend. She also has to ride a horse for the first time on live television. I won't give away everything, but you can understand how hectic and out of the ordinary her life is.This book was very well written and it really absorbs you. So much, in fact, that you can barely stand to put it down. I recommend this book to anyone who wants an easy and enchanting book full of twists of humor, romance, friendship, loyalty, and an occasional battle of wits."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I loved this book and cannot wait for the next installment as well as the movie. I hope others will enjoy it too! Recommend!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"After first watching the movie, then reading the book it was based on, I knew I had to get this book. You can sympathize with Jones through all her escapades. As much as I loved reading this book, you can tell that author Helen Fielding must've loved the movie &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;. She &quot;borrowed&quot; that idea for the bulk of Bridget's dilemma. However, if you read the first Jones book and are looking to continue the saga, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"If you just liked Bridget Jones you will LOVE this book. If you love BJ you will know that this is a total treasure. I have read both books and this was by far funnier than the first. Bridget is still warm, still a sweetie, and in more trouble than you can imagine. Mark is still evolving and as &quot;sentimental&quot; as ever. When he tells Bridget that the most she can be accussed of is being really &quot;gulliable and stupid&quot; you say oh there is the Mark Darcy I love so much. He is tough on the edges but very much her savior and he is just to perfect to be true. Men out there you have a lot to live up to. I don't know if it will happen because Rene Z said she would never want to gain the weight to reprise the role but I just hope they make the sequel for this.

The liked the first Bridget Jones, but I think I enjoyed this one more. It was perfect in respect to how absurd people think and act in relationships. I liked that there was less written about Bridgets parents and the focus was more one the friendships and relationships. I know it may seem a bit much but I'd love to see one more addition to the Bridget Jones collection. Problems with jeolousy and lack of communication last into marriage and it would be interesting to see how the &quot;singletons&quot; deal with the new &quot;smug married&quot; lifestyle.

Like everyone else said, I could totally relate!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I didn't think that it would be possible for this book to outshine the original Bridget Jones novel, but it has. Fielding has mastered the art of making women everywhere realize that they can not only relate to Bridget, but they are Bridget. We all think that we could be better if only we could quit smoking, stop being a singleton, and of course, develop inner poise. In this novel, Bridget sheds her singleton image for Mark Darcy, a conservative yet wonderful man. Through their ups and downs, One will pray that the couple prevails.

Boy, do I disagree! I actually think it's better than the first book. Maybe not so many laugh out loud scenes, but more of a plot. You really want Bridget to succeed with Mark Darcy! The book actually reminds me of I Love Lucy -- zany things that could only happen to our heroine. And any woman who has ever been over 25 and single will identify with Bridget and her fellow singletons. I really couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next installment!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Cheers to Ms. Fielding for creating another hilarious account of a very funny, likable character. Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason continues to document the life of the lovable Bridget. While she may still be man obsessed and self absorbed, she is still one of the more real protagonists in contemporary fiction. I know, I know she does come across as a bit daft at times. Take for example, the excruciating interview with Colin Firth. While, I heard a comment from an actual writer say how stupid she was, I must admit that when in the presence of celebrity even the coolest of cucumbers can sway and go a bit haywire. She is still in constant contact with her gal pals, Jude and Shazzer. While they do tend to medicate some problems with alcohol, they spit out some intuitive insight. Although the quest for Mark Darcy is still a central focus, Bridget focuses more on developing herself. Still the object of ridicule at her job, she pushes on just like the &quot;Get on with it&quot; girl she is."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Holiday reading.

A page-turner that has you laughing out loud almost constantly."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I've been a fan of the Bridget Jones books for a few years now. I think this is my third time reading it, and I still love it. Would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I last read \\"The Edge of Reason\\" around the time the film was released (2004?) and though I'd gone through the first book in the Bridget Jones series many times since, I hadn't cracked this one. Recently, I came across my copy and decided to give it another go. While I enjoyed it, the original is definitely better.\\"The Edge of Reason\\" picks up a few weeks after the conclusion of \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\". In that first novel, we saw Bridget finally get her happy ending wtih Mr. (Mark) Darcy. However, what happens afer the credits roll? With this book we get the answer to that question. Getting a man is the easy part; it's keeping him that is the difficult task.Despite her new relationship status, Bridget is still the same woman we met before. She is positive, insecure, devoted to her friends and self-help books, and suffers a lack of being able to follow through with her set priorities. In the sequel, we see her expand her career as a journalist (in a disastrous yet hilarious interview with the other \\"Mr Darcy\\"), travel to exotic locales (with terrifying experiences), and attempt to add on to her apartment (another saga unto itself). Her devoted friends, Jude and Shazzer, feature heavily as well, though Tom is absent for much of it. And we meet some characters who had more of a minor role in the prequel, notably married couple Magda and Jeremy.Where this book fails is that it tries too hard. Helen Fielding hit comedy gold with \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\", but it's almost as if she felt she needed to make the sequel more outrageous. Perhaps the best plotline in the story involves a hole in the wall of Bridget's apartment, if only because it's something I can envision happening to all of us (though certainly not the way it ends). Bridget went from being a real woman in the first book to being a bit of a charicature in this one, and it saddened me. That being said, I still enjoyed the book (the second half is definitely better than the first) and, while it's not bad, it's just not as good as the original."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"After reading a very clever, funny novel in this genreMy Life on Craigslist: Award Winning Finalist of USA Book Awards(great book, I highly recommend it) I realized that this genre is more interesting than I had previously thought from my literary ivory tower. So I decided to try the queen of the genre, Helen Fielding, especially since I watched the movie and loved it. The book is better written than I imagined, vivacious very funny in a self deprecating way. I noticed that some other readers complained that it was \\"just funny, not hilarious\\", well, European humor is less in your face than the American one. The only thing that I didn't love about this book was the price of the kindle edition, almost like a movie ticket in New York. Even so, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a fun, fine read that will tickle the brain and their heart."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I'd seen the movie a few years ago and then bought the book.

I thought I'd give it a try, to see whether I liked the original as much as the film version of our heroine - Bridget Jones - and to my surprise I enjoyed the books as well. Although, coming to this book franchise after having watched the movies first, I must admit - I was looking for the books to follow the movies, which the first movie did, the second - not so much. After finishing The Edge of Reason, and it being so different from the film, I think I enjoyed this book more than the movie, because of its differences. The situations that Bridget got herself in were hilarious to read and the development of Mark Darcy's character was great. There are a great number of funny scenes and situations throughout this book. As everyone mentioned the Colin Firth interview - is very funny, and I was laughing out loud when Bridget was trying to buy a bikini:\\"Saturday 19 July129 lbs. (why?

Wonderful! Wonderful!I highly recommend this book. Humor and a great story. Love it!!!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"While I was able to read \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" in two days, the sequel took me almost an entire week to complete. It's not that it wasn't good, but it was significantly more put-downable than the first. \\"The Edge of Reason\\" was hilariously funny in places, but had lost most of the simplicity and klutzy charm.I wouldn't expect or want Bridget to suddenly change for the better in just four weeks, but the opposite also applies, and I can't imagine how she lost so many brain cells in such a short period of time. The old Bridget would stumble into embarrassing situations with alarming regularity, but this time she dives headlong with reckless abandon into increasingly more ridiculous situations, until you find the stretch a trifle uncomfortable.There are the usual weight swings, misunderstandings and goof-ups, but with the addition of a back-stabbing rival, a contractor from hell, a naked Filipino boy, an amorous dry cleaner, an African houseguest, Colin Firth and a nightmare holiday in \\"Paradise\\".I didn't much care for this Bridget, who seemed less in control of her life, making unbelievably bad decisions and being generally pathetic, depressing and helpless.Rated 3.5 stars.Amanda Richards, June 18, 2005"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I didn't care much for this book. I love the first movie, and was excited to read the book. However, all the library had was this one, but I figured I'd be fine since I knew the story and most of the characters from the movie. That was fine, I knew what was going on, and I enjoyed the writing style, but I found myself angry at this book more than I found myself enjoying it.The main flaw with this book is that it is completely unrealistic. I didn't think it would be a problem, but I couldn't connect with any of the characters because their situations were so farfetched. Another thing that made me dislike the book was the way Mark and Bridget &quot;broke up&quot; at the beginning of the book. There wasn't any communication so they just stopped seeing each other? Based on my impression of their characters, I would have thought that they could have at least talked to each other. Obviously neither wanted to break up, so the way it happened just seem silly to me. And not in a haha sort of way.Most of the book I found too farfetched and just unfunny. What I liked about the first movie was that Bridget was an average girl with relationship problems who found herself often in situations women could relate to. She's a sort of Everywoman. But here I couldn't imagine a lot of the things that happened actually happening. It was too much. This could have been fine if the story was funny enough, but for the most part I just found the characters annoying. I didn't like the plot with her parents and Wellington, the Thailand bit was too much, and Rebecca was too stereotyped and annoying that I just couldn't stand her even being in the story.So why, then, the three stars? I blame a lot of my dislike for this book in the fact that I read it all in one sitting. It's a lot to take. But the fact I did read it all in one sitting must prove something. It's compelling, even if most of the time I was annoyed. I didn't read the first, which would have made this one more enjoyable, so I think that had some effect on why I didn't enjoy the story. Also, this book does have some unforgettable characters and moments. When I'm not completely annoyed and want to smack Bridget and all her friends in the face, I'm laughing my ass off. Kind of funny the way I've reacted to this book. It's completely unrealistic and annoying, but it is funny and compelling, anyway.Also, the last star is for the Colin Firth interview. Hilarious. Although I thought she got the interview all too easily, in an of itself it was just too funny. Mainly because in that situation, if I had even be able to speak, I would have asked the exact same questions. My only question is, if Mark Darcy is based off of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, why is he never in a wet shirt in the book? Since of course I picture Mark as Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy (in slightly more modern clothes), I think that would have been nice."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I love &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot;. It was one of the funniest books I had ever read. Immediately upon finishing it, I ran to the store for the sequel. I was, however, greatly dissapointed. &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; did possess all of the quirkiness and neuroses that made me love the first book, but several story lines were outlandish, and frankly hard to read. At times, it was downright ridiculous. I would recommend this book for an enjoyable read, but be forewarned that it fails in comparison to the original."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I had a great time reading the sequal to Bridget Jones' Diary. There were a few passages where I found myself laughing out loud (but perhaps fewer than the first novel) and that is always a pleasure! This novel explores Bridget's slow evolution into a more mature, &quot;grownup&quot;. Some loose ties concerning previous characters are resolved and all for the best. This is a feel good book!Perhaps what I enjoyed the most were the mere hints of romance in this book, i.e the looks on Mark Darcy's face that Bridget remarks upon but doesn't seem to realize the full context of,...really worked for me. I was involved in the love story, not just in the zaniness of the Bridget's day-to-day life.I recommend this book and its predecessor for women of all ages, for both singles and &quot;smug-marrieds&quot; often question the validity and sincerity of their relationships, as does Bridget."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget Jones is back with full force in &quot;Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason&quot;, along with Tom, Shazz, Jude and of course, Mark Darcy. Giving us more insightful views to this Singleton's mind. She explores even more into the depths of her neurotic-ness and tells us of her frantic diary. Possibly even more entertaining than the first diary, which I enjoyed immensely... Helen Fielding writes with much gusto and female understanding that every woman is bound to relate to. And who wouldn't fall in love with Mark Darcy... perhaps even a notch sexier than the original version. Loved the new adventures that Bridget got herself into in this book. Edge of Reason isn't just for women, you know! This time, conveniently featured are international escapades including tropical islands, drugs and even prison!! Oh, and there is this bit about a personalized live bullet that causes quite a scare! And, I was happy to read that Bridget somewhat achieves her goal of &quot;inner poise&quot; at one point... although, she seemed to have landed right back in square one at the beginning of the new year. Loved being with Bridget for two years in a row... hope Helen will give us some more anecdotes of Bridget and her friends! Oh... and Rebecca deserved what she got, finally!! Love happy endings for Bridget and her friends! The sequel is longer than the first but seemed twice as short... can't seem to get enough of Bridget. Can't wait to see how Colin Firth is going to play a modern version of himself in the movie!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I've just read the pair of books straight, and I must say that I'm amazed at some of the poor reviews of these books. Okay yes, Bridget is rather exasperating at times, but overall I can't imagine someone not being able to laugh at the \\"diary\\". Helen Fielding has a remarkable ability to create a well-developed character through her writing, with an acompanying cast of friends, relatives, and enemies. I think it's pretty hard to miss the obvious and intentional Jane Austen parallels (Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, etc), and Fielding is able to manipulate these themes to portray a modern story while still keeping the amazing qualities of Austen's literature.Now, on to the characters...Bridget!! Laugh out loud funny! I have NEVER laughed out loud when reading a novel, it's usually more of a smirk or giggle. However with this book, as well as the original, i was gaffawing and chortling and doing every other word that describes insane amounts of laughter. Bridget is a treasure!Mark...yummmm. Hahha, it sounds so lame to be so enraptured with a character in a book (I think it's in TEOR somewhere that being imaginary is definetly a flaw) but YAY!! Mark Darcy is the classic yummy-handsome-all-around-good guy. I'm so glad he was played by Colin Firth in the movie, and because I was already a die-hard BBC Pride and Prejudice fan, the Colin Firth interview had me LAUGHING/GAFFAWING/ETC for a full five or so minutes. (BTW, I very strongly suggest that everyone go out and rent/buy/borrow the mini-series on DVD or VHS.) After reading, and reminiscing over, the wet-shirt scene, I rushed over (book in hand) to watch it over and over again. Mark Darcy is simply wonderful. yummyyummyyummy!! (but awww...how sad...end of part 3.)Shazzers/Jude/Tom: Awwwww...they're the best friends. Although I can totally understand why they're still Singletons, they are very supportive of their fellow Singletons. Bridget should know that she is so lucky to have them.Rebecca: AHHH!! Just her name reminds me of that twisted horror movie with the same title (Rebecca). While Darcy is the classic hero, she is the classic b*tch-evil-thing, complete with simpering voice.Bridget's Mum and Dad: Wonderfully humourous and everything else jolly and good. Hmm. Think I am getting Brit-ified through reading of these books as have not said \\"jolly\\" since 2nd grade. Bloody fun!Daniel: Gratefully he only had a minor role. People like him are the reason for all the \\"emotional f**kwittage\\" in the world.Bridget's boss: GAAAH!! stupidstupidstupid. Poor Bridge.YAY!! SEE?? GREAT NOVEL!! :) And I must say that I really hope the movie stays as close to the novel as possible, though I heard that the interview scene wasnt going to be done. How sad, I guess it would be confusing to all those who haven't read the books though.PS: Was it just me or was Darcy (and Bridget of course) even better in this novel? :)"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I liked Bridget Jones's Diary, and was looking forward to more of the same improbable events and silliness. It was enjoyable because I knew that even though there were some emotional times, Bridget was not meant to be taken too seriously. I wanted more in the way of blue-soup dinner-party fiascos and quirky mothers getting in over their heads with shady gentlemen friends. Instead, a good chunk of The Edge Of Reason was about Bridget's incarceration in a Thai prison! Great fear, and the intense emotions experienced by her family and friends while fighting to get her out, really had no place here. I don't mean that the second novel should have been a complete repeat of Bridget rationalizing that a chocolate croissant fills the \\"whole-grains\\" requirement in a diet breakfast...but you know. Ms. Fielding could have found some middle ground and kept readers interested. By the time Jude's (or was it Shazzer's?) wedding rolled around, I was completely exhausted from Thailand and I can't seem to remember much of what happened to that silly Singleton. How come there was never a third volume where Bridget gets a proposal followed by months of funny prenuptial hassles? That would make up for Book Two."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read the Bridget Jones books because I enjoyed the movies, but the books are so much more entertaining and I love them! It's wonderful, even as a smug married, to see things through the eyes of a woman who is barely making her way through the maze of men/job/friends/mummy/daddy/dieting each day and who considers self-help books to be a new form of religion. I raced through the first book but took my time with the second, as I did not want it to end. If you are a woman who watches Pride and Prejudice and fantasizes about Mr Darcy to get away from the banal reality of your own love life; if your friends make you crazy and keep you sane at the same time; if your parents still treat you like a little kid who should be quiet and listen; and if you feel like you are the only woman in the world who is as homely/fat/miserable/unlovable as you are, then Bridget Jones is here to make it all look very bearable. Hurrah!!If you come to the book from the movie, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Bridget's friends, who are mere accessories to the plot in the films, are much more important and better created in the books. Mark Darcy is not as perfect and high and mighty in the book either. The story of his relationship with Bridget has more depth and details here. And you may also find yourself picturing a v. handsome model in his mid-30s rather than Colin Firth, who is in his mid-40s now. Maybe a man like the model on the Swiss Watch ads in Conde Nast Traveler. Mmmmm... Imagine HIM coming out of the lake of Pemberley in a wet shirt...Bridget Jones is the sort of book every woman should read when she is getting TOO SERIOUS and needs to laugh a lot."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"just as funny as the first novel, but the plot is just too incredible and Bridget seems a bit more immature with Mr. Darcy. No way would all this happen in one year or so. no way. For some reason - reading this one made me NOT want to see the movie because I felt the movie would spoil my feelings for the second one - and they couldn't fit the whole book in just 2 hours of film. And Daniel doesn't show up as much as the movie trailer would have you believe - which is a good thing. I can see how it's like Jane Austen's Persuasion, but that's also not one of my favorite Austen's either . . . however her friends are funnier in this novel. meh. worth picking up if you want to continue from book number one."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"By the time I had finished Bridget Jones's Diary, I decided that I rather liked Bridget Jones, despite her endless shallow, self-centered, annoying whining about how horrible her life was.So when I read this book, I was fully involved in her life, once again rooting for everything to come out OK, or at least not too badly.This book is in a somewhat similar style to the first -- that is, like a diary -- however it is far more narrative. Because there is a lot more to narrate, quite honestly!Bridget finds herself right in the middle of a classic farce, complete with misunderstandings, miscommunications, missing letters, missed planes, and plenty of misadventures. It was all great fun, while also being very soap-opera-like, in that you couldn't wait to start the next chapter because the last one ended with a cliffhanger.I almost couldn't put the book down until I'd found out what happens to our poor heroine. Does she finally find the man of her dreams, or at least inner poise? How about spiritual epiphany? Well, I'm not telling; you'll have to read for yourself."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This is a superb sequel to \\"Bridget Jones's Diary.\\" The characters, especially Mark, Jude and Sharon, are developed further. Bridget's mum is up to her usual antics- this time around she brings an African tribesman named Wellington home and has him stay with her and Colin. Bridget is as funny, endearing and poignant as in the first book....alternating between despair one moment and joy and hope the next....sometimes feeling she has a handle on things and at other times feeling she has no control and is at the mercy of the chaos and uncertainty of life. She is still making resolutions and breaking them. In this book, she shows her pluck by taking charge and taking action to get herself out of a Thai prison (sustained by a copy of Rudyard Kipling's \\"If,\\" given to her by Mark Darcy.) She has further journalistic adventures....the funniest being her trip to Rome where she gets to interview Colin Firth. Bridget only wants to talk about Mr. Darcy from \\"Pride And Prejudice\\" (especially the wet-shirt-in-the-lake scene) and Colin's Italian girlfriend (wouldn't he be better off with a nice, British girl?- Bridget asks). Mr. Firth would really rather talk about his current projects. The interview is hilarious. If you read it at home you will laugh out loud and if you read it in public you may have to put your fist in your mouth so you don't have people thinking you're out of your mind. Bridget is also provided with a worthy adversary in the dreaded Rebecca, a tall blonde who apparently only has one goal in life- to steal Mark from our beloved Bridget. You'll want to reach into the book and slap her silly! Excellent!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I loved the Diary of Bridget Jones, so I was looking forward to the sequel. I was not disappointed in the least, but if you're looking for the greatness of the first book you won't find it here. Bridget continues her neurotic behavior of counting calories, cigarettes, phone calls, and alcoholic drinks (which is the funniest thing EVER) and she tries to carry on a relationship with Mark. It brings back all of the characters and will definitely bring a smile to your face. A good follow-up, but can't top the original...in my book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget comes back with a bang and plenty of fears. All her books say she should act one way. Her friends say she should act another and Mark Darcy doesn't seem to understand her at all. what is London's favorite singleton to do. Why can't things be simple. For anyone who thinks too much this book is for you.Bridget is a character that is real and lovable. A v.good book and although I want bridge to be happy I hope another book is in the works"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I found the first Bridget Jones Diary book a bit hard to take, but the second had me in stiches. For anyone who has a crush on Collin Firth (and who doesn't?) the interview seen alone is worth the entire book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"oh geez this was a *great* book. have had it for nearly two months now and have read it more times than i care to admit. have recruited every last person i know to read both bridget jones diary and now, the edge of reason. what an amazing surprise to actually find an author who can not only write a fantastic novel, but a fabulous follow-up... am planning upon reading 'cause celeb' by same author when i've a moment's peace. i hate to admit it, but i - and so many of my friends - just absolutely related to bridget's plight... naturally, i know where germany is, but i sure as hell can still rattle off calories for even the most inane and odd foodstuffs, as well as get totally lost in the conflicting advice of weird love-life problems. oddly enough, the boyfriend and i both enormously enjoyed this book as we read it aloud on a road trip, sometimes even having to stop our routine to laugh without dignity at the well unfolding story. every last page is wholly well composed. there can be only one... erm, two... erm, bridget jones. accept no substitute."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I enjoyed the first Bridget Jones's because many of us could relate to the fumbling and vulnerability that encounters one's life when it comes to romance, sex, relationships and careers. In the sequel Bridget did not evolve at all, she just seemed to making the same mistakes over and over again. I don't why the most of the reviewers found her being incompetent, and suffering perpetual low self-esteem such an enduring quality. How many times can you shoot yourself in the foot? And the same foot at that! Bridget wasn't faced with any new challenges, instead Fielding just recycled the old ones from the pervious book and made them even more ridiculous to the point you couldn't even take it seriously nor was it funny. I yearn for the day when more women writers create a heroine whose life does not revolve around reducing flabby thighs and snagging up a male partner before her eggs dry out. Thank god for the public library because if I spent my money on this bookI would have been mighty pissed."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"If you have not read Bridget Jones' Diary first, go do so before reading The Edge of Reason. Okay, done that? Now of course you want more, but how can anything rival the Diary? It can't. But if you want to spend more time with Bridget, at least this book affords that. Whereas Bridget was a tapestry of neatly woven plot lines with echoes of Jane Austen, The Edge of Reason is like several story lines running parallel down a track, some falling down short, others overshooting the finish line, not one mixing too well with another. The timing's off. But The Edge of Reason has its laughs and it has Bridget, who in the worst moments, like in a Thai jail, always pops up a survivor. For those who don't know: the real Colin Firth is set to play Mark Darcy in the film based on Diary."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"no.of times laughed out loud 1(but continuous so maybe countsas much more?), no. of times told others to read this 12 (same asnumber in book club), no. of people I would like to tell-all( but to busy reading) no. of times glad Helen Fielding wrote this sequel-too many to count(hurrah! v.good) Bridget is back, and gets in even more predicaments than ever! Can Mark Darcy help? Will he be around in the end? Who was the young boy in the bed, or at the bar? Will her mother find out what is really being potted in the shed? Will someone round up all the Rebeccas of the world and ship them to Thailand? This is another fun book from Helen Fielding. v. good, v. ridiculous, and v.v. enjoyable! END"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I am 66 years old, married for 40 years, but I can relate to Bridget...she takes me back to the time when I was single, living with two roommates in a city apartment and wondering if there would be a Mr. Darcy in our futures! We giggled about each others' suitors, and gave unsolicited advice. We had office flirtations, just as Bridget does and all the interesting men were always taken, married or not interested in us...We had Mothers like Bridget's who called us with advice and suggestions that we meet the unattractive sons of their friends. We met our share of absolute &quot;creeps&quot;! I have been keeping my own diary for over 35 years and yes, I start each entry with my weight on that day! I recommend Bridget Jones to anyone who has had a &quot;Mark Darcy&quot; or a &quot;Rebecca&quot; in their life, and who wants to read an entertaining book that will definitely divert them from the stress of reading about current events in the day's newspapers!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I have been waiting for this sequel with bated breath. And, it didn't disappoint. I read it in one evening and was so sad when I was all done. Her charm and personality are such a breath of fresh are. Her &quot;singleton&quot; ways are funny, adventurous and make you dream for the days when you could live a life like hers. And, in many ways...she's just like all single gals out there. You root and pray for her....you're even tempted to skip to the end and see if she and her &quot;Mr. Darcy&quot; make it a happily ever after ending. this book doesn't let you down."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I had to have this book after reading the first diary! I devoured it in about 2 nights. Bridget definitely has her hands full in this novel. I loved every minute but couldn't help skipping ahead a few times to see what was coming up. I never do that as a rule but just couldn't resist it with this book. I have even gone back and reread my favorite parts several times.V. good book! Excellent example of Singleton way of life! Hurrah for Bridget!!! We want more!!! (especially with Mark)"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Wasn't sure if I would like this installment as much as the first but I can't deny that I laughed out loud just as much this time. My favorite moment, though, was when I realized that Fielding was doing a gloss on another of my favorite Austen books, Persuasion. Actually I had just watched the wonderful film version on TV the night before I started the book and couldn't miss the parallels (of course if I had paid attention to the reviews I might have realized sooner and picked up the book before it became paperback). Anyway, a truly diverting read. Am looking forward to Helen Fielding's next hilarious book. And of course there's always the much-anticipated movie of Bridget Jones where we can watch poor Bridget embarrass herself over Mark Darcy all over again!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I must admit that although I enjoyed the first Bridget Jones novel--the blue string/capon fiasco was priceless--I wasn't sure it lived up to the hype. Perhaps not having such high expectations with &quot;The Edge of Reason,&quot; I actually found it better! I suspect its because we simply know her better. additionally, there is more action--the Thai prison/Madonna impersonation scene had me laughing out loud--and she gains a bit, but hopefully not too much, of self-awareness this time--through something other than her many self-help books. Its a charming light read, and, perhaps an even better audio book selection!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The first installment was funny, quick, and thoughtful. Bridget Jones was an endearing character whose foibles were as lovable as her charms.But Bridget Jones in the follow-up was trite. Poorly developed. Boring. Self-conscious for the sake of being self-conscious. You get the feeling that the publisher rushed Helen Fielding back to the typewriter after the delirious success of the first one...."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"once again, ms. fielding has created a massively compelling and highly amusing tale of a certain class of mid-young womanhood in the millenium. I challenge even the naysayers to get through without laughing out loud. HOWEVER, this is a book for people who are able and willing to laugh at the foibles of love and dating; those who are not afraid to acknowledge certain values that the culture dishes out, and turn it delightfully on its head. she is a consommate storyteller and her ear for humor never falters. I very much doubt whether she would have rocketed to stardom had her gifts been less than noteworthy. I for one look forward to her next effort with enthusiasm......."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding has struck again! And this one is even better than the first one...the reader will find the same funny situations, same problems Bridget faces in her daily struggle as a woman.

Both are great!)"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Well, I'm not sure what Maria of the No Star Review was complaining about... if anything I thought this book was even more hilarious than the first. I loved that Bridget's parents were less written about and I loved the creativity. None of the plot devices seemed contrived, if anything they were true to life mishaps that occur to everyone and are therefore easy to identify with. In my opinion, Bridget is one of the most identifiable characters I have read about.I am lending this to non-readers and they are LOVING it! I swear- you will laugh out loud (like I did on the train causing strangers to stare). Enjoy and if you are like me you will eagerly await (or at least hope) for the next one.Helen Fielding- start writing!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read the first diary on Christmas Day and loved it so much that as soon as the shops reopened I sent my sister to buy the sequel.It was wonderful to see that Bridget was still as neurotic as ever and was still capable of messing up the smallest task with hilarious results. The interview with Colin Firth is in particular a classic section of the story.I dearly hope that we will hear from Bridget again as she doesnt seem the type to be laid to rest easily."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I found the sequel to be better than the first; it had more of a storyline and more twists. However, if you haven't read the first book it might be a little bit difficult to follow some of the story (e.g. when Daniel and Vile Richard reappear). I thought it was a great book -- full of laughs."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"What a great book! Perhaps even better than the first one. Once again, Bridget takes us through life as she sees it. The characters are unforgettable. You can't keep from laughing while reading this book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"After thoroughly enjoying Bridget Jones's Diary, I felt let down. The book had ended too soon and I wanted more story. I wanted to know what happened between Bridget and Mark, Colin and Pam, Jude and Vile Richard. I was not let down for long though because I soon discovered this book and I was able to have all my questions answered.I was pleasantly suprised by this delightful sequel and I read it with the same voracity that I had read the original with. This is a warm and delightful book and readers won't feel let down(except I wouldn't mind a third installment.) If you still haven't read the first book, buy it and read it, then move on to this delightful sequel!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This is the continuation of Bridget Jones's Diary. It starts four weeks after the end of its predecessor. Bridget is still the same calorie counting, self-help book guru that she was in the last book, now she is in a thriving relationship with an adult male. But of course, things can't be that easy. Once again, Bridget tries to figure out her relationship with the man she loves, her parents, her peers, and co-workers.Honestly, I thought Bridget lost some of her bravado. That doesn't mean the book wasn't good, but I always saw Bridget being a little \\"stronger\\", if you will, that she appeared in this book. Fielding also had a field day making fun of self-help dating book (cheeky satire at best). Bridget and her friends were more obsessed than ever with them, and it did get a little annoying at times. Although I like Bridget, I had to agree with a statement that was made in the book about wanting a person who knew their own mind instead of relying on what self-help books tell them they should do.And I didn't think this book was nearly as amusing as the last. I wouldn't say these books are laugh out loud funny, but they do make me smile a majority of the time. Can't wait until the next one comes out. I'm still interested in seeing how things end for Bridget."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is even funnier than the first &quot;diary&quot;...

I couldnt have loved it more."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I didn't think I could love Bridget anymore than I already do, but this book proved me wrong. Bridget is so awesome! Awesome because she's just like me, just like a normal modern girl trying to make it in this world by having career, family, friends, and love. For anyone who's been in love and had that relationship end because of miscommunication or by the machinations of some hideous, devious female dog, then you can appreciate this book. With advice coming from well-meaning friends who are just as vulnerable and really have no clue as to what the dating rules are because there really aren't any rules, then you'll understand this book so much. At every page I kept nodding my head in agreement with what Bridget was thinking. I could go on and on and gush about this book, but I have no doubt that whosoever reads this book will be left wanting more and more of Bridget. She's so real it's like someone's read my mind. Weight gain/loss, financial woes, crazy friends/family, longing for love, determination not to drink so bloody much (but then there's always something to celebrate or someone to cheer up or some sorrow to drown), it's all there. Thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope Ms. Fielding will write a Part III involving wedding plans, babies (can you imagine Bridget in labour?!), and how Bridget will balance her loyalties to the woes of Singletons and every Singleton's desire to be happily married with a brainy, sexy, sweetheart of a man. Love this book!!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"OK, I read Bridget Jones's Diary and about a year and a half later read The Edge of Reason. I like the latter alot more. For many different reasons. You get the feeling that you know her personally, if not someone like her. In the 1st book, I didn't care for her too much. In the 2nd book, she was like my best friend. She takes on more responsibility, she's fearless and determined. It seems if she came out of her shell in the 2nd book. Bridget begins to evolve and take chances. She still has to deal with her overbearing mother, passive father, and dreams up fantasies about men. In the end that what makes bridget, bridget.

All of our favorites are here, and a few new ones too, like Gary the Builder, who creates a giant hole in the wall of Bridget's flat--and leaves it there for 8 months. Not much of the horrid Daniel, thank goodness, but PLENTY of Marc Darcy, unfortunately caught in the clutches of the evil Rebecca (she of the insect-thin legs).Will Mister Darcy come back to Bridget?

I read it in two days (with a lot of interuptions from family) and suffered several what-is-wrong-with-you looks from my husband and kids as I snorted and laughed outloud my way through it.A memorable highlight is the interview Bridget conducts with Colin Firth. I found myself exclaiming aloud, &quot;Oh no she didn't!&quot; several times (yikes)then laughing so hard I had to put the book down in order to regroup. Luckily, my husband would miss me if he had me institutionalized.My friend Mary and I, both mothers of little ones, especially enjoyed the telephone conversations Bridget has with her married friend who continually talks to her children while talking to Bridget at the same time.I don't have the book right here in front of me but the dialogues run alot like this: &quot;Bridget, you really need to...sit on the potty, Mummy says sit on the potty!&quot;Should you read the book? I guess the best analogy would be the Austin Powers sequals. In the second and third movies, Austin stays Austin with only the adventure changing--the humor remaining the same. In the second installment of Bridget Jones, Bridget stays Bridget with pretty much the adventure changing and the humor staying the same. Some people liked the first Austin Powers movie but didn't want to see more of the same thing...I could watch a new Austin Powers movie every year as long as the jokes keep flying. The same goes for Bridget Jones. Does she change and grow--becoming a more 'complete' woman? Well, while she probably does learn the danger of taking packages from strangers while on holiday the answer to that question is no, not really. But just as I wouldn't want to see Austin Powers 'change and grow', 'no really baby', I have to say thank goodness for savy writers who know how to not mess up a good thing."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Ok, I know what you are thinking - sequels are never as good as the first one, the real thing. But sometimes they come close. Here, Bridget is still our adorable, disorganized, imaginative Bridget, the same one we left at the end of Bidger Jones' Diary. At the beginning of the book, she's offically Mark Darcy's girlfriend, so she is feeling much more at peace with herself. But things change, and you will be surprised of how fast her (funny, but still usual, pretty close to boring) life becomes a sequence of strange occurrences and advantures, including - are you ready for this? - a few days in jail. But Bridget will survive that and much more, thanks to that sense of humor, self-irony and imagination that made us like her so much from the very first pages of her diary!So go ahead and read this, especially if you are a Bridget fan, you'll like it enough."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"130 lbs.

The old Bridge is back!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"When handed the original Bridget Jones Diary by a friend a year or so ago, I found myself enjoying it but certainly not classifying it as Great Literature. It took a year or so of thinking back on it (when repeatedly finding myself in situations similar to those in the book), and the release of the sequel Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, to make me realize just how cleverly drawn the characters are. A NYTimes book review last weekend noted that we can enjoy Bridget even though this book reveals that she is &quot;not very bright&quot;, but I believe it's not dullness but fallibility that makes me, and apparently millions of other women, relate to her; Helen Fielding apparently striking the same chord as David Kelley did when he came up with Ally McBeal and friends. With Bridget, we get the added benefit of happy endings, which is always what one wants for a character one is relating to! This book is marvellous fun (and of course a terrific lift for all &quot;Singletons&quot; who have been recent victims of &quot;emotional f--kwittage&quot;), and felt like a fun-filled reunion with the characters who two years ago (I now realize)became life-long friends!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding has done it again! With all of the brilliance and comic genius she displayed in Bridget Jones's Diary, this second book Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, is just as much of a wild ride as the first. It is true the character of Bridget speaks primarily to single women, but there is no doubt any reader could enjoy the silly escapades that result from this thirtysomething simply living her life and taking advice from her 'singleton' friends. Frequent references to current events and trends in England and America make this diary easy to believe as non-fiction, although of course it is not. Getting lost in it's spider-web of events is only half the fun - when nearing the end, you will want it to slow down, as to preserve your need for more. Another highlight in this volume is the character of her mother taking a back-burner role, and letting the real star shine along with her friends and boyfriends alike. Read this book, laugh out loud, and be challenged to find at least one way Bridget doesn't remind you of someone you know. Perhaps even yourself!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Although am ashamedly Smug Married, manage to relate entirely to Bridget's neuroses and foibles to point of neglecting own children and husband in favour of hurriedly gulping down most entertaining read since last Bridget Jones book. Wonder if Ms. Fielding considering further additions to series, as cannot fathom going on without MORE BRIDGET! Disagree with previous reviewer that Thailand escapades were slow point in book, as thought were rather hilarious and cannot imagine non-Disney trip for self at this point in life. Highly,highly recommend for those who think laughing out loud while reading is high point in day and something that does not happen often enough! (Also wondering if will continue speaking and writing without pronouns and proper nouns as does Bridget.) Fantastic, fantastic and fun."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason by Helen Fielding is an easy evening read and a great source of side splitting humor and intrigue for any fan of Fielding's wit. While retaining her wit and great nack for story telling, she takes us to a historic London, exotic Thailand, the guilty pleasures of Heroine and the twisted accuracy of Pop Culture, clutching and fleeting with humanity and great characters.I curled up once again with my favorite reading music (John McArthur's, &quot;HIDDEN&quot;) and found myself willingly transported through the lives of Bridget, Jude and Shazzar. (And what extraordinary lives indeed.) Only to find that the story was over and I wanted to read more.A must for any Helen Fielding fan!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I saw the movie first and immediately wanted to read the books. I went to a store and picked up what I thought was &quot;Bridget Jone's Diary&quot; But when I looked closer, I saw it was actually the sequel &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; I intially felt disappointed, but then figured I could read the orginal later (since I had already seen the movie and knew the basic storyline) Once I started &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot;, I couldn't put it down. I found myself laughing all the way through. This book is a very easy, enjoyable read. I read it in a single sitting. I have also since read &quot;Bridget Jone's Diary&quot; which I also enjoyed very much. But I found that I liked the sequel even better than the orginal. Which is surprising, considering that only rarely are sequels as good as the orginal. If you liked &quot;Bridget Jone's Diary&quot; (and even if you didn't) I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"No. of laughs: 1 million (v.g.), Average hours per day spent reading: 4 (am turning into obsessive bookworm in manner of Belle in Sleeping Beauty or similar), Moments found relating surprisingly well to Bridget: 4,000 and counting, No. of other books have enjoyed nearly as much: 0 (well, not counting Brigdet Jones's Diary, that is).5:26 pm. My flat.Hurrah! Helen Fielding is bloody genious. Knew it would be just as good as original, knew it. Have not been quite as well entertained since was young child and watched Care Bears until mother was ready to rip her head off and eat it. Such an honest portrayal of life has never come round 'til now. Have found endless stories of Bridget shagging, calling 1471, ranting with Shazzer and Jude, obsessing over Mark Darcy, worrying about Mentionitis and evilness of the dreaded Smug Marrieds, and the trilling and the irking antics of gigolo-hiring mother to be much more amusing than any John Grisham.If you pass this book up (disaster), you're bloody well missing out."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"After reading &quot;Bridget Jones Diary,&quot; I couldn't wait for the follow-up book. The first review I read of it was in People magazine, and they had nothing positive to say. I debated buying it, and finally couldn't resist. I am so glad I ignored the reviews! I found this book as witty and laugh-out-loud funny as the first, and actually related to Bridget even more than last time. She finds herself very in love with Mark Darcy, even after her evil nemesis tries to drive them apart. Helen Fielding's writing was very on-target about the trauma and pain you feel when your relationship isn't going as well as you wish it would, and still manages to infuse hope and humor into the situation. I was rooting for Bridget all the way, and hope to see another segment of her saga in the near future!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Oh dear. I thought &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; was good but now Helen Fielding has topped it spectacularly.We don't really want to know what happens after Cinderella finds her Prince, mostly because we're afraid the Prince will grow a beer gut and watch cricket all day while Cindy is reduced to being barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen. She'll make cutting remarks about his dwindling manhood in a adenoidal whine, he'll storm out and drown his sorrows in frothy Guinness - it's all too distressing.It's all right. Something that mundane would never happen to Bridget Jones.I started &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; at bedtime (10pm), was so engrossed that I couldn't even put it down to perform my nightly ablutions (which made things quite awkward), and then sat up reading until 2am. When I read about Bridget's magic mushrooms and the contents of her Christmas cards I had to stuff a pillow into my mouth so that I wouldn't wake anyone with my hysterical gasps of laughter.Singletons will feel an instant, emphatic connection with Miss Jones; Fielding manages to tug the reader's emotions into synchronised sympathy with Bridget's. A poignant encounter between Mark and Bridget in a dark kitchen caused me to shed fat tears of grief onto the same pillow I was gnawing with suppressed mirth 5 minutes before. Books shouldn't be allowed to affect you that way.As always, Fielding's skillful weaving of intimacy and openness makes the reader feel like Bridget's imaginary friend and confidant rather than an intruder perving on a stranger's private musings.So who needs a date on Saturday night? We don't - we've got Bridget Jones."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I began reading this book with low expectations-- it's not often that a sequel is as good or better than the original. However, this book is at least as equally hilarious, charming, and captivating as Fielding's first novel. The story picks up where the first left off: with Mark Darcy and Bridget very much in love. This book also follows Bridget through her entire year-- and what a year it is! I was pleased to discover Fielding brought back nearly all of the original's characters-- from Daniel Cleaver to schemeing Rebecca to Richard Finch, the boss from hell. Note to self: do not read the &quot;interview&quot; scene when you are supposed to be quiet ( i.e. in a library). It is so positively hysterical, you won't be able to choke back your giggles."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Just as fun as the first book but borders on unbelievable. You are less likely to relate Bridget's experiences to your real life experiences but very very fun. If you liked the first one this continues where it left off. Great vacation reading!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Number of times read book: 15 (uh-oh becoming obsessive Bridget Jones-type person. Oh God even talking like her!) Number of times laughed out loud:79 (Gaaah but v.g book)Hurrah! Another Bridget Jones book (v.g) and love it. Even better than prequel, made me cry and laugh. A bit less credible than first book, Bridget in jail, not v.likely but still v.funny. Scenes toward end with Mark Darcy (aah) v.emotional as well as amusing. Book v.g if you like first book, will like this. Easy to read and happy ending. Throw out those self-help books now!!!! Love it.PS In case people have not a clue what I was talking about, I was trying to write in the style of Bridget. Reading that style in the book is not as annoying as it may seem. Don't buy this for its literary value, buy it to laugh and cry and realize that (oh my God) I am Bridget Jones.

Maybe that is more of a compliment to the first book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I laughed out loud. Sure some of the story lines were a bit far fetched. But the book was totally enjoyable."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The story in Bridget Jones's Diary continues (again in diary format) in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason with the events of the following year. This novel is longer (by 110 pages in my version) and the chapters are not broken down into months. (In some cases we follow Bridget's life day by day; sometimes there may be a break of weeks or even months).I should begin by saying that I absolutely loved Bridget Jones's Diary. I was sceptical about this novel's ability to be as good as the first (as sequels so rarely are in my experience). But I was so pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed this novel every bit as much as the first--maybe even more, if that's possible. There is a deeper, meatier story in this one by comparison with the first. Also, one's emotions are tugged at in this one far more than in the first novel, with one of the characters (I will not mention whom) being a real snake in the grass. The result was that although I hated to put the first novel down, with this one I simply could not put it down. And Pride and Prejudice fans (of which I am one!) will NOT be disappointed--particularly those who've enjoyed the BBC/A&amp;E miniseries starring Colin Firth!I don't wish to give the story and the many cute (and often hilarious) little surprises away. Suffice it to say that these two novels are two of the funniest and most insightful that I've read. As is typical of British humour, they are novels to be read and reread. If you enjoyed Bridget Jones's Diary at all, this novel is an absolute must-read. I cannot praise it highly enough, and I recommend it most highly!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I couldn't put this book down--stayed up late 2 nights reading it--it's so good. After recently reading the original book, seeing the movie and watching the BBC Pride &amp; Prejudice on DVD, I had to get this book, if only to read the Colin Firth interview (which Helen Fielding and Colin Firth &quot;play acted&quot; before she wrote this book). I was worried I wouldn't like this book because of the mixed reviews here and because the first book/movie have such a perfect ending. It didn't make sense to me to go beyond that ending (like writing a sequel to Pride &amp; Prejudice). But I was pleasantly surprised to find this book as good as the original--just as funny and touching. And you don't have to be a Singleton to enjoy this book--I'm married but can still relate. The only hard thing, being an American, is understanding some of the English jargon. Makes me wish I had a dictionary of English slang or something. I can't wait to see the movie and find out how they will handle Colin Firth playing both Mark Darcy and himself.If you're a Jane Austen fan (as I am), this book has the same theme as Persuasion, though it doesn't follow the plot of Persuasion the way Bridget Jone's Diary has lots of plot points similar to Pride &amp; Prejudice."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget is adorable. She's funny and flawed, proud and helpless and so thoroughly English.If you like English comedy in the Ab Fab vein, you will really enjoy both of the Bridget Jones stories."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The title of this book is a fitting description of the development of Bridget and her world. I thought that some of Bridget's antics in the first book could not be any zanier, but this book shows that there is a very fine line between reason and insanity. Just put yourself in the situation of being arrested for drug possession in Bangkok and facing the prospect of a 10 year sentence. Would it be reasonable to dance around in the jail cell in a Wonderbra singing Madonna songs to the other inmates? Probably not, but Bridget makes it sound as if it's the most normal thing in the world. That's one incident among many, including the hilarious interview with Colin Firth which will make or break her career. If you have read Persuasion, you will be familiar with the parallels in the plot lines. However, Fielding's talent lies in not copying the plot but adapting it to a modern setting with enough changes to truly make it her own. A definite recommendation if you enjoyed the first instalment."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"If you read and enjoyed Bridget Jones' Diary, then you MUST read this book. This novel picks up where we Bridget Jones' Diary left us.It is still refreshingly funny! A book for Singletons and Smug Marrieds alike! I finished this book in one day. I just couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read The Edge of Reason not knowing there was a first Bridget Jones Diary. Well I still haven't got around to reading the first so I really can't compare the two but I absolutely loved The Edge of Reason. It was simply amazing it was everything I would want to say without being able to say it. Of course, I know most of you experienced the thinking in fragments just as Bridget Jones wrote her diary.(I had the same experience!) I found myself in her diary. She was neurotic, vulnerable, and unbearably head strong. At some points you find yourself thinking she is totally overreacting and then thinking, I would have done that. I've found someone who thinks just like me. It was great. So if you like reading books that are very girly and a little bit silly you will love this book! I am American but this gave me so much new respect for the English people. Now I can't wait to go London! I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The book is great - there's no doubt about it. Bridget is amazingly entertaning in her honnesty, and although sometimes she's not very brilliant, Bridget takes the reader on a journey that leads to one's own spiritual awakening. Deep down, we are all &quot;bridgets&quot;, &quot;shazzers&quot;, or &quot;rebeccas&quot;. I even cryed when Mark went out with Rebecca - I mean, how could he? I want a sequel, but I don't want to risk being disappointed if the third book is not as awesome as the first two...Anyway, I would advise &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; to everybody who liked the &quot;Diary&quot;."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"After loving &quot;Diary&quot;, the sequel was somewhat disappointing. It followed the formula that made the first so successful, but the whole Thai prison section was a bit extreme and very unbelievable. Believability was what made the first one so good - we all could identify with Bridget, either ourselves or someone we knew. But her lack of affectedness in the prison was ridiculous - anyone would have been extremely traumatized and most likely unable to leave until they did their time. Other than that, I enjoyed the book - just not as much as the first one."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I liked this one even more than the first installment! Although Bridget's neurosis and addictions can sometimes be over-the-top, I can certainly relate to the honesty with which she describes human obesessive thoughts and behaviours mixed in with v. large amounts of humour. The connection between lack of religion in people's lives today and the rise in popularity of self-help books speaks volumes of truth about today's society. This book made me laugh out loud (once again) and I thouroughly enjoyed drifting through another year with Bridget, her parents, Shaz, Jude, Tom and all the rest. LOVED IT! Can't wait for the next installment from Helen Fielding. She is truly a gifted writer!! Don't stop writing!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I wasn't sure if Helen Fielding would maintain the same level of excellency that she achieved in the first Bridget Jones but she did! This book is hilarious and starts up where the last one left off. I won't give away the plot or any of Bridget's, Jude's or Shazzer's antics so buy the book! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This may have been better had i not read the first one.A few funny moments- i nearly wet myself over the Christmas cards- but unfortunatly a bit too few and far between.The desire to tell her to get her act together and stop being so self obsorbed was stronger this time too. But otherwise a pleasant way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I kid you not: I was laying in bed, in pajamas, bowl of popcorn and two kitties on my lap, and I finished her first book, Bridget Jones' Diary.I looked at the clock: 10:50 PM. I knew I could make it!I literally lept out of bed (amazingly didn't spill any of the popcorn or disturb the kitties' slumber - its a skill...), dressedn and sped down to the local (bookstore)- and bought this, the sequel, before they closed at 11:00!I think I read it all that night.I laughed out loud.Repeatedly.It was hysterical.A joy to read."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridgit is back and this time life is as usual crazy. Helen Fielding's first book had a ring of truth and experience, this one at times goes way over the top. Even greater than one can expect. A good read but the whole adventure in Thailand is not very creative. I would say read it in paperback and on the beach."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"If you loved Bridget Jones' Diary, you'll love this book. Bridget is back, and is crazier than ever. Her character becomes much more developed, as do those of the people around her. The plot gets thicker and thicker and is very unpredictable but one thing you can be sure of is that you'll laugh with the turn of each page.This book doesn't claim to be an amazing feat of literature in the academic sense. It's not always grammatically correct, nor does it pretend to be something it's not. It IS light reading, but entertaining. That's the beauty of both of these books. You open the cover and you are immediately immersed in her world, which is believable, colorful, filled with adventure and fun. She seems so real... it's almost as though you're reading letters from your best girlfriend, and she's filling you in on what's going on in her life.I just can't wait for the next sequel. I'm definitely addicted!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I loved BJ's Diary, yet Edge of Reason had me laughing so hard, I literally fell out of bed.

Especially her interview with Colin Firth in Italy, that was hilarious.Also, with more of a nemesis in this book, that one cannot help but to hate, it makes this book much more interesting, and with a little more conflict, unlike the first when much of the decisions were if Bridget should sleep with Daniel or not.

I thought is wa completely unrealistic and it just could have been a lot better than it was."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The journalistic style that Helen Fielding has carried on from the first book of Bridget is genius. I felt like I had walked into Bridget's bedroom and sat down with her diary to invade her life. Fielding has written what singletons think about but never dare to say. From the tremendous hatred of married people to the obsessive acts of torture one endures to get a man, Fielding has let it all out. Bridget's ability to get herself in the most peculiar circumstances leaves the reader laughing out loud. Some of the situations are just a little overboard. Besides the outright absurdity, I enjoyed reading Fielding's novel. The first of the Bridget journals gave the second too much to live up to in my opinion. However, the novel is still worth the little time it takes to breeze through this easy reading novel and encounter the madness of Bridget's world."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Although I have seen the movie I have not read the first book so I can't really compare the two, only the story.I thought it was a pleasant read, I read it in only three sittings over three days but at points it kinda did drag a little.Some parts in it were a bit absurd but I guess that's the appeal of Bridget Jones!! At times I was really laughing :) so if you do like the movie or the first book you might wanna read this.I didn't find this necessarily better than the first story but I think it could have been a bit better.I just wish there was a third book because the story does leave you hanging... and i hate when that happens!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book helped explained and went into futher detail of what happened in the first book of Bridget Jones.

A noteworthy continuation - I DID NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I've always thought the first few months of a relationship was more exciting than the event of getting together. For that reason, I enjoyed this sequel more than the original. Nestled in between all the twists of fate was the very human ambivalence, anticipation and hope that accompany any new relationship, which makes the novel truly poignant at times."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"It's not great literature, thank God. It's laugh-out-loud funny. Fans of the original can expect a grear evening in, reading this and roaring. So entertaining. I have never understood why Bridget is so popular in the US where it seems no one smokes or drinks and everyone goes to the gym, but maybe we Bridget clones are all stuck home alone without a Shazzer. Only thing that made me uneasy (real life intruding) is that by the end of this book HF has married off all the singletons, and then where will the rest of us be? Gaaah!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"There is very little that can be said that hasn't been already mentioned in previous reviews. However, after reading both Bridget Jones' books I have now come to the realisation that, beyond the apparent funny story of Bridget's misfortunes, this book is a mockery of the behaviour of young women. The author uses extreme situations to portray the uselessness of the generation's dependence on entities such as the circle of friends, the self-help books, etc. to interpret reality and find support to fight their feeling of inadequacy. From this perspective, more than funny chick lit, this book is a critique of how young women face the most important issues of their lives, such as relationship, insecurities, fertile years, etc. The book also observes the hypocritical basis of female friendship, which is sometimes based on envy and jealousy, and the genetic inter-women competition. Overall, I recommend this book to any person wanting to have a critical appreciation of female thinking and the futility of the strategies that women are using to cope with life. On the other hand, the movies have been unable to translate the author's critical standpoint of the books."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Pure drivel. First book humorous, but this sequel is just derivitive of BJD and Jane Austen's Persuasion. I now don't even like Bridget. Nor do I get Mark Darcy. They certainly do not belong together. Helen Fielding and publishers were just trying to make money-although not from me, since I took this out of the library. I will not even read another Bridget Jones sequel."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I so enjoyed the first of the Bridget books that I eagerly plunked down the ... sticker price for the second (hard cover) edition, not wanting to wait for its paperback debut. What a waste. While the first book was chock full of quirks and oddities unlikely to challenge your typical \\"Singleton\\", there was still a lot in \\"Bridget Jones\\" to relate to. But... \\"Edge of Reason\\"? Initially I had given this sequal four stars; however, the next day I reread it and immediately changed my rating (must not have been paying much attention the first time... either that or I was still too busy chuckling over \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" to notice what drivel I was reading). African tribesman in modern suburbia? Accused drug smuggling? Thailand jails? Death threats? This book was truly beyond reason... in it we lost the \\"everyday\\" character that all over-30 singles can relate to. Instead we were \\"treated\\" to implausible, poorly strung-together, forced plotlines that completely overplayed the book's hand. The underlying romance with Mark Darcy is a farce... he tells Bridget that he loves her (and she, of course, is in raptures) yet manages to believe a conniving shrew over Bridget, mistrust her at every turn and eventually leave her with no option but... to leave. The staid, trustworthy Mark of the original installment would not jump to such ludicrous conclusions... and he would certainly be smart enough to see through Rebecca's acts of sabatoge. The re-introduction (though mercifully brief) of Daniel serves no real purpose to the novel, except to demonstrate Bridget's continual stupidity when it comes to men. Her mother, again, is over the top but, somehow, her antics aren't as interesting in this novel. Probably because somehow, Bridget is always on the outskirts of them... not actively participating in damage control, as she was in the first book. If you have somehow managed to avoid this book (and judging from the reviews out there, not many have - and yes, I realize I'm in the minority with this one), I would suggest - at best - only borrowing it from the library. Even in paperback, it's not worth it otherwise."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I just finished the book last night. The life of Bridget Jones is a silly mix of roadblocks that she puts up for herself. She finally has a boyfriend (Mark Darcy). She has gotten away from her old boss (Daniel Clever) and has a legitimate job as a tv reporter for Sit Up! England. In typical Bridget style, her life starts to unravel. She notices, with help from her friends, that Mark has a new collegue in his law office who is a long legged beautiful woman named Rebecca. Bridget is sure, by watching the 2 of them that Mark no longer loves her and is with Rebecca. The same thing that most women would think. She decides that she has to move on. Included in this, is try to stop smoking (not successful), throwing away her self help books and having work done on her flat. Her friend suggests this guy (Gary) who turns out to be a complete flake and psycho. During all of this, she is still thinks about Mark, but also fantasizes about Prince William and Colin Firth. Now for those who don't know this, Colin Firth is the actor that plays Mark Darcy in the Bridget Jones's movies. As a work assignment, Bridget has to go to Thailand. She brings one of her girlfriends with her as company. The entire trip is a disaster. A man they had met on the plane gives them a gift that has cocaine in it. So Bridget ends up in a Thai prison. She is released eventually. Gary, after leaving her out of money and with a hole in her flat, sends her a bullet, not sure why, but anyway Mark sees it and decides that Bridget should stay at his house in one of the guestrooms. One night she can't sleep so she walks down to the kitchen and nearly scares the hell out of Mark who is coming up the stairs back to his room. She tells him she loves him and he says he feels the same. It is a sort of happily ever after, but not like it is shown in the movie. I recently saw the movie and could see parts of the book in it, but there are also parts that didn't make it or won't there. Buy it. Its fun and a break from reality."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Alright.Phew.I know this is irrevelant..but,I made everybody I know read this book and the one before it and suprisingly enough everybody liked it so far.I'm an average guy,you do the maths.It means I rarely read books,let alone a woman's journey for perfection.But i read it 4 times!!!it's hilarious and I'm in Love with Bridget!She is just so naive at times.Who would mistake a bullet sent by someone who wants to kill you for lipstick or some kind of fancy pen.Or spend an entire interview with a star asking him about his wet shirt scene and trying to convince him his girlfriend's bad for him and then expecting a call congratulating her on a terrific interview from the newspaper.Once again,Trauma finds its way to Bridget's great new life with her love,Mark Darcy.Dragging along with it a hole in the wall,a guy her Mum's brought from South Africa,several parties to attend,(all of which she makes a fool out of herself in),her snobby boss,her friends marriage and TOTAL DISASTER,namely Rebecca,codenamed boyfriend stealing ...,who just tramples on bridget's private life with shoes that would cost half the price of Bridget's apartment when she steals Mark Darcy.Oh yeah,and the bullet she mistakes for lipstick or fancy pen.and she has other interviews she's messed up.And believe me,that's just the beggining,she also gets arrested in a foreign country.and a Ski Trip from [heck].Sometimes,it feels like Bridget is clueless and you love her for that.She isn't bossy or \\"Strong\\",she's just lost.This book actually reminds me of the term \\"look at the bright side\\".This book is GREAT.It also amazes you how she could juggle all that and still manage to count her calories,cigarettes and whether she has a phantom baby.The main point in this book is,you could see it if you wipe the tears of mirth from your eyes for a sec,is that in order to get what she wants,Bridget has to be herself and not resort to her self help books like they are the rules of life.She throws them out in a chapter called \\"Mars and Venus in The DustBin\\".Reading the story,I could honestly say:Take A Bow Bridget,You Deserve it"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I can't even imagine being in the situations Bridget seems to always find herself getting into. Sometimes she is a walking disaster and other times she saves the day. Each event is funnier than the previous one. She is forever in the most unimpressive situations when the one person she wants to impress the most is there. This sequel starts where the first leaves off with the beggings of her relationship with Mark Darcy. In true Bridget tradition, love does not last and Bridget turns to her self-help books and the advice of her well-meaning friends. Bridget can't seem to win at work and her freelanced Colin Firth interview is nothing short of a disaster, much to the readers amusement. She manages to get arrest for drug posession while vacationing in Thiland. But through it all, Bridget is strong and makes the best out of every situation. And it does have a happy ending. I really enjoyed the book. It reminds me of myself at times and of some friends of mine. We all go through similar things at some point in our lives where nothing seems to go our way, we live for the phone to ring, and our mother's drive us mad. This was just the next chapter in Bridget's life. I hope Helen Fielding will share the next chapter as well. I certainly find myself wanting more!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Even better than the first Bridget Jones book. I kept waiting for the diary format to get on my nerves, but it never did. I found myself having to put the book down because I was laughing so hard. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The Edge of Reason was a good read. However, at times, I was frustrated by Bridget's inability to get her life together. Her foolish and zany behavior was funny and lovable in the first novel, but in this novel it became a bit tiring. I would have liked to see some personal growth in Bridget, instead she remained the same ditzy, self-obsessed character she was in Bridget Jones' Diary. Nonetheless, if you liked Bridget Jone's Diary, you will enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I highly recommend reading Bridget Jones' Diary before reading this one. You will love the first, and if you are like me, will run to the closest bookstore to buy this one. I stood for twenty minutes in front of the stand reading this book. Decided had to buy it and almost finished it at the bookstore cafe. I told all my Singleton friends to read it. If have not read in reasonable time, must give them a copy as present. Enjoy the laughs."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The \\"Edge of Reason\\" is the best. It is absolutely hysterically funny. Between Magda and Jeremy's phone calls, Pam Jones's fascination with Africa, the Madonna songs for the prisoners and the Colin Firth interview at \\"Adrian's tomb\\" in Rome, I was laughing so hard, I almost lost consciousness. I am in awe of Helen Fielding. I'm reading \\"Cause Celeb\\" right now and it's hard to believe the same person wrote these books. Thanks to Ms. Fielding, the entire Mr. Darcy, Mark Darcy, Colin Firth connection finally clicked. I felt compelled to buy the Bridget Jones and Pride and Prejudice DVDs in order to fully appreciate Bridget's need to pop the Pride and Prejudice video in her machine at all times of crisis. Wow! The Bridget Jones girl may be stupid, but she certainly knows a thing or two about Colin Firth. In all seriousness, I now understand what a truly gifted actor he is. I'm still wondering what all the fuss was about his wet shirt, but what he does with just his eyes should be illegal in 50 states and all U.S. territories. I can't wait for the movie version of Edge of REason and I fervently hope Rene Zellwegger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant will reprise their roles."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I've just finished reading Helen Fielding's second Bridget Jones book and my initial reaction to it was it took quite an effort for me to go through right to the end of this book.I mean I loved the original-it's freshness,it's wit and her whole approach.Best of all was the Bridget Jones character herself who displays all the simple faults of us humans,all the normal insecurities we may have-but best of all is the way she bounces back from adversity time and again.It's all the same in this book-well I suppose if your dealing with the same character she can't really undergo a complete character metamorphisis-but I just found her sayings and mannerisms became sort of boring after a while.This book is like the classic comic movie sequel-you know it's never as funny as the original.There are some great scenes,her interview with the real Colin Firth was classic Bridget Jones and it's a hoot.But some of it becomes so far-fetched that it almost defies comic licence-especially the ending of her trip to Thailand and her encounters with an inept builder called Gary.I also found the other characters really irritating.Mark Darcy is a complete and utter wet blanket-I mean he's always so politcally correct,always says the right thing,is always in the right place-I mean there is nobody in this world who could be so perfect?Her parents begin to verge on the ridiculous-especially her mother's patronising adoption of a Tanzanian in his mid-20's and the phonecalls to her parents which always adopts the same style as both parents interupt each other and we always have two totally different conversations going on in the one phonecall-like yeah it was funny the first time!Some of the rotary club evenings are quite humorous though.Basically this book is fine for reading on a beach or on a long flight-it's mildly entertaining and it may pass the time.But it certainly is far from memorable!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Although &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; isn't quite up to the first Bridget Jones, it's still hilariously funny. This book uncovers all those ridiculous thoughts you have when you are by yourself. Read it, and laugh."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is so irritating -- Bridget has been so dumbed down. It's difficult to relate to a heroine who is so stupid and clumsy and &quot;can't do anything right.&quot; Of course, this is meant to be endearing, ala &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; -- but it's freakin' annoying. It's still entertaining, and I will read it till the end."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is by far the best I've read in a very long time, and in my opinion is much better than it's prequel &quot;Bridget Jones' diary&quot;. After seeing the film starring Rene' Zellwager and the particularly wonderful Colin Firth, I decided that to check out the book would only be fair as it is well known that it is very often better before it is shaped for the big screen. Rather than conforming to everyone else's opinion that this was also true of this novel, I preffered the film. However, after borrowing the &quot;Edge of reason&quot; from a very close friend who demanded that I have it back in her hands within 12 hours I was finally allowed to take it home with me. I found that I couldn't put it down for one moment, and was highly annoyed when my mother called me down for dinner. Other than that one interruption, I read the entire thing from cover to cover and it only took me 8 hours to do so. Of course this took me through to around 3:00am but what the hey? It was worth it. I especially liked the interview between Bridget and Colin Firth...I don't think I have ever laughed so much at a book in my life. Bridget is definately the girl of today, and with some of the things that she came out with in this book I just know that there is a little bit of her in all of us. Absolutely brilliant, and the funniest book I've ever been lucky enough to read. Of course it did help being able to picture Colin Firth in the role of Bridget's boyfriend Mark Darcy...if only!!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Upon hearing there was a sequel to Bridget Jones I immediately rushed out to purshase it. Though on the whole it was a good read, it missed the same sense of humor that the first on poessessed. Perhaps it is because Bridget has somewhat settled into living with Mark, and I felt she became too mature too quickly. However, there were the few humurous moments that kept me reading on. Overall it was just a good read, but disappointing compared to the first."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I thought the book was funny, but I was bothered by how stupid Bridget was in many parts of the book. No one is that stupid. The situations were just a bit far-fetched. Also, I can't beleive the Thai prison thing was just a coincidence..."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This sequal was just as wonderful as the first Bridget Jones novel. Although, I did have an idea of what would happen in the end, it was still very entertaining and funny. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good laugh!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Like many people, I became intrigued with Bridget Jones after seeing the movie, and, naturally, was curious to see how well the book had been adapted to the big screen. Of course, I pulled a very Bridget-like move: I went and bought the wrong book. In retrospect, however, I'm glad I did.The Edge of Reason picks up right where the movie (and hopefully the book!) ends, so I was able to get into it pretty easily. In fact, I couldn't put it down. I took the book everywhere I went for two whole days! It's rare when a book captures and HOLDS your attention from beginning to end, so I especially recommend this book for those who are trying to get back into reading.While some aspects of the plot did seem a little too zany to be believable, I think that most women can identify with Bridget Jones and many of the situations she ends up in. Not only does the character help us laugh at our own faux pas, but it also reminds us that we are not alone in our struggles, that there are other women out there who are dealing with the very same issues and insecurities.I look forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is the funniest of Bridget's tales. You will follow Bridget from London to a drug prison in Thailand and back again. It is the continuation of her newly found relationship with the thrilling Mark Darcy, the next step between Vile Richard and Jude, and more of her parents' marital nightmares involving rehab centers and strange men from Africa. I laughed out loud which is something I rarely do when reading. It is again in journal form and will have you rolling on the floor reading her thoughts. And when you're finished, you won't be able to wait for a third dose of Bridget's humor. From an interview with Colin Firth to nightmare birthday party for three year olds, Bridget is the greatest imperfect heroine."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is marvelous! I can't believe that everyone didn't give it 5 stars. I enjoyed this book even more than the first. To those that say this book has nothing new to offer, I say Gaah! I feel like I know Bridget, that she's one of my Singleton friends. I finished the book today and feel that I will miss her funny, sweet company. A great read for anyone looking for some laughs."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The thing that was SO funny about the first BJD was how Feilding treated the mundane moments of BJ's life. There were many laugh out loud moments that dealt with something as small as her failed diet, reasons for smoking and the people in her life (Smug Married or Singltons.) The problem with this book is that it has BJ get herself into a number of implausible situations. (Getting arrested in Thailand, interviewing Colin Firth, etc) It took away the humor of the actual diary and turned it into a fantasy adventure. While some may like the action, I missed the everyday life of BJ struggling with her job, weight, smoking, eating, desperation, self-help books and men. All that was lost in between crises. Not a bad book but not BJD either."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Once again Bridget Jones was enormously funny. Perhaps not quite as amusing as the first book for me, as I found myself frustrated by the main character's actions at several points. Nonetheless, worth repeated readings. Helen Fielding has again paralleled and parodied Jane Austin, in this case &quot;Persuasion&quot;, in a manner that is sure to greatly amuse Austin fans. The parodies are not carried to extremes but are lighthearted and pleasurable, serving to remind us that social situations may change over the centuries but that people do not. Bridget continues to flounder through life in an enormously entertaining fashion."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"In this sequel to &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;, Helen Fielding proves there is more fun and laughter in neuroses. Bridge is still obsessing over each stone she puts on, and worrying whether being a &quot;Singleton&quot; proves that she will die alone.What's a girl to do when every invite to a party means having to put up with Smug Marrieds? Bridge grabs a glass and leaps in to deal with them all. Her friends Shazzer and Jude are in for the ride too, to provide that special brand of support.Ah, but here her life begins to change: is there a place for her is front of the telly? Who is that young tribesman with her Mum? Does Mark Darcy really mean to leave her for the Asian houseboy? Answering these burning questions is worth the price of the book, alone.It is worth it the debut &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; to get the background on Miss Jones and her gang, but not necessary. For a good laugh, curl up by that winter fire and crack open this book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Briget is back and ready for new crazy adventures. The Londoner singleton is still hunting for the perfect man. This novel is simply delicious. It's an unputdownable, and unlike other sequels equals the first novel. I've laughed so many times that I can't even count them. Though this novel tends to be unrealistic at times, I can assure you that you will spend a yummy moment following Bridget in the discovery of true love, if there really is such a thing... So get ready for a wild time and a good laugh. Don't miss it! Get it NOW!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Wow! Helen Fielding is an expert on comedy and irony. I thought she couldn't possibly pull off a sequel to Bridget Jones's Diary. Boy, was I wrong! Bridget is funnier than ever! I love the whole Bridget, Mark Darcy and Rebecca love triangle, very amusing! Are you looking for a laugh? Read Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason. But you should definitely read the original."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"i just finished reading &quot;The Edge of Reason.&quot; I was thinking it wouldn't be as good as &quot;diary&quot; but I was mistaken. I loved this book. It was a v.g summer read. I read it every chance I got, I could not wait to see what happen next with Mark, Jude and Rebecca (nasty nasty woman). I think anyone young woman can identify with this book. You may not be Bridget Jones, but you do have to root for her."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"If you liked the first one, you'll love the second. If you haven't read the first one - buy it NOW! This is one of those sequels that you hope is only #2 in a long line of books. I was impressed that Fielding was able to come up with a very fresh plot, but still let the reader stay attached to all great characters from the first book. I cannot wait for the movie - and hopefully another book!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"As much as I loved the first Bridget book, I am having a very hard time maintaining my interest in this sequel, much to my disappointment. I find myself constantly feeling impatient at the lack of change and personal growth in the characters. All of the things they said and did and felt in the first book are identical in the second. I keep wanting to yell at Bridget &quot;Stop living in the same old rut -- and try growing up a bit!&quot; The writing is frequently humorous, and I've gotten some good laughs, but overall I feel this is a retread of the first book -- a few of the names have changed, but the situations and experiences and dialog are the same ole same ole."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The first book of this &quot;series&quot; was exactly what it was supposed to be--a desperate singles story. However, I expected this one to chronicle Bridget Jones in a relationship. Boy, was I wrong. Single again, she is quickly driven into the same self-help cycles as the first book. Come on, Fielding...just reprint the first one with a couple names crossed out."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I just had to re-read this before watching the movie. Last time I read it I bought a ticket to London. I might just have to do the same again. One of the best characters of all time"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"People have compared this story to Jane Austin's Persuasion, which I haven't read (yet). Personally, I was struck by the similarity to \\"The Importance of Being Earnest.\\" Bridget and friends are like the diarists in that play - nothing is real until it has been shared with the diary and with phone calls to friends. No wonder Mark Darcy feels he's being disected!The basic plot - Bridget and Mark, who got together just at the end of Bridget Jones's Diary, hit a crisis a few weeks into their relationship (one of those easily resolvable movie-type crises that could be solved in two minutes, but then how would you fill up the rest of the time?). They split up, and it's a foregone conclusion they will reunite, but the fun is in the journey. This book seems to be every bit as fun as a the first, and yet I was left, at the end, feeling like the journey wasn't as interesting. It's partly because of the unbelievable absurdity of the breakup, but more because the characters are just that much more over-the-top. The book has moved from the sublime to the rediculous, as it were.That's not to say I don't recommend the book for anyone that liked the first one. It is fun, a quick read, and will have you chuckling if not laughing out loud. Both sexes will enjoy it - if Bridget is a carricature of the modern professional woman, the men are certainly the male equivalents (if less developed). So have a seat by the pool (or heat lamp, if it's winter) and turn off your brain for a few hours."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book. The narrator did a terrific job, but I still didn't enjoy it as much as the original. Bridget is such a ninny that at times she becomes downright annoying. She's hopeless at her job, chronically late, and insistant on listening to advice from girlfriends who steer her in the absolutely wrong direction. She gives a builder who she knows does terrible work money to do a major job (and ends up with nothing more than a hole in her wall), gets a plum interview with Colin Firth (a wink-wink tie-in to the movie), asks him ludicrous questions and then can't get it together to actually write the article she's contracted for, and that's not even mentioning her adventures in Thailand.I also don't think her character was consistant in regards to Mark Darcy. A girl like Bridget wouldn't have let him simply drift away after a misunderstanding, but would have probably plagued him with phone calls. Surely one of her self-help books would have instructed her not to give up on the relationship so easily.There are funny bits, however, such as Bridget surviving prison by teaching the inmates Madonna songs. The book is set up for another sequel - I just hope this time she isn't such a twit."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"When I read the first book about Bridget Jones, I loved it, even being a man. I laughed out loud and found the book to be very inventive. Other than that, even being a little crazy, she seemed like every other woman with high hormones.In this one, Bridget Jones is just like a caricature. Although it's good to see Bridget in other places different than the others ones - like a travel to Tailand - , she doesn't say a single line that doesn't seem to have been spoken by a crazy child, she is not serious in a single chapter and seem not to have the faintest idea of what the human being is as for their behavior and mind thinking. The book is not as funny as the first one. I didn't laugh in a single line and it's even dull sometimes. I think it's much better if Helen Fielding come up with another character, because Bidget Jones is not as good as she used to be anymore. If she writes another book like that, I think she'll perceive that the life of Bridget Jones is not interesting to her readers as it was once. If you wanna try it under your own risk, do it. If you have nothing better else to read... Just don't tell me that I didn't warn ya!Marco Aurelio."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Amusing and cute, but it did not live up to the first Bridget Jones novel."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Loved this book, absolutely awesome. This is one of my favorite books ever!! I think it is better than the first, and much much more funnier!!! I cannot wait till the movie comes out!!!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding's latest adventure for Bridget Jones borders on the unbelievable at times, but is utterly enjoyable. Reading the book a second time, I realized what I missed the first time--this is Jane Austen's PERSUASION and it is laugh-out-loud-in-public funny.Bridget's mum is on another trip and brings back another man, this time a Kikuyu warrior (or at least a nearly seven-foot-tall African male of the Kikuyu tribe) named Wellington. But it is Bridget who finds herself in jail this time, a la BROKE DOWN PALACE, which was the only unbelievable element in the book.Like anyone who governs their life by turning to self-help books and conferences with friends, which inevitably turn into dissections of every minute detail of a date or relationship, Bridget and Mark Darcy's break-up while the romance is still budding is unfortunate and sad, but all too believable. Mark Darcy expects Bridget to call or at least come by and Bridget is following her friends' and MEN ARE FROM MARS, WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS advice and letting him realize his rubber band attraction and spring back to her, only he doesn't spring back, which proves to Bridget and her friends Darcy was only dating her for the moment.As annoying and under-handed as Rebecca, one of Bridget's sort-of-friends-but-really-not-friends, is, she is the distillation of every man-stealing, back-stabbing, well-to-do stick insect female ever known and thus more aggravating and hilarious in her ham-handed attempts to co-opt Mark Darcy. Granted, she is a bit wearing on the nerves, but someone had to play Louisa Musgrove's part with Captain Wentworth (aka Mark Darcy) who is too proud to tell Bridget what he feels while Bridget is too full of self-help nonsense and helpful friends' advice to tell him she misses him. Ah, pride and prejudice once again.What really makes this book worth the read is not just Bridget Jones's Singleton adventures (and she is not a total klutz in a real emergency or two), but Helen Fielding's witty prose and social commentary. Sometimes confusing and frustrating, always funny, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON is well worth reading again and again. I can hardly wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"OMG, this was a laugh a page. I was wary, as follow up books are rarely as good as the original. But this book was even better than the first. And much better than the movie!!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"i was pleasantly pleased with this sequel. i have not yet read the first book, but had seen the movies. it took me a little while to get into this book because of the diary format. but once i got it, i was hooked. i finished it in 3 days. i just wish they had made the movie more like the book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Really this book was a fun read. I laughed out loud a couple of times and that is a good sign, in any book. In her first book Helen Fielding left me with this conviction that, \\"Oh My God! I'm Bridget Jones\\". She was righting about me, and I am a single woman, living a world away from London.Really it was(is) a phenomena that had instant success, even before the release of the movies.The Edge of Reason does not dissapoint, its the very same Bridget. And as a self professed Austen fan I enjoyed the tongue -in- cheek allussions to Persuasion.So Miss Fielding, could we persuade you to right another sequal, with wedding bells perhaps."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This is a silly story about a young adult girl who is desperate to find a man. The plot centers around her ordinary life along with her attempts to become married before she gets too old. Some of her thoughts and interactions are very funny. Not as interesting as Bridget Jones's Diary, however!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I LOVED the first Bridget Jones novel, and this one lived up to expectations. I listened to the audio CD version, and at times was laughing so hard I'm sure other drivers thought I was crazy.

Keep 'em coming!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read this book way before the First Bridget Jones came out on dvd. This is a great book, and they should have been smart and made the movie about this. I wish she had more than the three books!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"If possible, \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" is even funnier than the original book.The book opens with Bridget settled into happy domesticity with Mark Darcy....not! Her insecurities have not left her and they wreak havoc on her life. She's panicked Mark will leave her for the lovely Rebecca, she's uncomfortable that he folds his underwear at night, she's struggling on the job...and this all leads to the inevitable break-up with Mark.I don't want to ruin the many twists and turns of the plots. Suffice to say, her adventures (and those of her friends Shazzer and Jude and of her parents) are even more laugh out loud funny the ones in the original. And all throughout the book, Bridget never loses her sense of vulnerability and her decency. She is a true heroine (or anti-heroine perhaps).This book differs from the new movie. So even if you've seen that, you're still in for some surprises.I highly recommend this book to Bridget lovers everywhere."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Hurrah!

Rebecca is what Bridge and co. calls a 'Jellyfish', someone who seems all nice and happy and then lunges out at you and stings.But, her problems with Mark are often pushed into the background, as her friends and family wreak havok over themselves and poor Bridge. Her mother heads to Africa with Una Alconbury and comes back with an African tribesman, to the horror of her husband, Jude attempts to settle down with Vile Richard, Tom is stuck in his on again off again relationship with Pretentious Jerome, and Shazzer is having one of those 'just friends' shagging habits.Even though her job's ghastly, her ex-boyfriend gets drunkk and tries to get back together and she somehow ends up in a Thai jail, Bridget makes it through the year, every year.Best book ever, made me laugh more than the first. Better than Harry Potter, less pretentious."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I found this book to be better than the original, with enough action and edge of your seat plot-twists to keep anyone engaged fully."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"For me it was like an addiction, I read the first Bridget Jones and then HAD to read the second. While her flightyness was an occasional eyeroller at times, I just kept reading and eventually came away completley satisfied. I am actually hoping there is a third book and am counting down the days until Edge of Reason is a movie!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Wonderful book, but I thought it was a little far fetched when she was in the prison. I don't think they are that nice, but then again I've never been to a prison in another country. Maybe the pushup bra would be a great addition to any woman wardrobe, even if it were just a potato sack. Besides that, the book was wonderful. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"As much as I adored the first one I liked the second incarnation of Bridget even better. It is far funnier and far more focused than the first book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Although I loved Bridget Jones Diary, I found this one lacking something. Mainly, it was any originality in the first half of the book. It was more of Bridget messing up, disfunctional friends and family, etc. It wasn't even really funny as the original book had been.In the middle, however, Ms. Fielding got her second wind, threw in some plot twists and the laughs started up again. While not as funny as the first book, it still had some great moments and is worth a read."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The sequel to Bridget Jones's Diary is very funny. A quick read that you do not want to end."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I liked the &quot;Diary&quot;, but this was even funnier! My husband read it, and I read it, and we both laughed out loud. Not many books can make me do that! It's not great literature, but so what. It's funny and enjoyable and easy to read. And if you have read great literature (Persuasion, by Jane Austen), you'll have some clues about what's likely to happen next."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I was in absolute pain and tears from laughing so hard. Pure entertainment!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Unbeleiveably a &quot;must read&quot; if you have already been blessed to read Helen Fieldings' first book, Bridget Jones Diary. This is not a &quot;woe is me&quot;, &quot;woman power&quot; book like I have heard people refer it to. This is genuine good laughs and a book you will wake up from a deep sleep wanting more. I just hope that Helen Fielding comes out with a new book SOON!!!! Bridget Jones is the girl next door. She feels and thinks the way all of us women have done at one time or another in our lives. You won't be disappointed!!! And Helen Fielding should get the praise she deserves!!! ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"OK, Love Bridget. Really. I do. I'm always flipping to the back cover to look at Helen Fielding and imagine her to be Bridge. The best fantasy after the ones about sex are ones about the perfect girlfriend. And that's what Helen's given us with Bridget Does Anything. One small mark against Volume II: the end, while fun, funny and still Bridgetinteresting, is somewhat too whacky. Come on, we all like Bridget just fine in her flat, chugging chardonnay, watching Mr. Darcy come out of that damned pond ONCE AGAIN in the soaking wet puffy shirt. We don't really need a stretch in an Indonesian prison . . . But, hey, it's Bridget. And I really don't mean to complain. Buy. Read. You'll love."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget Jones Edge of Reason is the perfect sequel to the first book written by Helen Fielding. It captures your attention not only with the continuence of british humor but blends in many new adventures for Bridget in her quest to maintain a relationship, lose weight, quit smoking and drinking, and above all get rid of her obsession with self help books. Fielding cleverly captivates her audience to the point where you can't wait to read Bridgets weight for the next day and how many seconds it has been since she last had sex. Bridget is a very lovable character whom every girl in the world can relate too.This is another fantastic book by Helen Fielding! It looks as though Fielding may be starting a series for this much loved singleton! HOORAY!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I think that it would be a tough challenge for an author to write a sequel, especially one to a popular book like Bridget Jones' Diary. It's inevitable that fans of the original will develop ideas and expectations as to how the characters will grow. If the author doesn't meet these expectations, then the book isn't well received. Fortunately, Fielding manages to avoid this trap. This book maintains all the charms of the original, while managing to advance the characters in a natural, logical way.Fans will be delighted to find that the humorous spirit of the original is maintained. The situations in which the characters are placed are as outlandish and witty as before. Yet, the book isn't just a series of hilarious misadventures. There is a growth that's depicted in all the characters. Bridget seems to learn a lot about herself through the course of the book. The other characters also depict the little changes that constitute growth in a person. The result of these depictions is that the book, while still very funny, has an undercurrent of seriousness that makes it seem more realistic than one would first imagine.Don't let the slightly serious tone fool you. Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is still great fun. It's a very worthy follow-up to the original. I, for one, can't wait for the next volume of Bridget's diaries to see where Fielding next takes these characters."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is great! I thought it would be impossible to top the first one but it looks like Helen Fielding did! The Edge of Reason is extremely funny and very easy to relate to. I've just started reading again and with books like this, I don't think I'll ever stop!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Monday 18 JuneNo. of times laughed out loud: Countless (v.g.), No of times wanted to throttle Bridget for not standing up for herself: 6 or 7 (poor), No. of happy endings: 1 (excellent!)3p.m. Home officeThe first half of the book had me laughing out loud, what with Bridget's tribulations with unruly scary underthings, her scatterbrained mum's usual chaos, discussions of &quot;active appendages&quot; and such.The story became more and more far-fetched as Rebecca's intentions became obvious and the botched holiday in Thailand. But it was really in good fun. I'm thankful, yet sad ( and envious) that only Bridget experiences this life so full of tumult and chaos."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I loved the first book, and I wasn't disappointed when I read this one. The version I read is the one from England, and I understand it's a little different...Bridget's adventures always leave me laughing until my stomach hurts. This book won't let you down!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Just to keep it short and sweet: This book brings us even more hilarious, unexpected twists and funny scenes than the last one. She continues to develop some of the most enjoyable, original characters I've seen in literature in the past few years. The movie comes out today, and I'm not ashamed to say that I am looking forward to seeing these great people come to life."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is fabulous. Like many people I am often sceptical about sequels, whether it be books or movies. But Helen Fielding has written a funny and poignant book that had me in stitches and I was unable to put it down. Its almost 12 years since I have been out there in &quot;singletondom&quot;, but reading this book made me feel like it was just last week. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read both Bridget Jones books while on vacation recently and loved them both. I'm a 30 something who has been married a long time so it didn't reflect my life, but I could have sworn my sister was one of Bridget's friends. Over the years I've listened to numerous conversations concerning intimate e-mails, feng shui, home renovations, etc. Getting inside Bridget's comical brain was a lot more fun! What I liked about &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; was that it was not more of the same--it was Bridget PLUS. The situations were bigger, funnier, and also more outrageous (monkeys in bed???). It's not Shakespeare but it is an engaging and fun read. Great for the beach."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This sequel to Bridget's Diary is as good as, if not better than, the first and has me thoroughly addicted to the relationship-challenged thirty-something London-er.In the beginning of this book, Bridget has good friends, a boyfriend (finally!), a decent job, and a nice flat in London. But Bridget, being Bridget, finds herself in the midst of a feud with a good friend (who is moving from Singleton into life as a Smug Married by planning to wed Vile Richard), minus a boyfriend (evidently captured by the awful Rebecca, an absolutely perfect slim and trendy blonde with no qualms about stealing someone's man).Her mother's off with yet another foreign man, Gary the contracter has left a huge hole in one of Bridget's apartment walls, her dream job comes with an insane boss, the weight goes up, the weight goes down and that relaxing exotic vacation ends up more like Midnight Express than Stella Finds Her Groove.Relying on all the self-help books she owns (and she owns them all), Bridget still struggles, crashes and burns. Her life is humorous largely because it is strangely familiar to single women (of all ages). Her wants, desires, and worries are universal to women of all ages and time periods -- the books are modern-inized versions of Pride and Prejudice and Persuasian.Read them both, then join those of us who are waiting for the next book (and the movie and the tube version)."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"In the sequel to Bridget Jones' &quot;Diary&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; picks up almost immediately where the Diary left off: Bridget is with Mark Darcy, and thinks she should be 'happy'. But all is not well: Mark seems more interested in football, Bridget's friends are having problems, her mother is off to Africa, her father is drinking, and a new character, Rebecca (with &quot;thighs like a baby giraffe&quot;), is after Mark. Plus, Bridget is still obsessed with her weight, her smoking, and how many alcohol &quot;units&quot; she consumes. How Bridget copes -- or doesn't -- with all of the above makes for an hilarious read. However, there are some serious moments and some characters that sometimes don't fit well into the novel; for example, Bridget and Shazz's trip to Thailand starts off one way and ends very differently. These minor glitches don't ruin the book, and maybe author Helen Fielding was trying to see if her character learns anything from her trials and tribulations (hint: not quite). The highest comedy point is Bridget's Rome &quot;interview&quot; with Colin Firth: it will make you laugh out loud. (Fielding actually thanks Firth in the acknowledgements.) Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The Edge of Reason is fabulous. I must confess that I was somewhat apprehensive about reading this sequel, but it more than lived up to expectations. The Bridget Jones' series is a must for single women everywhere, although I think others will enjoy it as well. While there has been much debate about what are the best reads for single women, my personal favorites are Bridget Jones, Fried Calamari, and The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Loved it! Just as funny and delightful as the first! Still in love with Bridget &amp; Mark Darcy, although wish could have had more of them! So depressed when book ended, felt like a friend left me behind!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I've reaslised HF has lifted much of her second books from Jane Austen's Persuasion which I've just finished. For example:The scence where MArk is writing a letter at a party whilst Bridget is saying that if you love a man you cannot get him out of your system. Lifted straight from the Anne, Captain Wentworth scene.The scene where Bridget is telling Giles about self help books at dinner party. Lifted straight from the bit at Lyme where Anne consoles a captain who has lost his wife by referring to comforting literary texts.The scene where Rebecca jumps from the bridge = the scene where Louisa falls from the cob - I could go on.It spoiled my enjoyment of the original classic no end! Helen your books are really funny anyhow, I'm sure you could have managed without such clumsiness! Or is literature like pop music now and you can get away with it under the guise of a tribute?"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"A nice, fast read. I read both diaries and though I found this one less memorable than the first, it is far from offensive. Best to read while driving or at work. Concentration is not essential."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I cant deny the fact that it s an enjoyable and easy read book. Actually, I can relate to it very much, even though I come from a different background. The thing that turned me off was the amount of racism that you included in your book. You put it in a funny way and pretty light humor, but as I am Muslim and African, I didnt really appreciate the Attitude. Mentioning my prophet as a subject to dating is pretty humiliating in our religion. Along with ohter parts in the book, which talk about Kuran. You need to know that these things are sacred to us and they are not a subject of humor and sarcasm."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"&quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot; was just not nearly as good as the first one. I felt like I had to force myself to finish it. I don't live in London so most of the dialogue was lost on me! Bridget and Mark were a disaster waiting to happen and Sharon was a schmuck! As for Mark and Rebecca: that was the only really funny part of the book! I'd say skip buying this one!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"What the hell happend to this one. I couldn't even finish this; I returned it to the library when I was 1/2 way through!Her first novel was pretty good, but not great. The dialogue was getting me crazy! I know the lines are supposed to be quick and funny, BUT THIS WAS NOT FUNNY! Too much for my taste!If you want to read something hilarious try &quot;Watermelon&quot; by Marian Keyes. That one will make you pee laughing!I SAY &quot;ENOUGH OF THE DRY ENGLISH HUMOR.&quot; IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY ANYMORE!&quot;A NOTE TO THE AUTHOR: &quot;PLEASE DO NOT COME OUT WITH A 3RD TO THIS!&quot;"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is a nice diary about Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) in her 30s, facing a difficulties in her love life. Her mother is urging her to get close to Mark (Colin Firth) that she doesn't really like. On her new job, she falls in love with her boss, David (Hugh Grant). After a while, their relationship become complicated as David met Lara, his co-worker in New York. After this point, big things happen in her life. She has to make a decision, a difficult decision, that will change her life.This book is written in dates, just like a personal journal or diary. The details of things and people around her are described in detail. Some humors and funny terms are found in her diary, making it fun to read along her diary.Overall, the story in her diary is not so special, but you can learn something new from her diary, her life. You learn new things about relationship and love life. This book will be more meaningful and heart-touching for those who are in work life and may be facing the same problem as Bridget Jones."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"A ho-hum sequel. Sure, it's fun. The characters are all back and the laughs still flow, but the plot is thin, the story is ridiculously unbelievable, and so much of this story is plucked right out of some classic novels, including Pride and Prejudice. Overall, this is a rushed sequel, contrived, and far less enjoyable or inspiring than its predecessor. A bubbly, witty, and consistently surprising Bridget Jones gives way to a boring, paranoid, and totally un-funny darker side."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I like the story, I like the movie, but the book was impossible to read. It was just too broken up with a lot of slang - maybe if I hadn't seen the movie first I would have enjoyed it, but after a few pages I put the book down, it just wasn't worth the effort."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I haven't enjoyed the original 'Bridget Jones', but after reading a lot more 'chick lit' since then, I learned to appreciate Helen Fielding's work, and gave 'The Edge of Reason' a try.Authors sometimes try to replicate their original &quot;hit&quot; story line again and again (and again)until even their most devout fans are sick and tired of it. Fortunately for us, Helen Fielding hadn't done that. Not only did Bridget grow up - so did most of her co - characters, and the plot takes them to some exotic places, but also to some familiar ones."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book was even better than the first of the series. I loved this book. It was fun and easy to get back into the groove of bridget. I love her character and wish there was more of her."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The Edge of Reason proved to be good in all aspects. It totally fulfilled questions I had about what happened to Bridget after the first book. This book was worth reading and flew by. Anyone who wants to be entertained by a book should definetly check this one out!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read much of this book while working out on the eliptical machine at the gym and it really made me forget where I was and laugh out loud. And believe me, having a laughing outburst at the gym is worse than having one in the library!As sequels go this one cannot be missed. Rest assured, Bridget fans, you can hold it to the same standards as the first one. She's the same Bridget with the same personal crises and picadillos, but there's originality to it as well. This is not just a copy of Bridget Jone's Diary. Bridget evolves, and comically falls into the same ruts now and then.Since the movie isn't out yet this book is definately worth reading before hitting the theatres. Look for the chapter that has caused a dilemma in the film production: Colin Firth makes a cameo appearance as himself."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I had read the book but had to listen to it on tape. I laughed and giggled myself all over town. Vg Fun!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Even funnier than the first one. Helen is a very successful writer. I love her work. Hope she'd write more of Bridget Jones."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book is good, but I didn't like it as much as the original. This one seemed to drag on a little long, but it was still enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I liked the first Bridget Jones book, LOVED the movie with Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth, and tremendously enjoyed this sequel. As much as Ms. Fielding probably tried to separate Mark Darcy and Colin Firth by actually having Bridget interview Colin Firth in this book, I couldn't help but see Mark Darcy as being Colin Firth. If they ever make a movie of this book, I hope that they cast the same people in the Bridget/Mark Darcy roles."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"If you read &quot;The...Diary&quot; then you must follow up with this one. Just as funny and full of the same blunders. This one should be a movie as well. Easy read and it will keep you on your toes."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I ate up this book like candy..Every one should read this book solely because it is hillarious!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The first installment was funny, quick, and thoughtful. Bridget Jones was an endearing character whose foibles were as lovable as her charms.But Bridget Jones in the follow-up was trite. Poorly developed. Boring. Self-conscious for the sake of being self-conscious. You get the feeling that the publisher rushed Helen Fielding back to the typewriter after the delirious success of the first one...."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Having read other people's reviews elsewhere, I was prepared for a disappointing sequel. To my surprise, I liked the sequel even more than I liked the first book! Bridget is funny, single, and insecure about love and life...like many of us singletons. The self-help tripe was a little much (I always think the people who get the most help from those books are the publishers and authors), but in the end, Bridget reigns supreme! Great laughs, especially the Turkish prison escapade. A great summer read!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book was so great. I had heard of the first one but wasn't too thrilled about it. I saw this one while walking out of the library and picked it up. I read it and fell in love with it. This woman is so down to earth. She is actually believable and has real believable problems. You'll enjoy this book and laugh out loud several times while you're reading it. :)"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I'd heard that this book wasn't as good as the original. While of course the format is not new anymore and Bridget's tone is familiar, this was a riot to read.After a few weeks of blissful romance with Mark Darcy, Bridget's world begins to disintegrate, little by little, beginning with the evil Rebecca, who will stop at nothing to pry Mark away from an insecure Bridget, and, most memorably, the &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot; episode where Bridget finds herself in leg irons in a Thai prison.Of course it all ends well, but for a few moments there, we do suffer along with Bridget and cheer for her at her happy ending."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I had to read this book twice to decide whether or not to give it 4 or 5 stars. In fact, the first time I read it, I was in such a hurry to find out what happened, I missed much of the intricate detail that Feilding weaves into this book. Upon my second reading, however, I knew this book had to get the full 5.&quot;Edge of Reason&quot; has a greater depth than &quot;B.J.&quot; but it equally as witty and funny. Perhaps not the most, er, realistic of plots, but it's just close enough to real life to make readers identify with Bridge's mishaps. I was practically rolling on the floor at Bridge's Christmas cards that she sent, her plots to outwit the Evil Jellyfish Rebecca, and her attempt to find the perfect man with &quot;long eyelashes&quot; through the personal ads. On a positive note, though, this book made me think more so than the first one. It explored a few more serious issues, though always in a tongue-in-cheek way, and showed how miscommunication in a relationship can make things much more difficult than they have to be.My main complaint about this episode - what the heck happened to Tom? I miss him! He is just a side note to this book, making him seem less of a crucial friend to Bridge and a whole lot more superficial/insensitive.Overall, however, this book neatly finishes a lot of loose ends from the first installment. There is somewhat of a cliffhanger ending, which leaves B.J. fans certainly hoping that Fielding will write another book, and leave it at a trilogy.A survival guide for women everywhere who are desperately clinging to their sanity! Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I loved the first Bridget Jones' Diary! This was even greater. There were times when I was disappointed in Bridget herself, but I really liked the lessons learned here. Definitely an entertaining read, and a great follow up to the first! I absolutely could not put this down. If you don't buy this book, its the stupidest thing you have ever done!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book comes into a different climate than the original, which launched the publication of many new books in the independant-woman's-coming-of-age genre. It no longer has the fresh originality of the first, nor does it compare well to other, better, recent books, like the Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing. On the other hand, it launches right into the amusing Bridget tone and sustains it throughout. There were quite a few times in the first half when I couldn't get into the story. Often, the characters are being annoyingly stupid just to advance a plot point, and most of the situations are standard, over-the-top, boring sit-com fare. It reads like a B movie. And yet, I kept reading and eventually was drawn back in and enjoyed the resolution. We do have to hand it to Ms. Fielding for jump-starting a genre that I'm enjoying overall. I just hope they don't make a movie out of this story - we've seen it already."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"...but I was irresistably drawn in by both novels! I found myself becoming patently annoyed with Bridget throughout much of the new book, but stuck by her as I would a friend who repeatedly made bad choices. I too cheated and brought my copy to work because I simply had to find out what happened."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget is back! I fell in love with the first diary, and reading the second was like falling in love all over again! Helen Fielding has done it again. I admit, the Thailand trip was a little bizarre and a bit far-fetched, but amusing just the same. The interview with Colin Firth was hilarious, and I was so glad to see things work out for Bridget and Mark Darcy. Also, the downfall of Rebecca, the &quot;jelly fish&quot; was great---it is so easy to identify with Fielding's characters. I hope she will bring Bridget and the gang (Jude, Shazzer, Tom, Vile Richard, and of course, Mark) back for at least one more diary!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book was enjoyable and a very quick read. However, I didn't find it halfway as good as the first Bridget Jones and felt some of the scenarios were a little overboard. If you are looking for another book of the &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; genre, there are much better ones out there!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"As soon as I finished reading &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; I ran out and bought \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.\\" I couldn't wait to see if it was as good as the first book. Although &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; redeemed itself in the end, I have to say that I was actually disappointed--or rather, annoyed--by much of this sequel.In &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary,&quot; Bridget's ditziness was endearing, but this time around I found myself thinking, &quot;Come on, Bridget, you're a grown woman--how can you be THAT stupid?&quot; at least every other page. She just came across as embarrassingly incompetent during the first two-thirds of the book. The interview with Colin Firth, who I adore every bit as much as Bridget does, made me cringe, not laugh.Another irritation--and I admit, this is a petty one--the constant use of the exclamation &quot;Gaaaah!&quot; really got on my nerves. The first one or two uses were cute, but after that it made me feel that someone was sneaking up on Bridget and scaring her from behind during almost every diary entry. It was distracting.Third (and last) complaint: The story was long and meandering, with way too many tangents. Bridget's flat, her mother's Kenyan &quot;souvenir,&quot; Mark and Rebecca, the election, Uncle Geoffrey, Colin Firth, the trip to Thailand--too much going on! Halfway through the book, I considered not bothering to finish it.That said, I did finish it, and I'm glad I did--I enjoyed the last third of this book so much that it almost redeemed the rest of it for me. I loved the parts where Bridget and Mark were together--they're a great couple, and I wish more of the book had been specifically about their relationship. Bridget's stint in jail, while maybe a bit far-fetched, had me laughing out loud, and I LOVED it when Rebecca finally got exactly what she deserved. Bridget struck a blow for average girls everywhere with that victory! It was good to see Bridget grow up a little and gain some confidence at last.Helen Fielding is a very funny writer; she's captured the self-centered Singleton life to a T. I hope she plans to write another Bridget novel--maybe Bridget and her friends can become Smug Marrieds themselves (just, please, no more celebrity interviews!). All in all, I recommend the book for Bridget fans, if only to see what happened after the first book ended."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This one picks up shortly after the end of the first book, and continues on the same vein. Our heroine is still tallying all the previous day's good deeds, bad indulgences, and justifying how all of this falls into her master plan. I'm not positive, but I don't think she makes it to the gym once in the sequel.But Bridget does find a way to lose lots of pounds during the book. While on a trip overseas, she is falsely imprisoned for several weeks, and is forced on the diet she can't discipline herself to do on her own. Upon her release, she's proud of her weight, and is determined to keep it off. Can she do it? Well, can she at least keep it off until the holiday season?If I were a real journalist, I'd dig more into the timeline of when this book was written, and when the movie was being made. As those who have seen the movie know, Colin Firth played Mark Darcy. Well, the actual Colin Firth is a character in this sequel, and Bridget's interview with him is as hilarious as you can imagine. Now, which came first, the making of the movie or the writing of the second book? Did one influence the other, or is it coincidence? Actually, I'm not staying awake nights not knowing this, but the question occasionally pops up in my mind.Anyway, good stuff."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Fielding was clearly under some deadline pressure with this one. It's still full of laughs and some parts are done very well, but there numerous inconsistencies and many hastily written parts. Some parts, expecially toward the end, were downright sappy or stupid. It's a shame because I felt so involved with the characters after the first book and the movie. It would have been nice if more thought was put into the writing. For instance, surely more explanation is needed for how Darcy could have NOT meant he was breaking up with her during their first visit to Rebecca's villa, and NOT sleeping with her, especially since he constantly hangs with Rebecca for the next 5 months. Since we're talking fantasy here, it also would have been better to see Bridget accomplish at least a couple things (overcome alcohol problem, quit smoking, get a job on her own, show up for work on time, at least manage to not miss a flight to interview Firth, etc.) As much as many of us identify with at least some part of her challenges, virtually everyone can point to something they accomplished or didn't completely mess up. As it is, she comes off as too pathetic. I hope they do a better job with the movie sequel."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"In short, this is the best sequel I've read. It's witty, honest, warm and romantic."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read this book from beginning to end on a 10 hour flight from England to Los Angeles. I laughed my socks off. I don't want to say that this book is just &quot;for the girls&quot;, but it does poke fun at some of our everyday crisis i.e. does my bum look too big in this?, why do I weigh more than I did yesterday and the all too emotional rollercoasters with our mothers. I love the relationship issues Bridget has with boyfriends, the paranoias that we all go through at the beginning of any new relationship. I would love my husband to read it. I must say that the ending was a little far fetched, but the build-up to it was pure brilliance. There is not much else to say except GO AND GET IT you will love it."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I really love this book, and if you liked Bridget Jones's Diary, you will love the edge of reason! Once again Helen Fielding takes the story to it's top, and the result is very funny! For exampel Bridget gets to do an interview with the star from her fave tv show, and it all turns out really wild (and v funny!) This book is a must, so be sure not to miss it!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This is a sequel to BRIDGET JONE'S DIARY but can also be read on its own. It is written entirely in diary form.Bridget is finally in a functioning relationship (at least for 4 weeks and 5 days) and is reveling in it.7:30am Mark Darcy has not woken up. I know,will get up and make him fantastic fried breakfast with sausages, scrambled eggs and mushrooms or maybe eggs Benedict or Florentine.7:31am Depending what eggs Benedict or Florentine actually are.7:32am Except do not have any mushrooms or sausages.7:33am Or eggs.7:34am Or-come to think of it, milk.Bridget is funny, irritating, ridiculous and endearing as she tries to find her way to true love. Her family and girlfriends, plus a builder who just manages to put a big hole in her wall and then leaves not to be heard from again, all add to the confusion. Throw in ultra thin Rebecca who has her eyes on Mark and you have a super read.After many twists and turns, the ending is pure magic."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I loved this sequal, and actually found it funnier than the first one. I hope that Helen Fielding writes more bridget jones soon! I read it in a day and a half and loved every second of it. Everyone should give bridget jones a try."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I didn't think Helen Fielding could top herself, but she did. Bridget is even funnier this time around! I laughed 'til tears ran down my face (yes, it's THAT funny). Who else but Bridget can get herself into the situations she does and pull it off with such finesse? I hope, beg and pray there is another Bridget book out there and that Helen Fielding is listening. I want my own Bridget...heck, can I just BE Bridget!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget Jones 2 is funny, cute and enjoyable, - but not as funny, cute and enjoyable as the first one. Bridget still has her panic attacks and still overanalyzes to comic efect.The things with the sequel is that for me it stretches a bit too much. The story is not that believable anymore.But it is still funny."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I loved this book so much. I read it while on vacation sitting by the pool. Finished it in one day. I laughed so hard that my husband told me that I needed to take the book and go somewhere where people did not think I was crazy. Cannot wait to see the movie. Fielding is definitely a brilliant author - full of imagination."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"When I read the first book, I felt like I was finally not alone! I could truely empathize with Bridget in her struggle with self-esteem, inner beauty, and the quest for a perfect relationship.She defines so many idiosyncrasies that all women can relate to - 'mentionitis' being my favorite!I wish I had thousands of books like this to grab when I need a laugh or cry to get myself through this crazy female world!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"As a thirtysomething singleton, Bridget has become a good friend! She is once again navagating life with her assortment of pals, both smug and otherwise. Despite the craziness of a few situations-Edge of Reason is for anyone who loved Bridget the first time around."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"After reading the first book I was left wanting more tales of Bridget Jones. The Edge of Reason was just what I needed. More uproarious situations that made me laugh out loud! I could not put this book down. Even the man sitting next to me on an air plane asked me about the book because he said &quot;I really seemed to enjoy it.&quot; If you like the Diary you will like The Edge of Reason, I surely did."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I rushed out to buy 'The Edge of Reason' when i heard of its release. Just as funny as the first, Bridget keeps you cringing and sympathizing at her hapless antics. Thoroughly enjoyed the book and look forward to seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding because it was chosen by our book club. I found her neurotic, insecure, unstable, but absolutely hilarious! Her bar scenes with the girls (Shazzar and Jude) really hit home with my girlfriends! I went to a book signing, and had a chance to meet Helen Fielding, who was &quot;truly fabulous!&quot; I started reading the sequel 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' and COULD NOT put the book down. Bridget definitely outdoes herself in this one, especially on their visit to Thailand -- unbelievable! This is such a joy to read and a v.g. book to just cuddle up under the covers with a glass of wine and enjoy! I do recommend that you read Bridget Jones's Diary first, before The Edge of Reason, so you can get the full effect of the characters especially Bridget's mother -- what a ditz!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding did a good job when she wrote &quot;the diary&quot; but she shouldn't have written The Edge of Reason. Chasing a man and being jealous of other women is a lame plot and the book adds nothing to the first one. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I notice all reviewers communicating in terse &quot;Bridget style&quot;. Very amusing.I loved this book. Laughed out loud several times, most disturbingly in middle of night when husband attempting to sleep.What a delightful, farcical story. Helen Fielding is so very talented; a really wonderful writer. Don't let the sheer enjoyment and accessibility of this and her other books fool you. I particularly loved, loved, loved the send up of all the self-help books. Really adorable.In HOW TO LIVE 'TIL 100, fairly sure &quot;lots of laughter&quot; is in the top 10. But not in the middle of the night.More, more, more Ms. Fielding. My health depends on it."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I enjoyed Bridget Jones Diary very much and couldn't wait for the sequel. I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. Bridget is such a flake and her adventures in life and love had me laughing out loud. I hope there is a follow-up where she and Mark Darcy get married and have kids. I'd LOVE to hear her reflections on childbirth!Especially enjoyed the Colin Firth interview. I'd recommend checking out Nick Hornby's High Fidelity and About a Boy. His protagonists are male variations of Bridget."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Once again, Helen Fielding has made me laugh out loud, nod my head appreciatively, and inspired me to read passages out loud to anyone who will listen. &quot;Edge of Reason&quot; is a worthy successor to Bridget Jones I: hilarious, insightful, entertaining. The plot does lose focus toward the end with the introduction of a melodramatic Thailand twist. This portion of the book is unbelievable and self-conscious - makes you aware that Bridget is merely a character, rather than the very real person she is elsewhere in the book. But this relatively minor flaw was far outweighed by the pure, unadulterated pleasure I took in reading the book. Is this novel the literary equivalent of a &quot;chick flick&quot;? I don't think so; I think there is more than enough substance and humor to the book that no matter what your gender or marital status, you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This was definitely better than the first! Sure, good ol' Bridget is still ranting on and on about Mr. Darcy calling, but that was half the fun for me. I enjoy the tallies she keeps before each entry (cigarettes, alcohol units, number of Mark Darcy fantasies . . .), and I'm glad Ms. Fielding kept that up, even if she did cut back a bit in this novel.I liked the 'hole in the wall' story line; it kept me rolling, as did her, uh, adventures in Thailand, and especially her mother.Now, why should you buy this book? Was it a great work of literature? Did it inspire me to great feats? Was it the best book I've ever read? Nope, to all of the above. But it was a heck of a lot better than a lot of things lately, and if you like Helen Fieldings unique &quot;Bridget-Prose&quot;, then you'll love the edge of reason."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I'll admit it, I did see the movie before having interest in either of the &quot;Bridget&quot; books. I loved the movie so much that I immediately went to the bookstore and bought the first novel, which I liked, but I still preferred the movie. The novel just wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as I expected after seeing the movie. I then went and bought &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot;- I couldn't help it, I had to know what happened to Bridget and Mark- and I fell in love with it. I have already reread my favorite parts several times, especially the kitchen scene (those who have read it know what I'm talking about). Here was a novel that was up to par with the movie. I first read it on an airplane on my way home from vacation, and I got several stares from those sitting near me because I would spontaneously start laughing aloud. For those who loved the first novel, don't miss the second; for those who loved the movie, don't miss the continuation!! You will laugh as much as you did in the theater."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"No. of days spent reading this book: 1 (couldn't put it down); no. of times died of embarrassment for Bridget: 2435; no. of times I wished I was Bridget or one of her friends: 12,394; no. of time I was glad I'm not Bridget or one of her friends: 25,684.I loved this book and it's predecessor. I can't wait to see the movie - I'm thinking Cherie Oteri should be Bridget, with Molly Shannon and Ana Gastayer as Shaz and Jude, and Kelly Preston as Rebecca.Fielding is masterful. I could smell the funk in Shaz's apartment when all three girls lived there, I fell in love with Mark Darcy and Bridget's dad but most of all I love Bridget. What a great book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I devoured this book in one day! Could not put it down. I cried with laughter. Bridget is a very lovable character and her experiences speak to women everywhere. I have lent my book to all my girlfriends and they loved it as well. This book is a great mood uplifter."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I've read a few other reviews of this book, and I'm beginning to realize that people don't &quot;get&quot; the character of Bridget Jones. This sequel picks up almost immediately where the original left off, and yet some readers want Bridget to have grown up, got a better job, become secure in her relationships, chosen better friends, curb her obsessive qualities, and be blissfully happy. Sorry, but the reason Bridgit is so funny, and so many of us love her, is because we ARE her, in varying degrees. I love the fact that she is wrestling with insecurities about her looks, a nasty boss, a mother who is totally nuts, and a boyfriend who may want someone else. Sounds like my life. Some of the situations she gets herself into in this book seem far-fetched, but they are hysterical nonetheless. This book is full of laughs - just don't expect that Bridget has suddenly become a grown-up. Jeez, how boring!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget Jones is growing up right before our very eyes! So, to my review predecessors...of course she's maybe not as intriguing in the same ways as she was before. But in many other ways, it's much better! As readers, we know her better by now and sometimes may feel that we can predict her actions. This is, of course, not the case. Bridget goes down all sorts of unexpected paths...and does things we may never have dreamed possible. All the while, re-shaping her personality as we watch closely. She's even more fascinating and unbelievable than before. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I, like millons of other single women, found myself saying &quot;Bridget is me,&quot; and because of that I bought the UK version and had it shipped to me in Boston ... I doubt that anyone is surprised to hear that it isn't as good as the first one. However it is good. Had Ms. Fielden's first book never been published, we would all be talking about how good this one is! My advice, buy it, fall in love with Bridget, Mark Darcy, Shazzar, Jude and Tom all over again; but don't judge it against the first book, rather, enjoy it for what it is - A good read!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"THE EDGE OF REASON and Frank McCourt's 'TIS are classic examples of what gets lost when the authors are rushed into supplying sequels. Both of these books had enormous potential, and both fell extremely short of their mark. This Bridget is a whiner and her airhead friends are hard to tell apart. The mother/daughter relationship which was so lovingly and comically described in THE DIARY becomes flat and stale here. Although the comedy sometimes hearkens back to the high-giggle level of THE DIARY (witness the screamingly funny interview with Colin Firth and Bridget's plane ride to Thailand), much of the comedy also falters. The plot needs to be shaped into more of an arc. I agree with other reviewers who say that this book needs to be edited--and I don't mean just correcting the spelling of the First Lady's name."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I love Bridget Jones, but I'm a little afraid of her. If she epitomizes the fin-de-millenium feminine mind, we girls are in big trouble. Oh, sure, her obsessions with her appearance, her clothes, and her love life are funny. But are we really supposed to admire (and root for) a woman with no interests, ambitions, opinions, or even thoughts beyond what pop culture (TV, self-help books, etc.) provides for her? I found myself liking Mark Darcy more and more, and in the end (scary thought), I thought maybe he was a little too good for Bridget.The book has some very funny situations, and Bridget's voice is still appealing. But the plot's pretty thin in spots; characters appear and disappear without developing into anything. All in all, the book shows signs of having been written in a hurry and without a very exacting editor. Blurry goo' fun, if you keep the emphasis on &quot;blurry&quot; and don't think too hard--or at all--about just how much like Brudget you are. After all, if Bridget achieves her ultimate ambition, won't she be a rich housewife who dabbles in freelance celebrity journalism? Hmmmm .... not v.g., if you ask me."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The irrepressible Bridget Jones continues her diary for another year with this sequel to &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;, and the hilarity of her adventures is undiminished. Written in the highly comic trademark Bridget style, the new diary recounts Bridget's adventures in her relationship with Mark Darcy, her attempts to have her flat renovated, and her observations of her mother's shenanigans. Although &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; is necessarily less original than, well, the original (and is clearly not going to spawn an entire subgenre of popular literature the way &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; did) it's still an excellent read; Fielding is a better inventor of plot, and surely a better stylist, than most of her imitators."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The continuing saga of the pitfalls of being Bridget Jones. Just as engaging and funny as the first, the diary format has not yet grown irritating. And what woman can't see a little of herself in Bridget or one of her friends? A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"On a recent shopping spree through bargain tables I happened to see Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason laying there, calling my name. I absolutely loved the movie and it is one of the few \\"chick flicks\\" that not only does my boyfriend stomach but actually enjoys. Thus, I had to buy it. Once in my hands, I could not stop reading and devoured it in two days.The second installment of Bridget Jones begins where the first one stops. Bridget has been with Mark Darcy for four weeks. So what if her job ..., she has a boyfriend. Everything seems wonderful until Mark gets a case of \\"mentionitis.\\" This disease, made up by Bridget's singleton friends (yes, they are back), refers to the condition in which a person keeps mentioning another person's name. It appears to be casual, when in fact it is not. As Bridget loses confidence in herself and her relationship hilarity ensues. Bridget finds herself in awkward situation taken wrong after awkward situation taken wrong and, like usual, Bridget ruins things for herself. She's unlucky in love, lucky at work. Although Bridget thinks that she messes up everything at work, especially her interview with Colin Firth, things always seem to work out in the end. Bridget's life is turned upside down again and again, but she always seems to bounce back.The highlights of the novel have to be Bridget's time in Thailand (I had to chuckle on and on when I read the very last page), and, of course, her mother. I don't think that anyone else can make singing Madonna songs to a tampon while half naked could pull it off quite like Bridget does. When her mother returned from Africa I was laughing hysterically at both the description of her and the \\"present\\" she brought back for Bridget's dad. Edge of Reason brings a new viewpoint of Bridget's mom. While she is always wacky and weird, there is one moment where something she says actually makes incredible sense. I was touched and moved by Bridget's mom's telling of the significance of The Velveteen Rabbit. It seems that Bridget's mother really does understand her.Helen Fielding has brought us a character so real, so vivid, so like ourselves that readers can completely relate to Bridget. This is the secret to Fielding success with Bridget. Bridget makes us feel less like failures, less like incompetents, and less alone because there is someone out there just like us. Edge of Reason is hysterical; I could hardly make it through two pages without having to laugh out loud. The first installment was great, but this one is even better. Get all of your girlfriends to read this book, laugh together, and find out if you are truly a Singleton or a Smug Married."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"hurrah! bridget has returned! this book was thoroughly funny! though i have to dock it one star because towards the end, it seemed quite predictable &amp; a little cliche (her predicament seemed quite familiar, nothing new...) but Bridget is still hysterical! definitely read the first bridget jones' novel before you read this one."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Definitely not as good as Bridget Jones' Diary...but Bridget fans will enjoy her further adventures. Don't get me wrong, it is a good read and quite funny, just somewhat disappointing."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget's back, and this time instead of getting a man, she's focused on keeping the one she's got. Her complete inability to escape bumbling, awkward social situations (arrested for drug possession in Thailand, blowing an interview with Colin Firth) truly makes one feel better about one's own social graces (or near complete lack thereof). Though not quite as laugh-out-loud as the first, the book is still quite funny and we're kept rooting for Bridget until the end when true love reigns, and makes you hope that there's someone out there for you who'll appreciate all your inadequecies as much as Mr. Darcy does Bridget's. And if he happens to be handsome and rich as well so much the better! ;-)"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The sequal to Bridget Jones' Diary is absolutyly hylarious.Helen Fieding is a wonderful author who really know's how to bring real life into her books. Briget Jones is a modern girl with whom eveyone can relate to. This book keeps you coming back for more, wondering what Bridget is going to do next, and what is going to happen in her life. This is a must read!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Same quirky, self deprecating humor that made the first a must read. The only criticism I have is that the end of this one seems far fetched."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Was v.worried that I wouldn't enjoy this sequel as much as the divine 'Diary' but am happy to say that I loved it just as much as the (very original) original, and I can't wait to see the film. Hated dreadful Rebecca and loved Bridget to bits. D'arcy and Bridget's mom as adorable as ever. but when is the next Bridget book coming out? When when when WHEN????? Ple-e-e-e-ease hurry up Ms Fielding. Until then I recommend to other impatient BJ fans 'RAPLH'S PARTY' by Lisa Jewell (excellent), RACHEL'S HOLIDAY by Marian Keyes (ditto) and 'THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT' by Isabel Wolfe - another hysterical read about being a singleton."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I had an extremely difficult time getting through the first half of this book. I wanted to scream - Bridget, stop listening to your stupid friends! Mark Darcy is the man of your dreams! But I guess that is the whole point of the book as you will see in the end. The ending was fantastic - even though I nearly bailed out half way through - I'm so glad I perservered. I can't wait for the movie!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I was one of those who saw and loved the movie Bridget Jones's Diary and have watched it at least ten times but unfortunately never read the novel.After reading The Edge of Reason I got a real glimpse at all the characters lives, especially Magda and Jeremy as well as \\"vile\\" Richard which were barely touched upon in the movie and found this novel to a really good read as it filled in a lot of pieces I missed from the movie. The adventures of Bridget, her friends and family are quite amusing and a lot of fun. I will admit the one problem I experienced throughout the novel was trying to figure out some of the \\"English\\" jargon but other than that I really liked this novel and have already read it twice."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"To truely appreciate this book is to laugh out loud at the use of the video &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; as a device to cheer the characters in this book up. As an owner of this video and admirer of &quot;Mr Darcy&quot; and the famous pond scene, I laughed out loud! It was very hard to explain to my finance who did not like the movie as much as I did! Loved the book, even better than the first one."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I really loved the first BJD but this sequel is a BIG disappointment. Very contrived and ho-hummish, the characters totally overdone. Also Bridget gets to be a bit of a whining bore, and so desperate that I found myself not really caring about what happens to her. The book feels like it was all done in a rush. I've just discovered Tiffany Trott which I thought was much, much funnier, and with a kind of whacky innocence and charm. Also Tiffany is really independent, unlike Bridget. But I hope the next Bridget will be better than this one as I used to be a big fan."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I can't believe it, but this was actually a sequel that outdid the first book. I thoroughly enjoyed Bridgett Jones Diary, The Edge of Reason. I think every woman, no matter what part of the world you are from, can relate to this woman and her determination of being a &quot;better woman&quot;. As a fellow &quot;Singleton&quot; I absolutely could relate to Bridgett. Hurrah for Helen Fielding and Bridgett Jones."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I have only finished 1/3 of this book and I love it even more than her first book. This one is even better. I haven't been this entertained by a book in a very long time. I love the struggles between the married and not married friends and Bridget's constant battle with not letting anyone down now that she is finally involved. It hits so close to home. I have a library copy now but I am going to buy my own this week."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Although the reviews for &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; have been general more positive than the original &quot;Diary&quot;, I have to say that this one didn't really measure up as much as I hoped. For some reason the manic, hilarious nature of Bridget's life that was presented so cleverly and with such a tongue-in-cheek self-reflective way kinda gets lost in this book, and it just doens't ring as true.Still, the style and the humor are still there, and both &quot;Bridget&quot; books retain their place in my library as top-notch books to read while commuting (if you don't mind being embarressed by laughing out loud on a packed subway car)."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is another gem of a book from Helen Fielding. Fans of the orginal will not be disappointed. In fact, as much as I enjoyed the original, I think I liked The Edge of Reason better. I found the character of Bridget a little more developed and her insights rang more true. And, of course, her wit and insecurities kept me interested and laughing. (Bridget Jones' fresh perspective reminded me of the female characters in Fried Calamari, and The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing -- two other books I would recommend.) All in all Bridget Jones is one of the best characters in literature today. I highly recommend this book to both readers of the original and those discovering Bridget Jones for the first time."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The sequel to &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; is as funny as the original. In the last book, Bridget escaped &quot;singleton&quot; status by finding true love with Mark Darcy. In this book, she manages to ruin a good thing by just being Bridget. Her obsession with every aspect of the relationship and over-analysis of every word uttered by Mark Darcy soon throws the entire affair into chaos. Still, Bridget stumbles along- obsessing over her weight, her friendships and her neglected career. I haven't laughed this hard since the first book. Don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that Bridget has two unforgettable encounters in this story: one with hunky British actor Colin Firth, and one with a foreign prison. If you liked the first one, the sequel will not disappoint! I laughed myself silly. To Helen Fielding: keep the Bridget adventures coming!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The adventures of Ms Jones continue much as they did in the first book, with her usual trials and tribulations and quests for eternal love. I consider myself a modern woman, and I laugh at Bridget, but the things Helen Fielding writes are very easy to identify with. Do yourself a favour and read both of her books. Everyone needs a little laughter in their lives."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I read Bridget Jones' Diary quite a while back and had been hoarding this book for ages, looking for just the right amount of uninterrupted reading space. Sad to say, it wasn't quite the 'unputdownable' book I'd expected it to be. It started off on the right note, but soon began dragging unbearably. The gaffes began to seem awfully repetitive -- one just had to imagine the worst-case scenario and our heroine was right there. Also, the book could have done with some heavy editing, maybe in the middle months? It's reading value would have gone up considerably had it been around 30 pages shorter. They do say sequels rarely live up to their predecessors. Sad to say, this one only reinforces that feeling."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"While I was reading this book I either a) had this goofy smile on my face or b) was laughing out loud. This was the funniest book I have ever read! I read the first book and to be honest thought it was just alright, but I loved the first movie. Saw the second movie and thought it was alright, but loved the second book. I think if the movie had left out all that Daniel drama and the girl from Darcy's law office and put in more of the Rebecca drama, crazy parents and friends stories,and more of Darcy, the movie would have been as good as the book. I guess the movie wanted to bring in more of Hugh Grant's character.Best parts of Bridget's Jones Edge of Reason:1) Interview with Colin Firth aka the wet shirt interview2) Dry cleaner's Valentine's3) Christmas cards4) Singleton program for the Labour party5) Cell phone in dumpster6) Walk down aisle with braBridget is a lovable, sweet ding-bat. Even during normal situations she can somehow find a way to make it embarassing and funny. Oddly enough I think a lot her thoughts and feelings are still understandable and relatable to an average person. Yeah some of the crazy escapades she gets herself into are far-fetched but it's way I loved this book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"out of all the girlie novels i read, i relate and feel closest to bridget. i actually liked this one a tad more than the first ms.jones novel. helen fielding..your amazing!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This is one of those rare books that required me to stop reading because tears of laughter were making it impossible to continue. Yes, it's silly and implausible but that's also what makes it so charming and hilarious. The section concerning Bridget's discovery of the &quot;Asian boy&quot; in Darcy's bed had me howling, and her mother is truly hysterical. Overall I enjoyed this one even more than the first. It should also make for a great sequel in the movie department."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Incredible! Hilarious! Spectacular! I read this before I read the original and saw the movie, and I adored it. Especially the Mr. Darcys. :-D Definately a must read!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"That is why Helen Fielding's 'Bridget' is so accessible. Because she is our most neurotic selves. Helen Fielding has improved upon the Bridget in the initial installment and made her more realistic. How can you not chuckle at her thoughts surrounding Mark Darcy? (Sidebar: having seen the movie starring Rene Zellweger, the character is more alive). Have we not all been in love but not been sure how the other person really feels and so we go around attributing the wrong motives behind our loved ones actions? Helen/Bridget had me wanting more. Hopefully, she will you, too."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I've just finished reading this book, and I already miss Bridget and the rest of her crazy friends. This book was a wonderful continuation of Bridget Jones's Diary. It's great 'cause you already know the characters and how they are, so it's like you become a part of their crazy lives and all the crazy things they do. Helen Fielding does a great job with the humor in this book. It's clever and witty, and very enjoyable. I'm hoping she may come out with more Bridget Jones books. But even if she doesn't, I'm sure any other novel she writes will be just as good!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as well as Bridget Jones's Diary. All women can relate to the things that Bridget records in her diary about weight, men, finances, emotions, etc... Ms. Fielding draws you into Bridget's life so that you actually begin to care about her character and feel joys and the disappointments that Bridget feels. I found the book charming, heartwarming and delightful."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Great to catch up with Bridget, Daniel, Shazzer, Mark Darcy and ... Colin Firth! (Which, in and of itself, is hilarious after seeing the film &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; where Colin Firth plays Mark Darcy!!) I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"In some ways I liked this book better than the first one. Trying to imagine her singing Madonna songs had me rolling and I loved the last few pages with her signing her Christmas cards. V.G."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Like Lisa, I saw the movie before I read the books and immediately wanted to buy the book (mostly to see how the ending differed from the book). I too ended up buying the sequel instead, but quickly went out to buy the original when I found the mistake. I read them both in sequence and loved the second one as an extension of the first. I was delighted to find shades of &quot;Persuasion&quot; in the sequel, which are more blatant than the shades of &quot;PRide and Prejudice&quot; in the first. How can I not love Helen Fielding when she seems to love Jane Austen as much as I do? Both books are quick reading. You will hardly realize time passing. Bridget and Mark Darcy are likely to enter my list of favorite literary characters."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"If you only have a few minutes at a time for reading, as on the subway or bus, this is a great book (along with the original Bridget Jones Diary.)I enjoyed the first book more as I felt I could relate more with the occurrences in Bridget's life. In this sequel, her life takes some unexpected and less reality based turns, which I found it difficult to relate to.My one caution to this book is that, much like with the writings of Dr. Seuss, I found myself starting to think in the stilted thought bursts that Ms. Fielding writes in.Overall, enjoyable, but not as groundbreaking or &quot;real&quot; as the original."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This is the sequel to The Bridget Jones Diary and I must say, better than its parent. It was funnier and more in depth than the original.We catch up with Bridget a year later, actually we pick up right at the end of the first book and go into another fun filled year with Ms Jones and her wacky friends.Still struggling with her fluctuating weight, smoking and too much wine, Bridget shows us that nothing is perfect and nothing ends perfect.Problems with her boyfriend drive her to do some funny and off the wall things in this installment. Her boss is driving her crazy and her mother can't stop reinventing herself. Her friends are asking for her advice and help and all Bridget can do is wince.Throw in a disasterous vacation in Thailand and perhaps prison and maybe an exchange student and wella, you've got a mix of very funny scenes. Bridget soon realizes that maybe she should just stop trying to fix her life and just be happy?Well worth the time and money!Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"For those of you who cannot get enough of Mr. Darcy in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or Mark Darcy in Fielding's first book, you're going to love The Edge of Reason. In her second book, there is more of the Darcy character. The book is even more hilarious than before. I honestly liked the second one more than the first...possibly because there is so much of Darcy in it... This book is laught out loud hilarious, and you will not regret picking it up. However, I must warn Austen fans that the second book is very much similar to the plots in Pride and Prejudice. Happy Reading!!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This is possibly the only book of which has a sequel I have enjoyed! Much funnier than the first [though almost crossing the line into absolutely ridiculous with the Thailand adventure!], and so much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The Edge of the reason is as good as the 1st diary. We can find the same kind of humor again...But it is not boring, or repetitive. Bridget now is trying to make her relationship work with M. Darcy, with the help of self- books ... and her trip to Thailand is again a new adventureI would suggest to read the first one first ... because lots of elements will be easier to understand"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"While this book was an excellent read in itself, I believe it failed to reach the bar already set by the first one."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I've figured out why I didn't like The Edge of Reason as much as I did the first book. Bridget's a lot stupider in number two. In the first book, for whatever her insecurities, Bridget is witty, sharp, and self-aware - whereas, in this book, she seems to mindlessly go from one adventure to another, her motivations trivial. Book II's scenes also move away from the charming friends' pub nights, parents' houses, and Turkey Curry Buffet parties, into Bridget's surrealistic vacations in Thailand. She was likeable in book one because her world was real; now she seems like a figurine.That being said, The Edge of Reason has its moments - though something was definently lost."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I enjoyed this book while on vacation in NH. A very light read, but frantically funny in its ability to relate what a single woman goes through when she's got the self esteem of a pea. I like the poke it takes at self help books (does anyone else loathe Dr. Phil??) and the surprising drama that Bridget faces during the final third of this enchanting novel. If you're into this type of fiction, I highly recommend this read."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I could not put it down, I had to just read it through and see if she and Mark get back together. Really hysterical! Loved the parts with the eye shadow used for blush and the Colin Firth interview! I miss Shazzer and Jude and Tom already and especially loving to hate Rebecca! I agree, usually sequels are not as good, but this was actually better and very satisfying. Although, the one thing that keeps bothering me is what was the real story with the nude Asian boy in Mark's bed???"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"What else can I say? Read it! And quickly. It's even better (that is - funnier) than the first Bridget Jones novel. So much so that you may not be able to read it in public.This book is so good that I bought a copy for my cousin just so I wouldn't have to lend her mine!Now go get one of your own.... and thank me later.K."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I have now listened to this particular audio version (by Barbara Rosenblat, Recorded Books) three times in a row, which tells me that a) the book is very very funny (and I enjoyed it!); b) this particular adaptation is very good.Unfortunately, this particular edition is not available via Amazon.com but there is an abridged version available. Check your public library for the Rosenblat version if you want the full fix.I have both books in the Bridget Jones saga. While I read and enjoyed them both, the audio version brings out the full zaniness of this creation. It is hard to refrain from giggling (at work) while listening to particular episodes. Even Bridget's time in a Thai jail becomes hilarious when she is pondering on how to produce a baby with a boring young diplomat rather than have her child-bearing years wasted. The Colin Firth interview is a notable highlight, but so are the descriptions of Bridget's brushes with the British police and the description of Jude's wedding (starting from her dress disaster to the telegraph from Tom). Even that no-good handyman becomes a living breathing person.I believe that it helps to have read BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, but in some respects, this book can stand alone. For me, it brilliantly answers the question - What happens after \\"Happily Ever After?\\"Rating = 4.9Recommended = Very Highly, for Rosenblat's rendition of several characters."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Am writing review of marvelous book that just recently finished reading. Found surprising similarities between self and main character. Wondering if that is really a good thing. Main character very strong, but also had weaknesses. Does that makes sense? Anyway, will not obsess over weather or not am making sense. Ending was very good, and suspect that there will be a sequel for does not feel like a real ending. Like there's something more. Hmmm."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"As an enthusiastic fan of &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary, I waited with bated breath for this sequel. I wasn't disappointed, even though I have to rate &quot;the Edge of Reason&quot; slightly below &quot;Diary&quot;. (I can't think of ANY sequel that has eclipsed or even equalled the original.) As it happened, I'd just finished a re-visiting of Jane Austen's &quot;Persuasion&quot; when I got hold of this book, and I must say that that added to my amusement and enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The recording of Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason was fantastic. I laughed so hard I was practically crying. My life demands that I spend lots of time in my car. The book on tape was a terrific way to enjoy commuting. My favorite character is Bridget's boss. The audio does a terrific portrayal of the characters. I thoroughly recommend this sequel to anyone who can really laugh at themselves!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"The only bad part was when I finished. Was so sad was ready to start again from beginning! Can't wait for another sequel?"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book made me laugh out loud. It was so wonderfully written and true to almost everyone. The way Bridget saw the world is just hysterical. No matter what awful disaster happened, she found a way for it to be funny, whether it be a gigantic hole in her wall, 2 weeks in a Thai jail, or having someone after her. I just thought the entire book was totally funny, and better than the first one. I wonder if there will be a third diary? There is a little of Bridget in every one of us which is why I think so many people can relate to this. Anyway, definitely two thumbs up and an eager wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I thought that Helen Fielding's first book, &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; was great, but I was mistaken: this book far outshines it. I was so happy to see that Bridget finally found her man and although I try to maintain my status as a modern woman, I couldn't help but root for Bridge and Mark. I wanted to love to conquer all.It was especially great to see the characters' further development, particularly witchy Rebecca. I read this book in four hours because I couldn't put it down, every page held a new crazy situation that Bridge had gotten herself into. My husband, and fellow passengers on the subway, were especially perturbed each time I laughed out loud.I can't wait for Helen Fielding's next book."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"I was lucky enough to have picked up and read this book when I was in London in January before it came out in the U.S. I was v. glad I did because the reviews here in the media haven't been all that favorable. *Ignore them.* The book is a hoot, you will embarrass yourself by laughing out loud, and it's a quick read. Yeah, it drags in parts and the Thailand thing is a bit of an eye-roller, but it's what you expect- hey, the ending of the original was a bit &quot;out there.&quot; If you liked the original this is a *must*read*."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is another gem of a book from Helen Fielding. Fans of the orginal will not be disappointed. In fact, as much as I enjoyed the original, I think I liked The Edge of Reason better. I found the character of Bridget a little more developed and her insights rang more true. And, of course, her wit and insecurities kept me interested and laughing. (Bridget Jones' fresh perspective reminded me of the female characters in Fried Calamari, and The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing -- two other books I would recommend.) All in all Bridget Jones is one of the best characters in literature today. I highly recommend this book to both readers of the original and those discovering Bridget Jones for the first time."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"Helen Fielding actually bested her original. Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is immensely funny and digs deeper into the psychosis-hell that is Bridget. You'll laugh, you'll laugh, and you'll just laugh some more -- and come on, how often have you laughed outloud reading a book? It's like a witty and original Ally McBeal gone British, definitely a must-have for anyone and everyone and all of the billions worldwide who loved Bridget two years ago, will love her and her even more insane (and oddly realistic and connectable) friends two years later."},{"Title":"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason","review":"This book was really good and I highly recommend it to any Bridget fan. To me, the original will always be the gold standard but I found the unravelling of the story (as well as Bridget) to be fairly fulfilling. I ordered the book from Amazon.uk in December because I couldn't wait and have read it a half a dozen times! Look forward eagerly to the next volume in the Bridget saga."},{"Title":"The Substance of God: A Spiritual Thriller","review":"The reason I choose to read this author is usually because I'm seeking something other than that which fits neatly into any particular niche. Science fiction has its superstar writers and GLBT literature, erotic or otherwise, has it own community of talent. It's refreshing to have access to fiction that combines seemingly disparate elements such as The Substance of God does. True it requires at least as much suspension of disbelief as some high fantasy or soft sci-fi, but it's worth the price of admission. Brass puts forth some interesting theories on the existence, or at least the interpretation of the concept of godhead. The plot is a fast-paced adventure with a number of unexpected twists and turns even when the requisite sex scenes occur. All of this and a generous share of international intrigue included as well. The protagonist struggles with his own internal conflicts especially with regard to the nature of death and to the definition of spirituality, themes which are not exactly abundant in gay or lesbian erotica. Although I would have preferred a more explicit conclusion, the aforementioned issues resonated enough to hold my interest throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Substance of God: A Spiritual Thriller","review":"In its combining the themes of gay sex and religious concerns, Perry Brass's spiritual thriller is much less a \\"stretch\\" now than it was when it was just a few years ago when it was first published. It contributes to a growing movement of looking at religious topics through a queer lens, extending into popular, genre literature the work of those who study and write about scriptures from a queer perspective.The Substance of God is about sex, spirit, religion, marriage, life, death, and, oh yes, science, all in nearly equal portions. That is an enormous thematic undertaking, but, for me, Brass pulls it off with room to spare. Each of these themes could easily sustain extensive examination, but for the artistic tension of Brass's novel, the important thing is how they play against and into each other to populate and set into action the fictive world he creates.The sex is graphic and gay, mostly. And that plays out in different ways for the main characters, examples being the scientist, Dr. Leonard Miller, the main character who uses kinky sex as an escape from the lab and a religious man, Ted Richards, a pivotal character introduced half-way into the novel, who resists being attracted to gay sex but who seems to be drawn to it all the more powerfully because of that resistance.The spiritual realm is present throughout in terms of the plot driver, the mysterious substance, which gives the novel its name. There is also Biblical interest, both historical and in the life experience (both positive and negative) of the characters. But it is \\"the substance\\" that brings together the sexual and spiritual interest in the novel.And because of a major theme in my own writing and interest, I paid close attention to role of an apparent heterosexual marriage between a straight woman and a man, Ted, who wants to be straight but whose actions indicate that he is fighting a losing battle. Strongly to the credit of Perry Brass, like every other feature of the novel, this relationship and struggle is essential to the development of the plot.Some books are simply fun to read at the time and others play in my mind after I've finished the reading. For me, Perry Brass's The Substance of God is both. It is billed as a spiritual thriller. As with any good thriller, the pages seemed to turn themselves, and when I was ready to put the book down, I just had read a few more pages. But for me a lot more was going on than interest in what was going to happen next. The Substance of God is certainly successful as a thriller, but just as certainly, it is a whole lot more. Its important themes (and combination of themes) linger in my mind long after the thriller part drew me eagerly to the end of the novel."},{"Title":"The Substance of God: A Spiritual Thriller","review":"\\" I loved the book, the author's storytelling is off the hook and out of this world. I have alot of respect for Mr. Bass he kept me in suspense even until the last page. I like when the book leaves you in awe and wonder and this one took me there and back, I feel diffrent about God. I feel closer knowing that as long as I breathe, he loves me."},{"Title":"Backpacking","review":"This book is part of the \\"Wm. C. Brown Physical Education Activities and Dance Series\\". It was written when Backpacking required a little more skill for the basics. Even today we need to get diversions periodically it would be useful to pick up the skills needed when all the electronics give out. It sometimes can be fun not to use electronics as that is what we are deviating from.All the fundamentals are explained form equipment to training. There are 107 pages, a preface, 6 chapters, 7 appendixes, and an index. There are questions to be sure that you covered the material.Chapter four is in navigation. It falls a little short of orienteering. There is no mention of azimuth or reverse azimuth.The equipment is a tad dated but the principle is sound.This is a good beginner book and a plus to your library."},{"Title":"Who's on First, Charlie Brown?","review":"When Ballantine announced that they were going to release a brand-new collection of Peanuts baseball comics, my heart skipped a beat. I thought, &quot;finally&quot; and then waited to get my hands on a new copy.Alas, the day came and I bought it. It filled the gaps in my Peanuts collection and it's truly great...but it would have been a FANTASTIC book had they included every single baseball strip. Most Peanuts fans probably won't notice but there are some strips that are missing from this mix.But, let me stress the great points before I start by sounding like a pessimist.First, and foremost, nearly every baseball strip is here for your comic-reading pleasure. They bring back many memories and Ballantine has packaged it nicely in a 272-page masterpiece (about as thick as a copy of Vogue magazine) that spans the last 50 or so years of Charlie Brown and his team's exploits on the baseball diamond.It begins with a nicely-written foreword by Cal Ripken, Jr. who recounts that he started reading &quot;Peanuts&quot; when he copied his Dad's morning paper-reading habits at the breakfast table and took joy in the fact that Schulz would often do a baseball strip.After this, you get to read strips ranging from 1951 to 1999. It's fun to see Schulz grow in his artistry and his humor and there are many references and parallels to our baseball timeline and current events in general. This includes a classic series of strips which chronicles Snoopy's race against Hank Aaron for Babe Ruth's homerun record. If you remember correctly, Aaron was deluged with hate-mail and death-threats during that time (Barry Bonds sadly got the same treatment when he was going after McGuire's single-season record) and Schulz cleverly parallels that fact when Snoopy is sent hate-mail during his quest for the record. Also here is the drafting of Rerun who ends up giving the team their first win EVER when, due to his size, the opposing team fails to strike him out with the bases loaded...their joy is short-lived but I won't say why. It still ends up making you laugh.Now comes the bad news.As I said before, it is NOT all here. Ballantine keeps their reputation intact by stating that this is a &quot;brand-new collection&quot; and not a &quot;complete compilation&quot;. Fine, but to give us half a series of strips is unacceptable. Snoopy's homerun race is incomplete as is the first win by Charlie Brown's team via Rerun's walk at the plate. Several other strips go unaccounted for as well.Of course, I am a hardcore Peanuts fan and a bit of a comic collector. I own the original baseball strip book entitled, &quot;Sandlot Peanuts&quot; which sports a worn dust jacket over a hard cover. I read it almost every baseball season. I also have a beat-up old Peanuts 25th anniversary book with Snoopy's entire race in it. Both books belong to my Mom but &quot;Sandlot Peanuts&quot; is the one book that seems like it has gotten the most attention.To not include all the strips in the new book is baseball blasphemy. I know that when Schulz died, we saw tons of new books with archived strips in them. I wonder what kind of printing rights were given upon his death. Most of what Ballantine has released seems like a bunch of quickees marketed as &quot;collector's items&quot;. When I saw the thickness of this collection, my thoughts about Ballantine vanished a bit...but then reappeared once I finished the book.All in all, this is a nice book and a much-welcomed edition to any baseball-collector's bookshelf or any Peanuts collector's shrine, I just hope that Ballantine gets the rights to print every baseball strip someday.As Rerun says to his sister in the book, &quot;I'll drink to that!&quot;--Matt"},{"Title":"Who's on First, Charlie Brown?","review":"This is wonderful book that shows every Baseball related Peanuts strips spanning from 1951 to 1999! There also is a fun-foreward by Cal Ripken Jr. It also shows the amazing evolution of Sparky's drawing style and charactor development through the decades. It is such a fun read!!"},{"Title":"Who's on First, Charlie Brown?","review":"This is one of the most exciting bookstore finds I've made in a long time. It includes, I think, every single baseball-themed strip ever created by Charles M. Schulz.Charlie Brown and Baseball are a classic combination, and when The Library of America recently published their excellent collection of American baseball writing, I thought that Schulz would have been right at home among America's classic baseball writers. Who can think about baseball without imagining the visual gags of Lucy getting bonked in the head with fly balls, or Charlie Brown literally getting his socks knocked off by line drives up the middle? Such images are as much a part of the collective consciousness as &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; and &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game.&quot; But there are not just single-strip gags, there are also ongoing stip-by-strip stories. The one about Charlie Brown's hapless team nearly winning a game, only to have Chuck load the bases in the ninth inning, then balk in the tying AND winning runs is not only funny, but as poignant as any baseball story I've read. Every fan knows such heartbreak. It might as well be the &quot;fan interference&quot; at Wrigley Field, or a routine grounder to a RedSox first baseman. The volume includes, too, the great and forgotten stories of Charlie Brown's baseball-inspired nervous breakdown, and his quest for a card representing his hero, Joe Schlobotnik. These strips find Schulz at his best, capturing his own love for the game and mixing great humor with the gentle sadness that pervades his work."},{"Title":"Badges of the British Army: 1820 To the Present : An Illustrated Reference Guide for Collectors (Illustrated reference guides for collectors)","review":"This book has excellent pictures and a very helpful index, cross referenced where appropriate.

But, that's not all.In the caption for each photo, the authors carefully note what satellite, explorer craft, or telescope took the picture, what wavelength it was used, how it was filtered, etc. and otherwise brought to \\"normal\\" visible light, etc.And, that's not all. There's more for backyard astronomers with telescopes.In all pictures of nebulae, M or NGC numbers are provided for nebulae so identified."},{"Title":"What's Out There: Images from Here to the Edge of the Universe","review":"I have had this wonderful book for awhile and have returned to it recently, appreciating its excellence anew. These images of outer space are jaw-droppingly beautiful and awe-inspiring; the subject could be overwhelming to the uninitiated, but the organization of the text makes it accessible and puts it all into perspective. It is clearly and handsomely designed, and the material is presented with the most authoritative credentials.This oversize book is great to share with children and adults alike; it draws us out of our mundane daily existence, takes us on a whirl into our almost unimaginable (but real!) universe and poses the big questions of life and the nature of matter, how astonishing it all is \\"out there.\\" I highly recommend it, and it is a great \\"big bang\\" for the buck."},{"Title":"What's Out There: Images from Here to the Edge of the Universe","review":"visually stunning and excellent coffee table book. if you are looking for a picture book of the universe for casual purusal this book will more than do. provides very brief, non-technical descriptions of what each photograph is of. not for heavy duty research. recreational reading only. once again, the photos are...wow!"},{"Title":"What's Out There: Images from Here to the Edge of the Universe","review":"A word of advice: The casual reader might easily be seduced by the imagery in this book, but to parenthetically skim the wonderfully written text is to miss the real beauty in What's Out There. The content is right on. It's not over your galactic halo, or below your Kuiper Belt. And the richness of images (using everything from handheld cameras to Hubble) is almost impossible to describe. You'll just have to see for yourself.Words and pictures are the basic ingredients of publishing magic, and if handled cleverly, they can produce a feast for the senses. Such is the case with this marvelous look at (and into) the universe as we know it.

I recommend it for everyone from 4th grade (my grandson was blown away by the photos) to astroscientist (some of whom contributed).Curt Thorpe"},{"Title":"What's Out There: Images from Here to the Edge of the Universe","review":"This is the most spectacular photographic and textual exploration of space and the universe I have ever seen. After being overwhelmed by the truly awe inspiring sights and discussion of each photo, I realized how educational the book is and I thought every high school in the country should acquire one for its library; it would be a wonderful text for young people interested in the universe and, of course, for those of us a little older who haven't quite comprehended what the universe is all about."},{"Title":"What's Out There: Images from Here to the Edge of the Universe","review":"Another fascinating picture book for star gazers and astronomy buffs to look at and drool! This collection of one hundred eighty spectacular views were taken by the newest space instruments, telescopes, NASA satallites, during space probes. In the Foreword, Stephen Hawking's 'The Never-Ending Quest,' is descriptive, \\"I do not believe we will ever reach the end of our quest for a complete understanding of the universe.\\"From pulsars to white dwarfs, the clear, lucid pictures with descriptive text, make for a fascinating 'tour of the universe.' I've vicariously taken several such, from the time my son was a physics student leading into his Ph.D. in Astronomy, and this is one of the best. There are a cornicopia of this kind of photography on the web site for NASA; those of the Mars' explorations are out of this world.In this well-put-together collection, each planet, asteroid, the nebulas, black holes, supernovas, galaxies are shown in all their glory and explained in easy-to-understand by language by Mary K. Baumann. The sunspot and eclipse are strangely eerie in the detail shown. Each photo has the dates taken, where and by whom, so that the proper credit is given -- as there is available a plethora of images of the awesome beauty of the universe. I wouldn't call it the final frontier, only the beginning of things to come.The essay on color imagery in space adds to the enjoyment of the science behind the images, listed as a 'picture dictionary' (from A to Y -- no Z). In addition to these lovely, thought-provoking photographs, some overwhelming, the book gives helpful information for the amateur stargazer or the seasoned astronomer.Michael Soluri is expert in the research and editing of astronomical and space exploration photography. Ray Villard is an astronomy professor at Johns Hopkins University. Stephen Hawkings, a mathematician, has many bestsellers on the subject of space including THE UNIVERSE IN A NUTSHELL, THEORIES OF THE UNIVERSE, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING: ORIGIN AND FATE OF THE UNIVERSE, and a study on BLACK HOLES. He has edited books about Copernicus, Kepler, Gibbons, and Galileo among others."},{"Title":"What's Out There: Images from Here to the Edge of the Universe","review":"Today I have boldly gone...inside the pages of What's Out There. I have explored brilliant new worlds and have understood what they mean to us Earthlings. I have taken a ride on exploratory missions to seek out new life, if any.

It is not only rich with extraordinary photography but also written in such a way that the \\"hard to explain theories\\" become understandable.I highly recommend this book to anyone with a thirst for knowing \\"What's Out There.\\" Beginning with page one you will be teleported throughout our universe and beyond.

The mind that grasps its facts and principles receives something of the enlargement and grandeur belonging to the science itself. It is a quickener of devotion.\\"The above is a quotation uttered by American educator Horace Mann in the 1800s. It eloquently sums up my feelings when I viewed the images (the majority of which are taken from our Galaxy) and read their accompanying text in this fascinating book by M. K. Baumann, W. Hopkins, L. Nolletti, and M. Soluri (with astronomy consultant R. Villard).Stephen Hawking, who wrote the book's forward, tells us that \\"the [spectacular] images in this book represent some of the most up-to-date and high-definition data available.\\" Yes, the more than 180 images are truly spectacular and were selected because they were judged to be the \\"most important\\" examples to highlight a particular topic. (The earliest image was taken May 1967 and the most recent was taken Jan. 2005.) Each photographic image has a standard data area that gives key information about the image. For example the data area of the image that's on the front cover of this book (shown above by Amazon) might be as follows:(1) Identification icon of the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft. (I will explain more about these icons below.)(2) Saturn with its moon Enceladus appearing near its south pole(3) Visible-light image (metallic color added)(4) Cassini orbiter (Note that this spacecraft consists of this orbiter and the Huygens probe)(5) 16 May 2004(6) 12.5 million miles (20 million km) from EarthEach topic is presented alphabetically with a brief, easy-to-understand, descriptive, and interesting text to explain a topic. The letters covered are from \\"A\\" to \\"W\\" (excluding \\"K,\\" \\"O,\\" and \\"Q\\"). Topics under each letter range from one to several. For example, under \\"A\\" are two topics covering four pages but under \\"C\\" are six topics covering ten pages.Thus each topic generally has three pieces of information. For example, the first topic under \\"A\\" is \\"Asteroid.\\" Then there is:(1) a descriptive text of an asteroid(2) an actual image of an asteroid--in this case asteroid Eros(3) a data area for asteroid Eros (which, as shown above, has (i) an identification icon (ii) image description (iii) image type (iv) image source (v) date image taken and (vi) distance celestial object is from Earth).At the end of the book are three sections. One section lists with a brief description the mechanical and human image-makers that made the images in this book possible. Another well-written section explains the science behind the images used in this book. The last section is a glossary of important terms.The section regarding the image-makers is one I found especially interesting. Over forty image-makers are listed and well described. These image-makers are divided into four groups:(1) Earth-based (like observatories)(2) Near-Earth (like space-based telescopes)(3) Spacecraft, probes, & cameras(4) Individuals (who work with accessible and mobile equipment).The identification icons I mentioned in the sample data area above are in this image-makers section. Any icon that appears in the book can be matched with the same icon in this section. For example, the icon of the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft mentioned in the sample data area above can be matched with the identical icon in the above-mentioned third group. Then below the icon is a brief description of this spacecraft that I found quite interesting.Finally, I did find some problems with this book. I should emphasize that these in no way affect the book's readability but I found them to be irritations:(1) There is no introduction. There is a four-paragraph blurb on the inside front jacket flap that promotes the book and at the same time tries to give some indication of what to find in it. It does not do the latter very well. For example, how to use the icons is not explained at all. There should have been a good introduction included within the book itself.(2) Three astronomical images located on the first two pages are not explained at all. Why?(3) There are no references for the text. True, we are given the names of almost sixty scientists and space professionals who shared their knowledge. But throughout the book's pages are certain figures that must have been looked up somewhere. These sources are not given credit.(4) The glossary is somewhat redundant. For example, the first word in the glossary is \\"asteroid.\\" But as I mentioned above, it's a topic in the main section of this book! Why include it in the glossary? I found this for several other words as well.(5) Right after the index of this book (that is, on the very last page) is a description of a newly discovered phenomenon that is \\"a telltale trace of other Earth-like planets out beyond our solar system.\\" I found this VERY interesting. Why was it on the very last page of the book? It should have been included in the main narrative.In conclusion, if you're an armchair astronaut like me, you'll appreciate this visually stunning and informative book that reveals the awesome beauty and mystery of the cosmos!!!(first published 2005; forward by S.

In the tradition of a great coffee table book, they suck you in. But after a bit of browsing you realize that the coolest thing is the completely understandable explanations. It's rare that you find this combination of science in such an awe-inspiring and accessible package. Fascinating!"},{"Title":"What's Out There: Images from Here to the Edge of the Universe","review":"Not many things in the world can literally take your breath away. Maybe it was your first kiss, or maybe when your son or daughter finally became part of the living. But this book cannot be excepted from that category, because these pictures seem to live and breathe just as we do. Light years and light years away.Mars is viewed up so close, you feel like you're actually breathing in the dusty storms of the planet and you're surrounded by barren red wasteland, where life might once have existed. Jupiter's moon, Europa, has so many stunning pictures, as each one depicts its greenish-blue hue cracked with red lines and ice that fit in with the satellite so icily, but coolly. And don't get me even STARTED on the nebulae! They are so unbelievably beautiful - swirls of reds tingling with blue and a shiver of yellow belting down an orange, with sparkles and beauty outlining every inch of it. I think the nebulae deserve fifty chapters just for themselves.All the pictures are arranged alphabetically from their title, from A for Asteroid to W for WMAP (check the book if you don't know what that is ;D), this book has it all. All the pictures are high-definition and just a frightful wonder to look at, staring at the deep, stellar field of space.But as another reviewer said, don't miss out on the captions! There's an universe of information to be read, and they just can't be ignored because the pictures are so gorgeous. They're extremely factual and faultless, and only glorify the images with much information, unlike other space books where one-liners just dismiss the true meaning behind the pictures.This book is highly recommended. I can't imagine a better source to start a lifelong interest in space, or to simply indulge in the beauty of space."},{"Title":"What's Out There: Images from Here to the Edge of the Universe","review":"Stephen Hawking provides the foreword to WHAT'S OUT THERE: IMAGES FROM HERE TO THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE. Here are nearly two hundred of the most important images ranging from close-ups of Mars to views of the most distant nebula. An alphabetical arrangement allows for quick and easy reference and topics which lend to commentary by experts as they accompany striking color photos. Photos have been culled from archives and astronomical sources from around the world and beyond the planet and provide an amazing A-Z picture record of striking images. Very highly recommended; especially for college-level astronomy holdings."},{"Title":"Better speech and better reading;: A practice book","review":"Ms. Schoolfield was completely on the mark!

Similar info on rest of world too. Highly recommended for library, school, or home."},{"Title":"Hammond Citation World Atlas","review":"Let me begin with some minor critical points: I believe that, for the book's price, the color quality is primitive and tacky. Also, a portion of the maps are too small.That said, however, there are several qualities that make this, in my opinion, the finest World Atlas ever printed:One: if you enjoy atlases for precise political detail, the Hammond Citation Atlas is the most precise of them all. After surveying every atlas in Borders and Barnes & Noble, I found that 99% of the \\"prettier\\" and more expensive books failed to present the political subdivisions of nations, except the US, Canada, sometimes Australia, and, once in a blue moon, Mexico. Hammond Citation, on the other hand, gives you EVERYTHING, no over-simplification, no mediocrity, no pretty but academically useless movie-poster maps. If you believe, as I do, that reference books should provide reference, this fine volume is the only one that fits that bill.Two: This Atlas does not ignore the existence of small territories, as many of the \\"finer\\" atlases do. If you want to find St. Helena (UK) in the South Atlantic, by George, you will find it. I have great respect for Rand McNally, a source of good atlases. Unfortunately, they often don't place Navassa Is. (US), south of Guantanamo, anywhere on earth. Details such as those are the reason I appreciate Hammond.Three: This book does not run its maps into the book seam. I cannot put into words what an importance difference this makes.Four: Most of the maps are excellently proportioned. A few of them are uncomfortably small, like the Caribbean, but these belong to a very small minority.Five: Outside of National Geographic maps, which I consider the best, Hammond's color scheme for political maps is the most clear, logical, useful, and pleasing to the eye. Political maps are their finest accomplishment.I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those who appreciate concise and precise geographic knowledge in an affordable format, and reject prettier but unscholarly maps in an expensive book you can't use."},{"Title":"Hammond Citation World Atlas","review":"Ignore the clueless School Library Journal review. This atlas is perfect for basic reference and school projects. It is not intended to be a highly detailed ultra-refined reference work, and it is confusing to see people faulting it for that. Most maps are on ONE page (a miracle!), with small but helpful topographic, land use and agricultural maps. For the U.S. maps, state flags are reproduced, and basic state facts and gazetteers are along side the maps. This is an affordable, very useful basic atlas, with wonderfully clear maps that have county boundaries, county seats and larger cities clearly marked. Highly recommended for use at work, school or home."},{"Title":"Hammond Citation World Atlas","review":"Forget School Library Journal. I've had a version of this same atlas for 25 years, and when it became outdated--I looked until I found an updated version. Why? Because this Atlas has so much information, so clearly printed and accessibly arranged, that I couldn't find a comparable book (in the same size) without getting an updated version of the same thing. I just couldn't buy anything else until I found my old friend. One of the very great virtues of this book is that it's fully packed with info and doesn't weigh a ton. Great as a reading reference for light history or heavy fiction."},{"Title":"Hammond Citation World Atlas","review":"Wonderful small world atlas. Works well with my hobby of Amateur Radio.

Simmons' book gives an in-depth look to the rising opposition to the Fairness Doctrine. The information in this book is easily accessible through different outlets (whether it be a wikipedia search or a media law textbook). However, what this book offers that those don't is bias.Simmons is a strong advocate for FCC and also for broadcasters 1st amendment rights. He's clearly done his research and knows this field very well. I feel that his bias makes this a very interesting read for someone who's interesting in the broadcasting media. Otherwise, this book would be just facts, but instead the reader gets to travel back in time to before the Doctrine's demise and feel the growing resentment that it's causing.As mentioned before, Simmons knows his stuff. This is a long book, and his source notes and bibliographies take up a good portion of the book and they are a fantastic supplement to the information. He blends the info with his thoughts trying to persuade you to agree that something is wrong and that it most be fixed. Simmons even presents a solution.If you're doing research on the Fairness Doctrine, this is a great book to read.

This equipment was fitted new on the last 25 engines, Nos. 9063-87. The cab roof has the sliding ventilator; later batches had the hinged form. These illustrations also show the Grosley (sic) conjugating levers across the front, whereby the three piston valves were actuated from two sets of Walschaerts motion. In later years this gear was removed from seven of the 88 engines and an extra set of Walschaerts motion put in.\\"Jones Goods and Indian L (Arthur Wolstenholme)Side view of 4-6-0 locomotive #111 and tender in Highland Railway green livery; front and rear view of locomotive; front and rear view of tender\\"Very many versions of the original colour scheme of the Highland Railway Big Goods engines of 1894 have been published. The only authentic record of pre-1898 colouring and lining has been followed here, though the variations introduced in 1898, with lettering on the tender side and front buffer beam, are better known. The engine is shown here in its original mechanical condition with smokebox wing plates but without footsteps against the sidebars. In several details, as well as in the colour scheme, the engine as preserved at Glasgow differs from the original; but the details of the driving controls have perforce been taken from the Glasgow engine.\\"German Austerity 2-10-0 (David Warner)Front, side and rear view of locomotive 42 0003 in black and red livery\\"The illustration shows the heaviest of the three German kriegslokomotiven (or war locomotives), class 42, with 17-ton axle load, which was built to supplement Series 50 UK and 52, and had the same wheels and wheelbase and many similar parts. Over 8000 of these three classes were built 1941-45. The cab was wholly enclosed, and the back plate had the large circular hole leading to the tender; this was for service in the cold behind the Eastern Front. Smoke deflector plates were fitted to Series 42 but not to 52. Locomotive shown s one f those with bar frames; others had plate frames.

For a few days, at the very beginning, she had a name plate on the smoke-box side, but in that condition was never outside of Doncaster works. She and her three sisters, Nos. 2509-12, were painted silver-grey to match the colour scheme chosen for the train. When further engines to the same design appeared i 1936-37 they were painted L.N.E.R. standard green; but when the Coronation streamliner was inaugurated in July 1937 a few engines were painted Garter blue to match the colouring chosen for that train, and all A4s subsequently were painted that shade, as shown in Mallard below. Mallard, holder of the steam locomotive speed record, was one of four engines built in 1938 with Kylchap exhaust and double chimney. It is shown here in the state in which it is preserved at Clapham Museum of Transport [now York Railway Museum]. Visually that state is close to the original. A small difference is that the inside-cylinder drains now come out one on each side, and are clipped to the outside cylinder drains. Original arrangement for all 35 A4 engines was as shown above in Silver Link, where the two inside drains discharge at the front below the coupling. The modification was carried out in late L.N.E.R. and early B.R. days.\\"The American 4-8-4 (David Warner)Side view of locomotive #4411 and tender in Southern Pacific \\"Daylight\\" black, red and orange livery; front view of the locomotive\\"One of the first batch of Lima-built oil-burning 4-8-4s of the Southern Pacific; class GS2 of December 1936, with 73-inch wheels, used on the accelerated Daylight service between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Later engines from Lima, classes GS3 and G6, had 80-inch wheels, and came to be used on the Daylight, the Sunset Limited, and most other S.P. principal passenger turns. Like the GS2 class, they were painted as shown here to match up with the colour scheme of the Daylight train. The tender had Buckeye trucks with articulated frame sections.\\"R.O.D. 2-8-0s (David and Peter Warner)Side view of locomotive #1801 and tender in shop grey livery; front view of locomotive\\"As sent to France, the R.O.D.

The engine shown here, the first of all to be completed, is in shop grey with black and white lining, as painted for the official photograph at Hyde Park works, Glasgow, August 1917. 25 years later some were again painted light grey, unlined, when sent overseas on War Department service. Principal details that distinguished the R.O.D. Consolidations from their Great Central precursors were the use of Westinghouse air brakes, trail-heating connections, Ross pop safety valves, screw couplings and safety chains, round-head buffers, and non-scoop tenders.\\"Merchant Navy Pacifics (A.

No. 21C2 had slight differences again from Nos. 21C1 and 21C3-10. The first ten were all remodelled to the same style at the front end of the casing over the years 1943-45, and that is the state in which they are best known. But No. 21C1 is shown here as turned out from Eastleigh in March 1941, with pivoting flat cap over the chimney, the front brass number plate on the sloping sheet, and a full-height smokebox front plate.\\"\\"With the complete reconstruction over the years 1956-59 the appearance of the 30 engines altered entirely, mainly through the elimination of the air-smoothed casing and the fitting of a large-diameter cast iron chimney; 6,000-gallon tenders were attached to all, and had a longer wheelbase than the 5,100 gallon originals. Clan Line is shown here as rebuilt, and in the state in which it is now preserved.Darjeeling Tanks (David Warner)Front and side view of B-class No. 785 in blue liveryFront and rear view of A-class No. 9 in green livery\\"The A-class tans were the first standard design adopted by the Darjeeling-Himalayan Railway. Built from 1881 to 1883 they had disappeared by 1914 with the exception of one engine that lasted until 1954. They were never painted any colour other than the D.H.R. green, as show in this plate of No. 9 in its as built condition.\\"\\"Initiated in 1888 the B-class was built in numerous small batches until 1927, and 25 of them are still in stock. They have received many modifications during their lives, and even today all are not exactly the same in regard to all details. Originally painted green, they had a short spell in black at the end of World War II, and then ran in an unlined red colour as shown in by the sample square on this plate. Since coming into the stock of the Northeast Frontier Railway in 1958, they have been painted blue with white lines; and this view shows No. 785 as it was actually at work in 1971.\\"Pennsylvania Duplexii (David Warner)Side view of 4-(4-4)-4 locomotive #6110 and tender in Pennsylvania green and yellow livery; front view of the locomotive\\"Without experience of 4-8-4s, the Pennsylvania Railroad moved straight from 4-6-2 express and 4-82 mountain-division mixed traffic locomotives to a huge 6-4-4-6 experimental engine with two independent sets of propulsion machinery; and then acquired two prototype 4-4-4-4s (class T1) before proceeding to the introduction of 7 other duplex-drive locomotives of three different wheel arrangements. The 4-4-4-4s were for high-speed passenger services west of Harrisburg, and had 80-inch drivers.\\"\\"This colour illustration shows one of the two prototype 4-4-4-4s in its original guise in 1942, painted in Pennsy Brunswick green. Its fellow, No. 6111, was almost the same, but its trailing truck carried a booster. Both had poppet valves. On the basis of these two engines 50 more were built in 1945-46, but without the air-smoothed casing above the wheels.

One of the best things about them is that they think they are funny, too. It would be difficult to imagine anyone reading this book who has any vestiges of a sense of humor who could not feel happier after reading a few pages. Yet they all have some depth. There has been sadness in their lives and they deeply care about each other, but mostly they live so in the moment that life itself doesn't intrude upon them easily. Thirkell didn't get on the best 100 of the century, but she might be entitled to the first 20 or so. Read all her books and see which 10 or 12 you would omit!"},{"Title":"WILD STRAWBERRIES","review":"Angela Thirkell is a novelist after the fashion of Jane Austen. She use wit, charm, and style to uncover and skewer some of the foibles, follies, and eccentricities of her characters. Unlike some others, she always does so lovingly and with great regard for the human person. This story centers around a few young people and the romantic entanglements they experience throughout a summer in rural Barsetshire. The plot of the story might well have given rise to the movie &quot;Sabrina.&quot; There are no wild twists or sudden curves; however, they are not needed because the beauty of the prose and the careful observation of each person allows this novel to open up into an entire world of exploration. Once you have read it, you will want to return to it again and again to enjoy the characters, the settings, and the sumptuous prose. While this is a superb read, it is, remarkably, not the very best of Thirkell. The reader who is just starting has some real treats ahead for them"},{"Title":"WILD STRAWBERRIES","review":"I really don't understand why the publishers had to ruin some of the lines and mess up the chapters so that one gets distracted by what is obviously bad editing (or no editing) and rotten typing. It's like no one proofread anything and it makes it harder to enjoy what ought to be an excellent example of English humour."},{"Title":"WILD STRAWBERRIES","review":"Of the many charming characters that people Thirkell's Barsetshire, the Leslies are the most delightful. Meet them in this book and then enjoy them again in later Thirkell novels (notably Marling Hall).Thirkell doesn't provide suspense or surprises, but is perfect light enjoyment for those who appreciate light English wit, sillier than Austen but not as silly as Wodehouse (both of whom are authors I love)."},{"Title":"WILD STRAWBERRIES","review":"This is a wonderful book by a wonderful author with the worst formatting and copy editing I have ever seen in a commercially published volume. It reads as if it was scanned in from an old pre computer version, cursorily spell checked and grammar checked, which made things worse, and then formatted following some arcane principle that made it almost impossible to follow the turns of speech. Thirkell's work is sufficiently robust that to have this version is better than nothing, but it is really somewhatdisrespectful to her heritage."},{"Title":"WILD STRAWBERRIES","review":"This was the second of Thirkell's Barsetshire stories I've read. Normally, I'm a great fan of farce, silliness and all-around hijinks, but this one left me confused often enough to subtract a star. Moreover, unlike \\"The Brandons\\" this story was so self-contained among the family that it gave almost no local impressions.I give the header on this review to warn readers of a very, very politically incorrect incident, standing apart from the tone of the novel and lasting a page or so. Those with heightened sensibilities will toss the book across the room - pronto! Fans of Comedy Central's \\"Strangers With Candy\\" will adore it. The author does address the issue of homosexuality among the English Upper Class (don't all gasp at once!) in a rather forthright manner for 1934. However, I didn't for a minute believe that Uncle David was a bachelor because the \\"right woman\\" hadn't come along."},{"Title":"WILD STRAWBERRIES","review":"The typesetting is just dreadful. However, the wonderful gentle Thirkell storylines and characters are as charming as ever. Some lines are just nonsense because of the typesetting, so that is sad."},{"Title":"WILD STRAWBERRIES","review":"I love Angela Thirkell's Barsetshire novels and am reading them as I can find them, so was thrilled to see them being reprinted. I agree with other reviewers here that the rather slapdash editing and printing in some of the books is frustrating, but for me nothing can spoil the pleasure of another visit with Thirkell's wonderful characters.Here we visit Rushwater House and meet the Leslie family which includes three of my new favorite characters: Lady Emily Leslie, her long-suffering husband Henry, and their daughter Agnes. She, like her mother Lady Emily, is totally enthralled with her children and their well-being, and extends this loving (yet hilariously obtuse and therefore maddening!) attention to all in their charge - house guests, friends, servants - you name it, no detail is too small, no hurt feeling too insignificant to escape discussion and dissection by these two well-meaning matrons. Mr. Leslie tries to avoid the entanglements and complications caused by his beloved wife's good intentions, but that's impossible, of course, and leads to some of the funniest dialogue.There are other wonderful characters only Thirkell could create: sweet, innocent Mary Preston, visiting for the summer and becoming instantly invaluable to Lady Emily as she runs interference with the servants, smooths feathers and charms everyone with her calm good sense - sense that deserts her as she falls prey to Lady Emily's son David's facile charm and casual selfishness (of course the reader would cheerfully strangle him!) You know, of course, that Mary should be with elder brother John - mature, responsible, and a widower - but will Mary realize it? Will high-spirited grandson Martin's big birthday bash come off without a hitch? Will the snarky, snobbish and dreadfully odious Mr. Holt manage to worm yet another invitation out of Lady Emily? Thirkell may not have been quite the Jane Austen of her day, but for me she always creates a charming, funny, witty English Country-house world that is a pleasure to visit again and again - delightful!"},{"Title":"WILD STRAWBERRIES","review":"I really liked this book, I would describe it as a fizzy screwball comedy.

The world of Thrush Green is endearing but not so perfect that it is uninteresting. It is inhabited by characters that are by turn charming,wise,eccentric and down-right irritating! The stories, set in a fictional town in modern England, portray a pace of life that is appealing to those of us who live in the busy, disconnected world of 21st century America and while they are somewhat idealized, the real world is allowed to intrude and the characters must deal with some of the same situations we face in our own lives....aging relatives, loss and disappointment. Yet the book always leaves you with the feeling that life is good. If you like Jan Karon or Jane Austen, you will love Miss Read."},{"Title":"At Home in Thrush Green","review":"Complete your set of Miss Read's books.

A story that gives that warm, curl up in an easy chair and treat yourself to a real treat experience."},{"Title":"At Home in Thrush Green","review":"Though he fondly remembers the poorly designed Victorian vicarage that was reduced to cinders recently, leaving him and his wife homeless, Charles Henstock, the rector of Thrush Green is pleased to observe the completion of the new senior residences that have taken its place. The charming little cottages are perfect for the older residents of the area who can no longer care for themselves. Applicants for the limited space are numerous, however, and it is with some anxiety that Charles and the other members of the board sit down to choose the first inhabitants of the homes. After much deliberation, their choice is made and the community eagerly watches to see if the new inhabitants will be pleased with their homes and will live peaceably together. Meanwhile, other concerns arise in each of the village homes. Friendships are tested by arguments and misunderstanding, sickness plagues many households and new relationships and business partnerships are formed, to the delight of many. Though the mood of the village seems bleak at many times, the sunshine returns and harmony once again reigns at the close of the book.Peopled by charming, very human characters who find themselves in some interesting predicaments, this installment of the Thrush Green series is, like its predecessors, a sweet and cozy read. Simple but filled with wisdom, it's perfect for a day when you need to be reminded of all that is good in this world, despite the trials that we all face, whether we live in the big city or a quaint little English village."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"The formatting on my Kindle 2 looks good.

Great choice!"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQU7JO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgIt is impossible to guess or to tell from Kipling's fragmentary autobiography, SOMETHING OF MYSELF, whether he completely made up the short stories in THE JUNGLE BOOK or whether he based them on folktales he heard as a child in India. My guess is that it's about fifty-fifty. What I'm certain of is that they are worth reading, and they will remain worth reading.However, I prefer the edition in which all the Mowgli stories are in one book and all the other stories are in a second book. The stories not involving Mowgli have no particular order in which they should be read, whereas the Mowgli stories should be read in order, with no other stories between them.When I was five years old, my grandfather died. Among the things he left us was a complete set of Kipling. Where we lived there was no library, and my parents could afford very few books, though they managed to get us the old red Childcraft (it was new then) and Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories. But the main result was that from the time I was five until my mother gave the books to a library when I was twelve, I read Kipling constantly. The Jungle Books were among my favorites, even more so than the Just-So Stories. I think all children should be exposed to these stories, and I despise the Disney version which makes the dignified Baloo a clown.I love these books."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"This is a beautiful edition of the wonderful childhood classic.

It is about an Indian infant called Mowgli who is lost in the jungle, but then was placed in a wolf family. He grows up in the jungle therefore having no manners or any sense of human life. The Jungle Book show how friends can always be mad but then they come around. And they will always be there for you no matter what, if not then they aren't true friends. There is great ambition in Mowgli.His story is great for all ages. A lot of the characters are explained in detail and you grow to actually love the animals. I think all kids should have read the book rather than see the movie becuase the book is much better.Some of the values showed in this book are loyalty, trust honor, and courage. This book is valued by many children and it should be read to them as young kids to also expand their imagination.

And in the Jungle Book I found absolutely nothing, besides what I venture to mention, that slights my opinion of the quality of Rudyard Kipling's writing. I felt that in this book Kiplng was trying to exercise a mode of writing that was supposed to be at an elementary level, and therefor more suitable for children. I claim the same excuse for the length of the book. Yet I feel that Kipling's mode was not the best that could have been chosen. Instead, the book seemed to have a choppy quality, let me explain myself by saying that one chapter was used on a small event in Mowgli's life, and then several years were skipped, so the contents of the next chapter forced you to use an element of brain power for comprehension. I do not know the reader's, nor the general public's, feelings toward this use of brain power, I only know mine, which are that this usage distracts my from the story, and slightly takes me away from the spell any good book ought to have. I do not for one minute say that any of the contents of the book, extracting to the very singular word, were not put down without great thought, creativity, and originality, which all together produce a degree of brilliance. That degree, however, may alter, and I feel that although the brilliance is most definately there, it is not at it's utmost level. I find no fault of that with the author, except that of Kipling's trying to overtake a goal so difficult even he, with all his brilliance, was not able to peform to allow it to be rated as high as five stars. I do, though, sincerely applaud Rudyard Kipling's, original and, absolutely, in every possible way, amazing work, although I feel it to contain too many small faults to call it equal to its extroadinary reputation. I place the fault of it's too high reputaton sincerely upon those who read the book without knowlegde of it beforehand."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"It depicted the culture and feelings of different animals standing on their sides.

While their message is important, the same quality writing found with the previously was lacking in the rest. Kipling is a great author and I look forward to reading more, but hope they are more along the lines of Mowgli's adventures and less from seals looking for safety from humans."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"While I admire Disney's animation (and am looking forward to their Hamlet-ish The Lion King), I usually gripe about the changes they make in their movies from their source material. All one has to do is read the original Pinocchio, Peter Pan, or, supposedly, Bambi, to berate them for destroying classics. I probably should be bothered as well by their Jungle Book, except that I think that it was one of the cases where the marriage of animation, story and music achieves more than the original. Without the source material, it would be nothing, of course, but the wonderful songs (who can forget \\"Bare Necessities,\\" \\"Trust in Me,\\" or \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\"?) and the structure that turned Kipling's short tales into a two-hour movie create a gestalt that I'm not sure Kipling's tales do by themselves. This is probably sacrilege to the ears of the true Kipling fan, but I'm nothing if not opinionated.The stories that make up the Jungle Book aren't solely about Mowgli, though, and it's the others, especially \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" that make this a definate must have."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"This book was an interesting book but I had a hard time getting into the whole thing.

Alas, Dover hasn't manufactured paperbacks that way in years, but this clothbound edition looks every bit as durable as it is beautiful. Many will find it an attractive alternative to the Borzoi Book (Everyman's Library) published by Knopf; the paper is finer, and the illustrations (by the Detmold brothers) are reproduced in full color. This book is not, however, a facsimile reprint of the Macmillan edition of 1908. As the publisher's note explains, the plates have been \\"reproduced from an extremely scarce, original portfolio of watercolors, and have never before appeared on this scale in book form.\\" From these remarks one gathers that the illustrations are larger here than in the 1908 edition, some of them spread across two pages. Unfortunately, the binding (unlike that of the Knopf edition) is too firm for the open book to lie flat, so several of these two-page presentations (notably that of Kaa on pages 64-65) are spoiled by the heavy fold down the center. Moreover, in spite of the \\"elegant new type design and many additional decorative elements,\\" it is annoying to find Kipling's verses centered line by line instead of systematically indented according to their rhyme schemes. One final note: the text appears to be that of the first American edition, not the more established English edition."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"Am vazut in copilarie filmul de desene animate, pe urma am citit carte tradusa in limba romana, si acum ma bucur citind cartea in limba engleza.

Definitely aspects of this book have aged; Kipling was steeped in the age of the Great British Empire, especially the Raj (India).

She pronounces the character's names as attributed to Kipling in the notes of my faithful Penguin edition. Even then, my 10 year old daughter had difficulty with some of the phrasing, and we paused the CD's as we drove across the country to discuss and clarify.

It was one of the first books I read when I graduated to chapter books and even today it remains a favorite. I liked it then, as I like it now, because unlike so many modern children's books it doesn't water down the story or dumb down the plotline. I felt as if I wasn't being talked down to like in so many other children's/young adult books and to me that was important. It's somewhat misanthropic (when Mowgli is thrown out of the village) but I think it does have more redeeming values then most. I am proud to have a copy of these stories sitting eloquently on a book shelf where no other Children's/Young Adult books keep it company. I think even if you're an adult, if you've never read this book it's a must! The Disney movie made loosely, extremely loosely, on Mowgli's adventures always makes me want to scream.

For the past two weeks my 4-year old son and I have sat snuggled up reading one or two chapters at bedtime (we're on our second time through now).

He has been fully engaged and followed the story, asking questions about the jungle, and learning words he's never heard before. He's asked questions about Mowgli and Baloo during breakfast and played like a panther at preschool. The drawings are simple and I think having one picture for every page of text has been helpful in holding his attention.While I love this book, it is very condensed from the original and lacks the vivid descriptions and insight to the characters that the original provides. But that is also part of why I purchased this version... my son isn't old enough to understand much of Kipling's old English grammar and complex thought.

Too many peoeple today simply dismiss him as both racist and imperialist (in other words, judging a 19th century man by 20/21st century standards) but he was of that last generation of poets who tried to learn about their subjects instead of being like the shallow poets of today.This short collection of time honored favorites like the Jungle Book, Rikki Tikki Tavi (the girls loved the great snake fight!), and the White Seal all still glow with life. Real life is illustrated here, not white washed Hollywood stories where nothing really dies but the interaction between predator and prey is ever present.Kipling in today's world is not something allowed in schools, more the pity. His writings make most of what kids today have to read insipid. I only hope other parents/grandparents will allow their offspring the chance to see life how it was and often is today..."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"It is a fine book.

Kipling very deftly teaches the virtues of family, loyalty, mercy, courage, sacrifice and honor using the interactions between the man cub and the jungle creatures."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"The delightful tales in The Jungle Book can and should be enjoyed by young and old. Mowgli, a human child in India, is rescued by wolves and raised by them with wolf brothers and sisters by wolf parents, after an evil lame tiger chased away his human parents. The tiger who not only kills humans wants to control the wolf pact. He tells the wolves insistently that Mowgli belongs to him. Mowgli has many adventures among the wolves and later among humans. Once, for instance, he was captured when he was ten or eleven years old by monkeys, who are portrayed as stupid forgetful creatures in the book. He is saved during a lengthy battle by Bagheera the black panther who loves him and by Baloo the bear that is his instructor, as well as the python Kaa who respects him. Mowgli leaves the jungle and goes to live in the human village. He thinks that people act and think strangely, speak foolishly, and believe that they can change things, which Mowgli knows cannot be changed. These are just some of Mowgli's many adventures. The book also contains exploits by many different animals, such as the story of the white seal that saves other seals from being killed by men for their skins, the mongoose who rescues a family from husband and wife cobras, and a boy who sees elephants dance."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"Everyone knows this is one of the most amazing books of all time, so I'm not going to waste your time by reviewing the stories.

Maybe I'm just a weirdo but give me a square or nearly-square paperback any day. It's just more comfortable to hold. Okay, I AM a weirdo. It's fine. For the price you can't beat it.

I had purchased one of Calla Editions' classics (Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination)to satisfy my impulse to revisit some of my other childhood reading, and when I saw this edition of Jungle Book among Calla's newer publications, I couldn't resist. I'm glad I didn't. Rikki didn't disappoint my memory of him(though the story seemed a lot shorter with the passage of years). What knocked me out are the incredible color plates by two Edwardian-era brothers--Edward and Maurice Detmold. A little Googling informed me that they'd worked together for a relatively short time before one committed suicide in his twenties; the other followed suit later on. What tragedies! The Detmolds' artistry is stunning. Mowgli is depicted as he always should have been--nude and without shame among his animal protectors, and Mowgli's antagonists--Sher Kan the tiger and Kaa the python are sinister in the Detmolds' potrayal of them. Calla has elected to run some of the color plates across two pages, which adds to their impact. Somebody at Calla must love the look of fine, old hardcover books, because they're making them available at prices within reach--and with the look and feel of the originals."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"I grew up reading and re-reading theses stories. I never found a compilation of the Mowgli stories I liked though, at least not an affordable one.This one gave me not only Mowgli but Rikki-tikki-tavi. All with excellent illustrations that add but do not intrude on the stories.This is a classic that should be on every bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"The Jungle BookWhen we say \\"The Jungle Book\\" most of us invariably think of Disney's films, both animated and live action, that have become the norm for Rudyard Kipling's immortal children's stories. While the Disney interpretation is fun and enchanting, it makes a dramatic departure from the actual stories and takes considerable creative license in telling just a part of the Kipling stories. Even what we get from Disney falls considerably short of the applicable parts of Kipling's original that Disney used. What? Kaa, the snake, as Mowgli's friend and powerful ally? What? A deeper story of Mowgli's experience as a wolf and his relationships with Mother wolf and Father wolf? Oh yes, much, much more.Kipling's original masterpiece also includes several other wonderful chapters about the continuing adventures of Mowgli and also adds the marvelous tale of \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" the heroic mongoose whose battles with wicked cobras in an Indian garden easily matches Mowgli's showdowns with Shere Khan.The book also includes the tale of \\"The White Seal.\\" This short chapter of \\"The Jungle Book(s)\\" provides a wonderful commentary, in the form of animal parable, on human society, competition, male ego and human pride. Our hero, Kotick, the white seal, through his fearless explorations and his willingness to fight for a dream, changes the minds of his parents, his peers and his society for the better. The invitation to each of us is very clear to find and free the white seal that exists in all of us.Don't get balled up in the notion that \\"The Jungle Book\\" is just for kids. A look beneath Kipling's wonderful prose reveals, like most great children's classics, that the author is using the unintimidating forum of children's literature to speak to kids of all ages with the hope that somehow we'll all finally get it.Buy the book, read it, read it to the kids you know and learn the lesson.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"This is a beautifully designed book and the quality is excellent. Dover seems to have corrected the earlier problem they had with a few of the books in this series, where the text quality was faded and inconsistent in spots. This book has sharp and consistent text and photographs."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"If you were to ask anyone to describe \\"The Jungle Book\\", they would probably take their cue from the widely knownDisney film, and say that it was about a young boy who was raised by wolves in the jungle, mentored by a bear and a panther, and who eventually kills a dangerous tiger. In this they'd be right, but they'd only be describing the first three chapters.The rest of the book is a series of unrelated short-stories about other animals, and which are not necessarily set in the jungle either. I was surprised at this, as although I knew that Disney had extensively reshaped the story, I had no idea that Mowgli's story was such a comparatively small part of the book. To my knowledge, Rudyard Kipling's characters have also featured in an anime series and alive-action film, and in both cases there has been no indication that the source material involved anything other than a boy called Mowgli and his adventures growing up in the jungle.Though I had known that Disney had extensively reworked Kipling's book (as Disney is always accustomed to do with its film adaptations) it was surprising to find out the real scope and beauty of the original collection of stories, and just how deeply the film had permeated public awareness of what the story involved. Here Mowgli's story doesn't end when he rejoins the man-village, Kaa the snake is not an enemy but an ally, Shere Khan is not defeated with fire, but with a well-strategized buffalo stampede, and there are no vultures that sound like The Beatles (though you probably had that figured out on your own). If there's one thing that especially stands out, it's that Mowgli in this story is much more likeable and intelligent than the loathsome little brat of the film.After Mowgli's father is killed in the jungle, he is raised by a wolf-pack as one of their own, called \\"the frog\\" on account of his gangly limbs, and tutored by Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther in the ways of the Jungle Law: the fair but sometimes harsh edicts that make up life among the animals. Having escaped captivity at an early age, Bagheera in particular is serious about Mowgli's education, hoping that when he finally returns to his own people, he can take knowledge of the Jungle Law with him to teach his fellow man.Yet Mowgli is not easily accepted by either beast or man. Not only are the young wolves threatened by their inability to look him in the eye, but Shere Khan the tiger considers Mowgli his rightful prey. Likewise, the men and women of the village find the boy disconcerting in his habits and strange upbringing, making Mowgli quite a tragic figure in his inability to find a true home among either animals or mankind.The first three chapters of \\"The Jungle Book\\" revolve around Mowgli's story: his upbringing in the first chapter and defeat of Shere Khan in the third, leaving the second (rather oddly, considering it's out of chronological order) to deal with his kidnapping at the hands of the Bandar-log: the Monkey People. Kipling is wonderful at capturing the mystery and atmosphere of the jungle, as well as the fundamental character traits of the animals (the thoughtless monkeys, the malevolent jackal, the wise panther, the complex wolf-pack dynamics). He introduces concepts such as the Jungle Law and the Red Flower, the animal etiquette used in the sharing of hunting grounds and the way in which they address each other, and each species' unique customs and idioms. It's all fascinating stuff, carefully strewn throughout the story to provide a rich background to the world that Mowgli inhabits.The stories that follow are not quite as memorable, but still hold up well, and a couple have been published separately as their own books (\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" and \\"Toomai of the Elephants.\\")\\"The White Seal\\" involves the birth of a strange white seal called Kotick who - after witnessing the mass slaughter of his fellows at the hands of sealers - takes it upon himself to traverse the seas in search of a safe beach that has not been discovered by man. It takes several years and a visitation with the mysterious sea-cows before he can finally return to his people and tell them of his discoveries. It's at this point that a certain sense of values dissonance kicks in. Does Kotick convince his fellow seals to follow him to the promised land through his strong leadership and rousing speeches? No, he beats them all to a bloody pulp and insists on them following him once they've all been defeated.Outside of Mowgli's chapters, \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" is probably the most famous of Kipling's short stories. A mongoose is adopted into the home of an English family living in the jungles of Sugauli cantonment, where it soon learns that a cobra and its mate are planning to kill the little boy in the attempt to drive the family away and reclaim the bungalow for themselves. Aided by other animals in the house and garden, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi prepares to defend his home and family against the snakes with a series of ambushes, tricks and his instinctive fighting abilities. This is definitely the most appealing of the stand-alone stories.\\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" concerns a young Indian boy who works with his father in the rounding-up and breaking-in of elephants for the Indian government. Having grown up among them, he has no fear of the elephants that he can control with simple words and hand gestures. Though his father prefers camp life, it is Toomai's greatest ambition to go hunting for the elephants in the jungle, though he is told that this will only occur when he \\"sees the elephants dance\\" (that is, never).But one night Kala Nag and the other trained elephants are acting strangely, and when several manage to break free of their pickets, Toomai climbs aboard Kala and is taken to mysterious clearing where elephants from miles around have indeed come to dance...In many ways \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" feels like the odd one out in this collection. More for adults than children (who may find it rather incomprehensible) Kipling provides a first-person narrative account of a British soldier who eavesdrops on a number of animals in service to the army. As each one tries to explain, justify and comprehend their roles in the service of mankind, the listener is struck by the differences between each one, and their understanding of the world they inhabit.Up until this story, Kipling has managed to steer surprisingly clear of imperialism and unfortunate implications; here however, there is mention of \\"savage men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of Asia\\" and \\"a wild king of a very wild country,\\" as well as ending the story on a note of British superiority over the disorganization of its colonies. For these reasons, \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" doesn't hold up as well as the other stories.As well as the seven short-stories, the book also contains several poems, songs and chants, usually said to be performed by the animals themselves.Just as many readers are unaware thatLittle Womenis composed of two books (Little Women and Good Wives) and that most of Alice's famous adventures took place in the sequelBehind The Looking Glass, it's a relatively little known fact that there was a sequel to the Jungle Book. Known simply asThe Second Jungle Book, Kipling includes several more Mowgli adventures in it, as well as other stand-alone stories and poems. Many editions of \\"The Jungle Book\\" combine both the first and second book into one volume, though it's difficult to tell which is which considering Amazon.com has grouped all the reviews together, regardless of what edition is being discussed. It's hard to know exactly what you'll be getting when you make the order, so keep in mind that it's easy to miss out on the sequel. There is also the risk of buying an abridged version that cuts out stories or tampers with Kipling's use of language (his use of the archaic terms \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\" in discussions among the animals), so please be careful in deciding which edition to purchase.All in all, \\"The Jungle Book\\" is still a rich and intriguing read, with only a few dated passages. At the very least, it's worth reading in order to get an understanding of the source material as it was before Disney put its stamp on it."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"It's a very good book, and as far as I can tell it's very close to the original which was apparently a problem with some of the other printings."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"This is amazing.

The Jungle Books also remind us that childhood doesn't last forever, and eventually we all must leave it behind to assume greater responsibility in the world.

Now, as a mother I read it to my daughter and it brought me to tears. The lessons taught by the jungle folk are not only beautiful but very essential, it teaches of love and compassion for all living things and how we as humans have always seen animals as inferior even though their souls, laws, and values are quite superior to our own. Just as I believe every child should grow up around animals I also think every child should read the jungle book, for, until you have loved an animal, a part of your soul remains asleep within you."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"THis was a great book.

She liked it, so I guess its a great book."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"In the deep jungle of India there was a little boy name Mowgli. Mowgli is an Indian infant who is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan (the tiger) kills his family. Mowgli was raised by a pack of wolves and is taught the laws of life in the jungle. His closest friends were Baloo, (the bear) and Bagheera (sleek black panther). Mowgli learns how to speak to the animals his childhood seems pleasant. Shere Khan is a dangerous tiger that is seeking revenge on Mowgli. Shere Khan is the enemy and is feared among all of the animals in the jungle. Mowgli was taught there was a certain place in the jungle that he was forbidden to go to. Bagheera and Baloo are trying to teach Mowgli the Laws of the Jungle for his own good. They are having a difficult time with him because he is small and young. Bagheera is more concerned with Mowgli being on his own because he has not learned how to kill his own food. And they are worried that Shere Khan will come after Mowgli and try to kill him. Riki-tiki-tavi is a mongoose, a hunter, and a great fighter. Riki-tiki fought anything that came in his way, but when Nag and Nagaina (the cobra couple) approached him it was different. Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose's eyes grow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a little kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass.I really enjoyed reading The Jungle Book. Kippling had a great imagination, especially since Mowgli could talk to animals. I thought the characters were shown though their actions throughout the book. Rikki Tikki Tavi has always seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"I have to say, I like Disney's version of Mowgli's story better. This story is good, and has some humor, but it is defiantly harsher, especially the second part. Just in case you didn't already relies this, this book contains many stories, including the story of the white seal, which I like better. As for the tale of Riki-Tiki-Tovi, I liked some parts of it, but as a kid especially, I didn't like all the snakes in it. Tumi of the Elephants is a bit strange but Her Majesty's Servants is much better. Being interested in armies, I found it to be fascinating as well as funny. Perhaps if you are not interested in armies you would not find it to be so good, but if you like to wonder what animals would say if they could talk then you still might. In fact, the whole book is primarily on talking animals, so if you like reading about that, this is the book for you! Even if you don't, you should probably still read it, it's being a classic. However, if you're just looking to read something by Kipling then you should read Kim instead; it's much better."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book (Companion Library)","review":"Ms. Burns brings little dynamism to her reading.
