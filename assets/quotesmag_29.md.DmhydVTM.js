She specifically wants to study law at a good institution. In her pursuit of learning, she attempts to use libraries and tries to attend lectures, but is often thrown out of those places of discovery because, after all, she is just a pig. This is a new look at prejudice!This story is presented as a story for children and I really liked the fact that the vocabulary chosen by David Mamet is not the usual fare. Some of the words will need an explanation which adds another dimension to the book. The little fable is greatly enhanced by the illustrations of Elizabeth Dahlie who makes Henrietta real and shows how she looks in good times and in bad. One drawing in particular made me laugh out loud and the image has remained in my mind. The book has general appeal and could even be a \\"coffee table\\" book."},{"Title":"Henrietta","review":"Henrietta is a good example of the saying, &quot;don't judge a book by it's cover&quot;, because I think this book is an adult book in a children's storybook format. The story of Henrietta is about an intelligent pig who lives in Cape Cod and dreams of becoming a lawyer and going through college at Harvard Law School. When she finally becomes old enough to go to college, she is rejected simply because of the fact that she is a pig. Time passes, and Henrietta is found wandering around the city with nowhere to go. She has been unable to find lodging, and has been forced to sleep on the streets. One day, Henrietta was wandering about the city as usual, when she found an old man searching for his glasses under a park bench. Henrietta decided to help the poor man find his glasses. Even though the glasses remained unfound, the man thanked Henrietta for her kindness and took her to his house. I will not say the rest because it will spoil the ending. I thought that this book was very unique and that, as I said before, this book is an adult's book in a storybook format. I liked the fact that this book is more like an adult's book because some children's books, in my opinion, can be slightly irritating. I really enjoyed the moral (or what I think the moral is). The moral that I perceived was: believe in yourself. This moral is shown when Henrietta tries to enter Harvard. I think that people should read this book and see for themselves that this is much more than a children's book."},{"Title":"Henrietta","review":"How can you not be appealed when you read a literate children's book from a man who's works are very testosterone-laden and profanity filled?

I'm moderately familiar with computer networking in general, but I had never taken the time to get a full grasp of how switches play their role.Though one might glean otherwise from the title, Mr. Black discusses techniques appropriate for old hub-based networks rather than just switched networks. He does a fine job of explaining management techniques and tools, though if you're not familiar with SNMP, things can get a little confusing early on (with the discussion of MIBs and such). The discussion of various physical topologies/mediums and WAN systems are a nice touch and broaden the function of the book. I especially valued his emphasis on being constantly proactive when monitoring your networks (i.e. baselining).Overall, this is an excellent reference that is well written and quite educational. I recommend this especially for those just starting out, no matter how dated it has become (written when Fast Ethernet was just starting to come to the desktop)."},{"Title":"Managing Switched Local Area Networks","review":"An excellent introduction to Switching and Network Managementin general.Up-to-date (1998) and relevant, I would recommend this to anyone starting out in Switching technologies.

Now I read his book and understand why. It is as pleasant, shallow, narcissistic and self-absorbed as I found him to be.

I was too busy alternating between groaning at all the little &quot;cutesy-isms&quot; in the book, complaining at the over-simplifications and being generally angry about the number of trees that were chopped down to print the book.

Is this a book or a dating ad?!!I think the endless self-absorption in this book would also be a turn-off for future boyfriends (of the people who read this book).Maybe the problem isn't necessarily one not knowing what our &quot;inner boyfriend&quot; wants, but concentrating too much on that entity."},{"Title":"Finding the Boyfriend Within: A Practical Guide for Tapping into Your Own Source of Love, Happiness, and Respect","review":"Readers interested in a self-help book for gay men might be better off looking at &quot;How to Survive Your Own Gay Life.&quot; I can only repeat what others have said about the book's vacuousness, narcissism, and lack of depth.

The whole premise of the book is a canard...after applying the &quot;FBW&quot; technique to himself, all Gooch seems to have achieved is the ability to pamper himself a bit more than he already has. The book is overloaded with self-serving references to his fabulous good taste in brand-name merchandise. My favorite nugget of Gooch wisdom is on page 108.It's his advice on how to combat loneliness (while walking about town): &quot;...take out my cellphone and line up a date...make dates until sated.&quot; Gooch assures us that modesty is not on his list of qualities, good or bad.

Something about the book stuck in my mind and I returned 2 days later to purchase it. I was surprised that Brad writes of finding self-esteem and self-love so late in life (at 45 years old); however, better late than never. He reviews his dysfunctional thinking and lifestyle; then gives the reader a detailed story of how he discovered his dysfunctionalism and strived for a happy life filled with self-love, respect, and happiness. I was not impressed with the fact that he took so long to find inner happiness - AND this fact alone almost made me throw the book away; I mean, if he lived the dysfunctional life he describes in the book, why would I want to read his material. HOWEVER, I was very IMPRESSED with his 16 exercises, which alone are worth reading the book. I found these exercises lead the reader to &quot;focus&quot; on his &quot;life and priorities&quot;. I am currently doing the first exercise (I read the entire book first) and it is very self-revealing. I would strongly suggest that Brad Gooch please listen to &quot;In the Meantime&quot; by Iyanla Vanzant&quot; - this will help him along his road to happiness, love, and self-respect. Thanks Brad for a Gay Version of self-help. I could definitely relate to SOME of the things he wrote about, especially about the chaos with a messy house.

This book is one you'll love and put to good use right here and now, or you'll throw it in the trash, having nothing good to say about it or the author. I put it to good use! The exercises are helpful. I as a norm, don't get too insightful with myself. The exercises are simple, short, to the point and a joy. I came to self realizations I never would have independently and even found my BFW in a delightful and timely manner thanks to the reading. The story examples are cute, some self-centered,(of course the stories are about Brad, so how could they not be self-centered in some way?) but useful stories none the less. Like most self help books you get what you put into them and enjoy them depending on where you are in your life. If you didn't find Mr. Gooch's book helpful, you weren't supposed to, but don't throw it away just yet. Someday down the lane, you will have a &quot;moment&quot; and the book will have changed the way you think of relationships with others as well as with yourself. I believe every gay man, and some straights, will find Mr. Gooch's book &quot;Finding The Boyfriend Within&quot; helpful and useful at some point in their development.

I guess he just asked too many questions. Towards the end the book got boring. And when he had my full attention, I was counting the pages until the end of the chapter. He had a lot of important things to say, but it was nothing new to me. Maybe I got down because the book didn't deliver the way I thought it would.This book just reiterated the fact that no one can tell you how to like yourself. You have to want it on your own. Then you'll start living your life to make yourself happier. And it will be more rewarding that way because you did it yourself. And because no one else told you what to do, you can't possibly fail.

Often gay men wonder why they do not have a boyfriend. Gooch is writing that all men do and he is within them. By find this friend people, gay or straight, can come to know themselves better, make better choices and rely on their own resources for deriving meaning from life. Upon achieving this, anyone, gay or straight, can be a better lover, husband, wife or friend.For five of the six chapters the exercises described by Gooch seemed simple enough as well as perhaps a bit simple. In Chapter 6 Gooch write that love makes you feel loved. He was not discussing romantic love, which can certainly be a part of this love. He was speaking more directly to the kind of love that comes out of oneself. He spoke of volunteering. He wrote of responding to \\"charitable\\" causes or acts, such as visiting a sick friend. In these activities, Gooch advises the reader that one can experience a good feeling, but more important this type of loving nourishes one's own need to be loved. Love makes you feel loved.This insight is probably nothing new to people who practice various religions. But it is an insight that needs constant renewing. I think it is the most valuable chapter of Gooch's book.Gay people would do well by reading this book. While its insights may seem simple and simplistic, following the exercises can actually help to re-focus on one's most important values.

Don't let all of these \\"negative nancy's\\" dissuade you -- if you are looking for insight into yourself -- and/or this book was recommended to you by your best friend -- make a small investment in your happiness, buy it, read, and, most importantly, do the exercises that Brad \\"assigns\\"."},{"Title":"Finding the Boyfriend Within: A Practical Guide for Tapping into Your Own Source of Love, Happiness, and Respect","review":"I can't relate to this book and the viewpoint of the author. He offers no tangible solutions for me personally in order to improve anything remotely romantically related. Of course, this may be due to my complete lack of understanding in romantic relationships at all, having had no relationships by age, 34.

Joe Amendola, the author, was one of the original instructors at the CIA when they opened their doors after WWII. He retired from the school about 45 years later as head of Baking and Pastry, and was loved by all who knew him.One thing that many people don't know is that in many smaller restaurants, there is no pastry chef, let alone a baker, and the chef is responsible for desserts as well as the appetizers and main dishes. Because of this, culinary students at most cooking schools learn the essentials of desserts, spending 3-6 weeks out of 1-2 years of their training on desserts. For multiple decades, this was THE manual they used at the CIA, and at the catering company I work for, this is still our standard text for desserts recipes. It contains all the fundamentals you need for making excellent desserts. For home use, you will have to scale the recipes down some, as most make too much for most, but that is not a big deal.In particular, the instructions are very clearly written, with details where you need it, and conciseness where you don't.You simply cannot go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"Chocolate Passion: Recipes and Inspiration from the Kitchens of Chocolatier Magazine","review":"I have recently received this book and I find it an excellent book. It is not only beautiful (it has lots of spectacular photos) but also its recipes are wery good, and also its explanations of ingredients and techniques. It is true that it is elegant and you can find that many of the recipes are only for special ocasions (however you can adapt them!), but not too sophisticated (as it is Torres' book, which I find extremely sophisticated). I find this book beautiful and useful."},{"Title":"Chocolate Passion: Recipes and Inspiration from the Kitchens of Chocolatier Magazine","review":"One of the authors is the head recipe tester for Chocolatier Magazine, and the recipes in this cookbook are similar to the ones you will find therein; it has the same advantages and drawbacks. Specifically, it is a productive resource for the professional or the veteran amateur pastry chef. The recipes are probably too ambitious and the instructions too vague for the average home cook.The introductory chapter is a mixed bag. The essays on types of chocolate, tempering, and tools are exemplary. On the other hand, the sections on non-chocolate ingredients and various techniques and procedures (such as whipping egg whites or proper batter folding technique) are virtually absent. It also has the obligatory and disposable information on chocolate history and manufacturing.Interestingly, the book has three main sections, one each for milk, dark, and white chocolates. Here, you will find recipes mainly for cakes, cookies, and confections. In a rare moment of honesty, the authors admit that milk chocolate has such a weak chocolate flavor that it is easily overwhelmed in a recipe. There are slightly more than 50 recipes, and they are all listed and cross referenced in the table of contents.The recipes themselves are problematic. The main error here is the listing of ingredients in volume (e.g. cups) with no equivalents given in weight. This is a major problem for professionals who will try to multiply the recipes, and also for any recipe that has flour. They all list prep times, but never the cooling or baking times. Many of the recipes are complicated affairs that have several components. The result is a recipe that takes up several pages, but even so the instructions are quite scant; they are sufficient for professionals, but not detailed enough for the inexperienced. There is no advice on how to coordinate the execution of a complex recipe with several different sub-recipes. Each recipe has a picture, which is a good thing, but the presentation and decorating instructions in the recipes sometimes do not match the food styling in the photos. These problems will not be a hindrance for the experienced, but will be major trouble for the average home cook.The most interesting feature of this book is the variety of truffle recipes. Each one has detailed instructions from A to Z for using the fancy, plastic truffle molds that can be bought on the internet in a bewildering array of different types and shapes. There is also a recipe for using chocolate transfer sheets."},{"Title":"Chocolate Passion: Recipes and Inspiration from the Kitchens of Chocolatier Magazine","review":"This cookbook is to die for. I have been a subscriber to chocolatier magazine for years and every time I make something from the magazine, people think I've had it catered. The recipes are not as difficult as people might imagine and the photos make your mouth water to the point that you can barely contain yourself until you try every single recipe!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Passion: Recipes and Inspiration from the Kitchens of Chocolatier Magazine","review":"When even someone whose idea of &quot;difficult&quot; cooking is cake and brownies from a box picks up a cookbook and says &quot;I have *got* to have this book&quot;, you know it is a great book.Granted, this person is a chocoholic, not a reformed cook who will consider tackling these challenging recipes. And the recipes are challenging.This book does offer some excellent recipes, and we tested quite a few of them with excellent results...but they are very time and labor intensive. The vast majority of the recipes in the book require over an hour of active preparation.The book is still worth buying however, even if you couldn't possibly imagine taking 4 hours (plus chilling, cooling, etc. time) to make the decadent caramel rum kisses. The very generously sized book is filled with useful information about chocolate, chocolate history, suppliers, and cooking with chocolate. The book is very well written, and while some recipes span over six or more pages, the recipes are written in exquisite detail making it easy for the inexperienced cook to tackle even the most complex of recipes. But the real reason you should buy this book? Definitely the photos. I occasionally use this book as a coffee table book and to quote a guest the photos themselves are &quot;orgasmic&quot;. Her word, not mine. They are incredibly styled and just brimming with chocolate. Be careful though, they have been known to launch chocolate cravings of gastronomical proportions.If you do purchase the book, there are some recipes you *must* try. The Peanut Butter Milk Chocolate Pie is relatively easy to prepare and is by far the best version of this common restaurant staple. If you make only one dessert this year, their Flourless Bittersweet Chocolate Cake with Milk Chocolate Drizzle should definitely be the one. It is incomparable.Will most people actually use this book? Well, it depends on what you mean by &quot;use&quot;. I actually have friends who come over to visit this book...and just happen to see me while they are at it. Just reading the book makes you feel decadent and pampered...like you are eating the best chocolate in the world. Any chocoholic will enjoy this book immensely, probably more than any other book on chocolate on the market. If you want to know how many of the recipes you will use...to be honest, the average cook probably will not use many. There is a lot of useful information and ideas for the average cook, especially when it comes to decorating ideas and techniques that you can apply to many other recipes. You may even be inspired to use some of the unique combinations of ingredients in other recipes, such as white chocolate, citrus juices, and tequila or dark chocolate and ginger. It would take a pretty confident cook or entertainer to try most of the recipes in this book. But it would definitely be worth it!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Passion: Recipes and Inspiration from the Kitchens of Chocolatier Magazine","review":"This book is visually stunning. However, as an avid homebaker, I encountered errors in some of their instructions. Some cakes, such as the \\"White Chocolate Strawberry Mousse Cake,\\" had an assembly problem. I believe they never made the cake themselves or they would have realized that all the filling doesn't fit into the springform pan the way they have indicated. I instead used a 9 inch ring on a baking sheet lined with a 9-inch cardboard round, so I would have enough room for the cake layers and fillings. But the cake itself, when done was incredibly delicious and stunning to look at. I found the \\"Peanut Butter Milk Chocolate Pie,\\" contrary to another reviewer to have been an awful recipe in instructions, assembly and taste. Yuk! The \\"Milk Chocolate and Golden Almond Cakes,\\" were awesome. The cover cake, \\"Black Satin Chocolate Raspberry Cake,\\" is prettier to look and was uninspring in taste. I was disappointed. Most of the recipes are timeconsuming and I agree with another reviewer that they lack insight in the instructions a homebaker would need. I haven't tried any of the candy recipes and will soon be trying out the \\"White Chocolate Opera Cake.\\" I will say this book allows the homebaker to dream and succeed in many recipes to create stunning preparations. I find it is unique that it gives the homebaker a chance to try some challenging recipes that are on par with those one would find in pastry shops and five-star restaurants. Most baking books I find are uninspiring, insipid and about as challenging as opening a cake mix box. I think this book is a great one to add to your collection, because there are enough keeper recipes to make it worth your while."},{"Title":"Chocolate Passion: Recipes and Inspiration from the Kitchens of Chocolatier Magazine","review":"I had this book on my wishlist for almost a year and received it for Christmas. I sat down on Christmas evening and eagerly paged through the book. What a disappointment. Most of the recipes did absolutely nothing for me. Most of the recipes were time consuming and tedious. Yes, it's nice to look at, but I want to taste, not look, and this book totally put me off to trying many of the recipes. I was very disappointed. If you want truly decadent chocolate desserts, I highly recommend Chocolate Desserts by Pierre Herme. These recipes were specifically written for the home kitchen and are truly inspiring and decadent. It doesn't get any better than Chocolate Desserts. Don't waste your time/money on this book unless you want showpieces rather than decadent desserts."},{"Title":"Chocolate Passion: Recipes and Inspiration from the Kitchens of Chocolatier Magazine","review":"I love this book.That pretty much sums it up. I was looking for a book to unseat Desserts by Pierre Herme as my favourite high-end, spare no expense baking book, the kind you use for dinner parties and other events to just blow your guests away. And after being disappointed with Chocolate Desserts by Pierre Herme, I thought I would remain searching...The search is over. The desserts in this book fall into the \\"enthusiast\\" category, so don't expect the recipes to be quick or easy. Some will be irritated by the lack of mass measurements too.But if you're willing to put in the time and have at least a medium level of experience, these recipes are going to blow you away. The white chocolate strawberry cake, for example. Visually, it's just spectacular; every time I make the thing, people are just in awe. I've even stolen the great spiral design with the chocolate triangles for other cakes, and the results have never failed to disappoint. Oh yeah, and did I mention that these cakes taste great too? Well they do. Have you tried Pierre Herme's Meringue? This is one of the most complicated and difficult recipes I have ever done, but damn was it fun to make. Even the humble white chocolate cheesecake recipe tasted sublime, and was easy to make at that!This is the kind of book that makes me want to get up at 6:00 a.m. and just bake for 10 or 12 hours working on the elaborate masterpieces contained within. It's the kind of book that stimulates the imagination, as well as the taste buds. I cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Chocolate Passion: Recipes and Inspiration from the Kitchens of Chocolatier Magazine","review":"The book is good and the write up is very detail.

She also correlates this work with that of the aspirant and of the disciple, who wishes to collaborate with the GREAT WORK of Salvation. A good book for meditation. A practical book for anyone, who wishes to follow in the footsteps of THE MASTER.

I found it to be a great insight into the mind of a theosophical &#34;saint&#34; but other than that, I found her ideas and conclusions to be fruitless, boring, and just plain absurd."},{"Title":"The Reappearance of the Christ","review":"This review is intended as a general comment on the entire Alice Bailey teaching, and not just one book. What follows represents my current evaluation of the books, an evaluation that has evolved and changed over many years, following my personal experience studying the books. In the 1960s and 70s I had extensive contact with some of Bailey's co-workers who knew her and her teaching very well and I had help from them in understanding her teaching. My current views on the Alice Bailey teaching would not please them, but I have tried to be careful and not to be unkind. However, there is just no avoiding the conclusion that while the books are somewhat interesting, they are very defective as a guide to life, and it is as a guide to life that they are intended.The Alice Bailey books are complex and difficult. Many good things, and even some great ideas, are to be found in them. On occasion, in the past, I have recommended them to people searching for an esoteric vision of the Christian teaching. I would no longer recommend them to anyone. There are many serious problems with the Bailey books, and there there are far better spiritual teachings to be found elsewhere.A list of some problems of these books, and their possible resolutions, follows:1. Alice Bailey, and her (frequently over enthusiastic) followers insist that her books are a universal teaching for the New Age. But they are actually a neo-Gnostic Christian teaching dressed up with with some Theosophical Society terminology and some terminology derived from the mysticism of India. Behind the facade of that terminology, the strongly Christian orientation of her youth (she was a missionary in India), comes through in all her books, but now strongly influenced by Gnosticism. For instance, this short quote from \`Rays and the Initiations' p.637: \\"The decision anent the Jews is one of hierarchical importance, owing to the karmic relation of the Christ to the Jewish race, to the fact that they repudiated Him as the Messiah and are still doing so, and of the interpretive nature of the Jewish problem as far as the whole of humanity is concerned.\\"Resolution: For those who are sympathetic to Christian Gnosticism (repudiated, for good reason, by every Christian denomination I know of), you might find Bailey's books an interesting experiment in neo-Gnosticism.2. Despite the claims that the books were dictated telepathically to Bailey, who was living in NJ, by a Tibetan lama called Djwal Khul, who was in Tibet; there is no Buddhism to be found in the twenty-four books that Bailey wrote. That discrepancy leaves a core claim of the books, i.e. their origin, totally unsupported.Resolution: For those who are willing to spend years of their life studying a series of esoteric books which make claims of fact that are not rationally supported by anything, these books are for you. And because of the nature of the books it will take you years.3. The ideas found in the books are difficult to understand because in addition to the dry writing style, her ideas are peculiar. It is quite likely they have virtually no relation to any ideas with which you are familiar; unless you are familiar with the of Theosophical Society writings of Helena Blavatsky, particularly with \`The Secret Doctrine'. There is a certain similarity to the Blavatsky books. However, the Theosophical Society has publicly repudiated Bailey, and in fact Bailey was kicked out of the Theosophical Society at the time she started to write her books. There are many long passages, sometimes continuing for dozens of pages, which are incomprehensible. One of her closest co-workers (who I knew personally) admitted that neither he nor anyone else can explain the meaning of many of those passages. For me, this brings to mind the comment that Robert Browning made about one of his early poems, \\"When I wrote it only God and I knew what it meant, now only God knows.\\"Resolution: For those who enjoy being puzzled by long dry passages, that may not have any meaning at all, the Alice Bailey's books may be just what is wanted.4. If you do buy an Alice Bailey book, and get confused trying to understand what it means (if anything), there is help available. You will find in all the books a message directing you to contact the Arcane School, an organization founded by Alice Bailey as a way to promote her teaching. There are now also a number of other groups giving such help, including the School for Esoteric Studies, and the University of the Seven Rays. You will find that the people at the Arcane School, and the other groups, are very nice, very helpful, even well educated; and you will probably like them. They will be anxious to help you. But if you express doubts about anything that is contained in the books, no matter how problematic that content is, or how absurd it seems; you will be told (nicely at first) that you are wrong and that what you think is an incorrect, or absurd, statement are actually the words of the Master Djwhal Khul, who has an understanding that is above human understanding. In other words, they consider the content of the books divinely inspired, and that every statement, in every sentence, is correct and can not be questioned. So although it is called a New Age teaching, it is actually completely authoritarian and fundamentalist at its heart.Resolution: For those readers who are looking for fundamentalism and authoritarianism in New Age dress, the Alice Bailey teaching may be just what you want.5. There are also the well known accusations of Alice Bailey's antisemitism. Sorry to say that those accusations are not only true, but that her antisemitism is woven through the books in such a way that they become an integral part of her teaching. Also, since every statement in the books is considered the divinely inspired word of the Master, you are not allowed to question claims such as, for example, Bailey's view that Jews brought a force she calls \\"cosmic evil\\" to this world from another world where they previously existed, and that Jews are the exponents of \\"materialism\\" and \\"separatism\\" on this planet. In fact, these views are very similar to what Hyam Maccoby describes as the view of many Gnostic sects, \\"that the Jews are representatives of cosmic evil, the people of the Devil.\\"Resolution: For those readers who dislike Jews, and have also an interest occult esotericism, the Alice Bailey books may offer just the combination of those two that you have been looking for.Conclusion: For those who are looking for a good teaching, a teaching which is a Way to become a better person through living a more ethical life, a teaching which is a Path that will make it possible to contribute positively to the world, and which is based on a systematic teaching; what I would suggest is to study the writings of those great individuals who were living examples of their philosophy and their religion as a way of life. Such writings can be found in the schools of Greek or Roman philosophy, in the writings of the great Christian theologians and philosophers, and in the books from similarly helpful teachers that are found in Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, and Judaism. Why waste time on the absurdities of the Alice Bailey cult writings when there are so many better options?"},{"Title":"The Reappearance of the Christ","review":"Helpful is the review above which details some of the problems with Bailey's writings, but what these reviewers don't understand is \\"THE Christ\\" that Bailey speaks of is not Jesus. It's Satan. Bailey is a freemason in charge of \\"re-educating\\" the public on a grand scale. Just a heads up people."},{"Title":"The Reappearance of the Christ","review":"Like Banjamin Creme's work this has extraordinary merit and certainly helps in preparing the world for what is coming, but at this point I find another announcement being made in another (recently published) book much more credible -- that the Christ will not come this time, but has instead sent a messenger.You see, as Jesus said, \\"there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, who shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that they shall deceive and seduce the very elect.\\" (Matthew 24:24 and Mark 13:22) That was not merely to warn us of imposters and pretenders. It was also to confirm that the person who would actually fulfill Judeo-Christian prophecy would not be the Christ, but His messenger.Other evidence of this is that the prophesied messenger is the \\"bridegroom-lamb,\\" our \\"brother and fellow servant who has the testimony of Jesus\\" (Revelations 19:10). He is also the messenger for the \\"Spirit of Truth\\" that Jesus said would come, to \\"guide us unto all truth, show us things to come, and glorify me (Jesus).\\" (John 16:13-14) What's more, he is the \\"son of man who (unlike Jesus) first suffered many things and was rejected by his generation,\\" as prophesied by Jesus. (Luke 17:24-25 and Isaiah 49:4) He is also the son of man who was first \\"stricken and afflicted.\\" (Isaiah 53:4 and 57:15-17) All those biblical facts, along with others, indicate the truth about today's messenger of God, who is not a superman, and not holier than thou, but a prodigal son of man who delivers the true message for the Spirit of Truth.The messenger has no personal agenda and will play no other role. In fact, he prefers to remain anonymous and writes under a pen name. He fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah in that \\"the servant and witness of God will not make his voice heard in the street\\" (or in public), but sends \\"his work before him.\\" (Isaiah 42:1-2 and 62:11) He says the world does not need another would-be savior to scorn and crucify, or to exalt and put on a pedestal, and no man should be tempted with such great worldly power or bear its responsibility. He says the world needs truth, and nothing but the truth, and submits that the new covenant of God frees us from sovereign authority or sovereign leadership of any kind. He says there is no hierarchy in Christ, and he repeats what Isaiah wrote, that \\"besides God there is no savior.\\" (Isaiah 43:10-11)The book is titled Real Prophecy Unveiled, by Joseph J. Adamson. It's really about our total liberation and the fulfillment of prophecy, and it includes a comprehensive critique of what and who causes our main problems. It turns the tables on the Religious Right, establishing that Jesus (like all other enlightened ones) was really a \\"bleeding heart liberal,\\" and it exposes the error and hypocrisy of right-wing religious leaders who claim otherwise. This, the messenger submits, is absolutely necessary because in order for the humble and meek to inherit the earth, the proud and militant must be exposed and rebuked to fulfill the prophecies of Isaiah and Jesus. And he is not \\"lukewarm and neither hot or cold\\" about it, knowing the Christ's desire that the judgment from the son of man be strong and firm.The messenger also establishes the value and need for secular government, separation of church and state, equality of religions, and an end to misguided patriarchal traditions. He also dispels myths and false beliefs and explains the value of esoteric teachings. He even gives us a way to abolish partisan politics and be rid of the \\"pretender to the throne\\" so we can share the throne of God's \\"new kingdom\\" as the equal joint heirs that we really are according to the Bible, creating government that is finally of, for, and by the people. It is an overall view of prophecy we can enthusiastically live with and even celebrate!That is why, unless an actual Maitreya actually reveals himself and demonstrates that he is not merely a false christ who shows great signs and wonders, I will accept Joseph's work as the message from the Spirit of Truth. While there are many claims being made about the existence or the coming of the Christ (AKA the Saoshyant/Avatar/Buddha/Imam Mahdi), Joseph evidently is the person who really serves the Holy One according to prophecy."},{"Title":"The Reappearance of the Christ","review":"If you want to debunk this book, look at Acts 1:9-11. Jesus was talking to his disciples in that passage and was taken up into heaven. Luke uses the phrase, \\"before their very eyes.\\" They were then told, \\"This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.\\" Note the wording, \\"This SAME Jesus\\", and \\"will come back in the SAME way.\\" This book is purposefully deceptive. The religious right may have some political issues to deal with, but scripturally they're correct! This author is deceived and is deceiving others!"},{"Title":"The Reappearance of the Christ","review":"Alice Bailey hit on the nose in every aspect of the reapparance of the Christ. In her book she talks about my bringing forth a new light. She is totally aware that it was my self initiated task and pre-ordained destinty to fulfill this mission.She then goes on to give guidance as to what it is I am to do once here. Among the things I am to do are enlighten people to the new consciousness. Link together world servers who will feed cloth and house my people. I am to outline the new religion. And speak of rebirth.Even the great invocation sums up what it is that I am to do.This is the Great Invocation which has now been fulfilled in me.From the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Hearst of GodLet love streaem forthinto the hearth of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men-The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work outAnd may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.The door where evil dwells is at 666 St Cloud Rd in Belair.That was the door to the home of the Antichrist.On July 4th of 1990 I broke into that door to expose him and claim my rightful title as The Second Coming of Christ.My book Ronald Reagan: Image of the Beast explains it all and Alice Bailey's book confirms all that I say. It both confirms and instigates much of the prophecy.Many people do not understand why I do what I do or how I can even be considered sane. But if you read The Reappearance of the Christ you will see that it all makes sense. Not only that barring another acceptable interpretation of the prophecy. Our combined Interpretation will Triumph.A great combination buy would be Ronald Reagan: Image of the Beast along with Alice Bailey's The Reappearance of the Christ.

Charles Cogin does not really remember life before he was captured but at thirty, he remembers life after that until he is returned to his parents at age 16. Now he does not fit into either world but does his best, betrayed by a peculiar accent developed from picking up a second language when the first was barely learned. When his sister is raped and killed, he quietly saddles a horse to go after the killer, as he would do if he were still with the Apache. Perhaps he has feelings. No one, least of all himself, knows. If he does they are locked so deeply within his soul that he functions on a primal level, barely civil to others, always in survival mode. When Cogin arrives in the dust bitten settlement of Hornbuckle's bar it is not long before people figure out who he is after and jump to the conclusion that there is a big reward on the man's head. Not even the threat of Nino's band deters them from pursuing Cogin and his quarry into Mexico. Quickly only Cogin can function because the others are blinded by greed and oblivious to the dangers from Apache, desert, and Mexican banditos. There is a wealth of detail about stalking and strategy but in the end, many of the bad guys are dead, the killer of Cogin's sister is on his way back to Kansas to stand trial, and emotionless Cogin has begun to discover that there are not only men but also women in the world and that perhaps Big Gert is the only woman in the world who will accept him as he is because she, too, has a story to tell. This is another of Hopson's gutsy tales for true western fans."},{"Title":"The Romans","review":"Why do we remember Rome?. What made it great?. R. H. Barrow answers these questions and many more in a little book of 224 pages, that somehow manages to provide the reader not only a great deal of information but also entertaining reading material.'Romans' isn't a profound study of exactly how Romans contributed to literature, jurisprudence, architecture, or what were the characteristics of their daily life. Notwithstanding that, it allows us to learn a little bit of all that, motivating the reader to go on reading about the diverse subjects.According to Barrow, the Romans built a different kind of Empire, one inspired by a law that they created, and imposed on themselves. The author follows the process from the early days to the fall of the Empire, taking especial care to point out the clash between new and old habits, and how that made an impact on the kind of Empire Rome was. Of course, that is only part of what 'Romans' is about: it also allows you to understand what pietas, humanitas, libertas, mores, auctoritas, fides, severitas, gravitas and constantia meant for the Roman citizen, thus giving you at least a glimpse of his soul.In my opinion, this book is especially noteworthy because it aims to explain what kind of men were behind the greatness of Rome, therefore looking at the issue from the right point of view. History is made by men, and you can only understand it if you at least try to learn what motivated them at a given time. Barrow knew this, and tried to share it with us.

Here is one of my favorite entries: &quot;1873 - Tuesday, Midsummer Day. Walter Brown of the Marsh says that his grandfather once saw some fairies in a hedge. But before he could get down out of the cart they were gone.&quot; Another one of my favorite entries is: &quot;1873 - Wednesday, July 16. As I walked along the field path I stopped to listen to the rustle and solemn night whisper of the wheat, so different to its voice by day. The corn seemed to be praising God and whispering its evening prayer. Across the great level meads near Chippenham came the martial music of a drum and fife bank, and laughing voices of unseen girls were wafted from farms and hayfields out of the wide dusk.&quot; It's too bad that much of Kilvert is out of print. But anyone who appreciates a delightfully written book filled with observations of nature, God, the people of Wales, Welsh customs, etc. will be rewarded if they take the trouble to find one of his books. I sent my copy of Kilvert to my cousin, who lives in Wales and she is hooked."},{"Title":"Zeno's Conscience (Everyman's Library Classics & Contemporary Classics)","review":"This book is so wonderfully inventive and the character of Zeno Cosini so lovably comic, that I often wonder why it's not more widely read and loved. It was first published in Italy as La coscienza di Zeno, and James Joyce, no less, championed its cause and helped the English translation come into being. Still, the English speaking world, for some unknown reason, continues to ignore this wonderful book.The protagonist of the book, Zeno Cosini, is a man at odds with himself. Hilarious odds. He loves analysis, but hates his analyst. He's neurotic to the core, but his desire to rid himself of his neuroses seems to be superseded by his amazing, and very funny, ability to rationalize things away.When Zeno's despised analyst encourages him to keep a journal (write a memoir), Zeno does so even though he is lazy and fools himself into believing exactly what it is he wants to believe. A passionate smoker, who passionately wants to quit (naturally, since this pits him against his own worst enemy, himself), he begins his journal by recounting his various attempts at quitting smoking.For Zeno, the quitting is the thing. He doesn't care how many days he goes without smoking. He doesn't care how many times he's failed in his attempts to quit. What exhilarates him, is the feeling he gets when he smokes, what he tells himself, will be his last cigarette. The problem is, Zeno needs to feel that exhilararion again. And again. And the only way to feel it again, is to quit smoking again, which necessitates taking up smoking yet again. You get my drift.Smoking isn't Zeno's only problem in this book. Far from it. As a man who needs to be perpetually backsliding, Zeno wavers between a law degree versus a chemistry degree, then decides to join his family's business instead. He pines for the beautiful Ada, but marries her homely sister, Augusta, instead, simply to prove to himself that Ada no longer tempts him. Naturally, he proves no such thing.Svevo's writing, at least in this translation from the original Italian is elliptical and convoluted. Zeno will begin a sentence telling us he still loves Ada very much and then end it by saying he feels nothing for her at all. But it's not confusing. Not in the slightest. Zeno's contradictions and Svevo's convolutions make for high hilarity and a comic character that is both lovable and memorable. Italian was Svevo's third language (after the Trieste dialect and German) and some contend that his choppy style is due to this fact. I don't think so. I think he deliberately wrote this way for maximum comic effect. And it works. Beautifully.Zeno Cosini is a liar. He lies both to himself and to others. His lies to his doctors are some of the most hilarious passages in the book. But even though he's a liar, Zeno Cosini is one very wise and wonderful man. By the time World War I is approaching, Zeno is an elderly man who seems to have found the recipe for inner peace and la dolce vita: \\"Sorrow,\\" he says, \\"and love--life, in other words--cannot be considered a sickness because they hurt.\\" Zeno Cosini may have lied to himself about the pain of life, but he never ran away from it. This is definitely a book everyone should read. It's a classic, not only of Italian, but of world, literature."},{"Title":"Zeno's Conscience (Everyman's Library Classics & Contemporary Classics)","review":"Zeno's conscience is best described as the biography of a mollusc, but a very interesting mollusc. It is considered to be one of the first psycho-analytical novels and a classic. It is hilarious and sad at the same time, but above all very well written.Zeno Cosini is a rich man from Trieste, but his wealth is inherited. He himself is not really good in anything, except making up evasions. He is never really capable of making decisions what he wants to do with his life. The book is a description of his life which he has to write as part of his psychotherapy because he wants to quit smoke in which he does not succeed. Every day he decides to quit, but then takes a last cigarette to celebrate his decision. And that is the way his life goes: he falls in love with a daughter of a merchant, but than in the end marries her sister, he start a relationship with a poor girl but does not want to cheat his wife, he works as a volunteer in the merchant business of his brother in law, sees that things go terribly wrong but is too weak to act.And still Zeno is not an annoying man: you can feel his desire to be like the other people, he knows what he is doing and at the end we see that he can act, but only when the stimuli are strong enough. A must."},{"Title":"Zeno's Conscience (Everyman's Library Classics & Contemporary Classics)","review":"This is really a strange book: the characters are not that likable, there is practically no plot, and still it is attractive. This is the story of a man that does nothing in his life, except to procrastinate, cheat and waste his time. But he's not unlikable. I think that, in the end, he's even wise.Zeno Cosini is the heir to a prosperous merchant, and so he has no need to work. He has a bad habit of smoking and he's always trying to quit although in his heart he doesn't really want to. He undertakes therapy to get rid of the habit and his analyst advises him to write down his memoirs, which end up being this book. Zeno tells us about his father's death, the story of his courtship of Ada and his marriage to Ada's ugly (cross-eyed)sister Augusta, a wonderful woman who loves Zeno very much, although he cheats on her constantly. Then we read the story of Zeno's association with Guido, the man Ada finally marries. This is the funniest part of the book.It is funny without being &quot;comical&quot;. Zeno is really a puzzle: sometimes he's despicable, sometimes he's noble and wise. On the whole it is a good novel with a believable story, vivid characters and a sense of humor. But it is strange."},{"Title":"Zeno's Conscience (Everyman's Library Classics & Contemporary Classics)","review":"This is an amazing book.

At my first reading of Zeno, I recall it being funny and insightful, and I recall being taken with the narrator, his awkwardness - his inability to mirror Guido, the handsome, talented and carefree suitor to the woman of his dreams. Of course, I had no one to share my thoughts on the book because no one had ever heard of Italo Svevo which was, and is, a surprise. You pretty much have to stumble upon his work yourself because for the most part I think Zeno won't be taught in classrooms because of his weak moral fiber. He is a cheat, a loser, an attempted murderer, has little will power, is sedentary, rich, and somewhat delusional - not to mention a sexist, though the women seem to be the most steadfast characters throughout the novel, they are men's possessions.Of course we wouldn't have to look far to find canonical characters who have similar characteristics as Zeno(Huck, Holden, Meursault) but Zeno really isn't a bad guy, just given to fits of weakness and unsteady values.The first chapter, \\"Last Cigarette\\" is awesome, and could be read as a short story in itself - and of course, if you have ever tried to quit smoking or ever need another reason not to begin, this chapter is a hoot, and very cleverly written.The book can get a little repetitious at times, and it is not a story of intense action, it is presented by an intensely introspective narrator who is full of contradictions and uncertainty. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read and liked the Catcher in the Rye, The Beautiful Room is Empty, The Great Gatsby, The Stranger, On The Road, or Huck Finn - though by no means is Zeno relational to these other books, they have similar narrators."},{"Title":"Zeno's Conscience (Everyman's Library Classics & Contemporary Classics)","review":"Zeno is the first anti-hero. He is Eliot's Prufrock made novel. Not for him the daring and indeed the taking of the slightest responsibility or risk; and one feels that he also is consoling himself thinking he could have been something hideous.He's not hideous: he's petty, selfish, and he puts himself uwittingly in awkward situations because he lacks the courage to assert himself. But he could say that whit a self like his, there's little to assert. Here's a story of a man you can feel superior of, narrated in a manner profoundly influenced by Freudian theories. But he uses the great intuitions of Freud only to justify his own mediocrity and egocentrism. In a way it's funny, in another slightly annoying. It's a good psychoanalytical novel,though."},{"Title":"Something Nasty in the Woodshed (Charlie Mortdecai Mysteries)","review":"by R.W.FisherDon't be fooled by Kyril Bonfiglioli's light heartednarrative style. This novel is actually a look at betrayed trust in human personal and societal relationships which are examined by neatly and subtly weaving in religion and superstition. An ostensible parody of the English Satanicthriller, SOMETHING NASTY IN THE WOODSHED has an ending more horrible and soul upsetting than any gothic confection. This is a wonderful satire by a person who knows how to use language for maximum humourous effect. One doesn't realize until after a second reading just how deep beneath surface mores Bonfiglioli has gone."},{"Title":"Something Nasty in the Woodshed (Charlie Mortdecai Mysteries)","review":"Why Kyril Bonfiglioli is not regarded as one of our best novelists is unbeleivalbe.I can only put it down to lack of exposure.The man can make you laugh and cry on the same page.I cannot reccomend him highly enough...... Everybody must read the Mordecai books NOW"},{"Title":"Something Nasty in the Woodshed (Charlie Mortdecai Mysteries)","review":"The third book in the Mortdecai trilogy doesn't disappoint. This book captures the originality of the first book and improves on the polish of the second. The book opens with a tour-guide style listing of the surroundings of Mortdecai's current environs (The Islands, The People, The Fauna, The Flora, etc.) before launching into a bizarre tale of rape, mysticism, and, of course, C. Mortdecai's appetites.In these novels, the plot isn't centrally important - it's the journey that counts. The standard cast of characters is here and Charlie seems to have settled into the contentment of married life. As in the first book of the series, the ending sees Bonfiglioli mercilessly hammer his characters and they all sport mental or physical wounds of varying severity. For my taste, this adds to the story with the bittersweet ending giving the characters depth not often seen in a light hearted romp.I wish Bonfiglioli had written much more."},{"Title":"Something Nasty in the Woodshed (Charlie Mortdecai Mysteries)","review":"I love Simon Prebble and only get audio books that are read by him.

I shall purchase a couple more audios for gifts for special friends. English humor at it's most wonderful height."},{"Title":"Something Nasty in the Woodshed (Charlie Mortdecai Mysteries)","review":"Kyril Bonfiglioli knows how to mix a perfect cocktail of a book like no other. While others may sacrifice one quality for the sake of privaledging another, with the result of overwelming dryness or uninspiring wetness (lacrymose), Bonfiglioli knows how to stir up all the ingredients (a nice bit of brutality here, a sardonic observation there, a bit of satire elsewhere, and just a rumor of pathos) with the result of something of overall satisfaction and with the miracle of the individual flavors not being lost. His hero, the Hon. Charlie Mortdecai, I would rank even over the immortal Flashman for candid, rakish charm, and for a easy offhand (and yet pointed) manner of wit that would not have embarrassed you know who."},{"Title":"Something Nasty in the Woodshed (Charlie Mortdecai Mysteries)","review":"Sadly, the third book in the series is the worst. It's still funny as can be, and if anything, some of the witty asides in this book are even more outrageous than the first two (think of the very best stuff written by Doug Kenney in the early days of the National Lampoon). However, Bonfiglioli has decided to make 90% of the book occur on the Isle of Jersey, and that cramps his style quite a bit. The characters are Jersey are more dark than the ones in the first two books, and there is much more of a plot. Unfortunately, that resolution (you could argue the first two books barely resolves their wisps of a plot) felt very forced to me and really detracted from desired effect.Bonfiglioli moved to Jersey during this time, and so maybe that is why he felt he had to base the book there. That choice really narrows the wide range of characters he has to skewer, and circumscribes his plot as well.That said, some of the most outrageous observations in the series are in this book, including a long exposition by a character named Lord Dunromin in the middle of the book that is just priceless for its archness, expression, and sheer political incorrectness.If you've read the first two books, you know you're going to read this one just to tie off the series. There is a fourth book, which Bonfiglioli did not finish before dying. It was finished by a second author. Personally, I think this book is the way I'd like to think about Charlie and my taking leave of him."},{"Title":"Something Nasty in the Woodshed (Charlie Mortdecai Mysteries)","review":"A rather ugly story, with mostly very ugly people.

It was just boring. There were some very witty turns of phrases sprinkled throughout, but they diamonds buried under too many uninteresting ones. Also, the wit often seemed out of place with rape a central theme of the book. However, at the end the author seems to quit trying to be witty and the writing and pace of the book improves tremendously. The ending saved this from being a one-star review."},{"Title":"Something Nasty in the Woodshed (Charlie Mortdecai Mysteries)","review":"Because of Leo Carey's wry, admiring, melancholy essay in THE NEW YORKER, I grabbed this novel and its two prequels when I found them at a local used bookstore, and oh, how I wanted to like them more than I ended up doing. But they're just not as good as the hype. They drift all over the place [to be fair, Carey admitted that devotees of mysteries would find these books too undisciplined], and the narrator's aggressively amoral personality -- imagine P. G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster crossed with Jonathan Gash's Lovejoy -- can wear on one after a while. The plots are made of Swiss cheese, at best, and these books are also sadly dated in their views of women. Maybe it's because I read the Lovejoy books before these -- if I had come to them without knowing about Lovejoy, I would have enjoyed them more."},{"Title":"Something Nasty in the Woodshed (Charlie Mortdecai Mysteries)","review":"Like reviewer Bernstein below, I really wanted to fall in love with this book and others by Bonfiglioli.I heard his prose compared favorably with Wodehouse and imagined twisted plots, rapier wit, deft turns of phrase...in short, I got a bit goosebumpy. When I got my hands on this book, I jumped into the \\"comfy armchair\\" with a cup of coffee and orders for everyone around me to be quiet, and looked forward to a few hours of blissful bookish abandon.After the first chapter or so, I put those expectations aside, and simply hoped for a good read, but the book was not to my taste. The characters did not engage, the plot did not grip...the writing did not...well, it just didn't.I felt as though I were looking at one of those awful \\"3-D\\" pictures from the 1990's, and everyone could see the invisible dancing dolphins depicted in the swirling blue-green miasma but me.

The spots that are mentioned for meeting people, first dates, and romantic dates are very helpful...but require a little more explanation in some circumstances. For example, a cheap date suggestion is the Taco Surf in Seal Beach which is kind of a dump but allows a couple to walk around the quaint little town after the meal. But the Taco Surf chain is not really a place I'd go for any kind of date.But overall, I'd recommend this book to any Orange County person who wants to diversify themselves around the area with a chance to meet a wide variety of love prospects.

You'll probably get Old MacDonald crammed onto 1/4 of a single page, with little or no illustration. You almost need a magnifying lens to see what's going on.

These books vary enormously, from the arcane at one end to popular overviews at the other. This is an intelligent and well-written book that can be read for pleasure and intellectual stimulation by a scientist as well as the educated non-scientists interested in learning what one prominent neuroscientist has to say about the age-old question about the relationship between the mind and the brain.One novel idea that Fuster has is of the \\"Cognit:\\" a generic term for any representation of knowledge in the cerebral cortex. As he says, \\"A cognit is an item of knowledge about the world, the self, or the relations between them. Its network structure is made up of elementary representations of perception or action that have been associated with one another by learning or past experience.\\"But it by no means his only novel idea: the book is full of insights by a prominent scientist who has thought deeply about the fabric of Cognition.The book follows a logical structure and is broken down into eight chapters and an interesting though not totally convincing Epilogue about consciousness:1.

This book is excellent and really helped me understand how the cortex operates. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cortex and Mind: Unifying Cognition","review":"A very insightful book that clearly describes how the reciprocal connections between perception and action form the basis of cognition.

Having been to England but always having missed this area, I am so pleased to have this book. The scenes are gorgeous. The photography is true art, just beautiful."},{"Title":"Gemstone Journeys","review":"Finally, a book on gemstones and healing that goes beyond mere descriptions and remedies. This book has the most vivid and clear photography I've ever seen on crystals. In addition to that, Dr. Shelley Kaehr does a remarkable job in sharing with the reader her &quot;experience&quot; of working with these gems of Mother Gaia. This is not another clinical treatise on the subject, Dr. Kaehr strikes gold again with another excellent adventure!"},{"Title":"Gemstone Journeys","review":"This is just a great book! Many stones are listed and the pictures are great, very clear. When you go to purchase a stone, bring this book with you for easy reference. The text is interesting, never boring. Goes a little beyond the basics, but not too wordy. Dr. Kaehr discusses how and why gem healing works. Also, there are chapters on selecting stones, cleaning them, making elixirs (easier than I thought!),and how to use them for healing purposes. Speaking from experience, you can carry a stone in your pocket or put one under your pillow. Just go by the guidelines in this book and see for yourself how well stones can work for you. It's amazing!A great gift. I'm giving this book and a stone to all my friends for their birthdays this year. It's only Januaury and I've given 6. All have loved receiving it and I feel very good giving it!"},{"Title":"Gemstone Journeys","review":"Anyone interested in the effects of gemstones on their own (or others') energy levels will find this a good place to start.

It has good information for the beginner and the advance believers."},{"Title":"Solitaire and Brahms","review":"Sarah Dreher, best known as the author of the seven volume Stoner McTavish mystery series, has broadened her horizons with Solitaire and Brahms,an insightful and tender novel about a woman recognizing the freedoms and fears associated with self-discovery. Dreher's main character, Shelby Camden, is a complex, witty, kind career woman who maintains the strong facade of happiness in spite of her nagging depression, migraine-like headaches, and an unfullfilling engagement to the man of her mother's dreams. Set in the sixties during the dawn of the sexual revolution and women's movement, this work portrays the pre-Stonewall mentality of the country, a time when being lesbian meant certain ostracism, self-hatred, and often psychiatric intervention. Camden is a young woman, not terribly brave, caught between her desire for a conventional life and her deeper yearnings for a career as a magazine editor and a blossoming friendship with a warm easy-going, but rather secretive woman we discover is lesbian. &quot;The Childrens Hour&quot; is playing it's first run at the local theater and as readers we are immersed in the thinking that prevailed at the time when loving another woman meant very unhappy endings. Dreher's prose is engaging, never overwritten, often humorous. Her work as a clinical psychologist comes in handy, as well as her playwriting skills. The dialogue is fast paced, never trite, and captures the heart. Highly recommended reading for all who love a good character study, a brilliant depiction of a time in our history, and simply a beautifully composed story. She takes us on a journey through darker days but remembers to leave a light on at the end of the tunnel."},{"Title":"Solitaire and Brahms","review":"Bravo, Sarah Dreher. In these post-Sonewall, post-feminist movement days, it's been easy to forget just HOW it was. Yes, we were committed to mental hospitals or somebody in the family tried to have us committed; yes, we were fired from jobs and evicted from apartments; yes, our friends, once told, were no longer friends and, YES, good old Mom and Dad not only had the proverbial cow; they killed it too. (Figuratively, of course, by banning us from the bosom of the family so others wouldn't catch &quot;it&quot;.) Yes, we blamed ourselves for our lesbianism and KNEW everything would be okay if we could just get rid of this blasted disease. Unfortunately, for most of us - despite the marriages and children and shock therapy, etc., recommended by the shrinks and/or family to get us over this stage - nothing worked. We stayed gay and learned to live with it for better or for worse. I've got a hunch your wonderful charcters in &quot;Solitaire and Brahms&quot;, Shelby and Fran, learned to live with it for the better. What a great ending! And now, as I look back to then from the pages of your excellent book and remember how it was, I'm glad nothing worked, glad I'm a dyke and VERY glad I survived those years. A must-read for those who lived how it was, or those up-coming youngsters who would like to know how it was."},{"Title":"Solitaire and Brahms","review":"Oh, yes, for those of us old enough to remember, this is a searing book! If you can't remember, you might want to be real glad. It captures exactly the feelings and ambiance of the late 50s and early 60s. This was NOT a time to be a lesbian, even for those of us who could be nothing else, and who went ahead and got married anyway."},{"Title":"Solitaire and Brahms","review":"I really loved this book. I read it twice and I NEVER read fiction twice. I actually want to read it again, just to relive and feel the geniune love (without all the hangups or gender identity issues) growing between Fran and Shelby. The thing I enjoyed most about this book was that it, unlike the majority of books in this genre, was free of the common lesbian sterotypes. It was a genuine love story. It wasn't a story about girl meets girl at bar, girl sleeps with girl afterwards, girls thinks she's in love with bar girl. (rolleyes) It also wasn't a story about promiscuity and superficial relationships between women. Nor was it a story of a relationship based on possessiveness, dependency, or insecurity.Shelby Camden is an educated, unmarried young women, who is trying to make it as an editor. She behaves how she thinks she is supposed to behave and does a lot of people pleasing and yet is so unhappy. She meets her new neighbor, Fran Jarvis, and a ray of sunshine suddenly enters her life. She loves spending time with her new friend, and feels as though she can just BE HERSELF around Fran. This is freedom for Shelby. She's light, happy, and carefree. When she is in the company of people and situations where she doesn't feel free to simply be who she is, and feels she has to present a certain image, her health suddenly is compromised. As the book progresses Shelby is able to take a good look at herself and her life and realize what/who she wants in it, and what/who she no longer wants in it. She toughens her backbone and stands up for herself and courageously goes after want will make her happy and lets go of all that will not. Cheers Shelby!This novel gives and insightful look on how it was to be a lesbian or show any romantic attraction for another women at that time. The novel describes how social attitudes affected those with 'lesbian tendencies' psycholigcally, socially, and otherwise.Fran was a woman who knew that she preferred other women romantically. She knew who she was and did her best to be happy and deal with the world around her who didn't approve of who she was. Shelby did was she thought she was supposed to do. She didn't categorize her sexual orientation. Real Love came to her and she welcomed it. Even after, she didn't feel the need to define who she was. In the end, this is a story about two people who fell in love with each other. No classifications needed.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Solitaire and Brahms","review":"Having only read Deher's Stoner McTavish Series, which I enjyoyed immensely, I thoroughly enjoyed the poignant story of Shelby and Fran. Not having experienced lesbian life before Stonewall, I found it a valuable slice of history as well as a really good story. I look forward to more of Deher's work."},{"Title":"Solitaire and Brahms","review":"When I first started reading lesbian fiction this was one of the first books I read. It was sweet and had an &quot;innocent&quot; view of how some people find out who they are. The harsh realities of the time period were initially shocking to me, helped me understand alot about history that isn't in books. Suicide attempts are often part of anybody who isn't &quot;normal&quot; and parents need to realize that especially. The fear of rejection is very real especially when you decide to date or try to find somebody to date."},{"Title":"Media Studies: A Reader - 2nd Edition","review":"This is a well chosen and very well edited selection. It gives short 4-5 page samples of some of the most valuable things that have been written on media in the past fifty years. Compared to its 1997 predecessor, the 2000 American edition tones down the focus on British media, and includes new excerpts by Fairclough, Radway and a whole new section on 'New Media'. The emphasis in the new volume is on the present rather than on the history of media studies. The bad news is that things had to be cut to make space for the new material. Too bad that two illuminating pieces by Judith Williamson (from Decoding Advertisements) and Alan Tomlinson (from Consumption, Identity, and Style) were left out."},{"Title":"Celtic Borders Laser-Cut Plastic Stencils","review":"These stencils are perfectly cut from heavy flexible vinyl.

I'd been looking for information about how to research, find, and obtain long-term care. This book answered 99% of my questions. The only variable was how plans differ from state to state. Premiums may be deductible from state taxes in some cases.Long-term care makes sense if you want to avoid nursing homes or need help paying for it or care at home. Our goal was to protect our assets as much as possible so we used this book to see whether it made sense for us financially. Not everyone needs or can benefit from long-term care. But we are in an income group that might be able to save money and make the most of our assets by taking advantage of it.This book will help you evaluate whether you need this insurance, how to tie it in with home care, decide whether a nursing home is acceptable (my spouse says yes, I say no) and factor in Medicare and Medicaid. I'd suggest sharing this with your adult children as well so they can understand how you plan to use this insurance when the time comes.Of course, long-term insurance doesn't have an extremely long history so you'll want to take that into account. If possible, talk to friends and family members who are using their policies and figure out how much it covers. You may still have to chip in a fair amount - but far less than you might otherwise.One of the major assets of this book is that it is both detailed and reader friendly. You won't feel over your head when browsing through it."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"This book covers all the options on long-term care, everything from home care assistance to nursing facilities and all of the hybrid combinations in-between. This answers the questions for those who's planning needs don't quite fit in one or the other, but rather using a mix of options. This book includes tips that set it apart from a plain reference book. For example on page 207, Paying Family Caregivers: \\"Family members do most of the work for people who are cared for home, even if there is also paid home care help. If you find yourself needing paid help and would like to qualify for Medicaid but have slightly too much income or assets, paying one of your family members who regularly takes care of you might accomplish two useful things at once. First, the family member gets paid for something he or she would otherwise do for free. And the amount you pay that family caregiver might drop you below the income or asset qualifying levels for Medicaid coverage of home care, meaning that you could get Medicaid to pay for additional home care help.\\" This book is filled with countless pieces of wisdom, and is a must-have for anyone who likes to have a little planning security in advance, or for the children of aging parents, or anyone curious how the various long-term programs work."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"If you're a senior in good health or you're handling an elderly family member's affairs, you probably have hardly given a second look at the handbook mailed by Medicare or the Summary of Benefits pamphlets sent by your HMO. Most of the time, it is when you or the elderly loved one needs medical services and long-term care that you find yourself forced to get rapidly acquainted with what is covered, the cost involved, the options available and the myriad rules you'll need to navigate to get the care appropriate to you or your loved one. Long-term care is a subject that many would prefer to keep out of mind and only a few actually plan for it in advance.Whether you have an immediate need for information or whether you're just educating yourself on the subject of long-term care, Joseph L. Matthews' \\"Long Term-Care: How to Plan & Pay for It,\\" should be included in your must-read list. Mr. Matthews have written a comprehensive guide that describes the different care options available such as adult day care, assisted living, hospice care, etc.; the level of care each provides, their advantages and disadvantages, their costs and whether government programs would pay for them. The author also dedicates individual chapters to Medicare, Medicaid and long-term care insurance (LTCI) and explains how each may impact your finances. In the final two chapters of the book, he gives advice on elder fraud and on the preparation of health care directives and powers of attorney.At the time I got this book, I was looking into long-term care insurance policies and needed a resource that would provide me with an unbiased look at LTCI since most of the reading material I had came from the insurance companies themselves. I found Mr. Matthews' chapter on LTCI very educational and helpful, especially on what to look for when shopping for policies. Reading this book not only has increased my understanding on the different types of long-term care, but also has opened my eyes as to how Medicare, Medicaid and LTCI work. I feel that Mr. Matthews has saved me a lot of research time by bringing all these different aspects about long-term care into one volume. This is definitely one book anybody who needs to or will need to look into long-term care should have on his/her reference shelf."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"OK, yes, the topic is depressing. And yes, it IS a legal book, so can only be read about one chapter at a time without feeling sleepy. Even so, this is stuff we all need to know eventually, and it's best learned while you are still young enough to have options.I was very impressed by the accuracy and thoroughness of this book. I wanted it to cover long-term care insurance, and whether I should buy some. It does that, well, but also does much more, providing a wealth of information about nursing home selection, home care options, senior communities, assisted living, and hospice options. There is also info about related issues like living wills, durable powers of attorney, and warnings about all the ways bad folks try to separate seniors from their money.My first shock was learning that even if I get a fancy long-term care insurance policy, it may not cover the kind of care I'd want (senior residence or assisted living.)My second shock was how hard it is to get a policy that actually protects you better than just investing the same money. Too often, by the time you actually need such a policy, either it is no longer sufficient for the need, or got too costly so had to be cancelled.Although I hope I'm still decades from needing any such care, I will be keeping this book handy, so as to make the right decisions now for our future needs."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"This is perhaps the most practically useful Nolo product I have ever read. Elder law can be a confusing and overwhelming subject even for an attorney. For a grown child seeking help for an elder parent, it becomes frustrating and impossible. Especially when the parent is incapacitated or is becoming incapacitated and has not made prior arrangements.The book provides a comprehensive overview of possible senior living arrangements, what arrangement is appropriate for whom, and how to pay for them, with notes on exactly where to go to find more detailed information. For me, this was really useful, because I was able to determine relatively quickly what material I could skim or skip as inapplicable. Medicare, Medicaid, and VA benefits are explained in short, easy to understand sentences with no terms of art or dependent clauses to navigate.Everyone of a certain age who has one or both parents still alive should have a copy of this book. It will help you now (or soon), and it will help your own kids later on."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"What a timely and clearly written book for me, as my parents are needing care. Written by a trusted source.I'm simply a novice when it comes to the issue of long term care for my parents. Nursing facilities, hospice care, medicaid, medicare-- all new terms to me. What I needed is a clearly written book to explain the implications of these, and this book will serve as an excellent foundation guide and reference source.Easy reading font, clarity in writing, and providing the basics and cautions so that I can do further research to make decisions. I won't know for sometime how effective the advice is, but coming from Nolo, this is a good start."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"If you are facing the overwhelming reality that a loved one may need long term care and have not been able to get the answers you need to the endless list of questions you have, this book will surely be of great use. I don't think they left any stone unturned this book covers everything from finding proper health care, paying for it before or after it's needed, legalities, available services, particulars on alzheimers, hospice, medicare and medicaid, veterans, fraud, insurance issues and many more topics of interest regarding long term needs. As always NOLO books cover everything you need to know and this book is a must have regarding this subject nobody wants to face but most of us will have to some day. If you have questions this book will have the answers. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"We recently a senior in our family who is has recently presented a number of elder care issues. We had any number of conversations: Should she move in with a family member? Into an assisted living facility? What help is available? How do we respect her independence and still protect her from other people who might want to take advantage of her.As with all Nolo publications, this one is excellent. It packs a lot of detail, so it can be dense in parts, but if you work through it, you will get a solid grounding in many challenging areas of elder care, including:- Ways of providing in-home care, including in-home nursing, respite care, family care, etc.;- How to evaluate (and pay for) nursing homes;- Caring for seniors with Alzheimer's disease;- Medicare, Medicaid, and long-term care insurance;- Protecting yourself or your loved ones from elder fraud.If you are consulting with an elder care lawyer, this book will ground you in the basics and save time. If you are going it alone, something like this is even more essential. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"This was a timely book for me. My sister and I just put our parents (one Alzheimer's and the other just had a stroke which has induced dementia) into a memory care unit. It is exceptionally costly. We went through this book before and it did help with some areas - like learning more about the types of options available to us but for others it didn't tell us anything we did not know by just doing some web research and using the Medicare site.So for helping out with my parents who are now in a nursing home - it would really get lower stars. The reason for the 4 stars is that this is really more helpful for me (I'm in my 40's) as it gave great overview's of what I can expect, what my options are, what timetables I would be looking at, the benefits of long term care insurance and all that.Warning: It is not exciting reading. In fact for me I almost dreaded reading it. Heck I don't want to think about when I'm in my 70's or 80's! Taken in small doses it is palatable and if you read it as information only and stop thinking all about horrible potential scenarios (\\"will someone have to change my diapers?\\") it does what it sets out to do.My advice, such as it is, is to get this book when you don't yet need it. Start early, plan well, and hopefully that will lead to being prepared later. I obviously cannot confirm that - but this is the type of book it would have been helpful to have 5 or 6 years ago before my parents needed care and could participate in some of their own decision making."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"I've become a big fan of Nolo's line of \\"How to books\\". I've been using them mostly for estate planning where they have been a invaluable resource.I never really considered long-term care until my work place starting offering long term care insurance. Unlike regular health insurance where I feel like I have a good understanding of the pros and cons of various options, LTC was something I knew nothing about. Enter this book by Nolo. It does a great job of succinctly covering what you need to know to plan for long term care, and more importantly, shed a lot of light on what it's going to take to get good long term care. Those to area are separate but equally important: depending on how far out you are your LTC needs are, what you desired level of amenities is, and how are you going to pay for what you need and more elusively, want.I'm young enough that this is mostly academic. It helped my evaluate the LTC insurance offered by my employer, and it help me review my 401K with an eye on how far it would get me if I ever needed LTC. After running through a number of scenarios and ended up signing up for a mid-tier LTC insurance plan that helped fill a gap in my \\"worst case\\" scenario. And for me that was about it.After reading it I can see it having a lot more value for someone who may be actively looking for LTC for a parent or spouse. There are so many question and topics to cover there's no way this book could answer them all, but it does a good job of raising the most important issues and gives you a lot of guidance on where to seek more answers. The phone numbers in the back for things like legal aid, state-by-state elder care agencies, and home care, look like they would be a great help, especially for someone older who wasn't as comfortable searching around on the internet.Overall a very readable survey that easily worth the price. Could you figure this all out on your own? Sure, this is the internet age. But even if you only skimmed it I think you would learn enough to feel like it was $20 well spent."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"As my parents grow old and become frail I've been thinking about their long-term care, especially because they are not the planning type themselves so as their only living child I have to do everything for them, which of course makes my life harder as I have my own life to live and why is it I have to shoulder all these responsibilities? Of course I know if I don't find suitable long-term care for them, eventually they'll come to me for financial support whic of course won't be an ideal situation, as I don't have much money myself and soon I'll grow old and need to think about LTC for myself!Anyway, I find Nolo's guide to LTC comprehensive. It's nice they cover the different options, especially for low-income, zero-wealth families. Some of the explanation is a little confusing, such as how Medicaid exactly pays for LTC or what the proper procedure is, but I'm really glad I got this book because it'll serve as a good guide to my own arduous search that's coming up.If you need to pan for LTC for yourself or your loved ones, I highly recommend this book. It shows the way."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"As we get old, we start worrying about certain things, including how to cope with failing health and ability to function independently. If you or a loved one is looking for a comprehensive guide on how to get elders the best appropriate care for what they can afford at a certain stage in their life (e.g., coping with physical impairments, onset of serious ailment, or last few months of life), this book is certainly one of them.According to the author: \\"Until recently, older Americans and their families had few choices for elder care. The options were either family care at home or residence in a nursing facility or 'rest home.' Family care often placed an overwhelming burden on adult children and grandchildren and seriously strained family relations. Care in a nursing facility, on the other hand, often created guilty feeling, drained family finances, and restricted the elder's comfort and independence.\\" (page 31)Fortunately, the options available for elder care have increased in recent years, ranging from hiring home care aides to assist with personal hygiene, dressing, or other physical and non-medical tasks; to occasional visits from nurses to give injections or take blood samples; to assisted living arrangements for more extended care; and finally, for more serious conditions, round the clock nursing care facilities or hospice care.This guide discusses several options in detail, comparing costs and benefits, and what assistance (e.g., financial, or information on care standards or facility certifications, etc.) you might be able to get from programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, etc.The maze of options, eligibility requirements for financial assistance, hidden pitfalls, and ways you can prepare for various things can be difficult to navigate if you don't know what questions to ask whom. This guide gives you a reasonably good roadmap to help you get started, and also provides special information on how elders can avoid becoming targets of fraud, as well as how to address the special needs of veterans and elders with Alzheimer's."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"The timing of this book couldn't have been better since I have been helping my parents navigate through the maze of retirement communities and extended care options. Although they had planned to remain in their current house for the rest of their lives (and still may do so), circumstances change, as this book points out from the beginning. This comprehensive guide walks readers through the sometimes confusing array of options and the advantages/disadvantages of each. The chapters range from advice if you plan to remain in your house to finding residential care for Alzheimer's patients, from what to look for in extended care retirement communities to the details of hospice care. It also includes sections on Medicare and veteran benefits, Medicaid and nursing care, and how to protect you or your loved ones from elder fraud.This book can be overwhelming with its details, whether you are urgently seeking assistance or are just planning for the future. I recommend that readers take it in bit-by-bit to avoid frustration, especially since the subject itself is an emotional one. The information it gives is invaluable; however, it cannot substitute for actually visiting facilities to gauge their care, cost, and the intangible \\"feel\\" of a place.I expect to return to certain chapters as my parents continue their search and even after that, when we face new challenges as they age and as new challenges arise.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"Long Term Care can be difficult to plan by yourself.

That is not the case with this book. This is the Eighth Edition of their book on Long-Term Care, so the information is up-do-date in an area which changes often. The book's author, attorney Joseph L.

This knowledge is shared with you throughout the book.Long-term care is a very complex field and a book like this is absolutely necessary for anyone who does not work directly in the industry. It will not make you an expert, but it will provide you with the important details concerning how to buy these policies, what to look for, how to review the companies which offer the policies, and how to make sure the person selling you the policy is telling you the truth.

My understanding of Nolo is that they are a legal organization dedicated to providing details about complex legal issues in laymen's terms. They are, in my experience, thorough, smart and well organized. It doesn't matter what you do or don't know when you open a NOLO book, you're pretty likely to find out everything you need to know and then some.This book is about Long Term Care, which is a misunderstood and often maligned product that is absolutely essential in a financial plan. If you can obtain LTC insurance, you should. If you don't, by the time you need it, you won't be able to get it. Many people believe long term care is covered by someone (though they're not sure who) and although Social Security has a long term care component, you have to be pretty far gone to get the benefit and the monthly allowance is than would be required in most cases for a day or two. This is important. If you are considering purchasing LTC insurance, this book is a good guide. If you have a parent who has assets and you are concerned if they get sick about protecting those assets, there is guidance here too. With the baby boomers growing older, LTC coverage is going to be of increasing importance and this book is an excellent guide.Whether you are reading it for general information (I am a financial planner looking to learn more to help my clients) or as a reference, you will be able to easily find answers to your questions and questions you should be asking.Last, in closing, there are a number of legislative changes that are up and coming based on the Affordable Health Care Act. The details are not in this book (which was published before the Act was created). Please use this book and double check the key facts in case there are relevant changes to the laws. I'm certain an update will be forthcoming from NOLO press. This review is based upon the 8th edition which was published in November 2010. You may wish to see if there is a more recent edition that addresses the legislative changes."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"This book is an excellent guide to long-term care. Matthews, a lawyer with specific interests in elders and pensions, has written several other Nolo guides. This book covers the following topics: home care, senior residences, nursing homes, care for Alzheimer's patients, hospice care, Medicare and veterans' benefits, Medicaid, long-term care insurance, advance directives and financial guardians, and elder fraud. End material includes contact information for state agencies on aging, Alzheimer's support organizations, directories for home care and senior residences, hospice organizations, and many other relevant offices and organizations.This book provides an exceptionally clear guide to living and health care options for seniors. Matthews clearly describes the many different levels of care that are possible, discusses advantages and limitations for each, and provides lists of questions to ask when choosing providers. He also compares costs and quality of care, and explains whether insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance) would cover some or all of the costs. His chapters on Medicare, Medicaid, and long-term care insurance are particularly useful, since they explain the current government policies for paying for long-term care and eligibility for Medicaid, as well as who is in most need of private long-term care policies. This is an essential reference for anyone entering their senior years, anyone with parents who may be in need of long-term care at some point in the future, as well as those who are currently facing decisions about long-term care options."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"Whether for oneself or loved ones, the problem of being cared for in old age looms large. This book gives a good introduction to all the major alternatives, from at home care to senior centers to nursing facilities. I found this book good as an introductory guide but not as a comprehensive guide.At its best, Long-Term Care gives the initiate a summary of options within the major categories such as home care, senior living, nursing homes, and hospice. I don't think this is a sufficiently comprehensive guide to serve all our information needs for several reasons.Information that I feel could have added a critical perspective was often lacking. For example, the problems with getting medical care under the Medicaid program were in my view understated. Another area that was understated had to do with the problems associated with the long-term care insurance industry. While space was devoted to the issue of denial of coverage under long-term care policies, there weren't nearly enough examples provided. Also, nothing was said about the counterparty risk, namely that those insurance companies might not be solvent when the insured needs long-term care.I recommend this book to anyone seeking introductory information with the caveat that additional and more critical information will at some point be required."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"If you need legal knowledge, and can find a Nolo Press book that covers the topic, just buy it. You won't go wrong. This book is no exception.An elderly family member is facing choices about whether to enter long term care. We needed to know all the ins and outs of various options, including Medicaid, Medicare, and veterans benefits. This book covers everthing of importance in clear, concise text.One problem in a situation like this is that the \\"experts\\", like the case managers and social workers at hospitals and nursing homes, seldom have the time or incentive to tell you the whole story. It's up to you to figure out what your options are, and what protections you have. This book covers all of the bases in clear, understandable language.Important note: several laws and regulations regarding transfer of assets and Medicaid/MediCal coverage eligability changed in early 2006. Make sure you understand the current laws. This book was published in late 2006 and is very up-to-date.Like I said, another winner from Nolo."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"I am in the middle of dealing with a failing parent. I have consulted with all the recommended experts (accountants, multiple attorneys, social workers, private care managers, all the medical people). This book lays out clearly and very helpfully what I had hoped all the attorneys would've, but didn't. This book gives you the information you need to make your own decisions, rather than relying the 'experts' to decide for you. Worth every penny and the time taken to read it."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"I really thought this book would help explore options for long-term care. Nolo books are usually \\"dummies guide\\"-style books, written as an introduction to a topic.I was somewhat surprised to discover this book had nearly no information whatsoever about how to locate an affordable long-term care facility (assisted living, retirement home, live-in nurse, etc). Instead, most of the book focuses on issues like senior health insurance, medicare, reverse mortgages, supplemental insurance, how to decipher a nursing home contract, etc.My approach to all decisions in life (including health care, long-term care, etc) is this: determine the need, then determine the best way to go about it (meaning, highest quality, most cost efficient, etc).So when my maternal grandparents were thinking about assisted living, they looked at the high rates and the small room sizes, and hated it. So we all sat down and determined the real *needs* (this process took several weeks): i.e., help with a few meals each week, help with laundry, help getting up & down the stairs, etc.Once the needs were clearly identified, we took ALL the pre-conceived notions OFF the table (nursing home, assisted living, etc), and started with a completely blank sheet. We determined their needs would be met by staying in their current home but adding (A) a chair lift, (B) a certified nurse to check in once a week (cost of $20 per visit), & (C) hiring part-time help with food and laundry (found on craigslist, cost of $40 per week). All their medical & living were solved with super-affordable methods (MUCH much cheaper than assisted living), AND they are super happy!This book did not help one iota in our creative problem-solving process. That's not to say it's not useful - I've found that most Nolo books (I've read 5 or 6) contain very common, watered-down advice (do NOT expect creative problem-solving), and most of it is just reprinted from other sources. (For example, the Medicare sections seem like they're just cut & pasted from Medicare literature &/or the Medicare web site). And, if you read literature like the AARP newsletter or Prevention magazine, or if you listen to talk radio like Bruce Williams or Clark Howard, then nothing here will be new to you.I know some people here go nuts over these Nolo books, and if you have absolutely no idea where to start with a subject, then you will definitely benefit from it! But as I said, if you are well read, can browse the internet, are familiar with the Medicare web site, then this will be redundant information for you & you should probably look for something more specific to your needs."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"I am a senior citizen. That's the age you might think this book should be read. I wish everyone would read it by the time they are 30 years old, start doing research for their future, and, can understand why they need to begin a savings account for thier future.I had no idea what a CCRC was before I purchased this book. I now live in one, and, believe that I am extremely lucky to be here. There is so much helpful information in this book. Everyone would benefit from it."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"I have quite a few Nolo books and as always, this one covers all aspects of its topic. Whether we like to think about it or not, we're all going to grow old (hopefully) and will at some point require assistance in our daily living. This book covers every aspect imaginable of how to plan for and pay for long term care. I can not think of anyone who would not benefit from reading this book because preparation for old age is something that one needs to begin planning about at a young age. Even people in their twenties should begin to make preparations for this imminent stage their life.Nolo, delves into just about every situation possible. I thought I knew quite a bit about this topic, but Nolo has taught me things I never knew or even imagined. So I would advise any adult to read, or at least browse through this book. I am very glad I read this book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"I never really thought much about long term care until the need arose with my parents a couple of years ago. What this pointed out to me is that it is never to early to be thinking about the subject; if you are still on the young side you never know when an older loved one may have a need for this, and as you get older, it is wise to be prepared for taking care of yourself and your spouse before it is too late and you don't have as many options, or you are rushed and aren't able to properly evaluate alternatives in order to make wise decisions.As with all Nolo books I have read, this is an excellent source of information for pretty much all aspects of long term care. The chapter dealing with making a decision to buy a long term care policy was of particular interest to me. I currently have a policy but this book has a great deal more information than what I considered when buying the policy in terms of statistics, what to look for, etc., and thus now I am in the process of evaluating my policy based on what is in this book to determine if it is really worthwhile to continue.The rest of the chapters are equally as helpful. They contain a wealth of information, conveniently located all in one place that answers a lot of the questions normally brought up, and also brings up a lot of points that most of us probably never think about but that we ought to think about when making important decisions about long term care.It seems to me that this book is well worth the money. It provides valuable information, is written from an unbiased standpoint (as opposed to hearing the pros and cons from someone who has a vested interest in your making a decision a certain way) and it is so convenient to have everything in one reference work. Studying this book now can result in huge savings of time and money in the future."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"Reviews an important but neglected topic. People usually wait until it's too late to plan for this possibility. Long term care insurance is expensive. Medicaid requires asset depletion over a certain time frame. It's a potential minefield. If you have no assets, the government will take care of you. If you are very wealthy, you can afford long term care insurance or pay for this potentiality out of pocket. If you are in between these two extremes, you should read this book."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"No one likes to plan for the end of his life, and a surprising number of people refuse to plan for all contigencies--most notably, what will happen if you have to be put in a long-term care facility. Every year, these policies get more expensive and restrictive, because the cost of the facilities go up, and it's not uncommon for people to simply ignore the realities, and necessity, of making those decisions ... until it's too late.In a recent instance I'm aware of, a friend of mine saw her grandfather put into a facility. He was suffering from dementia and unable to live at his with his wife, who like him was well advanced in years (both are 90).They did not have a long term care plan, and like many people, probably felt their safety net was Medicaid. Unfortunately, in order for the U.S. government to cover the cost, they require you to liquidate your assets to cover expenses after an initial stay, which means that you'll have no estate--they had hoped to leave their estate to their children and grandchildren. Now, they cannot.The time to do this kind of planning is WELL before you need a policy, if you want to avoid the financial and emotional churn that will result when you're faced with putting a parent into a facility--and they have not made any plans whatsoever.This book is a clear, concise, and authoritative roadmap on what you need to know about long-term care. If you're a baby boomer and have parents, or in your fifties/early sixties and want to plan for the future, the small price you pay for this book will pay dividends. Knowing what to do and knowing what your options are will make a tremendous difference down the road, when at the end of your parents' lives, or your own, hard decisions have to be made.YOU should make the decisions--not the circumstances--and Nolo Press's books are a great place to start. (I've built my own personal library of Nolo Press titles.)For non-lawyers--in other words, most of us--Nolo Press demystifies legal matters and makes complicated concepts easy to understand.Obviously, as Nolo Press points out, for your specific situation, be sure to get a competent lawyer for end-of-life planning. (Shop around--you'd be surprised how prices vary for services!)Bottom line: Plan for the last chapter in your life, and make sure YOU are the author and not the government."},{"Title":"Choose the Right Long-Term Care: Home Care, Assisted Living & Nursing Homes","review":"Long-Term Care: How to Plan & Pay for It offers keys to choosing the right long-term care plan to protect assets.

It had detailed information on the different types of care one might need either in case of a premature disability or as one aged and becomes less self sufficient. One drawback of the book is that it did go in to great detail on the types of care people might need and the costs, which would be more for someone needing care in the near term having to make immediate decisions. That level of detail was a bit incongruent with the title of how to plan and pay for long term care. I was expecting more on the financial side of things since no one can really plan at a detailed level what help you might need exactly ten or twenty years down the line. However, that is my only complaint. The financial aspects were included and were well researched. I just wish the book had a higher percentage of content on the financial issues surrounding long term care.The best part of the book is that it is a bit of an antidote to all of the marketing ads for long term care insurance, which is very pricey. The author included lots of stats on the odds of needing long term care and the probably lengths of stays. That is good information to have to compare to against the high price of LTC policies.In order to really plan for long term care in detail, you'd still probably have to go to an elder care attorney and/or do online research as laws regarding Medicaid vary from state to state. That makes it impossible for a book like this to go into specific details for each state. However, I think this book would be a good initial primer on the subject for anyone with an interest in planning ahead for possibly needing long term care."},{"Title":"The Secret House: The Extraordinary Science of an Ordinary Day","review":"This is a republication of the book which was written in 1985. It's a very interesting read, but some of the material has probably surfaced elsewhere in the intervening period. It could use an index for future reference, and is missing the some 80 photographs found in the hardback. There are obvious typos in some places, probably because of editing to get the book into paperback form. I'd really suggest buying a used copy of the original, which I would give a 5 star rating to. The photos help a great deal to add to the text."},{"Title":"The Secret House: The Extraordinary Science of an Ordinary Day","review":"The things that happen around us every day are very easy to miss unless a time comes when one reaches for a book such as this one.People think that if it's not in their face, then it doesn't exist, but this book tells you like it is!It follows an average household in two major sections Day and Night;Then breaks activities into- morning, midday, afternoon,then : early evening, dinner continues, Bed & bath.The writing is humorous at times, scientifically proven, accurate and most of all, very interesting and not hard to comprehend.If you ever wondered what's in your toothpaste (chalk, water, paint, seaweed, anti-freeze, paraffin oil, detergent, peppermint and formaldehyde),in your margarine (lard, fish fat, sulfurs, deodorizers, color and some sunflower oil, so that it can be painted on the side of the tub as wholesome),what's in commercial cake mix, why roses are red, how many dust mites- its dead family members- and their poop you sleep and walk on, the history if the fork, dining room table, music, talk, light bulb, why your blue jeans are blue ( decaying oil produced but certain flowers is the tint) , if you ever knew that the lightning bolt is 5 times hotter than the sun itself, what really happens when you flush the toilet and how many days ( 11 to be exact) suspended germs can hover over it, how long that meat that you buy in the store has been lying around for ( 10 days, for muscles of animal to relax after rigor mortis ) and other bizarre interesting things you touch and breather in, then this is the book for you.Don't be scared, it won't make anyone an alarmist, but it's a great tool on learning fascinating info and keeping germs at bay.Knowledge is power.

Great read, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Secret House: The Extraordinary Science of an Ordinary Day","review":"This book (The Secret House: The Extraordinary Science of an Ordinary Day) follows one perfectly normal day in the house of two people. Starting with the alarm clock going off and ending with a late night bath, this book portrays the science behind all the normal things that are usually taken for granted by most. One man however (the author David Bodanis), does not let these things go unnoticed. He shows us what our eyes cannot see. These things include, what gives potato chips their snap, why jeans are blue, what is crawling into your food when you are not looking, what you kick up when you take a step, the damage you could do with the twist of the foot, the millions and millions of tiny mites and creatures crawling across your face as you read this review, and many, many other things, far to many for me to list here. The types of things Bodanis analyzes and breaks down are interesting, amazing, and in most cases, shocking. Without a doubt, this will be one of the most eye opening books you will ever read.I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to find what is actually going on in their homes when they are there, and the things that go on in your homes when you are not there. This book had my interest from the front cover to the back cover. I will be honest, when I first got this book, I got it mostly because of the easy language and the fairly short number of pages. After finishing it though, I am immediately thankful that I did end up getting it. The language is very simple to understand. Some of the things discussed are not simple topics, but Bodanis does a great job of breaking it down into much simpler things, and much of the time, drawing metaphors to topics that a non-chemist will understand. A lot of the time, I found myself reading pages over, not because I did not understand them, but because I wanted to re-read some of the amazing things he says in this book. Any person can relate to this book, because it is about an ordinary day, which every person has had. I suggest this book to anyone that would be interested in what goes on beneath the surface of their daily routine."},{"Title":"The Secret House: The Extraordinary Science of an Ordinary Day","review":"There are over 2 million distinct creatures on your cheek, chin and nose, and more on your forehead.

In every cubic foot of air in your house, there are 3,00,000 odd items floating about, like micro insect limbs, sea salt, tire meltings ...etc This book reveals the present but unnoticed aspects of our daily lives. Using a chronological device of a typical day, the author examines typical activities like brushing, bathing, cooking, eating, even walking (and talking) and exposes the physical intricacies behind them. He also examines mundane products like toothpastes, soaps, cakes and reveals the components and their manufacturing process.

He takes us through a &quot;typical&quot; day and shows us what we don't see as we get up, shower, dress, go about our day and have dinner. In this he shows us what we don't see going on around us, and uses it as a chance to tell stories of how things came to be in our modern life [for example, talking about historical roots of the dining table]. For the most part, while he tells you about the millions of microscopic things that live on and around you, he does so without being alarmist. Sometimes though, I could have done without his information - he's ruined cakes for me now after a rather unsettling story of their making. In all the reader is entertained and may learn a thing or two. This book would go well with more serious books like &quot;The Secret Life of Germs&quot; by Philip M. Tierno.

It's gonzo food journalism with a healthy dose of history and cultural anthropology carefully disguised as a travelogue.The focus of the book is coffee, and Allen treats his subject with Hunter S. Thompsonesque flair as he traces the history of the divine bean from it's African origins all the way to the Texas Panhandle. I'm still a little skeptical as to how much of the text was real experience as opposed to caffiene-induced delusion, but in the end it really doesn't matter much. It's an entertaining and informative read, and that's what really counts. You certainly can't fault the author on his research and sources. Allen has good footnotes and his stories hold up well under the scrutiny of a good many Google searches.The author is accompanied on his quest for javalightenment by a revolving door of unusual and interesting characters, all helping to drive the narrative forward with lightning speed as Allen travels from one locale and adventure to another. Allen begins his quest in Ethiopia, where coffee was first cultivated. He moves quickly along the traditional trade routes to trace how the bean migrated through Arab and Muslim lands to Europe, the New World, and beyond.\\"The Devil's Cup\\" is too short to provide a holistic picture of the sacred bean, and I'd recommend pairing it up with one of the more traditionally written histories on the subject such as \\"Uncommon Grounds\\". That said, this is a great compliment to other coffee-related books and it should sit on your shelf if you have even a passing interest in learning more about the magic grounds.Grab a good cup of joe, get this book, and start reading already!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Cup: A History of the World According to Coffee","review":"This book reignited my interest in history.

Though I think there was more potential to be explored in the journey than it ultimately wound up having, it is smartly done without being pompous or endlessly detailed It's also not a coffee-nerd's journey either. It's written in the style of the proper coffee-geek... subtly curious, factually informed, non-judgemental of different styles of drinking coffee, and at times utterly evocative of the locales, the people, and the scents of coffee.I really enjoyed and I'm glad it is written how it is.

Delightful and quite a light read. I suppose if this book were a woman I would call her an airhead. Nonetheless, from the very origins of humanity in Ethiopia and Eritrea, passing through the markets of Yemen, where the aroma of the smoothest of Arabica beans awaits the tired traveler; then Europe, with its typical French caf&eacute;s and Viennese coffee with cream on top; to the darkest of roasts in Brazil, and finally our very own North America, the reader is sure to enjoy this journey to the last drop.I would be very interested to know Allen's credentials (they are conspicuously absent throughout the book), but his wit is indeed unique, with passages that made me laugh out loud. An example of such is given within the first chapters of the book, when he is inquiring about the epitome of Ethiopian coffee in a conversation with his friend Abera in the most casual of dialogues:\\"This is only drunk in the home. Hardly anyone in Harrar drinks it today. You must visit the Ogaden. They still drink it.\\"\\"Where do they live?\\"\\"The Ogaden? They live now in Jiga-Jiga.\\" He made the place sound like a disease. \\"But you can't go there. It's very, very dangerous. And those Somalis, those Ogaden, are very arrogant. So rude!\\"\\"Why? What is the problem?\\"\\"They are rude people!\\" Abera shook his head angrily at the Ogaden's poor manners. \\"Why, just not too long ago they did a bad thing to a bus going there. To all the men.\\"\\"Bad? How bad?\\"\\"Why, very bad. They killed them.\\"\\"That's pretty bad,\\" I agreed. (Page 15).The pursuit of coffee continues with Allen traveling to Yemen via Djibouti, a place where the rule of law is still that of one's own, and where thieves are crucified pretty much in Jesus Christ style if caught. The author delights in rambling through the streets of Sanaa in the wee hours of the morning without a care in the world that anybody is going to rob or assault him in any way.But the book reaches its climax upon Allen's arrival in Germany, where he has a philosophical chat - over coffee, of course - with Dr. Josef Joffe. Dr. Joffe explains that in order to determine whether a nation is rich and powerful, one need only look at the way the society makes its coffee. Have we not noticed how, as Americans started learning to make designer coffee with the advent of Starbucks, their world supremacy has dwindled considerably? Much in the same way, nations like China, who do not know how to make a good cup of the fragrant drink are now booming. Thus, Allen arrives to the conclusion that coffee is, in fact, evil - hence \\"the devil's cup\\" (page 135). Joffe's conclusion does not deter our author however, who continues his treacherous but adventurous trail in search of coffee in a cargo vessel and on to America. He visits Brazil in search not only of coffee but also of African spirits responsible for its brewing and traditions.Allen goes even further on his thesis about coffee, claiming that the fabled grain has, after all, a \\"ridiculous\\" history, and lays down the premise that is no coincidence that both coffee and humanity originated in Ethiopia, the place where \\"those early ape-men nibbled on the bright red berries\\" (page 133). It is up to the reader to decide whether coffee has been a good or bad influence on humanity, and even if it is an intelligent decision to decide to drink it.Although I have enjoyed \\"The Devil's cup\\" to a certain point, the book falls short as a treatise on how coffee changed the world, making one feel as if one were reading a poorly treated thesis. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable read that will do whenever in need to clear the mind while still cultivating it."},{"Title":"The Devil's Cup: A History of the World According to Coffee","review":"This book was entertaining, although it was a bit...schizophrenic. I wish it hadn't ended where it did...felt a bit sudden and depressing, but most of the book was a whirlwind of the author's travels in search of unique cups of coffee from many of the places that have made their own unique versions. Bits of history come in here and there...where the beans started for instance, and some of the religions that grew around them. Some interesting primary source data also.However...if you're looking at it in terms of food history, it's a bit light on that. It's in there, but far from comprehensive or complete and I feel like it didn't really teach me that much about coffee...or even how to make a good cup myself (though maybe why American stuff is so terrible?)Good...but not what I hoped it was based on the title."},{"Title":"The Devil's Cup: A History of the World According to Coffee","review":"The Devil's Cup is the best kind of quest story -- a man in pursuit of something he loves for no reason other than to satisfy his own curiosity. In a journey that parallels the coffee bean's chronological journey through time, Stewart Lee Allen travels from Ethiopia to al-Makkah (hence the term mocha) in Yemen, Calcutta to Istanbul, and finally Vienna to Paris. Then he hops a freighter to Brazil and concludes with a car trip across the U.S. in search of the perfect cup of coffee. Along the way he visits Rimbaud's house in Harar, crosses to Yemen with a boatload of Somali refugees, turns down numerous offers of qat, conspires with smugglers of forged Rajasthani miniatures, whirls with dervishes, and tracks down the descendants of the adventurer who first brought coffee to the new world. In Brazil he tours the torture chamber of a slaveholding coffee baron, ducks a doomsday cult and communes with an ancient Ethiopian coffee spirit through an Afro-Brazilian shaman. Back home he cajoles a friend into taking a java-fueled ride across route 66 and almost lands in jail. Ultimately he does find the most \\"American\\" cup of coffee somewhere between New York and LA.The author did a wonderful job of weaving in more coffee trivia than I ever imagined possible without bogging down his fast-paced narrative. Particularly fascinating were the myriad of ways he saw coffee prepared, his explanation of the relationship between coffee and Islam and his history of caf&eacute;s in European culture and commerce. When he began making plans to attend an Ethiopian ceremony to invoke the Zar coffee spirits to perform an exorcism, I was a little concerned about where the book was going. But after his respectful recounting I found his quest to understand coffee's anthropological context to be an added dimension of the story. Anyone who enjoys travel or adventure writing will find this a worthwhile few hours. For coffee lovers, with a great cup in hand, it's even better."},{"Title":"The Devil's Cup: A History of the World According to Coffee","review":"This is a must read for Barista's.

He travels on a budget that leads to many interesting scenarios, such as crossing the Atlantic on a cargo ship with a handful of other passengers, that have little to nothing to do with coffee. Much of his info on the history of coffee in Europe is a recitation (although amusingly told) of more staid histories of coffee. He spends most of his travels looking for either the best or worst cup of coffee. After I finished the book, I felt like I had read several good anecdotal stories and legends about the origins and history of coffee, and had also read a rather crazy, but interesting, travelogue that loosely related to the spread of coffee from Africa to the rest of the world. It was a fun read and worth reading, but I am still looking for a more focused and complete history of coffee."},{"Title":"The Devil's Cup: A History of the World According to Coffee","review":"I received this book as a gift and was hoping for a more informative book about coffee, its history, and its intricacies.

But the book not only has the great tale of how coffee came from Africa and made it's way all over the earth to the daily drink we know today, it also is a first rate travelogue. The author follows coffee's migration from Africa to Europe.

It is basically a personal narrative on his travels so it can also be considered a travel essay. As he experiences various regions, he stops and samples various brews. The \\"History of the World\\" portion of the title comes from amusing anecdotes throughout the book relating to coffee. I enjoyed learning about some of the regions where coffee was outlawed at a time and the reasoning or lack of behind it. I am only giving it four stars because I wanted more as was related to the title and less narrative. Some chapters are amusing, but there are portions of the book I just skipped over, but all in all a nice effort and I would recommend it. This book appeared to have been written very quickly with quick tidbits of humour. I am convinced Mr Allen was intoxicated with double shot's of espresso while writing this text.

It's not just a travelog. It's not just an essay on the politics of the import and export of a consumer good. It's more than that, it's an adventure that follows the trail of that most wonderful beverage, coffee. Where did coffee originate from? How did it make it's way from country to country, from continent to continent? Who was responsible for the many moves that coffee has made? For the different ways that coffee is enjoyed? How do different cultures view this magnificent bean? What role did coffee play in the creation of civilization? Of the shaping of our globe as it is today?

I found myself accelerating my reading to see what would happen next, as the author travels the world in search of various historical brews. From Africa to the Middle East to Europe and beyond, you feel like you're right there, experiencing the bustle of busy marketplaces and the chatter of a Viennese cafe. It's written in an amusing prose and presents an array of intruiging tidbits of historical evidence.As I sipped my coffee along-side the book, I couldn't help but experiment and day-dream of whether the brew tasted even remotely similar just a few hundred years ago, although I found myself (unfortunately?) short on ambergris. It's not often that I read a book in just about one sitting, but I was hooked as soon as I started reading."},{"Title":"The Devil's Cup: A History of the World According to Coffee","review":"As a well-traveled and verified coffee fanatic, I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Devil's Cup by Stewart Lee Allen. There are many books more encyclopedic on the history of coffee but it is rare to find one like this that masterfully weaves centuries of historical fact with a modern tale. If you are not crazy about coffee like I am, Allen's tale of travel through foreign lands is enough reason to read this book. Sure, we have all heard the story of Kaldi the goatherd and how people may have first started to drink coffee. Ever wonder why we call it Java, why we refer to a cup of coffee as a \\"Cup of Joe\\" and what do the Capuchin monks have to do with Cappuccino?

I'm not sure what I enjoyed more, the travel log or the history \\"asides\\" given so that you hardly notice you're learning about coffee's rich history and influence on cultures and civilizations. After reading this, you'll wonder what secrets and anecdotes other common-place, everyday items have."},{"Title":"The Devil's Cup: A History of the World According to Coffee","review":"I really liked this book, but it is important to know what to expect. You will not find a history of coffee in the usual scholarly style.In fact, it is as much of a travelogue as it is a book on the history of coffee. The author follows the trail of coffee as it spread throughout the world. It tells the story in a lighthearted, trivia kind of way, but that does not diminish the value of the information, which is accurate. Rather, it is decidedly and intentionally non-scholarly and avoids any attempt at serious verbosity. The journey is fun to follow - probably more so as an armchair traveler than it would be in real life. I thought it was funny, well written and a good, easy yet informative read. In the end it fizzles out a bit as the search for coffee tales turns into a somewhat frenzied search for a caffeine kick - not quite the same thing. But still, it does illustrate well how a simple herbal concoction of a rural backwaters village (could be anywhere) slowly, over time evolves into something much more potent and potentially lethal, as preparations become more intricate and the search for the 'active ingredient' develops. This story has been repeated with different 'herbs-turned-drugs' so many times throughout history - one could say it is the history of pharmacy. And so, this book tells as much about the human mind set in pursuit of that ever more powerful punch, as it does about the actual plant and its round-about journey to conquer the world. Despite the lightheartedness of this book, it does raise a lot of questions and is excellent food for thought."},{"Title":"The Devil's Cup: A History of the World According to Coffee","review":"a hybrid between \\"a history of the world according to coffee\\" (subtitle) and stewart lee allen's research travelogue, the book follows allen who follows coffee's historical and geographical paths of adoptionthe early history of coffee is largely unknown, so the first half of the story primarily narrates allen's travel snags in unsuccessful research; border problems, boat breakdowns, getting ripped off by faux art-smugglers, etcthe 2nd half of the book is content-rich and much more interesting - covering the fascinating rise and role of coffee since the ottoman empire (primarily europe, india and the americas). allen provides a lot of speculation (his and others) with his facts - for a subject as nebulous as coffee's impact on civilization, speculation feels appropriate to methe format would work better for me if 1) his travel tales worked together to form an interesting narrative of their own and/or 2) they had anything to do with coffee. unfortunately they fail on both these counts, and become filleroverall, allen's caffeinated and irreverent writing style makes the book easy to read and i found it reliably funny. for example on page 126 he writes ->\\"the main nonalcoholic source of nutrition, bread is now believed to have been plagued with the hallucinogenic fungus ergot, the base ingredient for lsd. drunk doctors, tipsy politicians, hungover generals: the plague, famine, and war. add a pope on acid, and medieval christianity starts to make a whole lot of sense\\"if you're interested in the history of coffee and you're okay with some travelogue-genre fluff, you'll probably enjoy this book. i would give it 3 and half stars if i could"},{"Title":"Pedro Paramo (Evergreen Original, E-149)","review":"I really needed a copy of a translation of Pedro Paramo of Juan Rulfo by Lisander Kemp and I finally found it here, it did took more or less long time to get it cause I'm in Oaxaca, south of Mexico, but in fact it said I'll get it in two months and I received it before, so I was really happy and the product did was as described.

This book gave me flashbacks of growing up. I didn't realize then some of the odd behavior of those around me as well as myself. If you are from the sticks of N.E. you will love this book. It is hilarious, smart, and tight. If you are not and you like to read non-industry writers, writers with imagination. Pick up this book. It is great. I was truly blown away. I grew up with a TV but we had no channels but for PBS (Durham NH) and cable was not yet in the hinterlands. I read many books in New Hampshire and about New Hampshire, this is the very best. Hebert nailed this story. Trust me if you like original, new, fresh, material read &quot;The Dogs of March.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Dogs of March","review":"I read Hebert's novel many years ago and was surprised when it went out of print. It is a wonderful novel, much better and more profound I think than &quot;The Beans of Egypt, Maine&quot; in honestly protraying rural poverty in New England. Hebert's characters are beautifully rendered and unlike with Chute's, the author does not condescend to them nor does he make them larger or smaller than life, though he does portray them with empathy and with heart. His characters have their own pettiness and desires and dignity, and he allows them to follow their own paths without making them cartoon-like puppets or grotesques. They are poor but they are not made to argue for some political point of view (though of course one can hardly not be moved when the main character talks about &quot;teeth&quot;--when referring to the lack of dental care for the poor). As with all great art, this novel makes its politcal statement by fashioning characters we do identify with. This is a profoundly moving novel that deserves to be rediscovered and applauded as the gritty and realistic novel it is."},{"Title":"The Dogs of March","review":"I was born and raised in New Hampshire and, to echo a previous reviewer from the Granite State, this is spot on.I love Russo's books, but \\"Dogs of March\\" is far more gritty and, at a dirt level, far more realistic. The town I grew up in had trash men that were constantly building \\"additions\\" to their tin, aluminum foil and tar paper shack out by the railroad tracks. They were clones of the Ollie Jordan family in Hebert's novel.Besides the characters, there is a powerful story of what drives men to do extraordinary and bizarre things.This is among a handful of novels I've read twice."},{"Title":"The Dogs of March","review":"Reviewers have noted that in Darby, Ernest Hebert has created New Hampshire's own version of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. Howard Elman, the main character in The Dogs of March, and a recurring character in the series is a working man, ignorant in many ways through his near illiteracy. He becomes unemployed, and without health insurance early in the story when the factory he's worked in all his life is sold and the jobs and machinery are moved south. He finds himself in a battle against change and in conflict with the new people moving into the area who have \\"college degrees and big bank accounts.\\" Zoe Cutter is the newcomer who's bought the property adjacent to Howard Elman's forty acres. Zoe has come from the city with plenty of money and ideas about turning the property into an idyllic New England landscape, and running a country boutique. The junk cars and abandoned machinery that are eyesores to Zoe are as much a part of the landscape to Howard as the trees and the stone walls.Hebert was probably the first (and may remain the only) author to masterfully, elegantly and genuinely create Granite State natives, working class people, as complete characters not just as caricatures of the stereotypical New England Yankee, used to backdrop bigger stories.When I think about why The Dogs of March has endured for nearly 30 years, why it remains in print and why I find it as true and relevant now as I did when I first read it, I believe it's because beneath the well drawn characters, the intimate sense of place, and the taut, compelling plot, flowing throughout the story and elevating it to literature is a theme about insiders and outsiders. What has often been called regional fiction isn't regional at all. This is a universal story.A lot of the authors I love are household names. Ernest Hebert is not as widely known, but he is one of my favorites and may turn out to be one of the best writers you've never heard of -- yet."},{"Title":"The Dogs of March","review":"I read this book when it first came out and it has never left me. Hebert's portrayal of the invisible people who live around us in the rural landscape is memorable, sympathetic and accurate. This is a book not to miss and remains one of my favorites.

Popularized in verse by John Godfrey Saxe (1816-1887), it is a parable about Man's understanding of, and relationship with, the transcendent. Six blind men went to see an elephant. Each touched the elephant in a different place, one the trunk, one his tusks, one his side, one his back, and so on. Since each sensed the elephant in a different way, they argued amongst one another about who described the elephant correctly. Yet, none was right, since none could really see the elephant for what he was. The blind men represent the religions of the world, who constantly fight and argue amongst themselves over who gets God \\"right\\", when none has the whole picture, and all just have little pieces of the big picture.Is this an apt metaphor for religion? Are the different religions simply the variations and manifestations of Man's search for God, the ultimate, and the transcendent; all equally apt, though ultimately inadequate, means of seeking God? The vindicated secularist in us, and the open-minded religious pluralist in us, is ready to say, \\"of course.\\" The orthodox Jew is us, and the traditional Christian in us, is ready to say, \\"those other religions may be \`blind men', but not we. We have the Truth.\\" Yet, there is a profound truth in this elephant tale. Blindness is a metaphor that takes us back to the Christian Scriptures, where Jesus heals the blind man. The authorities are troubled, since Jesus performed his healing, \\"worked,\\" on the Sabbath, the day of rest. Jesus heals one man's physical blindness, but it was never that man who was really blind. He had faith. The men who are blind are the authorities who cannot look past their own preconceptions and expectations of God to recognize that the duty to honor the Sabbath is really about making time for God, and does not preclude helping others. Physical blindness as a metaphor for spiritual blindness has deeply embedded Scriptural roots. Maybe there is something to this Eastern myth.The Elephant Tale is right. We are all, in many ways, spiritually blind, spiritually impoverished. Yet, how did we get this way? Is there a way out of the darkness and into the light? This story of blind men and an elephant is a good start, but needs to be expanded, and further delved into. Maybe what is needed is an extension of John Godfrey Saxe's poem. Let us continue from Saxe's final stanza, with free story rather than verse, as I do not bear the talents of Saxe....The disputants, I ween,Rail on in utter ignoranceOf what each other mean,And prate about an elephantNot one of them has seen!Papa, the men of the world are blind. They no longer can see the elephant. They search for him, but do not find. They feel him, but are constantly at odds. Why is this so? Was this always so?My child, this is a story of long, long ago. Of a time when all men were blind. This is no longer so.Papa, we are blind! I feel the elephant. He is solid ivory. But, Krishna feels the elephant as long and rollicky!Child, we are not yet ready to speak of the cure for our blindness, the light to be lived. It is a light that men of old had originally seen. Men were not always blind. It was not always this way. Men did not always \\"prate about an elephant not one of them has seen!\\"In the beginning, the elephant raised his trunk, stomped his feet, and breathed life into men. Men could see the elephant. Men loved the elephant, the giver of life. Men touched the elephant. All men could see that the elephant is like a wall, and a spear, and a snake, a tree, a fan, and a rope. Man could see the elephant, and man was happy.What happened, Papa!?The elephant had raised his trunk and breathed life into men so that men would be happy seeing and feeling the elephant. One day, on a day like all others, men, who had been satisfied to see and touch the elephant, with no inclination towards disobedience, decided that it was not enough to see and touch the elephant. Men wished to be elephants, themselves. Then they would know what it would be like to have tusks, a trunk, and ivory skin. They would not need the elephant to experience the elephant feel.Papa, did the men become like elephants? Did they become the source of their own ivory feeling?No, my child! Far from it. Not only did men not become elephants, they lost the vision of the elephant. Because man lost his appreciation, reverence, respect, and love of the elephant, he became blind. Men could now no longer see the elephant. This is why men during the following era prated \\"about an elephant not one of them has seen!\\"Why did the elephant not give men back their sight, Papa? Why must the elephant punish the men like this? I thought the elephant loves the men, Papa?He does love the men, my child. He is not punishing men. Men have chosen to bring blindness upon themselves and their descendents by not seeing the elephant as the elephant. If the elephant simply restores their sight, they still will not see, since they have chosen to hide themselves from the true vision of the elephant. Even if they did see, they may choose to disobey again. How many times should the elephant keep restoring sight, my child?You are wise Papa. This saddens me. Are men doomed to blindness, to never seeing the elephant again? There must be more.There is much more, my child. Men were trapped in blindness for ages. The men would come upon the elephant, and each feeling about blindly, argue with each other about the elephant unseen.This happened every day. The men would visit the elephant, sense about, and prattle on needlessly. Then, on a day like all other days, something changed. The elephant raised his trunk, and roared to one of the men. This one man did not have his vision completely restored. He had inherited the vicissitudes of his ancestors. But, he was given a partial vision of the elephant. As the chosen man, he was destined to teach the men of the world about the elephant. He would suffer cruelties and beatings. Men would continue to mock him, and reject his message.Why, oh why, Papa? This pains my heart to hear of his sufferings. Why would men do this to this man of the elephant?Men were blind, my child. They knew not what they were doing. But, fear not. Light would be returned to men. Out of the house of this man of the elephant would be born One who is not blind. This Man, who was with the elephant, who was the elephant, became flesh, became man, so that men could see.As the men of long ago had lost sight, this Man had sight from the beginning. This Man, the Incarnation of the elephant, was sent to reveal, to be the revelation of, the elephant. He walked amongst the blind men arguing about the elephant. He healed their wounds. He consoled their hurts.Men did not embrace this Man. Instead, they took this Man who could see, they accosted Him, and they blinded Him. They took away his sight.Papa, it appears hopeless. All is lost. If even this Man the men would not accept, all hope is lost.Be not afraid! Blindness does not have the final word, my child. Men had brought blindness into the world. By embracing this blindness, by allowing blindness to come to Him in all its might, this Man took away the power of blindness over men.On the third day, this Man, who had been blinded, returned in all His glory, with full vision and sight and of the elephant. Because of this Man, men now have sight regained. No, this sight did not come all at once, and many are still blind. In the end, when all will be all in the elephant, the blind will see."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Currency Trading: Winning in Today's Hottest Marketplace","review":"This book is perfect for getting the big picture view of forex trading.

The second type of person is looking for trading techniques and would do well to read the author's excellent work on charting techniques for forex trading.Take note, these men are SERIOUS traders and have the rare talent to bring complicated ideas to different levels of readers.

I like it because it covers all of the basics and explains everything you need to know about the currency market. The book even goes into the basics of technical and fundamental analysis and trading psychology. What it doesn't cover is how to trade and trading strategies. But you must know everything in this book before you can work on a strategy.Some of the topics covered include the History of Forex, terms, opening an account, record keeping, calculating profits, and money management. Of particular interest are their lists of characteristics of successful traders, and common mistakes."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Currency Trading: Winning in Today's Hottest Marketplace","review":"I give this product 5 stars because it is exactly in line with what it is advertised to be, a good rudimentary read into the FX markets and Fx trading.There is no glit and glimmer, no formulas, and no systems.For the price, I am satisfied and it has a place on my book shelf."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Currency Trading: Winning in Today's Hottest Marketplace","review":"The book contains defnitions of Forex terms which you could get on the web for free.

I expected more judging from alot of the other reviews. I felt that he did not give good explanations. I really felt lost quite a bit. I was able to figure out the math by teaching myself, because I've always gotten straight A's in math. Some of his formulas were overcomplicated. I was able to rewrite some of them simpler. I feel that this is definitely not a \\"For Dummies\\" type of book. If it's truly for a beginner, it should be explained in a way that a child would be able to understand it. And I know it's not just me, because I'm a very bright woman and graduated from college with honors. But he really had me confused with the math, the fundamental analysis, and the graphs were very confusing.

Ironically, the author sometimes forgets that he is talking to those getting started as he starts talking forex speak on matters he has yet to explain clearly. While the introduction to Forex is substantial, once you move on to actual trading discussions, it tends to be too general (and as mentioned, refers to terms he has not made the reader familiar with).

Hernandez-Brun) are unreadable. Most of the remaining eighteen are provocative, enjoyable, amusing, moving, or all of the above - a remarkably high success rate for any anthology.Some particular standouts:\\"The Translator\\" by Kim Stanley Robinson. A human is forced to use an inaccurate translating machine to avert a war between two alien cultures. A deft portrayal of cunning deception, and the loose translations generated by the machine show Robinson to be herself a master of language.\\"One Night in Television City\\" by Paul DiFilippo. The story itself is rather blah, but DiFilippo creates a narrative voice that is very Raymond Chandler-esque while advancing the slang and idioms a few hundred years. The word choices and the language that ensues is a fine example of a technical mastery of the written word (it is just unfortunate that the substance does not live up to the technique).\\"Alimentary Tract\\" by Scott Baker describes a world where gluttony is punished by allowing the glutton to gorge himself; all calories are diverted to needy families in Southeast Asia. An intriguing idea played to out to wonderful comedic and insightful effect.\\"The Songs the Anemone Sing\\" by Grania Davis is a powerful, moving tale of inter-species (platonic) love. Davis' ability to evoke powerful emotions in fifteen pages is astonishing.\\"Love Is a Drug\\" by Leah Alpert is, perhaps, the highlight of the book. In Alpert's society, couples must undergo drug therapy before they can be divorced. Occasionally, though, the therapist injects the wrong drug! Wildly entertaining, and a pure pleasure from the opening line to the satisfying ending.Amidst such excellent stories, Ursula K. LeGuin's contribution, \\"The Shobie's Story\\" is the only actual disappointment. Which isn't to say that the Shobie's story is a dull one; it's just that one expects perfection from the author of The Left Hand of Darkness and perfection isn't present here.One final observation, several of the stories are post-apocalyptic, which is somewhat surprising given the stories were written in 1989/1990 when the Cold War seemed to be coming to an end and world-wide optimism was high. Once upon a time science fiction was the literature of the hopeful; not for several of these writers.Overall, Universe 1 is a very worthwhile collection, one that should be appreciated by not only science fiction fans, but also fans of good literature in general."},{"Title":"Evangeline (French Edition)","review":"This book, I thought it was a story, but it's a poem.

He brought back a copy of this poem. It was required reading for my parents growing up - I had never heard of it.I confess I was probably hesitant when I sat down to read it.

Therefore, I was uneasy in the purchase of Evangeline, A Novel. I shouldn't have been. Finis Fox's insight into the lives, loves and losses of the Acadians is remarkable. He adds to the story lines rather than detracting from them. His words are at once romantic and colorful, lulling you into passive reflection. The emotions are all there, the joy, the pain and the suffering. He does not stray far from Longfellow's poem, using the same names of people and places. It is a story worth reading! It would be worth the price if it were twice as much. I wish it could have been longer, but in staying true to Longfellow, the story moved much the same as did the poem.

Scott Fitzgerald was the author of \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Fitzgerald was born in 1896. An interesting fact is that he was named after his ancestor who wrote the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\". He was an underachiever when he was in high school but he was intelligent. He did, however, end up going to Princeton University, though he didn't graduate from there. He instead enrolled in the army in 1917. Events in Fitzgerald's life inspired him to write his most famous book, \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Fitzgerald died of a heart attack in 1940.The most controversial situation in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" was the disfunctional marraige between Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Tom was interested in a girl in New York. Daisy even knew that Tom was having an affair but she tried to love him anways. She figured that she had to because she had a baby on the way and Tom was the only life she knew.Jay Gatsby lives across the bay from Daisy. Every night, from across the bay, Gatsby watches Daisy's greenlight on her porch. Gatsby and Daisy used to love each other before Gatsby went off to war. Gatsby's absence left Daisy lonely and she married Tom. Gatsby wanted Daisy back. He tried to live the \\"American Dream.\\" He thought this dream would bring his love back to him. Daisy, however, never heard of Gatsby's return until she was invited over to a lunch which he \\"happened\\" to be at. The luncheon caused Daisy and Gatsby's love to rekindle and they began to have an affair.Tom found out about the affair and he was furious with Daisy. He knew he was having an affair himself, yet he still had the nerve to tell Daisy she was wrong. Tom thought Daisy should be a faithful wife to him. This was the main conflict which caused all the problems to arise throughout the novel.This conflict really caught my attention. I felt for Daisy as she was still living the life when her husband was with another woman. I can't imagine the pain she was going through and how hard it must have been to continue to be with him. When Daisy started seeing Gatsby, I did not think she was doing the right thing. Two wrongs don't make a right. That was the feeling I had throughout the book, hurt for the way the Buchanan's chose to live their lives. Their life of cheating, lying, pretending, and settling for less then the best. I felt this way because I know there are people who really live their lives this way and I wish no one would have to go through that pain. This book has a very strong and lasting impact on the reader."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Its an American classic whose themes are still relevant today."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I recommend, as an alternative, &quot;The South Beach Diet.&quot;"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Response to literature is a matter of taste and taste is often a matter of experience. Those who haven't read much (and widely) are less likely to be able to discriminate between what is significant and what is not. But even experience and an open mind do not guarantee a positive response to every classic. I always wanted to like The Great Gatsby because it was one of those books in the canon of accepted 'great' American books, but repeated attempts at the book still leave me cold. I don't find anyone in the novel to care for and if one doesn't care about the characters, one doesn't care what happens to them.'Gatsby', I think, is a minor book about very shallow people. Fitzgerald's language seems, to me, overblown and almost, at times, adolescent. I think it is significant as a document - a historical marker for a period in American history - but not as a great work of art, or of entertainment."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"For a great American classic, The Great Gatsby isn't too impressive. While perfect reading for an english class, this book just doesn't have too much going for it for most contemporary readers. Fitzgerald stuffed as much symbolism as possible into such a short book, and gave us a pretty good picture of &quot;the roaring twenties,&quot; but it was overall pretty boring and pointless. I think that this, like The Catcher in the Rye, is one of those books where either you love it or you hate it.The ending to Gatsby was amazing, and really worked to fit the whole thing together, but for me the book itself was just a dreadful waste of time to read. I'd recommend skipping this one."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is so good. It is a wonderful story of wealth, dreams and love."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Now I realize that most reviewers loved this book, but I just have to go with my instincts here. The book was boring. Plain and simple. None of the characters was really likeable, there was no great plot to speak of, and overall just dull in tone. Sure Fitzgerald is an accomplished writer and the novel is descriptively and grammatically great, but it takes more than that to make a classic. And sadly, this book fell far short.If you're a high school kid getting force fed this crap, you may emerge with a negative view of the book upon completion, which will mostly be greeted (from your teacher) with, \\"Well, you just didn't understand it.\\" A little inside info for you (from a teacher). Most educators teaching this are not necesarily doing so because they personally like the book, but because some genius decided Gatsby was a classic and needed to be shoved down the throat of every kid to graduate high school. But the teachers will pretend they like it and if you didn't enjoy it they'll say you just didn't get it. Oh no, I got it all right. I just wish I hadn't. So don't feel bad if you disliked the book. There's nothing wrong with you. And I completely agree.To be fair, the book isn't awful, so I gave it 2 stars. I guess my biggest beef with it is just how ubiquitous it is in public education. It seems every single high school kid has to read books like this just because someone said it was a classic. Meanwhile, ACTUAL classics like the Iliad, Odyssey, Inferno (and even a little exposure to the Bible wouldn't hurt) are left untouched because they're too old or not American. Gimme a break."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. in New York in 1925. The book is about the American Dream and the failure of the attempt to reach its illusionary goals, especially the Gatsby's. The attempt to capture the American Dream is central theme to many stories of all times. For Gatsby, the dream is that one can acquire love and happiness through wealth and power. F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896 - 1940) was born in St Paul, Minnesota. He was an American short-story writer and novelist. The Great Gatsby is considered as Fitzgerald's finest novel.The story was set in New York and Long Island in 1920's. Nick Carraway is a young man working as a bond broker in New York. He is used as the narrator throughout the story. Nick acts as an insider as well as an outsider. He eyes everything that is happening in between, but has no intention to interfere. I think he chooses not to lose anybody close to him in the story. This arrangement makes it easy for Fitzgerald to give the audience detailed inside information and to back out as an outsider as needed. The core character, Jay Gatsby, is a character that longs for the past. He devotes most of his adult life trying to recapture it and he finally pays his life as the price in his pursuit. When he was young in the military, Gatsby fell in love with the beautiful Daisy, but he could not marry her because of the difference in their social status. So he left her to acquire wealth. When he got the wealth legally or illegally, he moved near to Daisy, who has already married to another wealthy man, and threw extravagant parties every week hoping Daisy might show up one day at the party. Finally, he set up a meeting with Daisy through her cousin Nick. Fitzgerald uses Gatsby's personal dream to symbolize the larger American Dream where all have the opportunity to get what they want.Nick is a multi-functional character to the author. He uses Nick as the approach for Gatsby to Daisy. The author naturally arranges all these. Gatsby cannot accept that the past is gone and done with. Nick once attempts to show him the folly of his dream, but Gatsby innocently replies to Nick's assertion that the past cannot be relived. For Gatsby, his American Dream is not material possessions, although it may seem that way. He only comes into wealth to fulfill his Dream, Daisy.Gatsby believes that he is acting for good beyond his personal interest and that should guarantee success. However, he is terribly wrong. He is so determined and so blind that he would do anything to get Daisy, even covering her up for the fatal accident. His dream never comes about and he ends up paying the ultimate price for it. The idea of the American Dream still holds true in today's time, which is wealth, love, or fame. But one thing never changes about the American Dream. That is everyone desires something in life and strives to get it. Gatsby is a good example of pursuing the American Dream.A society naturally breaks up into various social groups over time. Members of the lower statuses constantly suppose that their problems can be solved if they gain enough wealth to reach the upper class. Fitzgerald believes in his story that many people interpret the American Dream as being this passage to high social status. They believe once reaching that point, they do not have to worry about money any more. Though, the American Dream involves more than the social and economic standings of an individual.It seems that the more Gatsby tries to obtain, the less he ends up with. The saddest part of Gatsby is the funeral, which symbolizes the ultimate failure of Gatsby to ever achieve what he has wanted. The women he loved and died for was not present. None of the people who frequented the parties over the summer showed up. Wolfsheim, whom Nick believed to be a close friend to Gatsby, refused to attend. The idealism conflicts with the materialism and is torn apart. However, it is his father who lives at the bottom of the society, who is the most natural and native person in the story, whom Gatsby has never mentioned about, finds his way to his son's mansion for the funeral. What greatness of a father's love is in contrast to the love that Gatsby died for? That is the love of eternity. The father loves his son no matter his son is rich or poor. At this moment, both the idealism and materialism are eclipsed by the truthfulness and naturalness. And that is why Nick was tired of the life there, the carelessness of the people, and the corruption of the society in the American East. He decided to head back to his origin, to the more natural and traditional American Mid-West.Gatsby possesses an extreme imbalance between the material and spiritual sides of himself. Fitzgerald uses him as a portrait of the ultimate failure of the American Dream in that individuals tend to believe wealth is everything. Maybe what Fitzgerald wants to say is that a nation cannot operate solely on materialism. The spirits of individuals are the true composition of a nation."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"fItZgerald,,herald, the future that you can gleem in symbols of far off,HIS GENUIS,REGRET given full amplification in symbolic descrptions of GLITZ EMPTY ECHOES IN PONIFICATIOns.

Widely regarded as a masterpiece, I think The Great Gatsby took advantage of the claim as a marketing tool in a way of generating sales. But honestly, the book is just not that darn interesting. It lacks feelings, emotions, and realism, but F. Scott Fitzgerald does well in making his characters appear as robotic, unfeeling, and uninteresting. The most surprising thing about the book is how Jay Gatsby appears to be smaller than life. Had he been portrayed as a legendary figure, my opinion of the book would have been much dramatically different. Rather, he is an ordinary guy who happens to have money. Anyhow, if I had to suggest a much better book that deals with the same themes as The Great Gatsby did, it would easily have to be The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe. The Great Gatsby is dated in its details as they are also lacking of description whereas in The Bonfire of the Vanities (A Man in Full isn't too far off either) is more relevant to our times and is very revealing. I could almost taste it as if I was there, but in The Great Gatsby, it was difficult to follow the course of action at times. It could be the writing itself, but let's be honest, no matter how many revisions it will take, The Great Gatsby is not that interesting. It might be an accurate description of the Roaring Twenties, but let's face it, it was a dated era. Nevertheless, I was forced to read the book during high school and found nothing of substance. The second time I read it for pleasure during college, I still found nothing of substance. And now, I read it again for pleasure and still find absolutely nothing of substance. I want to make a comment about two things in the book. Every time Jay Gatsby calls Nick \\"old sport,\\" I cringe with my eyes shut. When Nick (the narrator whom I hate) suddenly said, \\"I just remembered that today's my birthday,\\" now...that is probably the worst moment of the book. It's just so stupidly random and so stupidly stupid. Even Sam Waterston had to pull out the Keanu Reeves moment by quoting the line. One part in the book where Jay Gatsby threw his clothes in the air, Daisy Buchanan remarked about the beautiful shirts. At that moment, I immediately flashbacked to Mia Farrow's over-the-top performance and wondered if I could get a glass ball from the dance club and whirl it above her. All in all, it is safe to say that The Great Gatsby has been vastly overrated over the years."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I think I would have enjoyed this book more if I had read it with a book club or an English class. The story is compelling enough but the writing and the symbolism were sometimes out of my grasp.I'm not thick-headed (or at least I don't think I am) but I tend to like to be hit over the head with things and I like characters who are direct and to the point (same with people in real life). I get frustrated when things are very subtle and I generally have no idea what the hell people are talking about. Which is how I felt about much of this book. It felt like people were speaking a different language...I just didn't understand it.I'm glad I finally read it and I'm really glad it was only 180 pages long."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As a much praised literary work of art, I must say, this book leaves much to be desired. While it does depict a historically accurate and believable account of the 1920s, not one of the characters seems to be anything more that a superficial comsumer or partygoer. Through the entire novel, Nick Carraway, our straighfoward, if not boring, narrator is a shadow of a real man, showing no courage or brain for himself. In the end, just when he could stand up and change the entire point of view for the characters, he chooses to stay comfortable in his little corner of his unimpressionable life. Unless you are being forced to read this for a class, or are drawn to incredibly dull and lifeless books, I would advise you to skip this and do something like wash your hair or watch paint dry, instead."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Nick Carraway having graduated from Yale and fought in World War I has returned home to find a job. Being unsettled, he decided to move to New York to learn the bond business. The novel opens early in the summer of 1922 in West Egg, Long Island, where Nick has rented a house and seems to be unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg. Next to his place, is the Gatsby's mansion. Shortly after his arrival, Nick travels across the Sound to the more fashionable East Egg to visit his cousin Daisy Buchannan and her husband, Tom, a hulking, imposing man whom Nick had known in college. While Nick is there, he meets a young woman golfer named Jordan Baker, whom Daisy wants Nick to be interested in. During dinner, the telephone rings, and when Tom and Daisy leave the room, Jordan informs Nick that the caller is Tom's woman from New York. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom's marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.As the summer continues, Nick turns his attention to his mysterious neighbor, who hosts weekly parties for the rich and fashionable. Upon Gatsby's invitation, Nick attends one of the extravagant gatherings. There, he bumps into Jordan Baker, as well as Gatsby himself. Gatsby, a gracious host, remains apart from his guest; more of an observer more than a participant. As the party winds down, Gatsby takes Jordan aside to speak privately. Jordan is greatly amazed by what she's learned from Gatsby.One day, Nick and Gatsby take a trip into the city and there Nick meets Meyer Wolfshiem, one of Gatsby's associates and Gatsby's link to organized crime. On that same day, while having tea with Jordan Baker, Nick learns the amazing story that Gatsby told her the night of his party. Gatsby, it appears, is in love with Daisy Buchannan. They met years earlier when he was in the army but could not be together because he did not yet have the means to support her. In the intervening years, Gatsby made his fortune, all with the goal of winning Daisy back. He bought his house so that he would be across the Sound from her and hosted the elaborate parties in the hopes that she would notice. It has come time for Gatsby to meet Daisy again, face-to-face, and so, through the intermediary of Jordan Baker, Gatsby asks Nick to invite Daisy to his little house where Gatsby will show up unannounced.The day for the re-acquaintance of Gatsby and Daisy finally arrives. Gatsby makes sure that everything is perfectly prepared, and wants every detail to be perfect for his reunion with his lost love. When the two former lovers meet, their reunion is slightly nervous, but shortly, the two are again comfortable with each other.. Later on, the three move the party from Nick's house to Gatsby's, where he takes special delight in showing Daisy his meticulously decorated house and his impressive arrangement of belongings, as if demonstrating in a very tangible way just how far out of poverty he has traveled.When Nick, Jordan, and Tom take a drive one day, they discover that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom's lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle's husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then turns the gun on himself.After Gatsby's death, Nick is left to help prepare for his burial, only problem is that no one seems overly concerned with Gatsby's death. A telegram from Gatsby's father indicates he will be coming from Minnesota to bury his son. Gatsby's funeral hosts only Nick, Gatsby's father, a few servants, the postman, and the minister at his gravesite. Although Gatsby, during his lifetime held high popularity, at the time of his death, he was completely forgotten.Nick, after everything he has experienced, heads back home to the Midwest."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book was a spark not version of the book, and it did not state that ANYWHERE in the description of the book. i am highly disapointed because i now have to go out and buy the actual book. it was very a big disapointment. i will never buy something from amazon again."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"AM I THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO HATES THIS BOOK?!?!?! I found the characters insipid, vacant and superficial, and I know that's the point Fitzgerald was trying to make, but instead of being deeply moved and inspired by the depiction of our society as shallow and meaningless like THE REST OF THE WORLD, I found myself incredibly disgusted and repulsed. I know this is the Great American Novel. I know that I'm supposed to appreciate it for its sublime beauty and honest portrayal of the Diseased Elite. But I don't."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Perhaps as a previous reviewer noted I missed some fundamental points of this novel. I hated it and couldn't stand the characters. I also couldn't help thinking of Su Tong's novella, Raise the Red Lantern. It takes place during the same time period, but in China. It's also about some wealthy individuals who make ruining other people's lives a sport. The difference is that Raise the Red Lantern is a much more interesting and suspenseful book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Well, I admit, I am let down. I concede that I am rating this from a scale of expectations; and on that scale, its rates only an okay. Like many, from time to time, I go back and pick up a \\"classic\\" to see what it is I missed the first time around. I was without a new read this particular weekend and picked up \\"The Great Gatsby\\" off of my daughter's required reading shelf of books from high school.Well, in comparison to other such deservedly vaunted works (\\"Moby Dick\\" is my second favorite book in a lifetime on such a re-reading), this one did not measure up. It was not just the ennui (although it was primarily that) that seemed to envelop one and all the characters (sparing only Nick, who I am guessing was the author's own self reflecting on his world), there also seemed to be evidence of an odd lack of discipline in spots. There were a couple of passages where the author seemed to have forgotten in whose voice he was speaking. In others, time and space are confused.(And, its only a minor complaint that Fitzgerald can't seem to stop using the work \\"murmur\\" to describe virtually every other audible utterance. Was this intentional?; I am not sure but it did strike me a bit lazy).But my biggest complaint was the lack of any inspirational bottom. Perhaps, indeed this was Fitzgerald's own experience, and I would have to guess in many ways it must have been. But while I have read many a novel full of misanthropes and other desperate souls, this is one of the few that are thought of as \\"great\\" in which virtually everyone seems to be lost or desperate, or, as to most of them, just so plain self-orbital, that one is left without some glimmer of hope. On reflection, aside from the pitiable Mr. Wilson, Jordan Baker (despite her tendency to lie and cheat) was perhaps the only character that elicited genuine empathy at the end of things- an insecure soul who had allowed herself to be finally vulnerable to her feelings for Nick only to be let down by his withdrawal from her, when he finally retreated from the ennui of the East. Only she seemed \\"human\\" in a way that one could understand or tolerate.A friend once laughed at me for describing Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" as a hopeful novel. Yet despite a post-apocalyptic world full of survivalist desperation, there was at its core a message of the hope of delivering a next generation into a world with the faintest glimmer of new awakening in it. In Gatsby, in contrast, the only child in the novel is revealed briefly as an ornament for her mother's parlor gathering, and then ushered away for her parents to get on with the party. And, the author ends the book with a despairing description of human hope as being washed away with the sands of time.I have to admit Fitzgerald could set a stage for dramatic, and sometimes emotionally gripping moments, although the scenes sometimes (too often it seemed) bordered on melodrama. The characters, were, for the most part, richly rendered and he was able, at times, to make them make me laugh. Indeed, the symbolism of the settings he described was wonderfully rendered. In these respects, I can admire the flourish of his writing.And as for my disappointment with the substance, that may well have been the product of a gifted writer (and that much is clear) working in that gilded age after the Industrial Revolution and before the Great Depression.BUT,\\"the great American novel\\" (of which there are many) should some, for this reader, offer some source of inspiration or at least enlightenment. In the end, this exquisitely written book left me feeling empty in the way that its well sated characters did after their summer season's tragic end."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is a seriously awesome book. Quite simply, you must read it. I know you've heard it before: allow me to join in praising it.The first thing I'd like to point out is Fitzgerald's brilliant use of symbolism. The cars, the colors, various characters' glasses... these aren't just trivial things, you know. Pay close attention to them.Anyway, the next thing I'd like to discuss is the character of Gatsby himself. A very intriguing figure. In fact, he's a bit of an enigma to me in that I have no definite opinion on whether or not I admire him. My opinion on the other characters is clear-cut (I mostly dislike them, other than Nick - which I believe was Fitzgerald's intention, to portray the rich as shallow and irresponsible - another thing that comes off brilliantly). But Gatsby... I'm not sure on Gatsby. I have to salute him for sticking with his dream for so long, in spite of its hopelessness, but the ends of said dream would have resulted in disaster for all parties involved, and his motives would be questionable. Gatsby is charismatic, well-read, determined, and intelligent; he is also greedy, self-absorbed, and stuck in the past. In other words, very human. And that's the most intriguing part of his character: when the end comes, I am unsure whether or not I feel Gatsby deserved his fate. Something to ponder. I like books that make me think deeply, and this is one of them.As for Fitzgerald's language, let us say he has total mastery over it. I knew he was a phenomenal writer from reading a collection of his short stories before I picked up Gatsby, but nothing could prepare me for what this book would present. Fitzgerald was a very, very talented writer, and there's a fine reason why he is widely considered one of the best. Books don't get much better.As an attack on the fast, hard lifestyles of the wealthy (something Fitzgerald himself knew a lot about), and as a meditation on how time's passage can ruin lives, this is equally brilliant. Easily one of the best books I've ever read. Every character is fully fleshed out, even seemingly (but only seemingly!) trivial characters like Old Owl Eyes; the symbolism is perfect, the language is stunning, and the book is just the right length. I can think of no criticisms."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gastby is honestly one of the greatest books out there these days. Despite the infamous spellin errors, Fitzgerald really pulls off a complicated relationship that truly reveals the true ideals and values of the new American Dream.Dedicated to his wife Zelda, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a quick compilation of his passion for her, pouring out every single rush of emotion from pen to paper. After Fitzgerald's rocky relationship with Zelda, he decided to embed his experience into a book replete with mistakes as a result of his burst of emotion and fervor.The Great Gatsby argues that even if an individual is determined enough to chase a dream to the ends of the earth by any means necessary, his social status would remain the unchanged. Left with no choice, Gatsby is forced to perform illegal actions, like bootlegging, in order to gain monetary success. With this wealth, Gatsby can successfully compete with Tom and win Daisy over. However, Daisy cares not only about the wealth of her husband, but also the reputation and social status. However, the only way Gatsby was able to obtain that much wealth in a short period of time was to bootleg, an illegal action that would lower anyone's social standing. In the hierarchy of society, an individual is rarely able to move up on the social ladder. Because Gatsby had to earn his wealth through illegal means, his reputation was thus undermined. Because his goal was to win Daisy's heart, he cared less about his appearance to his contemporaries and thus sacrificed his image for his goal. Despite his determination, he was unsuccessful in that he died before he could fully experience Daisy's love, ultimately coming up short.Even though he had gained the wealth he needed, his goals were eventually hindered and obstructed, as he died without his dear love. Because the story ends as a tragedy, Gatsby represents a low social standing individual who failed to reach his goal, despite his quick path to financial success. Though he came close, he still could not hold back the repercussions of a society, in which reputation mattered as much as wealth.I recommend this book, because it's ideas are intriguing and realistic and can potentionally happen to you."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I never read this book in school but it is on my classics list so i read it. Often times with the \\"Must reads\\" I am disappointed but this was not the case here. I am glad I read it. Interesting story, quite possibly the best character development ever written and certainly worth the effort."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald has written a classical portrait of life in the 1920's in America. Nick Carraway narrates this tale from the sidlines more as a spectator rather than as a participant. Jay Gatsby, the main character in this engrossing tale of life among the party set of what has become known as the roaring twenties, is a somewhat vague shadow of a character especially when compared with the other richly portrayed personalities. Perhaps it a virtue of the book that Gatsby remain a mystery man to the reader. \\"Old sport\\" is a phrase overused ad nauseum and gives Gatsby a grating personal quirk that was off-putting to this reader. Perhaps this was intentional on the part of Fitzgerald to keep Gatsby from being a more sympathetic rather than tragic figure. This novel has become a standard literature piece in the college-level curriculum as it lends itself to many insights to the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"While I was reading it about a month ago, The Great Gatsby seemed like a pointless story of spoiled rich people, too lazy to commit adultery successfully, let alone make a marriage or even romance work. There was a lot of description about the period, and society behavior of the period, that didn't seem particularly relevant, and the end seemed morally ambiguous. However, much of this short novel has stuck in my mind, especially the characters, longer than other novels I read (mostly sci-fi and mysteries).It also seemed a mistake to make the protagonist a bystander with only passing reference to Gatsby during the first third of the novel. On reflection, this probably built up the mystery about the character and kept me reading. Since then I've watched the movie with Alan Ladd, and they dropped that device, bringing Gatsby in early. The movie seemed like it would be thoroughly dull to anyone who hasn't read the book, though relatively faithful for a Hollywood adaptation."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Considered one of the best and most important books in English, Francis Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the few intellectual novels that are at the same time widely popular. The writer's vivid descriptions of the Jazz Age ranks as the best, and his language and character development can be understood by young and adult readers both.Published in 1925, this book has many events inspired by Fitzgerald wealthy life. The narrator --and one of the main characters--, Nick Carraway, like his creator, is a young man from Minnesota educated at an Ivy League School (Yale), who moves to New York after the war. At the same time, the main character, Jay Gatsby, also share many things in common with Fitzgerald. Both are young and sensitive, and, what is more interesting, is the fact that they have a very romanticized vision of wealth and love, and felt in love with a young woman when in a military camp in South.Nick starts his narrative telling that his readers an advice his father gave him, telling that when he feels like criticizing someone he should remember that he is not in a position of doing so, because he has had many advantages in his live. Beginning with that, it is sort of a disclaimer as if the writer is telling that in his narrative he is just portraying a story, rather than making judgments on the events and people. Smart movie -- since most of the novel reads like a big criticism against the lost of the American Dream, due to money and corruption.Nick is learn bond business, and lives in New York. He rents a house in the West Egg district. His neighbor seems to be wealthy and happy -- he is throwing parties in an everyday base. One day he goes to East Egg to visit his cousin Daisy and her husband. He meets young Jordan Baker, a young woman who claims to know his neighbor. He is Mr Gatsby. She also tells him that Tom has a lover.Days later, Jordan invites Nick for a meeting and tells him about Daisy and Gatsby. They used to date before the war. And now, the man wants that Nick and Jordan arrange a meeting for him and Daisy at Nick's. Once the couple meets again, the tragedy starts in the characters lives.By telling this American Tragedy -- and loss of American dream -- Nick is very contradictory. To begin with he is making judgments -- not following his father advices --alternating moments when he is very objective, and moments when he seems to give his own interpretation of the facts. What also has resonance in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is the nostalgic tone adopted by the narrator. He seems to be telling about the end of a civilization that no longer exists, and at the same time he feels guilty for its destruction.On another point, Nick/Fitzgerald is criticizing the hollowness of the upper classes. This is the part when the book has a sociological --and not only literary-- interest. The West Egg citizens represent the noveau rich; while the East Egg ones are the aristocracy. The newly riches are vulgar and have no social grace or taste. Gatsby is his most effective example of that. But the aristocracy, on the other hand, lacks heart -- they don't care if hurt other people. Ironically Gatsby's best qualities (love and loyalty) are what lead him to the tragedy.\\"The Great Gastsby\\" is a very short and entertaining book. Written with beautiful language and extremely well characters. It is a passionate and unforgettable portray of a civilization that doesn't exist any longer -- like something gone with the wind."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I don't think &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a perfect novel, but it is better than most I have read.

It is often read in English classes and sometimes read on one's own. If you like novels from this time period, the 1920's, this book is one you must read. But if you are like me and prefer modern novels, let me suggest not reading it. The plot is quite simple, a man who has finally made his fortune is attempting to win back the love of his former conquest who married to her station while he was on duty in the army. This man will do anything to impress his boyhood love and goes as far as moving close to her and living an extravagant life with many parties in the hopes she will come to one. She avoids him, either wittingly or unwittingly, and he is forced to seek help from her cousin, a mutual acquaintance. He ends up getting in the middle and it is all a big mess, but you will have to read the book to find out how it ends. Fitzgerald shows the time period very well in the materialistic and secular sense. The plot is very well thought out and the use of foreshadowing and symbolism is very evident as one reads. It is a good book to read if you are interested in the time period or in romances of the bizarre sort. Unfortunately, if neither of these things catch your eye, it isn't a great book to bother with. It is tedious and slow reading. If you prefer more action, or perhaps more of a mystery, let me suggest a modern book. Or if you simply like to read in plainer language with a faster flow, read something else. If you are planning on reading this for a class, read it. It is educational in the sense that one learns a good deal about the 1920's and symbolism from it.

I defy anyone to pick a better word, for ANY word that Fitzgerald used in this epic novel.Though it was not a monetary success when first published (Fitzgerald actually made a living by writing short fiction for magazines and was paid enormous prices for his work when America was in a depression) the fact that it still sells the huge volume of copies each year speaks to its appreciation by those who love perfect prose.With the ease of writing these days (he wrote in long hand) it is a shame that there is not one novelist today who can match Fitzgerald's genius for putting words together."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book is nice and it came as described in the correct binder and cover.

He comes from poor stock, people to whom he is only loosely connected. Gatsby is a self-made man, but don't look too closely at how he made his fortune. Gatsby is fascinated by the beautiful, the rich, the flashy, and his goal in life becomes to be part of that world. At his core, Gatsby is deeply lonely and has no one with whom he can share his vision and his dreams. All around him disappoint him in the end."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the most exquisite books I have ever read to date that deals with most if not all aspects of love and the challenges of life. There is so much to learn especially for us in this modern world where so many people use the word \\"love\\" without really knowing what it truly means. The author is so descriptive that I sometimes felt as if I was in the story. He made it easy for readers to penetrate the souls of the characters and relate to their lives.The character development is prodigious, while prose is outstanding. I felt as much for Gatsby as I have for the other characters. He always had high aspirations, but his dreams were taken away from him by the fact he had to fight a war, and he could never be the same again after that war. Gatsby's ambition is to have his former love, who is now married to an unfaithful husband, a quest that saw outstanding twist and turns in the story to make it the great read we have heard so much about. Disciples of Fortune,with a similar theme, is another inspirational book that I read with The Great Gatsby for the month. This book is truly inspirational for everyone irrespective of race, gender, age or occupation."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Written for a generation that was brought up on Haratio Alger's formulaic juvenile novels, F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"Great Gatsby\\" dispels the myth of the American Dream. If you want to read a rags-to-riches story with a happy ending, you had better read something by Jackie Collins. Jay Gatsby is a tragic antihero who rises from humble beginnings to flamboyant riches while chasing a single dream. Nick, the narrator, describes Gatsby as having an \\"extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in another person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.\\" If money cold by everything, then Gatsby would have been the most fortunate of men. Unfortunately, his dream became an illusion. On Gatsby's deathbed, Nick ponders that Gatsby \\"paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.\\" The reality of the situation is that Gatsby is a man in love. His life was a concerted effort focused solely on winning Daisy back: acquiring wealth, buying the house across the bay, throwing his lavish parties, and befriending Nick.Gatsby is tragic because he, like everyone else, suffered from loneliness and wanted to experience authentic caring. He thought he found that in Daisy. He spent his life building wealth, mostly illicitly, in a misguided scheme to bring Daisy to him. Money was not his end but the means to his end. The people with money, represented by Tom and Daisy, do not care about authenticity or love: \\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smash up things and creatures and then retreat back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up their mess for them.\\" In a classically tragic ending, death is abundant. Not just people, but dreams. Gatsby's image of Daisy that Gatsby built up is now completely dead. The reality fails to live up to his expectations. The reality of the situation is that Gatsby was a man in love with an image. While Gatsby concentrated all of his life on winning Daisy back, the nouveau riche could not see beyond their own enjoyment. Told with an eye for cynicism, The Great Gatsby is an American classic and beautifully written; any group of lines can be extracted and appreciated on their own merits. The message of the Great Gatsby is just as poignant today as it was in the Jazz age."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald explores social dynamics in The Great Gatsby. It's worth tracking the character development time and time again in order to better understand inter-and-intra-personal dilemmas. Fickle Daisy, egotistical Tom, and detached Jay allow a close up view of people that are in reality much different from their superficial appearance. Reading The Great Gatsby has trained me to recognize facades, and penetrate them, to realize better relationships with people I might otherwise have misunderstood. Much is made of the colors in the book, the environs, and the historical context, but I've found the greatest value in trying to relate to characters whose actions and images are polar. A good test of whether or not you've penetrated the facade is if the characters' actions start to seem logical from their standpoint. It took a second read for me to get to that point."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"For years, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" has been my favorite book but this book has dethroned it.

Conversely, this must mean that &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is second only to Shakespeare. How sad. (He sounds like the Village Voice when it berated the movie &quot;Arthur&quot; for being a comedy about rich people.) The trouble with narrow schools of criticism is that they cease to be about the text and focus instead on their own dogmatic (or phlegmatic) view of the world. I suggest you just read the novel and make up your own mind. Bathe in Fitzgerald's descriptions (especially Nick's first sight of Daisy in the wind-blown room), the gradual unveiling of the truth about Gatsby, and the suspense and heartbreak of the last few chapters. (And avoid the Redford adaptation.)"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I usually do not enjoy reading but this book caught my attention a lot. In my opinion \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is not an outstanding novel but it is quite good. I would recommend this book for teenagers from 15 to 23 years old. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the best love stories I have ever read and it is also a suspense story. On the one hand we are encountered with the love between Gatsby and Daisy, which grows bigger as the story develops, and on the other hand we have Gatsby's secret; nobody really knows Gatsby but everybody enjoys his big parties. Once we find out why he organised them and why he surrounded himself with glitter, we admire him for his total dedication to his dream and for his endless search of love. Gatsby is a character with which we can easily identify because he is the embodiment of the American dream. in my opinion, the book shows how this dream will never came true because of careless and cruel people such as Tom Daisy and Jordan, who are materialistic. I would rate it with three stars because although the story is interesting the book is written in a very complex way. The only thing I would criticise about it is that the action does not start until the fourth chapter, which encouraged my reading."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"With flowing prose, Fitzgerald depicts through the simplest of plots the univervsal needs of every person. The success of this book does not simply lie in the fact that this author portrays the ideals of his time so well; applicable to today's society, it is the destruction of them as seen through the profound observations of the narrator that places this book among the elite. The impact of these observations is what highlights Fitzgerald's impressive skill. Not only does this author portray the historical pressures of society at the time, but he also interweaves advice through a simple plotline of love and greed. This advice does not act to accentuate the story, but to create it; it is the questioning of the push for the perfect life and what we define it as that allows this novel to stand alone. Read not for the sake of entertainment and strictly for the qualities of a good novel; look beyond the obvious into the social implications stated through the author's voice. Only then, will this novel become what it was intended to be - a helpful tool written to assist us in broadening our views on society.

One part trenchant social commentary, one part Dominick Dunne-like pot boiler, it's a rich, creamy, yet damning work you can savor page after page, perhaps the most taut piece of fiction ever written. Five Stars for language.The expositions on past as shaky prologue to future and of holding onto dreams too long until they inevitably go up in smoke, of materialism and greed, of class and of postwar disillusion - we've seen these elsewhere, sometimes told better.Fitzgerald's close seems an overly harsh indictment of The American Dream, obviously forged from the many unsympathetic characters of his story and the zeitgeist of the period. It does little to suggest that those who eschew the excesses that litter the landscape of Gatsby's world may be able to successfully build on their pasts and create a successful future - meeting and marrying a spouse grounded in Midwestern virtues, raising well-adjusted children, finding more intrinsic value in honest work, and for the most part looking back on their past with general contentedness.Five stars for exquisite storytelling; four stars for a period piece about classism and excess that will exist as long as civilization does."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I re-read this book for a book club, being ~20 years since I read it in high school. It was much better reading it as an adult, as one generally has a much better perspective on answering/understanding concepts of lust vs. love, desire/drive for material aquisitions and what importance it has in life. There are multitudes of discussion questions regarding this novel available on the internet, worth considering. I believe that our club's discussion of this book offered many different opinions, making it one our more intersting ones. Also, worth reading about F. Scott Fitzgerald's biography and seeing parallelisms between his life and the story. The book is relatively a quick read and maintains your interest. It is worth re-reading, particularly if it was something you read many a years ago."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Can one lead a happy life while hoping to relive the past? F. Scott Fitzgerald explores the perils of optimism in The Great Gatsby, which points out that although optimism sustains one's drive for life, the hope of a bright future may be devastating as it often requires the need to revive one's past, a difficult task that often generates misery when one's memories cannot be recreated. Fitzgerald portrays this message through America's famous Jazz Age set in the 1920's, as Jay Gatsby, a self-made man, rises from poverty to become one of the richest men in a fabricated town, West Egg. Despite his new role in society, Gatsby fails to achieve the only dream he has- regaining his ex-lover, Daisy Buchanan's love. Despite the two lovers' past intimate relationship, Daisy represents society's artificiality as she dismisses Gatsby's love to retain her husband, Tom, and cling onto Tom's noble name. This allows her to automatically achieve a protective seal of respect in society, which comes with Tom's last name, and therefore, does not need to be earned through hard work. Gatsby's tragic ending symbolizes not only the frailty of America's desire for true happiness and social equality, as seen through the fact that even Gatsby's wealth cannot overcome society's critical view of his poor roots. Fitzgerald thus explores the deep meaning of life and society through his creation of Great Gatsby, a man great only because of his rise from poverty, but tragic and pathetic to the noble, who accept only those with \\"royal blood.\\" The Great Gatsby is a timeless literary achievement because of its skillful and universal observation of human nature, but may prove to be depressing to those who enjoy comedy and \\"happily ever after\\" endings, as Gatsby ends up being far from normal people's view of \\"great\\"."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Laughter echoes into the chilly city air as a collection of musician delicately stroke their instrument to the beat of the party. Glasses click gently together, while men in black ties and women in luxurious dresses drown away life's problem under the elaborate mansion. In the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the story depicts the Jazz Age in the 1920s, while it revolves around the drama in the East and West Egg Village. Jay Gatsby, a self-made man, is hopelessly enchanted by the beautiful and married, Daisy Buchanan. Holding on to bittersweet memories, Gatsby hopes to rekindle the flame between them five years ago. As he desperately holds on to a lost dream, corruption and deception wiggles into the life of the upper classes.Set in the 1920s, Fitzgerald gives the reader a deeper understanding of the conditions and fast paced lifestyle of the Jazz Age. In a descriptive and easy to read manner, he guides the reader that one can have everything in the world, but true happiness lies within things that are not tangible. Masterfully Fitzgerald displays this through Jay Gatsby, whose obsession and only happiness lies blindly with the conceited Daisy. Without holding back, Fitzgerald explains the flawed nature that exists in every human being rich or poor. The story is filled with symbolism and unique imagery of the glamorous Jazz Age. The Great Gatsby is an instant classic and respectable piece of literature because of its refreshing viewpoint about the flawed American Dream, which illusion and chaos spur from."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece, The Great Gatsby, is definitely considered a classic for many reasons. The vivid details and outstanding descriptions of the setting are truly amazing. The major theme of this novel is the American dream which is portrayed with excellent hard evidence of the exact ear of the 1920's included.This has to be one of the greatest books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The plot flows which makes for easy reading, but is also very interesting which makes the book impossible to put down. I strongly suggest that every person make time to read this amazing piece of American literature. It is truly a work of art which has be studied for generations, and will continue to be studdied for many years to come."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The author of The Great Gatsby is F. Scott Fitzergerald. The theme of this novel is the declining of the American dream. The falling action of the story is a tragedy because the Gatsby, Wilson, and Myrtle Wilson die in the story. The setting of the story is in Long Island. West Egg and East Egg, which are both next to each other, are fictional places in the novel which are near New York City and are both separated from each other by a river. Nick Carraway, who is the main character of the story, narrates the story so well and is Gatsby's friend. A green light, which is in East Egg, can be seen from West Egg.In the plot, Nick drives to Daisy Buchanan's house in order to have dinner with Daisy Buchanan who lives with her husband, Tom, who is arrogant, and tall. Nick then drives to New York City with Tom and Myrtle, whose husband is George. They go to this party, which has a lot of people invited, in an apartment in New York City. After some time in the party, Tom punches her wife in the nose because her wife said that she would say Daisy a lot and because she was shouting when she said that. After many days, Gatsby sends a man to Nick's house in order to give him an invitation to Gatsby's party. The Owl Eyed man, who is a strange character, realizes that the books in Gatsby's library are real so he tells Nick and a few others that the book are real; however, Nick and the others probably don't believe that the books are real. After a long period in the novel, Nick, Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom go to New York City in order to go into a big building. After they leave the building, Daisy accidentally crashed her car into Myrtle Wilson who died at this time, so George Wilson, who loves her wife so much became angry at Jay Gatsby because he was in the car that hit her wife. At the end of the novel, Nick Carraway sits on the beach in West Egg staring at the light, which is in East Egg, on the other side of the river.There is a billboard in the story with a picture of a face of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg wearing glasses. The picture on the billboard is one of the symbols, which represents God staring down at the American people, in the story. Another symbol includes the valley of Ashes between West Egg and New York City. The valley of ashes represents the poor people. The green light is another symbol in the novel; it represents the Gatsby's hopes and dreams in the future.I believe the story is very interesting to read, so I would recommend others to read it. I enjoyed reading some parts of the novel very much such as when Gatsby told Nick Carraway about the accident between the yellow car and Myrtle Wilson and such as when Owl Eyes were talking about the books in Gatsby's library with Nick and his friends. George Wilson is a very interesting character because he is the only one that murders a person in the novel after getting angry after Tom tells George who killed his wife. Owl Eyes is also a very interesting character because he came to the funeral and Nick Carraway did not know that he would come to the funeral and because he crashed his car into another car. The wreck of his car was conspicuous to chauffeurs."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read this in my tenth grade English class.

Easily the closest thing to the Great American Novel yet."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have to say, that as is the case with many regarded literary classics, Gatsby took awhile to grow on me. Four years in fact.As a junior in high school this was required reading. I remember reading it then, checking out opinions on it before getting around to it, and becoming somewhat excited with the conversation and debate that would inevitably follow the assignment. I found the novel then, in complete contrast to my opinion now, to be a completely boring and pointless read.Last year as a college sophmore I decided to give it another go. Enough time had passed where I forgot many of the details of the piece that it naturally seemed like a good idea for a quick read. The lingering first impression of Gatsby, along with the seemingly endless amount of opinions contrasting with my own, convinced me that this book was worth a second shot.Without getting into various personal (and probably subjective) interpretations on the many themes and symbols throughout, I simply have to say that I now regard it as one of the best books ever written. While the aforementioned aspects of literature (themes/symbols) play a large part in distinguishing this book from many others, for me it was the prose and the story itself. It's just too bad it took some personal growth and a bit more patience to finally appreciate it- I can't even go on about it because I loved it so much."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Melanie VelaAmerican Literature IIMs. KroneJune 2, 2005Book ReviewThe Great Gatsby is a fictional novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald.It is a story of one man's desperate attempt at rekindling a past relationship with a beautiful woman named Daisy. She is a wealthy materialistic woman who, due to the difference of social classes, does not marry Gatsby, and while he is shipped off for war, marries a more wealthy man. The real conflict is set off when Nick Carraway, a distant cousin of Daisy comes to visit for the summer. He tries to help Gatsby win back Daisy, who has now become a very wealthy and popular man by throwing large extravagant parties. This leads to drama and conflictThis book is Fitzgerald's life in a couple hundred pages Fitzgerald is Gatsby in many ways. Gatsby moved to New York in hopes for fulfilling a dream and so too did Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald met and fell in love with a woman who would not marry him due to the fact that he had no money. He wins her over by becoming a famous author. The alcoholism that is portrayed in this play by the party guests reflects Fitzgerald who became a heavy drinker.The Great Gatsby was Fitzgerald's attempt at being remembered for a long time. It has always been his dream to be great. Gatsby was Gatz attempt at being great also. I think that is why Fitzgerald entitled his book The Great Gatsby, because Gatsby was supposed to be a great, popular guy who made something of himself. However, Gatsby wasn't great since everyone used him and his main goal to win over Daisy failed.This book was good in ways that the storyline was interesting and that the ending was very suspenseful. I also liked how Fitzgerald made the narrator a truthful and moral man as the narrator because it allowed the reader to trust that his details of the characters were right, and to trust his judgment which also allowed seeing the characteristics and personalities of each character. Fitzgerald's in depth description of different aspects was needed but at other times it just felt like a run on words. It at times did create the mood, but for the most part, it created a boring faade upon the reader. It was slow and the real action of the book occurred late.Overall, this book wasn't so good. I would not recommend the book to those who like action or drama in every page. The whole story was just one jumble of words that bored the reader page after page."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This title did bring out the society of the 1920's and was very well written. Prohibition caused social problems and classes in the society and F. Scott Fitzgerald certrainly showed he had an understanding of this society. I'm sure when this was written, many people were kind of offended at his not-so-perfect depiction of the life beneath the glamour of the 20's. Now it can be appreciated and I hope no one who reviewed this book had the audacity to review this book badly because it conflicted with their personal views. I hate when that stands in the way of enjoying a good book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is the best novel I think I have ever read. We had to read it in my high school English class and I loved it even then. I've read it two more time in the three years I have been out of high school, and I plan to read it at least one a year. I feel I have to, its like revisiting old friends who you wish you could help but you know you can't. This novel is awesome in the way that the characters just pop off the page. The Great Gatsby is so sad too because in the end no one &quot;wins&quot; except maybe for Nick who is a better man for having known Gatsby. Eventhough Nick believes that Daisy and Tom can retreat into their money and forget anything ever happened, Daisy still has to live with the fact that she got the only man who every really loved her killed, I don't think money could make her forget that. Anyway I recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it, although if you read it when you were in high school, I suggest reading it again, because you probably missed how beautiful this book is in the rush to have it finished before the test! Also, if any of you have not seen the movie go rent it or check for it on your local classic movie channel because I've seen the movie on one of those channels at least ten times. The casting is excellent. Mia Farrow was the perfect &quot;Daisy&quot; beautiful, delicate, her voice &quot;full of money.&quot; Nick, sweetly played by the lovely Sam Waterston. And lets not forget Robert Redford's portrayal of the great Jay Gatsby. I thought he did and excellent job. This movie is very beautiful and if you don't cry as Daisy and Gatsby renew their love, or when George mourns over Mrytle's body, then you are not human!! I could write all day about the book and the movie but I will just say that they are both worth checking out. Lose yourself in the decadent twenties!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is honestly my favorite book of all time.

Flowery language, moderately interesting story line. Skip the book, get the movie."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"May I throw a pebble into the pool? The Great Gatsby is widely regarded as a great novel and has been widely acclaimed as such, but having read through it twice I cannot agree. I am merely a well read person and lay no claims as to literary erudition but this book did not live up to my expectations. I found the writing very adjectival with constant use of metaphors, some of which seemed trite and effeminate. In addition the story moves at a slow pace, particularly in the first half of the book where there is much description and virtually no action. Obviously Fitzgerald depicts the period of the early twenties with prohibition allowing quick acquisition of wealth, but the fact that Gatsby returned from military service penniless and alone makes his construction of such a huge fortune in a few years seem unbelievable, even in that era. Gatsby is the least believable character in this whole novel. For much of the time he is a shadowy figure moping around in his infatuation with a woman he was parted from for five years. His behaviour verges on that of a love-sick teenager rather than a war hero. Of course the book depicts the decadence of the wealthy during that period superbly and at times the prose is beautifully descriptive, but the \\"Great American Novel\\" ???"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The ending seems quite abrupt, but that's not necessarily bad. The only thing that annoys me about this book is that the protagonist doesn't seem to have much depth. All of the other characters in the book are much more fleshed-out than the first-person narrator and it bugged me that it felt a bit hollow.Still good though."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A classic is a classic is a classic. There's no disputing why people still read this great American novel, and I was moved this time around more than ever. I originally read this work in college, and only mildly \\"got it\\". Actually, I wondered what the fuss was all about, but maturity brings wisdom and reading this now, in middle age, makes all the difference. Actually, in today's terms, Gatsby is the 1 per cent. (Need I say, this read couldn't be more apt due to one of the presidential candidates?) The prototype could not be better. Both Gatsby and his wife, Daisy are so shallow, not minding the eventual fate that meets them. Of course, Nick Carraway is a great witness to that demise. Written in the 1920's, it proves classics remain this way for a reason: good story matters. Good characters matter. Only so many books today meet the test."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"JUST MY OPINION.....While I do find the content of the book enjoyable,it has been somewhat agitating to read because too many times in the book,a sentence lacks commas thus making it difficult to quickly and clearly understandwhat the sentence is trying to express.For Example: About three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering changed.While this one is pretty easy to understand, would it kill to put a comma between \\"o'clock\\" and \\"the\\"?So... \\"About three o'clock, the quality of Wilson's blah blah blah...\\"This is one of the hundreds of the problem in the book.Maybe it's just me, but this book could be a lot better with some copy-editing. Seriously."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is a must read in most high schools, why can I buy the paperback for half of what a Kindle download costs? Thinking Kindle sounded good, but was a waste of money."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"There's two reasons we read this book in English class- Gatsby is perhaps not, as Huckleberry Finn or Lord of the Flies might be, an interesting enough story that we would read it on our own.- But it's important that we do, because Gatsby is a thematically rich and important book to analyze and study, to understand our country and its past.I've read it a few times now, and with each additional read, I remember why I was a little bored the first time though, but how I appreciate this great work of literature more and more with each new read and each new discussion about it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This classic tale tells the story of Gatsby, a self-made man and his doomed love for a married woman he'd met prior to her marriage. The narrator is Nick Carraway who lives next door to Gatsby on Long Island and is present for all the major moments in the affairs of his friends.It seemed odd to me that these people wanted Nick to witness their sordid conversations and assignations. The author seems to want to give Nick a romance of his own, but Nick's relationship with Jordan is never fleshed out. The focus is on Gatsby, a person I both disdained of and championed. He is rich and throws huge parties, but the people around him are hangers on who know nothing of him and enjoy spreading rumors about him in his home, while also eating his food and drinking his beverages. He cares nothing for these people and is only having the parties in order to draw his love to him. Sadly, when he needs them, these people do not come and he is alone.This is another classic which I found myself disappointed in. I expect that for books to become classics, there must be something remarkable about them, but I didn't find much to remark on with this book. It was not as difficult to adjust to the cadence and style of writing of this author and this era than other classics I've read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I really enjoyed reading Fitzgeralds Great Gatsby in class. I'd always heard of it but never actually read it so I'm glad we had to read it in english. The thing I enjoy most in a book is it's description, I like feeling like I'm actually there in the room with a character, and in Gatsby I was able to do just that. I love how detailed he is in describing the different locations they travel to and the people they meet.I liked how it exposed the corruption and manipulation that comes with the power of money. Well not to say that all people with large amounts of money are corrupt, because Fitzgeralds clearly showed that even Myrtle who was poor and lived in a shabby home can be just the same as the rich and spoiled. It just goes to show that money can make anybody do crazy and dumb things. Like Tom and Daisy for example, they're infinity for excitement lead to the death of three people and yet they were able to back away clean of any remorse because of there status in society. Also there is George who was the most innocent of them all but because of Tom and Daisy's carelessness was driven to become a \\"madman\\"."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I've read this book at three different stages of my life: when I was a teen, when I was making the transition into adulthood, and when I had an active social life in part of a club scene. Each time I read this book it had a different meaning, and I've enjoyed it more as I've aged. I swear, reading the descriptions of the gossips and drunken flappers was made relevant by my having to deal continuously with their modern counterparts. As for the book itself, it's a good story, and the ending is especially nice if you like feeling down after reading. It's a fine book, well worth picking up again when it's no longer \\"required\\" reading."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It has been a while since I read a book in one sitting. It has also been a while since I first read \\"The Great Gatsby\\". Since then, I read articles and saw movies about F. Scott Fotzgerald and his wife Zelda. It is hard not to draw some similarities between Fitzgerald's best work and the way his own life ended. Without going thru the plot, this is all american story about difference between old money and new money. Not all rich are created equal. It is also a story of obsessive love that will not let go. Can a man love so much that getting rich in order to be close to the woman of his dreams can consume his entire life? How much does it take for a person to understand that one cannot live in the past? Love story is set in it's moment, time and place. Once any one of the components is not there, love is not the same or there is none at all left. And then of course, there is pure love and there is recklessness - way of using people and there emotions as means of reassuring ourselves - with always disasterous outcomes. This book talks about all of that in a way that feels like being said in one breath. Storytelling is so compelling and language so beautiful, you cannot put this book down until you are finished reading it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I had forgotten how delightful and evocative this book is--or perhaps it just all went over my head back in high school.It has made me think of three things: devices that compel the reader forward, the way a story folds, unfolds, and reveals, and death in the novel.The thing that propels the book forward--the mysterious Gatsby--is introduced at the very beginning. Although this initial mystery does not take us to the end of the novel, nor is it even a particularly revelatory device, the mystery does get things going, giving Fitzgerald the space to lay out his characters, their place and time, and the voice of his narrator.Once we get to the bottom of the Gatsby mystery, once we learn Gatsby's history and motivation, the story continues to unfold. And the real telling of the story, the real events, surround the characters and their clashes with one another, with their desire and the things that either get in the way of their desire, or the things that the satiated desire reveals. And it is in this wanting and getting that the real story takes shape.And then I wonder about death in the novel. I suppose I wonder this because I just finished Moody's \\"Ice Storm\\" and I feel as though the death in that book was somehow unnecessary--not that I can imagine the novel completing itself without the death. In fact, I don't know what else would complete the book. But in the particular instance of Moody's novel, the death seems too convenient. Even in Gatsby, death comes not in the messy, senseless way of real life, but in the meaningful (if only for the protagonist) way of fiction. But of course, that it exactly what it is."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This story is by far the greatest piece or fiction ever by an American writer. I am a high school English teacher and as such have read many novels, none however, compare to this work.The characters are interesting, they come alive off the page. The story is compelling, so much so that you will be tempted to read the book cover to cover in one day. It also made a great movie.This book will stick with you for years to come."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I was essentially forced to read the book, and I am glad I was. While I was reading this book, I thought I was watching a soap opera. It has everything you could want in a interesting, action packed story, everything from love triangles and murder to back stabbing and philosophical enlightenments.The book gave me a pretty clear and convincing perspective about the early to middle 20th century obsession with the American dream, otherwise known as the great, ideal, promising American dream. The tragic story of Jay Gatsby exemplifies the flawed aspects of the American dream, warning readers even from modern day of the danger and sacrifice demanded from the pursuit of the American Dream. And because we are a growing society still pursuing financial success in most matters, the book applied and will apply in the near future."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"While I was reading it about a month ago, The Great Gatsby seemed like a pointless story of spoiled rich people, too lazy to commit adultery successfully, let alone make a marriage or even romance work. There was a lot of description about the period, and society behavior of the period, that didn't seem particularly relevant, and the end seemed morally ambiguous. However, much of this short novel has stuck in my mind, especially the characters, longer than other novels I read (mostly sci-fi and mysteries).It also seemed a mistake to make the protagonist a bystander with only passing reference to Gatsby during the first third of the novel. On reflection, this probably built up the mystery about the character and kept me reading. Since then I've watched the movie with Alan Ladd, and they dropped that device, bringing Gatsby in early. The movie seemed like it would be thoroughly dull to anyone who hasn't read the book, though relatively faithful for a Hollywood adaptation."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Gatsby was a beautifully written novel, set in the Jazz Age. Written from the point of view of Nick Carroway, it was told from a subjective point of view providing the only interesting part of the novel. I'm not saying this was a bad book, Fitzgerald is a phenomenal writer, but even so I couldn't make myself care about the characters. Maybe that wasn't the point, but from the perspective of a pleasure reader it made the book rather dull. As a study of the culture of the twenties or of the theme of time in a period coming directly after WWI, it is amazing and captivating, but the characters were so shallow that I felt a strong detachment as i was reading further and further into the novel. Gatsby is a complete flop, spending all of his energy tryig to redo the past, Daisy is so flippant that you can't truly care for her, Tom cheats on his wife and hits his girlfriend, and Nick allows himself to get sucked into their games. Although written well, and worth all the acclaim it has recieved i personally did not enjoy this novel or find it particularly engrossing."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"To only have lived in this well depicted time period.

I re-read it constantly just to pretend I'm there."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby was possibly the single greatest book I've ever read. The attention to detail is amazing. He puts in short descriptions of all of the characters. This book is a model for a love story. This is like a building block for modern love stories."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read this whole book in one sitting. I LOVED IT!! It is by far my new favorite book. It was truly the first \\"school book\\" that I could not put down. I highly suggest it!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I first read The Great Gatsby while in high school. I thought it was wonderful at the time, but I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now that I've read it for the second time. The story of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan enthralled me from beginning to end. Written during the Jazz Age, which is also the story's backdrop, F. Scott Fitzgerald tells the tragic and decadent love story of an impoverished officer who seeks wealth in an attempt to woo Daisy. He also happens to want to obtain a respectable place in society. However, Gatsby's attempts to obtain both Daisy and richness beyond his wildest dreams backfire and he soon falls from grace in a poignant conclusion that brought tears to my eyes.Someone once asked me if I wanted to be like Jay Gatsby -- if I wanted to aspire to things beyond my means and want someone who will never be within my reach. And that is the reason why this novel touched me so much. It spoke to me. Gatsby is one of the most compelling characters ever written. And the love story is quite a sad one, but I think that that's what makes it memorable and special to me. And the fact that the story is narrated by a third character -- Nick Callaway -- makes the reader appreciate both sides of the coin, though Callaway is quite vocal about his own observations and prejudices. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a true American classic. I have read it twice and will no doubt reread it at some stage in the future. I cannot recommend this American classic enough."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This story starts out relatively slow, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It tells the story of Jay Gatsby who tries to win back the love of Daisy Buchanan with his money. The story is narrated by Nick Carroway who views all aspects of the rich. Whether it's the front that Gatsby puts on or the deception between the Buchanan's, he views it all. The American Dream is the theme throughout this novel which seems to be what every character longs for. Overall I would definitely recommend this novel because many people could learn a valuable lesson that the \\"American Dream\\" is not all that its cracked up to be."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Scott Fitzgerald has been showered with praise and celebrated as one of the great authors of the century, and deservedly so. His language is remarkable because he uses quite an extensive vocabulary with the utmost precision, and is able to create vivid characters with a few succint phrases, a few strokes of the artist's brush. However, there are two things that strike me as odd in this novel: the &quot;prologue&quot;, that is, the first few paragraphs, which must have been written after the rest of the novel had been completed. This is a strange and ambiguous opening, and I am not sure that it is very good. And secondly the ending itself, because closure is brought about by introducing an accident (Daisy running over Tom's mistress). Somehow this is not satisfactory, at least not to me, because it avoids a final confrontation between the characters. Here Fitzgerald may as well have sent down a bolt of lightning to kill someone! People's fates in literature should be decided by themselves or by some other character, not by something beyond anyone's control. Why? Because that negates that character is fate and action; in fact, EVERYTHING in a novel should stem from character."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This was a great story about six or seven really messed up people whose lives' get thrown together. Inevitably, the story ends in tragedy. Really, the story centers around the main character's dream to find a relationship. This dream ended in adultery and murder. The character, Nick, from which the story is told from in the first person, gives this conclusion,\\"His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him....Gatsby believed in the (dream), the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then but that's no matter- tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"In a sense, the story is a dark account of humanity's failure to achieve happiness in pleasure, relationships and money. In trying to achieve these things, mankind ruins lives. In the end, we find that the wealthy, popular Gatsby only has three people at his funeral. While the number of people at a funeral is not a marker of success or happiness in life, it does show that attempts at popularity, wealth and power does not add up to much in the end."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read the Great Gatsby for school in my junior year of high school and loved it. It is beautifully written and is full of great insight. It is an awesome example of Lost Generation literature. The ending is fantastic. Please read this book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Most classics fall into one of two traps. The first: thick, tedious prose, tiny font, 800 pages of 18th, 19th century drama. The second: a theme so blatant it sits beating the reader on the head, neglecting the fact that stories still have things called a story. Most fall into one of those two situations--thick or preachy.Not Gatsby. Oh no. Gatsby falls into neither classic trap. You can read it in a day and enjoy yourself doing it. Actually, you can read it in a few hours and enjoy yourself just as much as if you were rereading The Hobbit or Harry Potter. Then, once you've finished, you look back and see, to your wonderment, how powerful and deep The Great Gatsby really is.And that is only part of Fitzgerald's success.The entire work is highly precise. Every word has its reason for being there. None are wasted. The themes are embedded in precise locations so as not to jump out at the reader and consequently distract them from the story.Speaking of the story, Fitzgerald does what many classical novelists fail to do--tell one. Fitzgerald told a story about this man, Gatsby, who invented himself. As a result, he told a story about following dreams, and ambition, and living life, and viewing life, and carelessness. But he told the story about Gatsby, and the people around him, first.In that way, he avoided theme device, and plot devices, and made for an impeccable, enjoyable, thought-provoking read. Thus, five stars from me for the best classic I have ever read, The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"+++++This interesting novel was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896 to 1940). It takes place during \\"The Jazz Age,\\" a term Fitzgerald actually coined. This period of the early-to-mid-1920s \\"was an age of miracles...an age of art...an age of excess, and...an age of satire.\\"The novel is about Jay Gatsby (whose actual name was James Gatz), a newly wealthy Midwesterner-turned-Easterner who orders his life around one desire: to be reunited with Daisy Fay (she's now married and known as Daisy Buchanan), the love he lost five years earlier. His quest for the American Dream leads him from poverty to wealth and then into the arms of his beloved. By the end of the novel, we get to see the ugly side of the American Dream.There are many socially insightful themes evident in the story. Some include (1) wealth (a key theme), (2) superficiality and shallowness (3) selfishness (4) materialism (5) societal expectation (6) societal stratification (7) immorality and (8) appearances.Something else that this novel is known for is its \\"breathtaking lyricism.\\" As a writer, Fitzgerald is very sensory-orientated. Here is one small example of his fantastic writing found throughout the novel:\\"He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in a many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange and monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\\"This particular book includes other relevant information and insight about the novel and its author. The most helpful for me were the \\"explanatory notes\\" that explained key terms in the novel. Here is an example:\\"West Egg/East Egg: The fictionalized geography of [this novel] was based on the actual geography of Long Island and the borough of Queens. See map [that has the caption \\"Long Island: East Egg to Manhattan].\\"Finally another interesting thing about this particular book is that its cover (displayed above by Amazon, be sure to click on \\"see larger image\\") has the original dust cover that was on the first published novel. This is \\"the most celebrated--and widely disseminated--jacket art in twentieth century American literature.\\"In conclusion, be sure to read this engrossing novel to discover for yourself why \\"Fitzgerald stands out as one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century!\\" As well, also discover why the social insight found in this novel is still highly relevant for the twenty-first century!!(first published 1925; this particular novel published 1999; 9 chapters; 180 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I enjoy reading about people and places in existance prior to my lifetime. This book offers the best read for insight into the aristocractic society in the 1920s. While I did not find the characters to be likable, I believe their story to be interesting and a likely sampling of that period of time in the cities of America. The novel is an easy, fast read and worth the time if you are interested in expanding your knowledge in Classic American Literature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is F. Scott Fitzgerald's cynical take on the decline of the American Dream in the 1920s. Instead of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, Fitzgerald believed that Americans had become obsessed with the desire to accumulate great personal wealth, and that desire corrupted them. In \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" the title character tries to impress his lost love, Daisy, by throwing extravagant parties at his Long Island home every Saturday night. The reason why Daisy and Gatsby never got together in the first place was because they came from two very different social classes, which is why Gatsby eventually resorted to a life of crime in order to make enough money to capture Daisy's affections. Unfortunately for Gatsby, Daisy is nothing like the amazing woman he has built her up to be: she is selfish and shallow until the very end, and her actions ultimately end up costing Gatsby everything.The book is narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's next-door neighbor. At first Nick is drawn in by all the glitz and glamour that the New York lifestyle has to offer, but eventually he becomes disgusted by the behavior of this so-called \\"elite\\" group of people. Nick also becomes involved with Jordan, a friend of Daisy's who comes across as being beautiful and charming one minute and then cold and unfeeling the next. In a way, Nick sometimes acts as Fitzgerald's voice in this novel, describing his bitterness about the lack of morality that is plaguing the nation. At the end of the novel, Nick has become so disenchanted by everything he has witnessed in New York over the course of a single summer that he decides to return to his home state of Minnesota, where life is much simpler and moral values are much more intact.I think \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is just as relevant to today's world as it was when it was originally published. Fitzgerald's readers will have a lot to contemplate after they finish this book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book's rating on Amazon has lowered significantly for the simple reason that generations of high school students have been forced to read it. Hence the young review below who hysterically complains, \\"it could have been shorter.\\"Simply put, it's not an adolescent's book. It's a novel about the tail end of youth, not the beginning. All the characters have reached a point in there lives where the party has begun to die, and find there is little waiting for them in the light of day. Thus they are perfect metaphors for the Jazz Age, for capitalism and America itself.It's also one of the most stunningly written love stories ever written, conveyed in a completely opaque manner. Fitzgerald expresses characters' relationships with little more than snapshots, gestures and tones of voice. The way that Daisy kisses Gatsby while her husband is in the other room. The way that the Bucahanans talk to each other in the kitchen of their house. It takes a brilliant writer to use such opacity to his advantage.Fitzgerald basically defined American tragedy with this novel. The mixture of ambition, romanticism and shame that constitute Gatsby make him perhaps the most archetypal tragic figure since Oedipus. It's simply a great book and nothing more."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"What makes a good book good?I know what I think, but empirically, there should be some guidelines. So I googled, \\"What makes a good book good\\"...The very first result is a book here at Amazon called:How to Good-Bye Depression: If You Constrict Anus 100 Times Everyday. Malarkey? or Effective Way? (Paperback)by Hiroyuki NishigakiGo ahead, google it yourself. I'll wait.And please read the two paragraph editorial review. I promise it will be the best thing you've read this week. There's just so much to love. Can we talk about that book instead?*At fourteen, The Great Gatsby was my first love.Twenty years later, it's still my favorite, perhaps though for different reasons.The central theme is simple--you can't recapture the past.What's also notable is how this story is so very American. Gatsby, the American archetype, was a poor man in love with a rich girl. Through whatever means he employed, he made a fortune. He reinvented himself and showed up again to win her heart.The idea of being able to be anyone you want to be, or being to change your life mid-course, is an (almost uniquely) American characteristic.Having money, though, is equated with moral flaws. Fitzgerald hammers the point home that people with money are careless: Careless about things and about other people.I vacillate between favorite characters. Usually it's a tie between the narrator, Nick Carraway and Jay Gatsby himself. Gatsby is the modern tragic hero.If you haven't read it in a while, pick it up again. You might find something new to like about it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Someone much more read, much more important in the world of letters, and much more famous, was asked a simple question -- what is the greatest American novel that you have ever read? Without hesitation, this author of conceivably a few candidates for such an accolade, blurted out the answer -- and without any embarrassment or any second thoughts -- the book is \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" That person was Fitzgerald's friend and foe -- Ernest Hemingway.To any young person reading this book, I can only suggest that you swallow every word, understand that each is placed in a precise place for specific reasons. Tight --a term used by the 1920's meaning drunk and which Fitzgerald may have been much of the time while writing this novel -- describes the writing style of this classic. Nothing wasted. Nothing but pure and calculated prose delivering the reader with crisp, succinct and pithy portrayal of its characters and issues.I will not discuss the story. Hopefully, a new reader reads the book without reading others' interpretations. This is a classic. This is a great read. Take this book for a slow and enjoyable ride.You will finish the book, close the cover, and say to yourself what Hemingway probably said, \\"Now that's a novel.\\"And, like many other readers of this book, you may very likely open its covers again and again in your future. Good books entice you to read them over and over.His sales prove that the book has been read multiple times. It has sold more than 10 million copies. Selling over 10,000,000 copies is something which most writers dream of doing for all of their books in their entire career -- something which few can proclaim. This book meets that criteria by its one copyrighted version. Amazing.Sadly, this book today -- in the United States alone -- sells 1.66 books a MONTH for every book sold during the LIFETIME of Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald unfortunately never got to see his work appreciated the way it deserved/deserves to be. In some respects, Fitzgerald's career is as sad or sadder that the protaganist in his greatest novel."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I do think it is a very good example of what good construction of a novel is. That might be why people think it is a soap opera instead of being the solid writing that it is. The main difference between the soap opera and this is a soap opera doesn't really incorporate an opinion about it's characters although it does construct situations that are meant to reach the lowest common denomonator. In this story, as opposed to soap operas, it does have a cut off point where you can not notice certain details of the story that change the significance somewhat, mainly, Fitzgerald's opinion of his characters and how they play. There has never been a character in a soap that is portrayed in such a knowing way than the narrator. What's so interesting is how he can insinuate certain things about the main character with the words he says. I would be interested to see how little kids react to this book and how older people do because of children's tendency to take everything literally and older people's ability to see through the lies, or half-truths. It really is a good novel and I don't want to actually detail the plot because I want you to discover it without my introduction. I will give you the main character, though, the title character is named The Great Gatsby, but his real name is Gatz and he becomes an aquaintance of Nick, the main character who sees himself as objective and fair, and his cousin Daisy Buchanan who's married to Tom. That's all I'll tell you, read it and have fun, it's a short read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book for people ages 12 and up. It really captures life in the 1920's in a way that leaves you breathless. This book is not made for optimists; its ending is very depressing. This resolution, however, is needed in order for the reader to receive the full impact of what the author is trying to say. Fitzgerald does a remarkable job of using symbolism of many aspects of the book. It is the symbolism that really makes the book the great book it is. The only negative aspect of the book is the extensive vocabulary Fitzgerald uses in certain sections of the book. It is good to have juicy vocabulary in a novel, but the author just saturates his book with these vocabulary words. This takes away some of the interest in the reader, for they will spend some time pondering what the author was talking about. Overall, the Great Gatsby is a wonderful book for everyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is the very first book by F.Scott Fitzgerald that I have read, and it was actually engrossing and interesting. There are parts that seem to move slow, but the author makes up for it with his amazing lyrical writing/description and his great characterization. The way he writes of the character's reactions and emotions seems so realistic, that is what I beleive will make it easy for one to read and get \\"into\\", so to speak.Now, yes, Fitzgerald was an alcholic, but that does not mean that he wrote this while being drunk. Quite the contrary; Fitzgerald is known for his notorious revisions - in which 'Gatsby' was revised several times before he was satisfied with it.I am saying this to basically let the reader know that it is very worth giving it a chance, and even though by the end it may not be ones' \\"favorite\\" story, however it is a very good introduction into the writings of F.

Though it may only be a story of a man, he was indeed a memorable one."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fiztgerald's The Great Gatsby is the tragedy if not death of the American Dream. Jay Gatsby longs to become rich and captivate his only love. It depicts the longing to relive the past intricately yet adds a feeling of grand admiration for Gatsby. Gatsby was just a man, surrounded by attitudes and consequences. This book only lets the reader admire a fictional character while leaving him or her without a learned lesson or a thought to ponder over. I truly believe the essence of this book is powerful yet only for the main character not the public. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read of made-up legends and unique characters but not to the the vivid reader who hopes to find a momentum to retrive from it and carry in throughout life."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"What could I say about this book that hasn't been said before?

Nick becomes, well, disillusioned with the 'glamorous' life Daisy and Tom are leading, he realizes how shallow and corrupt they are. Gatsby isn't dull, he's a fascinating character study. Don't you see how he's trying to recreate the past, but can't? Even Daisy is full of symbolism- like the name. A daisy is white and pure looking, but on the inside (like Daisy) it is yellow- which stands for sickliness, corruption, etc. This is also a beautifully written book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book was a study of the nature greed and ambition, and what they lead to.

It was a book for my son's English class. He enjoyed the book. The book was in great condition."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As with many great works, I can read this book at many different times in my life and uncover new layers of meaning. F. Scott Fitzgerald creates a world that is almost like an optical illusion. With one twist of the wrist, something can appear as the exact opposite of what it previously seemed. The characters are presented in such a way as to create sympathy for them which ultimately leads the reader to excuse their reckless deeds.There is no character that doesn't have something to like about them, however superficial those attributes they may be. However, if one looks beyond the superficial allure, instead of being dazzled by that which shines on the surface, one can see the more important deficits of character and human decency.The character Daisy, with the constant references to her sonorous voice, alluring visage and pleasant demeanor, is painted as the perfect portrait of a modern day siren. She was indeed a \\"beautiful fool\\" who can get people to like her by acting in ways that pander to their sensibilities and expectations. It is because of her charms and her apparent helplessness that most readers will, in some way, excuse or minimize her cold-blooded actions. The fact that F. Scott Fitzgerald has the reader rooting for characters that are so obviously self-centered true testament to his skill as a writer.The writing is enjoyable to read. The character descriptions are memorable and the action of the novel is well-paced. I read this book in one afternoon."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book was amazing.

Gatsby sports an english accent which is splendid in its own right. Although written in 1922, this book is very far ahead of its time as today, many Yale grads decide to go into high finance similar to Nick's decision to learn about the bond business in New York.

By epic I mean I didn't expect it.Truly after this book I was hooked on and recommend it to any. I do agree with my High school teacher, this book should be mandatory.

That's all I have to say about this book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Perhaps the strongest point made by this book is Gastby's futile attempt to reach the idealistic goals that he has set based on the romanticism of the 20's. In his work Fitzgerald has created a picture that summarizes an entire decade. The character Daisy also represents the pressures put on women during that time period. This book is excellent for anyone fascinated with the 20's as it transports you to Gatsby's time and for all of you hopeless romantics out there."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This remarkable book is one of the chief reasons I am such an avid reader of classic fiction. The reasons for this novel's greatness are unexplainable and somewhat mysterious to me. i.e., I have no idea why I love it so much, but I do! With this masterpiece, I believe that Fitzgerald has captured some unknown and unpracticed form of writing that is seldom equalled. With a style all his own, he took an ordinary, everyday setting and plot, with your average &quot;next door&quot; characters, and created something exceeding the extraordinary. Nick, the narrator, has a refreshing, honest way of letting the reader know exactly how Gatsby's story played out, and at the same time bringing us into his own life. I found myself sympathizing with Gatsby, and his love for Daisy, as I would with a member of my own family, and even having feelings, not present in the book, that a man in Gatsby's situation would likely have. It is easy to see, however, how one could misunderstand the book, or have a low opinion of it. There are a number of time-line and grammatical errors, but if it is read for what it is, it will be a cherished favorite forever."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; may at first glance seem to be merely a book on the idle rich in New York. They hold parties, get into arguments, become unhappy in love, and unhappy in life in general. However, in the end, one feels sorry for these tragic characters who represent not only the small group of people who they are, but everyone. They are all of us, searching for what makes us feel complete, whatever that may be. We too wonder at the green light that glimmers off in the distance that we just can't reach."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have to agree with Mr Vogt (2/15). The negative reviews make me question the quality of the books that people read these days. The lyrical quality and economy of the writing are enough to make The Great Gatsby worth reading.

And the last two paragraphs....wow!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Perhaps one of the best works of the early 20th century, it is the epitome of all that was the Jazz Age. Fabulous wealth, extravagance, and romance. Still, the characters, especially Nick, seemed a bit 2-dimensional at times, and I personally wished that I could know more about them. Still, the book is a work of art and displays a powerful message, that there is no American Dream. None of the characters ever succeed to attain what they desire, due to personal failings or external forces. An essential read, but a hundred extra pages would have made it a near-perfect book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"After reading many other classics, i found this one to be surprisingly not boring!

While this is indeed one of his amazing features the hope and optimism he touches upon in his masterpiece, The Great Gatsby, is even greater. In this case the master author uses a society, his society, steeped in cynicism and hedonism, full of careless people who break things; yet shows us true flawless beauty and hope. To this reader's eyes The Great Gatsby is no tragedy at all, but instead a treatise on the nature of hope.&quot;Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--&quot; And after experiencing such a wonderous work, this humbled reader also sees his green light."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a book written for romantics. It is a prime example of how greed can control and destroy lives. It is told from Nick Carryway's (Gatsby's neighbor and Daisy's cousin)point of view. He is more of a spectator and observer than a part taker; this allows the reader to get a better understanding of what is taking place. It starts out slow and confusing, but once all of the scandals, parties, and affairs begin to take place there is no way the reader will be able to put it down. Jay Gatsby is a poor army man when he falls in love with Daisy, and she is a wealthy woman that doesn't want to change her way of life when she falls in love with him. So she marries Tom Buchanan, a wealthy business man, that can provide her with the life style she wants; to Daisy money is everything. Gatsby decides to spend the rest of his life doing anything and everything to become rich and the kind of man Daisy wants. Once Gatsby and Daisy's lives begin to entwine several years later there is nothing to stop them--at least they think so. Every character goes through trials and heatache that cause the reader to get so emotionally involved that he feels as though he is there being a part of everything taking place. Everyone should read this book because it contains mystery, love, death, and betrayal; all of the concepts that make a novel truely interesting."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I first read The Great Gatsby in high school and I have picked it up and read it again many times since.My first few repeat readings were for the quality of the writing -- the absolute clarity and economy of the words, and the &quot;just right&quot; tone.And I still read The Great Gatsby for the writing, but now with each reading I seem to gain more sympathy for all of the characters -- even the brutish and stupid ones.I finish the story each time feeling that I have lived among those people, smelling their perfume, riding in their cars, dancing at their parties, guessing at their secrets.All these years and all these readings later, I still can't say precisely why Fitzgerald makes me feel this way, but each time I jump back into this wonderfully realized little book I feel as if Nick is beside me on the sofa or across from me at the table, telling me a story I have never heard before.In this day and age when every third or fourth novel is carelessly called a &quot;masterpiece,&quot; it is always a pleasure to read Nick's opening words, spoken especially and unambiguously to me, and know what a masterpiece truly is."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby was recently voted as the second greatest english novel of the twentieth century, right behind Ulysses. And no wonder, The Great Gatsby is vintage America. As a panoramic snapshot of the Jazz-Age, The Great Gatsby provides a crystallized glimpse into the age that bore swing dancing, the end of prohibition and the new exhuberance of an America breaking out of the shell of old world puritanism. With poignancy and simple beauty, The Great Gatsby conveys the timeless story of endless love, and the jealousy that eventually murders it.The Great Gatsby is not simply a reflection of its times -- it is perhaps the greatest love story of the century. It is the story of a man who had everything but love, and gave everything for his love of Daisy -- a Marilyn Monroesque goddess who evokes the raw passions of innocence and beauty.The story is not complex -- nor is particularly innovative. What makes this novel a masterpiece is that Fitzgerald associates all these actions with a particular naivety -- the same naivety seen in Nick to Daisy to Gatsby. It is this unbridled ebullience that typifies the era that gave way to a depression which shackled the nation with fear for years to come. And in its particularly austere style, there arises an unmatched elegance, whose words cannot be matched by those who masquarade behind the incomprehensible jargon of \\"knowledge\\"."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is one of the best classics American Literature has to offer. Fitzgerald has painted a telling portrait of a time and a class of people.

It tells the story of Gatsby, the dreamer, and his fall from the world of fantasy to the world of reality; two worlds that for him were one and the same. Gatsby stands for the dreamer in all men; that force which we must use yet restrain. He reminds that while it is imperative to dream, we must live in reality. This story tells not only of that philosophical message, but of adventures among the rich, and provides a commentary for the society of the Roaring 20's.

At first glance this book seems to revolve around a love interest between Nick,(Our middle class man) and Daisy, (Our tennis player) while Gatsby (the extremely wealthy man) is our third party who's fancy parties help them together. But slowly this novel turns, and sends the reader into a situation where Nick Carraway is a third party in the Great Gatsby's life, and a love situation that will have the reader hooked....."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel's best point is Fitzgerald's writing style. Having such a light and lucid pen, Fitzgerald manages to describe scenes in such a way as to make them come to life. He is also very subtle in his use of sarcasm (mostly demonstrated through the narrators remarks on those around him). This ornate style is in contrast to the spare quality of the plot. Basically, the story follows Nick Carraway's involvement in the relationship between Jay Gatsby and his --Gatsby's-- long time love (who is a married woman). It plays out in a way that is very similar to Greek tragedies (imagine Oedipus Rex). However, simple this may sound, it plays out in an interesting way, and is somewhat refreshing when compared to the modern day four-plot-twist-per-book style of writing (not to say that there aren't good modern writers; there are, of course).Another interesting aspect of this book is the idea of wealth, or the idealization of wealth. All of the characters involved in this story are either bent on gaining, or flaunting money. Gatsby throws lavish parties, and drives around in a distinctive automobile. Nick is looking to earn a fortune in the supposedly limitless city of New York. Fitzgerald even lays down a sort of classist line (through Gatsby's lips, I believe): &quot;The rich get richer, and the poor get children.&quot; It follows that within the book there are thin, nearly invisible, lines drawn between all the characters of different classes.I would recomend this novel for anybody who is interested in clever writing. I'd also recomend this to anyone who's interested in the expatriot writers. For while Fitzgerald is in contrast to Hemingway, they almost seem to compliment each other in defining the time period. I would also recomend this to anybody who's interested in classic american literature, for it is very much a hallmark American story."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I enjoyed the book but not sure what the accolades are about.

These are the Hemingway and Fitzgerald wings of political novelization.Fitzgerald was a member of the East Coast elite, the Ivy Leaguers of the Hamptons known as the &quot;idle rich.&quot; Hemingway represents a more red-blooded Midwesternism, tempered by the war and it phyical and mental horrors.&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; describes a con man from the lower classes of Middle America who remakes himself. He achieves fabulous wealth in the heady early days of the Roaring 20s, at time when the stock market was unregulated by the SEC and such things could be accomplished. In the manner of the Count of Monte Cristo, he makes a fantastic splash on High Society, a nouveau riche pretty boy, supposedly an officer in the Army during the Great War, who owns a huge Long Island mansion and holds enormous Summer parties.The book centers on the angst of the idle rich, the love affairs of the morally ambiguous, people who must look for newer and more outrageous ways to tickle their fancies. Naturally, Gatsby's attractiveness among the gorgeous socialite women of the Hamptons stirs resentment among the old school boys, who question his validity.Fitzgerald here describes a world from the standpoint of guilt; guilt at being rich. He paints a picture of people who have money without having earned it, who are not worthy of it in the entrepreneurial sense. This is an elite, liberal view - the opposite of the more hard-scrabble Hemingway world.Political views aside, Fitzgerald is a fabulous writer who lends a distinct voice to the American literary scene. This is the proverbial Great American Novel.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When I first started reading this book I didn't understand it but as it went along it really caught my attention.

The one thing his life is missing is the one thing that he desires most-Daisy Buchanan. Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby tells the story of greedy upper class people who have only desire to get more and further distance themselves from the lower class. Jay Gatsby throws all his extravigant parties but has only one goal in mind-attracting Daisy. Her husband Tom is already wrapped up in an affair with low-life Myrtle. The Rich folks' treatment of each other and disregard for others is at the center of Fitgerald's novel. Other themes to look for are his use of weather to set the mood of the scenes, use of colors(especially yellow and green) to foreshadow upcoming events, and the disparity between the upper and lower class. I recommend this book to all young and old, as it is a classic read that everyone should experience at one point in their life."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"About 20 years ago I decided I'd start reading some of the books which had been assigned to me in school, and which -- for any of a number of reasons -- I'd either never finished or never started.

So my thoughts were mixed about the author and what he wrote, however, once I read the book I was quite pleased with the story and its' narrator, Nick Carraway, and the experiences he had with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby.The book is essentially filled with love-hate relationships and suspenseful twists, which enlightened my curiosity page after page. It is no wonder that this book is being used in school curriculums as a required reading, for its material is interesting for many young minds because of its wide range of adventure, mystery, romance, and ambition within the book that kids can relate to in one aspect or another.Furthermore, upon reading \\"The Great Gatsby\\" I would recommend anyone with virtually any reading level to jump at the opportunity to read it, for not only is F. Scott Fitzgerald one of our finest writers, his book \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is an American classic, and also the book may enhance your perspective of what New York and its people were like in the nineteen twenties."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"After having the coolest kid (Nate) referring it to me to read, I did. It was an absolutely astounding book. Aside from Perks of Being A Wallflower, the best book I've read. Even the film was wonderful. Almost exactly like the book, so that was great.It was pretty interesting to read the differences, I suppose, in society and such in contrast with today's. Definitely 5 star quality."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"What more can be said about this extraordinary work? It truly has everything--the universal American themes of success and money, finely drawn characters, perhaps the most doomed love story ever written, and finally, a bitterly tragic ending.I first read this book over 30 years ago at a time when I was first discovering Fitzgerald's genius. However, I have since found myself coming back to it again and again. The mood Fitzgerald's words generate is like nothing else I've ever experienced in literature, with the possible exception of the writings of Isak Dinesen.In &quot;Gatsby&quot;, a sense of impending doom seems to loom over the entire story. Here you have a hero whose only goal in life is winning the love of a boundlessly shallow and self-centered woman who can never be worthy of his affections. Daisy's persona, combined with the world of money and carelessness that has produced her and her kind, can only lead to tragedy for Gatsby.A masterpiece ..."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is able to show what upper class lifestyle was really like in the 20's. It reveals the failure that can follow success, along with demonstrating money cannot buy happiness. This book shoes love can fail, money can kill, and you never have enough time to truly live.I personally thought this was a really well thought-out book. It had a highly developed plot that really kept a person into the book. It built up suspense well and managed to keep people interested. I recommend this book to anyone trying to learn more about the 20's."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Set in the 1902s, The Great Gatsby, is a captivatinig story about finding the &quot;American Dream&quot; of happiness.

It portrayed the ways of the wealthy in the 1920s well."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a story about the rich in New York in the 1920's, told through Nick Carraway's eyes. The main character is Jay Gatsby, an idealistic and materialistic character. Gatsby acquires his wealth to gain his lost love, Daisy. The Great Gatsby is a story that questions, &quot;What really brings happiness?&quot; This story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a critically acclaimed novel and is a must read for anyone over the age of 13."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby criticizes most of the major social trends that occurred during the 1920's. Jay Gatsby is a &quot;slf-made&quot; man who gained his wealth by bootlegging, however he is very materialistic. The Great Gatsby shows that material possessions will never equal the love two people can share."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"On the surface, this is a simple novel, not unlike many Romances-with-beauty-and-money. But the magic of the book resides in the depth of the context in which the story unfolds: the restless prosecution of money which characterizes Americans (in general), and which in this case would also buy love. It is a Romantic story in the strict sense of the concept.The novel evolves with agility, elegance, and freshness. Jay Gatsby is a new millionaire who desperately tries to recover his beloved girlfriend of old, now married to a bully and also millionaire man. The narrator is a neighbor of Gatsby, Nick, who is witness to Gatsby's efforts to reconquer Daisy Buchanan. Eventually the lovers reunite, but of course happiness lasts little, and the events unfold, as another reviewer has aptly put it, like a Greek tragedy. Social conventions impose themselves, and finally Realism triumphs over Romanticism. It all happens in the Twenties, when American society rapidly evolved towards the hedonism and materialism that characterizes much of it today. It is undeniably a great novel and it will last not just because it reflects neatly the American character, but because in the end it speaks to any manifestation of human nature. Say: back when you were a young person, and your loved one turned you down, didn't you dream of becoming rich and successful and THEN getting the girl (or boy)? How did it turn out?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is the story told from the view of Nick Carraway, who just moved from Minnesota to New York to learn about the business. His next door neighbor is a man named Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is a mysterious man whom Nick meets at the party, which was held at Gatsbyfs residence. Nick learns that Gatsby has a lover, Daisy, who was married to Tom, and Gatsby asks Nick to help him. Nick holds a reunion at his house and Daisy sees Gatsby there, beginning their relationship.The story is set in New York and its during the 1920s. The title character, Gatsby is a wealthy man who earns his money through some criminal activities, and he does it only to make Daisy falls in love with him. He does anything to make Daisy his.The major problem in this novel is when Tom finds out the relationship between Daisy and Gatsby. Even though Tom is cheating on his wife, he becomes outraged on Daisy and Gatsby, and it leads to the end of the novel, tragedy.I recommend this book to those who like money, romance, and who wants to see the life style of the rich! People who like the classic genre would enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at this novel. I had been meaning to read it for many years, and everything I had heard about it left me thinking that it was the great American novel and that Gatsby was a Svengali. I was surprised at how sympathetic (and rather pathetic) Gatsby turns out to be, I was also pleasantly surprised at the accessibility of the story itself. The writing however is a complete delight, the first person observations work well and the style is completely captivating and believable.None of the characters are completely sympathetic but nor are they outrageous.Overall an excellent, accessible read. Don't be put off by its \`classic' reputation."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald was a writer who truly understood that &quot;writing is revision.&quot; The story of the Great Gatsby covers an era of decadence and lavish living that most of us can't imagine. But within the glitter and excitement, he weaves a tale of loves lost, struggles with personal demons and upward mobility. There are some descrepancies within the story but, beyond that, the writing is phenomonal.Fitzgerald takes the English language and plays with it, subtly. Giving us beautiful phrases and lingering images that were quite exciting in his day. As we live in an age of hurry up and hurry up, reading his work is a real pleasure. It's a fast read but you don't want to run through it. You must savor each word, the masterful phrasing, while enjoying this classic.I give it a thumbs up. I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"THE GREAT GATSBY is one of those books that people either love or hate with no inbetweens. There are many who consider THE GREAT GATSBY to be the great American novel. I wouldn't go so far as to say that, but there is no question that it is a great book and a classic piece of American literature. The book evokes a particular time and place like very few writings can. The words in the novel flow together like cool water in a fresh-water mountain stream. However, what I find most amazing about THE GREAT GATSBY is that even though the novel doesn't have any truly redeeming characters and has a plot that is pointless and somewhat predictable, the story unwittingly sweeps the reader into the world in which it takes place so that before one realizes it, the story is over and the book is finished. Not very many stories can do that. It's not difficult to understand why Andy Kaufman loved this book so."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Need I say more? It seems inane to review The Great Gatsby because of its proverbial timelessness and consistent crowd of faithful readers, especially at my age and lack of literary experience, but it also seems blasphemous not to pay homage to Fitzgerald by indulging in his brillant novel. He intertwines the moral value of the rich vs. the poor in the early 1920's, and the general thematic virtues of life in an exceptional storyline. Fitzgerald tactfully constructs the plot throughout the majority of the novel, resulting in a crescendo of clashing characters and settings, but then slowly extinguishes the tension with a calming resolution. Several literary philosophies/movements are threaded throughout and it is an extraordinary read. I suggest it to anyone who likes classic literature or just books in general."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"i love it, it is a really good book. it was an idea given by a very close friend who read it"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Makes you analyze how our world is set in its ways and how the analytics of time truly affect us."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This American classic is a story about an aspiring man, Jay Gatsby, told from the perspective of his friend, Nick Carraway.

Before the depression, people had fun and would dance carelessly in the night to big bands and fox trot. Gatsby was an interesting character who had sort of a charm to him, and it just shows how during the 20s, not many people cared about affairs, racism, nor drinking. I feel Nick is obsessed with Gatsby because Gatsby has the personality and class he doesn't. The story is somewhat hard to follow at parts, especially near the end, but it has a nostalgic feeling to it, and basically is a portrayal of life during this time period."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"i bought it new. but i could have just checked out the book at the library while i needed it instead of paying for it :("},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is relatively small, but packs a huge story.

Scott Fitzgerald is a fantastic novel of the Jazz age that mostly describes the differences and struggles between various social classes. After reading this book, I can see the fantastic connection between the original cover art and the conflict of emotions within The Great Gatsby. The title itself connects perfectly with the character of Jay Gatsby; he is truly The Great Gatsby.The story within this modernist novel is the story of Nick Carraway, a young man of the midwest. Carraway moves to New York during the summer of 1922. Nick visits his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom. From the visit with them on, Nick's life only becomes more and more chaotic. The layer that covered the infidelity and chaos of those in this book is suddenly peeled back. I really enjoyed the dramatic element of this novel simply because the drama keeps the book riveting. However, the amount of infidelity in this book portrays that perhaps the author could not think of another way to keep things alluring.Fitzgerald is a very eloquent author. His words seem to undulate across the pages as they flow together. I had to read some lines multiple times to truly get the meaning, but I did not mind because in diong that one recieves a deeper connection with the text. All in all, I recommend The Great Gatsby to anyone who enjoys a good dramatic novel."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Or maybe I never knew! I read this when I was a teenager and certainly didn't pick up on all the nuances or the impeccable way Fitzgerald crafted the story. I know this book is taught in high school--although I don't remember it being part of required reading for me at the time. It was just a book that you read, like you had to try smoking cigarettes at that age. I think I was too young to get it. I didn't understand Daisy or Gatsby, and especially Nick. It seemed to me everyone was his or her own worst enemy, except maybe for Jordan who got short shrift. The whole scene, dissolute rich people in the 1920s, was beyond my comprehension. One of the only scenes that stuck in my memory was that of Gatsby flinging his numerous clean shirts around his bedroom to show off how wealthy he'd become. Reading it now, as a supposedly mature adult, I was touched by the masterful descriptions and the economy with which Fitzgerald communicates his characters' emotions. I had never realized the implications of where Gatsby's wealth came from, and totally missed the desolation of the funeral secne. The book was maybe too subtle for me as a teen. I was moved by it as an adult. I recommend it, even if you've read it before."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is a timeless good read.

Yes, show us the &#34;evils&#34; in the world, but then show us what the alternatives are. Show us the answers.

Knowing that rabid fans of the book also hated the film helped convince me to take it off the shelf (I've owned it for a few years) and read it.So glad that I did.Having previously read Fitzgerald's short story collection which contained \`The Curious Case of Benjamin Button', I was familiar with his writing style (detailed yet easy on the intake) and immediately took to this novel. The way that Fitzgerald paints these characters and their situations and the \`Jazz Age' itself is so wonderfully astute and captivating at every turn. This is a short yet very rich story, filling nearly 200 pages with beautifully delicate character development (enough mystery to make these people intoxicating as opposed to merely fascinating) and an engaging plot that completes itself in the most unexpected and yet tragically beautiful way imaginable (yes, I knew the ending thanks to the film, but it feels so much more \`complete' here).The meaning behind the pursuit at play here is remarkable, and the way that the story's conclusion truly embeds itself in relevance, even today, is unexpected yet welcome.The story told is that of Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire who moves nearby his sweetheart of yesteryear, Daisy, who is now a mother and married to a wealthy man with a downtrodden mistress on the side. Daisy and Gatsby were torn apart by social circles and the war, and while he was fighting for his country she was being swept off her feet by Tom Buchanan. The novel is narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbor and trusted confidant. Through his friendship, both Gatsby and Daisy reunite and Nick is torn between his friendship with Gatsby and his knowledge of not only Daisy's love for him but also of her husband Tom's indiscretions.Beautifully fleshed out and \`whole', this classic earns that title with every word. Creating characters that are unforgettable (Tom being one of my favorite literary creations) and a story that is so inspired and poignant, \`The Great Gatsby' is just that; great!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Author F. Scott Fitzgerald composed his 3rd and most renown novel, The Great Gatsby, when wanting to write a new and exciting book. A romantic tragedy of a man and a women who are in love but life and money gets in the way. Set in the jazz age in Long Island, NY, a man name Gatsby has made him self a fun and exciting persona. Throwing grand parties for people every weekend just so people would like him, but they liked his money more than Gatsby himself. This character he made is fake. He throws parties because he used to be poor and it's the only way to attract the love of his life, the married Daisy, to his home. Daisy is a rich woman and he wants her to leave her spouse,Tom, for him. I would give this book a 3 out of 5 stars. I had read this book a few years ago and did not understand the main theme of the book. This time around I realized the theme was greed, and doing useless things for a spark of pleasure. Fitzgerald who had lived in so many places around the world really understood the hardships of peoples lives during the jazz age.

I am in the 9th grade and have only begun to form my own tastes for adult literature, but to me, there is an enormous difference in the knowledge I gleaned from this book versus George Orwell's 1984 or Emile Zola's Germinal, both of which I have read this month. I found myself absorbed in both of those books and even took interest in understanding the principles of socialism and totaltarianism. I found myself feeling just a little more enlightened by these books. The characters in the Great Gatsby, however, are by comparison, very superficial, and I didn't connect with their problems. So even though it's a moderately dark book, it went down like a fairy tale: eloquent, fanciful and fluffy. Some people like that, but I would rather laugh and cry with a good book than read an indulgent novel like The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is supposed to be an American classic?

Imagine what he could of done if he had actually had a good idea for a story."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) lived fast, achieved success early, and then descended into a ferocious alcoholism from which he never emerged. His literary star was already in decline when he published THE GREAT GATSBY in 1925. Although the book had admirers, critical reception was lukewarm and public interest was virtually nonexistent. At the time of his death Fitzgerald and his works were regarded as trivial relics of an era noted for its superficiality; it would not be until the late 1940s that both critics and readers began to re-discover and re-assess them.THE GREAT GATSBY has often been described as \\"the great American novel.\\" In some ways this is unfortunate, for it has resulted in the academic world's force-feeding of the novel to exactly those least likely to have any appreciation of the work: high school and college students, who most often lack the maturity required to grasp the nature of the work. It is short but remarkably complex and requires skills of critical analysis that seldom arrive short of thirty years experience.On the surface the story is not unique. Nick Carraway, a well-to-do young man from the midwest, has come to New York to learn the bond business. He takes a small house and afterward discovers that his cousin Daisy, now married to Tom Bucchanan, lives directly across the bay. A visit to their luxurious home introduces Nick to professional golfer Jordan Baker, an attractive woman in which Nick is soon interested; it also alerts him to the fact that Daisy is disillusioned in her marriage to Tom, who for all his wealth and social status is limited in his views of the world and more than a little brutish in his habits.Nick is only casually interested in Daisy, Tom, and Jordan, but he is soon propelled into constant contact with all three through his own neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a mysterious yet charismatic man whose chief occupation seems to be staging parties. After some little time, Nick learns that Gatsby knew Daisy before her marriage, and indeed his parties are set forth as bait, an attempt to lure Tom and Daisy to his home on the less fashionable side of the bay. For Gatsby loves Daisy, and his memory of their romance has propelled him to fame and riches, all in an attempt to bring her to his side. Through Nick, Gatsby arranges to meet Daisy once more, and the lost love blooms anew.Or does it? THE GREAT GATSBY never allows us entry into Daisy as a person; we are never privy to her thoughts but are instead required to see her through the eyes of those around her, and the way in which we read her changes according to the people and circumstances involved. As the novel climaxes Nick and Gatsby and we ourselves do at last understand both her and Tom and the others of their kind, but the understanding comes too late to avert the three deaths and profound disillusionment that conclude the book.Like most great novels, THE GREAT GATSBY is about a great many things, but it is perhaps most particularly about America's drift into a terrible sort of materialism in which human beings become less valued for their humanity than for what--and in a very real sense--who they own. Almost everything the characters of the novel do, say, or plan is done \\"for show.\\" Gatsby's parties and his car, Jordan's golf competitions, Tom's mistress, Daisy's child, Nick's job are masks that conceal the screaming emptiness of a world in which what you have has become more important than who you are. \\"What shall we do with ourselves this afternoon?\\" Daisy asks at one point in the novel. \\"And the day after that, and the next thirty years?\\" Who would you be if you had only yourself? Would you still be what your possessions seemed to indicate--or would you be a different person, perhaps better or perhaps worse?Although THE GREAT GATSBY has always been admired for the cool, languid beauty of Fitzgerald's language, many felt the core statements of the novel were rendered largely irrelevant by the Great Depression and World War II. But like Gatsby's memories, which he himself cannot lay to rest, the book has a way of resurfacing in our minds in a remarkably disquieting sort of way, again and again with each generation. The great literary diamond of the Deco age still glitters, and it does so all the more in the face of the \\"on demand\\" confused consumerism that has arisen in the internet age. We know it should not be like this, and we wish it were not so, but we expect someone else to deal with it--or, as Fitzgerald writes with such profound clarity near the end of the novel, we, in this most American of American novels, are a people prone to smashing up things and creatures and then retreating back into our money and vast carelessness. We prefer to let other people clean up the mess we have made.A brilliant work.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.\\"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.\\"He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.And so begins The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. But what--I can hear you asking--What does the \\"F\\" stand for?F. Scott Fitzgerald's full name was actually Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, as he was distantly related to the famous author of The Star Spangled Banner, the national anthem of The United States of America. He is famous for writing The Great Gatsby, a prime example of \\"the Great American Novel\\" that all writers aspire to. It is the kind of book you are made to feel that you should read. And it is true, that you should read The Great Gatsby. But it's also true that you will probably enjoy it, and that is the main reason why you should read The Great Gatsby. It is a great book that can be studied and analyzed in college literature classes, but it is also a fun book, not too long, that tells a good story and tells it well.Gatsby is a millionaire who throws fabulous parties. No one knows where he really came from or how he got his money, but he bought a mansion where he \\"dispensed starlight to casual moths\\" for some as yet unknown purpose. Written in 1925, just before the stock market crash of 1929 that began the Great Depression, Fitzgerald is prescient. Did he know that the glitz and glamor of The Jazz Age and The Roarin' 20's was a house of cards built on a foundation of sand--mixophorically speaking? That it could all be washed away in an instant?The Great Gatsby is the subject of the book, but it is told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, the narrator. Nick doesn't say that much out loud. He is kind of an introvert. But his inner voice is exceptionally rich and poetic. If he has a flaw, it is that he judges everyone around him, though he begins his narrative by telling us that his father told him not to criticize others who may not have had the advantages he has had. He then proceeds to judge and criticize everyone. He is like a male Judge Judy. That is the fun of the book. If he wasn't judgemental it would be very boring. Nick Carraway considers himself to be one of the few honest men around. If he thinks he doesn't judge others, that as a consquence of his father's words he's \\"inclined to reserve all judgements\\" then he is certainly not being honest--with himself.Nick judges all before him, almost like the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles that pass over a non-existent nose.Though they are not the eyes of God, but merely an advertisement for an eye doctor, they brood over the dreary landscape nonetheless, like Nick Carraway also broods. He judges Jordan Baker, a female golfer not above moving her golf ball to a better position or telling little white lies, but only when it is absolutely convenient. He judges the hoards who flock to Gatsby's parties. He judges Klipspringer, who spends so much time at Gatsby's parties that he is called \\"the boarder.\\" He judges George B. Wilson and his wife Myrtle, and he judges Tom Buchanan.Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this man Goddard?Nick Carraway presents the evidence on Tom Buchanan's character, and we don't even have to hear him read the verdict to know what it is. Daisy, his wife, is a little harder to pin down, but later Gatsby provides him a clue. Nick thinks Daisy's voice is indiscreet and full of a certain jen se qua\\"Her voice is full of money,\\" he said suddenly.That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl. . . .The Great Gatsby is a book that I am very grateful to have been required to read in college. Professor Edwards at San Francisco State University led our class in an insightful discussion, and I will include some of the points he made--as I remember them many years later--in the comments, so as not to spoil it for those who have not yet read The Great Gatsby. Even if you haven't been to college you will still enjoy this book. I have made a list of 10 books that I would recommend to those who aspire to be well read, and The Great Gatsby is right at the top. If you can just get started you will want to keep reading until the very end. A veritable page turner. You are swept up in the story, carried away by the narrative voice of Nick Carraway, moving forwards and backwards in time in alternate passages--forward as Gatsby's final chapters unfold--but backwards as we delve deeper and deeper into Gatsby's past.Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . .

Additionally, the novel suffers from an extremely contrived plot and climax. I'm sure at one point in the history of American Literature this could have been seen as a clever and biting indictment of the upper crust of society, but reading it in 2007 exposes it as only another variety of the boring 19th century society fiction in the same vein as Austen, Bronte, etc."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY is a somewhat quick read. It is not a diffiuclt read, so it is reasonable to see why so many of us have or will read this work during our high school days.Our story's protagonist, Nick Carroway, is the real focus of the story, despite the book's title. Gatsby is merely the focus of Nick's observations. Beginning as a person of mystique and fascination to our protagonist Nick, Gatsby lives a life of luxary and prestige. Throwing lavish parties and seemingly on the top of the world, Gatsby is merely putting on a show. The lavish lifestyle he displays is meant to represent what can be achieved if you work hard to find the 'American Dream'. The whole concept of the American Dream is what this work is continually tied to, that Gatsby has a great number of skeletons in his closet and that he lives in rich misery because he cannot be with Daisy, his one true love.THE GREAT GATSBY is a book with a meaningful point, yet it is a somewhat dull read. While it certainly does not lack staying power, it is understanable why so many students gripe at having to fight their way through the sometimes tedious moments. THE GREAT GATSBY is great for some, but a chore for others."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"While this is not a bad book, it is not the master-piece I expected. One of the reviewers before actually gave it a 4 star review despite the fact that she or he admittedly did not even finish it! This is probably what you'd call a biased judgement. The Great Gatsby is certainly an interesting book to study (as would be any book, in my opinion) but I cannot say I enjoyed it too much, even if the images and underlying themes are interesting. I have to say I read it in the Penguin edition, so I don't know about the preface of this one, but I found helpful the essay displayed there (always read these introductions and stuff AFTER you read the novel, otherwise it's merely a spoiler and it can't deepen your understanding of the book since you know nothing of it at that moment).Despite all this I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 stars, I hesitated longly between 2 and 3 to be honest."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"** spoiler alert ** I can honestly say that I expected to hate this book as it wasn't the type of book I would usually reach for, but as one chosen for me by my favourite book club I got to read it, and I liked it.So many cliches come to mind when I think about this book. Those phrases you've vaguely heard about the grass not being greener on the other side, that all people have their secrets, that even the seemingly happy may not be so, and that we all die alone.Whilst well written and beautiful in a literal sense, it was just such a twisted web of illusion and tradgedy where nobody ended up happy and it was possible that nobody ever really knew the truth about any of the other characters.It may be just me, but I found it a bit like a car wreck and I couldn't look away and finished it quite fast."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I know that lots of people consider this the Great American Novel, but to me it's too flawed to rank that high.The problems begin with the decision to have the story narrated by Nick, a minor character. The first page of the story is devoted to Fitzgerald's trying to convince the reader that Nick is a reliable narrator (\\"I'm inclined to reserve all judgements\\" -- how many people go around saying things like that, and would you believe them if they did?). For the rest of the story he has to arrange for Nick to be everybody's confidante and present at all the crucial scenes, even when his friends are committing adultery: he's there when Gatsby shows his girlfriend his shirt collection; he's there when Tom punches HIS girlfriend in the nose; he's there at the fatal auto accident, and it's awkward that he's not there when Gatsby gets shot.Then there are the story's underlying assumptions. Fitzgerald assumes that his (1930 WASP) audience will favor the old-rich Buchanans and dislike the newly-rich Gatsby, then tries to convince them otherwise. If you don't have that bias in the first place, a lot of the novel is a waste. And Fitzgerald doesn't seem to realize that Nick is old-boy-network too -- his bond-selling job is apparently so easy that he hardly ever mentions it.Then there's the 1930s racism. To present a really contemptuous picutre of the New Rich, he describes a car of rich African-Americans. And to hint at Gatsby's shady background, Fitzgerald brings in a Jewish racketeer (who, of course, describes his scams to Nick in detail - see paragraph 2).The purpose of all this is to teach Nick something -- that rich people can be jerks, I guess. Not that Nick does anything with the lesson, except write the novel."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"While I understand this book is denominated \\"a classic\\" (that's why I read it), it was just an OK read (for me).I also just completed the online Sparks notes, and will readily and loudly announce just how much I truly missed in my reading. From the Sparks notes, I saw all the symbolism and historical implications that went whizzing past me. And from the perspective of literary accomplishment/social commentary, I am truly impressed.But again, I can't get past that this was just an OK read for me. I can't really say I connected with any of the characters (although Gatsby was clearly the most sympathetic).Frankly, I could have done very nicely without the overtly anti-semitic portrayal of Wolfscheim (and no, I can't excuse it, as simply an accurate historical reflection of the times).I expect that many will be offended by a lukewarm review of a recognized classic. But like spinach, it may be healthful to eat, but just not taste that good. I guess it depends on what you are looking for."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can, says Gatsby. Essentially, this is the prototypical Great American Novel - that old cliche of pop literary culture so often used by writers and laymen alike. The book conflates America's promise of the past, corruption of the present, and hope for the future. It is the beautiful and ugly side of American ambition, optimism, and sense of invincibility that makes so many Americans feel immortal.The story, which Mencken inevitably declared to be a trivial anecdote, is nevertheless an exciting look into twentysomething romanticism. Glamorous parties, nouveuax riche and old money values colliding, the luxury of youthful idleness, whirlwind romance. This is the perfect book for a high school student with dreams.More than anything, this book struck me as a metaphor for timeless American ethos. Gatsby makes the paradoxical attempt to move against the tide of the future to bring back the past. He wants, like so many people, to bring back that magical moment in his life when he thought life was eternal, the world was beautiful, and he was the biggest man in it. He wants to recapture the love that opened a plethora of infinite possibilities, turning his back on the reality of changing times and changing people.Gatsby's greatness is in making himself and others believe the sublime fantasy that thinks itself real. He wants his Daisy as so many other people have wanted theirs - pure, perfect, and existing solely for him. The ambition to defeat life may become tragic, but it never gives up hope - the hope of a better, stronger tomorrow. And in the end, it is action that moves the world, but it is hope that keeps the world alive."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"If I was a high school student forced to read this and have to answer test questions on it, I would not think so highly of this book. However, now thirty and coming to this on my own I found a book that has righfully earned it's place among our few American classics. At first, Fitzgerald's poetic and economic prose takes some time getting used to. I found myself rereading certain passages. It did win me over though, after the first page where the narrator defines personality as &quot;an unbroken series of successfull gestures.&quot; He has other witty observations throughout and I was surprised to see how funny the book could be at times.Symbolism aside the story is a decent, readable one. The premise is a young man starting out in 1920's New York after the end of Worls War I whose next door nieghbor is the self-assured but mysterious Jay Gatsby. This may seem boring to some, but I hesitate to say more at the risk of giving anything away. Trust me, there more to it. At first it meanders, seeming to string a series of almost random but interesting vignettes depicting the jazz age. For those who may want to give up on the book at that point, I say don't. Fitzgerald has been setting the reader up. The other shoe drops halfway through the novel. Also a note on the characters. Even though you may not agree what the characters are doing, at least it invokes a reaction. Which is more than I can say of the &quot;classics&quot; that I was forced to read in high school.The themes in Gatsby are very poignant. Showing us how fragile dreams and perceptions, both self and outside, can be. And that sincere intentions do not always come from honest sources. Is this the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;? I don't know, I have a few more books to go before I make that assumption. What I can tell you is that I has a pleasant time reading this one and see why many people think so."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a novel set in 1920s New York City that precisely captures the mood and tenor of what came to be known as the Jazz Age. The story focuses on the flashily affluent Jay Gatsby, who made his fortune through dubious means, his more modest neighbor Nick, Nick's captivating cousin Daisy Buchanan and her wealthy husband Tom. Gatsby hopes to use his material success to win the adoration of Daisy, who happens to be a love from his past, before he went off to war. However, Gatsby\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d ends up paying a heftier price - his life - for the girl he has passionately but secretly pursued through the years.On the surface, The Great Gatsby seems like a book designed solely for leisure reading purposes. But dig beneath that surface, and the reader excavates some philosophical themes. For example, since Daisy did not marry Gatsby at the time of their affair because he lacked wealth, when Gatsby returns from the war, he is intent upon making a fortune in order to lure her back to him. His efforts ultimately doom him, reflecting the dour consequences of material obsession. Additionally, Gatsby's fervent focus on Daisy after so many years have lapsed exposes the peril inherent in clinging too closely to far-fetched fancies.But while Fitzgerald deftly works these themes, sometimes his commentary on the moral substance of his characters is ambiguous. He appears to revel in Jazz Age excesses, as portrayed in Gatsby's elaborate parties and in the characters' periodic jaunts to the city. Yet, through the sober-minded narration of Nick, Fitzgerald also seems to indict Gatsby for his ostentacious display of wealth. Furthermore, Fitzgerald draws Gatsby in a dualistic way - he simultatenously shows him as a man of principle and as a starry-eyed fool for persistently pursuing Daisy. But perhaps Fitzgerald simply wants us to make up our own minds about Gatsby rather than preach to us, or maybe he wants to show how human weaknesses can serve as strengths and vice versa, depending on the scenario.The character of Nick is credibly drawn; he represents temperance, but also passivity, as he appears to float on the fringes of his friends' lives rather than actively indulge in them. Indeed, as narrator, Nick allows us to see the story through his eyes, and while we never lack insight into his feelings, we also never feel pressured to see things his way; Nick's tone is calmly questioning rather than priggishly pedantic.Tom Buchanan as a vapidly wealthy and viciously philandering spouse is artfully conceived; whether he's flaunting his latest love at a party or speaking haughtily about the menaces of black economic progress, reader disdain for Tom is never far from the surface.But it's Daisy Buchanan who steals the show in The Great Gatsby; a mishmash of contradictions, Daisy exudes a sultry charm that masks a profound restiveness with her current lifestyle. She wants desperately to break free from her stifling circumstances, and Gatsby provides the catalyst for her to do so. Yet, she is constrained by convention, and Fitzgerald permits us to feel the tragic dimensions of her fate throughout the story. This tragedy is never more apparent than when at a tense gathering that includes Gatsby, she reluctantly (and not altogether believably) concedes that she has loved Tom, despite her earlier assertions to the contrary.The Shakespearean conclusion of The Great Gatsby will seem heavy-handed to some, while other readers will embrace it as a logical c\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001dulmination of a story infused with melodrama. But one thing is certain: The Great Gatsby will leave an indelible impression on readers with its instructive themes, intriguing plot, and realistically drawn characters."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Jay Gatsby. The most sophisticated, popular, extravagant man on West Egg Island. The host of lavish, extraordinary parties, sprawled across the gardens of his enormous house, filled with aristocrats, vibrant colors, jazz music, laughter, and the tinklin of glasses. A personable young man if there ever was one. A friend to all, and fond of calling them &quot;old boy.&quot; And above all, an Oxford man. Or is he? For it seems one can never fully trust Gatsby and the stories of his past. The occasional uncertainty d hesitancy in his voice, as well as frequent inquiries, investigations, and juicy rumors, contradict the his words. Jay Gatsby is the hero of F. Scott Fiztgerald's classic, The Great Gatsby, an captivating novel full of intertwining stories and characters, and the revelation of the first connection is intriguing enough to leave the reader begging for the next. A won rful story, The Great Gatsby is laced with mystery, and spiced with a dash of romance. The tale unfolds itself in 1922, on the Long Island provinces of West and East Egg Island, the latter being the more fashionable of the two, and the island where Daisy and Tom Bucanan reside. Daisy is a sparkling young woman and adored by all that meet er. She is sociable, polite, energetic, enthusiastic, and positively delightful, complete with a voice resembling lilting music notes. But this bright girl isn't all she seems; even lovely Daisy has a passionate secret. Her husband, Tom, is an athletic an, the epitome of arrogance. His eyes are always described as &quot;flashing about restlessly.&quot; The former football hero demands dominance over all, especially over the women in his life; his wife, and his over-the-top, full-figured mistress, Myrtle Wilson. t is only when he feels denied of this control that he shows emotion. Across the bay, on the West Egg, lives Daisy's cousin, and Tom's college friend, Nick Callaway, who also happens to be Gatsby's neighbor (just some of the slew of intertwining connec ons between the characters). Nick is the narrator of the story, and does well in presenting an objective view of the string of events that take place. Perhaps this is because he lives by the rule to not criticize others. However, he is incredibly percep ve, and whatever criticisms and opinions he does take on become completely justified to the reader, biased or not. Nick is forever changed by his encounters with Gatsby, but still remains able to continue his normal life, leaving any stinging memories b ind. Perhaps this can be attributed to Jordan Baker, who can be considered the anchor of sanity, or the accomplice for the plot basis. Jordan, Daisy's good friend, moves through the story to become Nick's love interest, but also serves as the source of e missing pieces of the story, the glue between other characters, without being incredibly integral to the connections themselves. As said before, The Great Gatsby is a wonderful whirl of mixing and mingling pasts and presents. It focuses around Jay Gatsby and his quest to recapture the love he had and lost five years ago; Daisy, who loves him in return. However, between elaborate chemes and secret meetings, the two must conquer husbands, mistresses, death, tragedy, and pass the test of true love and loyalty. And despite how much readers come to wish them well, at times their happy fate is wholly uncertain. Through the tangled story of Gatsby and Daisy's romance, and the web of characters and events that surround them, Fitzgerald makes it painfully clear to his readers that people are interminably connected, and the actions of one can start a chain that e ects the lives of many. And, contrary to main-stream fictitious happiness, love does not always prove to be pure and true, or prevail over all. Although The Great Gatsby eventually proves itself to be a simply engrossing novel, the primary story line can be difficult to deeply fall into. The first seventy-five pages can seem dry and lagging, as they primarily consist of explaining how Nick cam to live in West Egg, and retelling seemingly unimportant encounters with several of the characters, probably simply a method of presenting them to readers. However, with the introduction of Mr. Wolfshiem, a shady character, as well as the conversation b ween Gatsby and Nick that precedes that meeting, the plot thickens tremendously. It is with these two events that the mysterious story and the intertwining pasts begin to unfold themselves, and readers will find themselves immediately entranced by the s uence of events to come. The Great Gatsby, though not entirely difficult, should also not be tackled by those who find expressive language and metaphors troubling. However, once readers have become aquatinted with Fitzgerald's writing, his exquisite use of language and metapho will become apparent. They will find the lavish words find even necessary to match the sophisticated nature of the characters. He makes exceptional use of metaphor, best exemplified by his description of Daisy's voice. It is praised time and time again, nd is said to retain the quality of music, notes that will never be played again, the sound of tinkling money, and glowing and singing noise, the sort that the ear follows up and down. Jordan is also frequently said to &quot;balance objects on her chin,&quot; def ing the way she holds herself. And just outside of New York is an area where everything is apparently made from ashes, and the piercing blue streams of sky are solely referred to as &quot;the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg.&quot; These metaphors help to paint a wo erfully vivid picture, making sounds and sights come alive, full with depth and meaning."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I suspect that there are three types of readers.1) People who read just to read a good story2) People who read for the beauty of the prose and the beauty of the way the story is told3) People who are a combination of bothI myself am #1.

Sometimes, those elements are combined with a third: the story makes us think about ourselves, and life in general. It's only then that we have a classic...In my opinion, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is just that, a classic. It was first published in 1925, an the author set the background of the story in the 1920's, the &quot;Jazz Age&quot;. Disregarding the fact that particular period of history is already distant, this book has managed to mantain its edge.But why does that happen?. The plot is interesting, but nothing out of the ordinary. It is the story of Jay Gatsby, a poor man who fell in love with a rich young girl named Daisy, who ended up getting married to someone who had as much money as her parents. All that happened before the beginning of the story, that starts quite a few years after that marriage. Daisy is quite unhappy (in a rather superficial way), and ready for a change when Gatsby enters again into her life, as good-looking as ever but with much more money.The story is told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, who is Daisy's cousin and who happens to meet Gatsby in one of the party the later organizes. Nick is a catalyst in the story, due to the fact that he puts Daisy and Jay in contact again after many years of separation. However, and more important, Carraway makes the book remarkably more interesting for the reader, making commentaries from time to time regarding what is happening. In the book, Nick says &quot;Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known&quot;.At the very least, Nick's role is an effective way that Fitzgerald found of involving the reader a little bit more in what's happening in the story. Most people can identify with Nick Carraway because he doesn't go to the extremes where the other characters permanently are. Gatsby, and his relentless persecution of a love that never was, that can end in nothing else that pure tragedy... And Daisy, so frivolous and vain, so thoroughly engrossed in herself that is incapable of true love...All in all, I liked the story, but I especially enjoyed the way in which F. Scott Fitzgerald writes. His style is very simple, with only some metaphores that don't obscure the meaning but help to make it clear. He is also quite concise, as evident from the fact that this book has little more that 200 pages.I think it is probably wortwhile to point out that what really makes this book a classic, instead of merely an enjoyable book (not that there is anything wrong with those!!), is the fact that it deals with many themes all of us deem important, for example love, dreams, lies, justice, social differences, hate, money and what it can (and cannot) buy...From my point of view, this book is more than worth your time and money. I only wish the ending had been different... The book would have lost some of its dramatic air, but I would have been happier. Even though I know it is rather silly, I prefer happy endings. I hope you notice that despite that, I still recommend &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to you. I really don't have other choice, because it is really a great book :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"After living abroad in the Middle East for a year and traveling through more than twenty-five countries, I recently re-read The Great Gatsby, seeking the familiarity of America. The Great Gatsby captures what is different about Americans and the American experience. At its most basic, America represents endless striving for greatness. Whether in business, science, athletics or world affairs, Americans imagine and seek the best. Though we often stumble and fall short; though we often cut corners to achieve our dreams - striving for greatness is the essence of America. In Gatsby, we feel what it is like to want something so badly, to succeed in reaching it and to ultimately fail. How many of us have not shared these experiences in some way or another? American writings today, such as David Ebershoff's Pasadena (2002) and Scott Gaille's The Law Review (2002), continue to explore Gatsby's central theme of obsession with greatness. In this time of global uncertainty, we can get back in touch with what it means to be an American by reading such books."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"...of course, that's just my opinion, and I obviously haven't read everything that's been written (or even a minute fraction of it!). However, I've never come across anything that so captured the profound wonder and sadness of the human condition. There are passages in The Great Gatsby which took my breath away, passages so perfect I couldn't believe that someone was capable of writing them. Hunter S. Thompson once said something to the effect that he couldn't imagine one word being added or taken away from this novel. Surely that's one of the highest compliments one writer could give another (it also gave me a newfound respect for Hunter S. Thompson, but that's beside the point...). Like most of Fitzgerald's work, The Great Gatsby holds up well as a period piece on young America in the Jazz Age. More importantly, it is a timeless metaphor of mythical proportion. The green light on Daisy's dock is the longing that drives us all; our dreams dissolve in the moment of fulfillment, leaving us with the bittersweet realization that it was only the dreams themselves that gave our lives beauty and meaning."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Amazon.com, I don't know what was wrong with the last 2 reviews I left.

Our hero Jay Gatsby becomes a victim to the American Dream. All because he has a crush on the conceited airhead Daisy Buchanan. The problem is that Daisy is already married to arrogant rich bully Tom Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story, remains Gatsby's only true friend.

Perhaps he would not have died from a coronary doubtless related to his depression and alcoholism.The book is told through the impressions of Nick, a middle class fellow, and revolves around Mr. Gatsby. A man who has replaced the fortitude of spirituality with the frailty of materialism in the hopes of acquiring a woman, Daisy, hardly worth his disdain let alone his life.The story reflects the deeper truth that rationality and science alone cannot solve our problems and certainly cannot supplant the need for a higher purpose in life or belief in a higher power. To do so leaves a void too often filled with materialism which is a cheap substitute.This is exemplified in the characters of Tom Daisy and Jordan, souless wraiths who drift aimlessly from place to place draining the life of everything they touch. Even Tom, who has every conceivable material possession, betrays a longing for days gone by when he was revered as a football hero presumably since this was the only title he ever earned.Gatsby is a compromised and tragic figure partially redeemed only by his solitary quest to fulfull an adolescent meaningless fantasy. Unlike \\"old money\\" he has a goal however trivial.The fulfillment of his goal is anti-climactic as with all objects pursued solely for possession and display. The empheral joy of possession is replaced with the enduring meaninglessness of his life and the eventual ignomy of losing Daisy.The end of the story shows the illusion of Gatsby, a young wealthy eccentric enigmatic gentleman, dissipated by the reality of Gatsby, a hollow common criminal consumed by the desire for a used mindless woman.With the contemporary obssession with materialism, in the form of youth, beauty and wealth, to the exclusion of all else the book is more relevant today than it was then."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Reader could have been a little more animated, instead of somewhat monotonous.

Unfortunately, the first cd skipped in a few places."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I finished reading this book for the first time last week. I usually review the books I read here, but since this book is closing in on being 100 years old, is required reading in many American AP high school English courses and most likely everything that could possibly be said about it by the human race, positive and negative, has been said by reviewers of higher importance than I, I thought it would be silly to review it.But here's this: I liked it. I liked it quite a lot. As much as I read, it's almost absurd that I hadn't gotten to this one sooner, but I'm glad I read it at this age because I almost surely wouldn't have appreciated it in it's fullness if I'd read it in high school.My wife recently read it for the second time (and she loves it), and though our taste in books is usually pretty far from similar, she insisted I really ought to give it a whirl. I was in the mood for something older and in the modern classic realm, so here we are.I have to say it went by fast. I mean, it's a short novel; less than 200 pages. But I daresay once things get cooking (once Gatsby actually enters the novel, basically), it's almost written in a jumpy, quick-moving way. Sure, there are moments of quiet beauty and reminiscence, but the party scenes are perfect depictions of swirling chaos from loud-mouthed, gossipy rich people from the perspective of a man who largely keeps to himself. I love how well the tone of the dialogue encapsulates the time period and suggests that most of the folks were talking just to hear their own voices, responding with answers that had nothing to do with the previous speaker, and no one really listened and no one really cared (again I'm referring primarily to the rich folks at the parties... not necessarily Gatsby or the other main characters, though Daisy shows some hints of this high-living arrogance).This is getting dangerously close to a review (MAY IT NEVER BE, GAINES!!), so I'll wrap up. I reckon this is a novel with layers; something short and rich that reveals more good stuff every time you re-read it. That being said, I'm fairly certain I'll revisit this book somewhere down the road."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel would be a great addition to your collection of books read. The great Gatsby is written in manner that is relatable to the reader. The first time I read The Great Gatsby I was in high school. I found it to be a great masterpiece that I couldn't cope with putting down. (I even cried at the end...which never happens). I read It again as I entered college and it blew my mind away. It was pure magic and left me astonished by the language and the bittersweet romance of the hopeful but desperate Jay Gatsby vying for the affection of a married woman but his one and only true love. It seems like every time I reread this novel, I find another flawless element that always keeps me wanting to read even though I already know what happens.I recommend The Great Gatsby for all high school students because high school is a time in your life that one starts to find true deception in everyday life that can be very relatable while reading this novel. High school is a time where deception is laden and you have to find out who you really are and identify what is fake and what is real. Also, when you re read this this book at a later point in your life, you will find different elements every time that will inspire you to pick up this book many more times throughout your lifetime."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby could be stated as one of the greatest pieces of literature. Everyone should experience the world of Fitzgerald's writing.Fitzgerald created the characters with distinct personalities. He lets the reader feel strong sympathy for each character. In contrast, some readers may believe the characters are too exaggerated and seem unrealistic such as Daisy Buchanan. However, I believe exaggerated parts are necessary for the interesting plot.Jay Gatsby could be announced as one of the main characters. His perseverance to love one girl for a long time is very admiring. However, his dream of reuniting with Daisy crushes when he comes back and sees her with another successful man. When the reader finds out of his struggle, the reader starts feeling sympathy for him and realizes that money cannot solve everything. It is depressing to see Gatsby hold on to the past, thinking he could re-live it. Gatsby's idealistic characteristic as well as his wrongful idea of money buying happiness wins favors from his audience as well as myself and teaches us a real life lesson.The theme that money does not buy happiness is clearly apparent. Gatsby's character progression portrays how money cannot always bring the most desired, finding happiness. He thought prosperity could get him what he wanted, a common mistake that people in the modern society uphold. Many of us think money is all you need, that fortune could bring us joy in this money-oriented society. Wealth could bring us happiness to a certain extent; it cannot buy values that can only be obtained through experience. When he comes back as a prosperous man, he is shocked by the fact that his absence had caused Daisy to be with another man.The story was full of ups, downs and un-expectancies with an irony, which kept the reader wanting to continue on to the next page. Everyone who has read the book already could happily agree that it is hard to find a stopping point due to its intensity revolving around the characters and the stories they create. The overall language Fitzgerald uses in the novel defies typical comprehensive characteristics of an intelligent composition by making the book easier to follow yet still containing a higher-level reading."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"feel that the sentences may go on and on and on sometimes but I could not stop reading! Have wanted to read this my entire life and have not been disappointed."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Great novels are about things. The things they are about are provoking thought or providing illumination on some aspect of the human heart or the human condition. Additionally, a great novel will always evoke an emotional reaction in the reader, whether good or bad. Gatsby was intended by the author from the start to be a serious work of art for adult consumption, Fitzgerald was reaching for greatness. While books like \\"Harry Potter\\" or even \\"Lord of the Rings\\" may be a fine entertainment, in the end they are just a collection of ingeniously crafted plot points with relateable and entertaining characters. There is nothing wrong with this, people need and enjoy pap, but sometimes it's good to have a book or even a film challenge you to think about things more deeply.For any high schoolers \\"forced\\" to read this, let me say this. You will not \\"get\\" this book. This is not due to any intellectual or moral deficiency. A 17-year old Steven Hawking or Einstein would fare no better. This is not because the book is even slightly difficult to read, comprehend, or follow. On the contrary, the book is an easy read that does not have difficult language or elaborate plot intricacies. Many of you might still like and enjoy the book highly, I know I did in high school. Many will intellectually understand the themes or symbollism, because they are not complex, in fact they are very simple and straightforward, which is what makes this novel so great. But you won't really feel it in your heart, because when you are younger you don't yet have the tools to fully appreciate this book. Do yourself a favor. Reread this book after the age of 30, and just let your mind soak it in for the pure enjoyment of it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The novel, The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald is not a book for me. I felt like the novel was too boring, and dull. It was really hard to get into. This novel is about a man named Nick that lives next to Gatsby, who throws parties at his mansion every Saturday. He then befriends Gatsby. In the beginning of the novel, it was confusing when Tom showed Nick, his mistress. I felt like nothing really actually happened in the book. There wasn't really a plot. This book is supposed to be a reflection of the 1920s, but doesn't really exude it. The 1920s was fun and exciting, and this novel was not. Also the actual writing was way too eloquent and he used lots of big words, that was distracting from the actual plot. His writing was way to flowery, which made it unenjoyable. This book was just basically about affairs. I also didn't like how Nick was narrating it, because he wasn't a sole part of the plot. He was just there; nothing important. I don't understand why this is a classic..."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Prior to starting this novel, I was convinced I had read it some time in school while I was growing up. Throughout my public school education, we had read a variety of classics from Steinbeck, Dickens, Hemingway, Miller, etc. So I really thought I had read this one along the way. After a couple of paragraphs, I realized that I hadn't, because I think I would have remembered the different feel this one seems to have from most classic American literature.The length of the novel alone is enough to show you that it's not quite the same as some of those other novels. Fitzgerald seemed to have more of a sense of what to cut out and what to include than some of his contemporaries, because at no point during this reading did I sit and think \\"Will you just get ON with it?!?\\" I'm sad to say that I have done that with plenty of other authors, so I was a bit worried I'd have that reaction when going through The Great Gatsby. I very happily enjoyed this novel and hope to read more of Fitzgerald's work in the future.The book itself is the tragic tale of our title character, Jay Gatsby. Having never been satisfied with the life he came from, Gatsby invents a new self and goes about trying to find the person he wants to be. Along the way, he meets Daisy, who becomes the big driving force in his life. I think in today's day and age, we might call Gatsby a stalker - he's obsessive and goes so far as to buy his house in Long Island because of his ability to see Daisy's across the way. While this would seem creepy if we were telling it from a modern perspective, it strikes me as being rather sad. Gatsby goes from only knowing he wants to make money, to knowing he wants to make money for Daisy. At one point during the story, he even says that he decided doing things was less important than telling Daisy about all the things he wanted to do. It's really a sad case of lost boy syndrome, in my book.Something that really stuck out to me throughout the book was that people seemed to want to be around Gatsby, but no one necessarily seems to like him, going so far as to spread random rumors about how he acquired his fortune and what his past was like. This theme carries through to the end when we learn that our narrator, Nick Carraway, is the only one who is truly there for Gatsby in his time of need. While Gatsby isn't a model citizen, he doesn't seem all that scandalous to me, and certainly doesn't deserve the rumor mongering that follows him throughout the course of the novel. Maybe it's just the fact that I'm looking at it from a modern perspective, so his actions don't seem any worse than things we see on TV on a daily basis.I picked this book up for Banned Books Week, and found it rather amusing when I was investigating the reasoning behind the banning of this book. It was basically for language and some mild sexual content, which is just ridiculous. I certainly didn't see any bad language when reading it, and the only references to sex were along the lines of \\"so and so left the room for awhile\\". Again, maybe it's a more modern perspective, but those things are just silly. I'm totally against the banning of books anyway, so I guess I've got a skewed perspective twice over.The only questionable thing for me is really the behavior of Daisy's husband, Tom Buchanan. I found Tom to be annoying, as arrogant as he is described, and a bigot to top it off. It's made worse by the knowledge that men like Tom did exist, and to an extent they still do. Still, that's no reason to ban a book, it's just a reason to dislike Tom and root for Gatsby.I really would be curious to see what kind of things Fitzgerald would have come up with if he lived in our time. It's a shame we lost him all too soon, because I think he has a unique voice and I would have liked to see more from him."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When I was reading this I kept wondering how it could be a classic.

His eloquence is jealousy inspiring.I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest books of all time. It is a classic not just of American literature, but of world literature. It has meanings on so many levels. If there was only one fiction book that I was able to read for the rest of my life, this would be it, because every time you read it, it has a different meaning.This book also brings up many different questions that the reader must answer for himself and the book also never satisfies the reader, which causes you to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"My son needed this book for his English class.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This classic American novel is the story of Jay Gatsby, that fabulously wealthy Long Island party giver, as related by his less affluent neighbor Nick Carraway. Written in 1925 at the height of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby expertly captures the 1920s and all its excesses.As Nick Carraway begins this intriguing tale wherein wealth and gayety mask underlying tragedy, Gatsby is presented as an enigmatic character. No one really seems to know who Gatsby is or where he obtained his fortune. Because of that knowledge vacuum, multiple myths concerning the man circulate, growing more fantastic with each telling.But ultimately, Nick and the reader learn that Gatsby is a mere mortal whose inner life is a less than satisfying one and whose moment in the sun is destined to be short-lived. Much like (as we now know) the Jazz Age itself.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Great book! I read it once and would love to read it again.

Back in college, almost everyone had read this \\"great\\" masterpiece of literature. I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to sink my teeth into this novel and see once and for all what it was all about.The story was wonderful to read and its subject matter was appealing for the most part. The industrial age must of been a sight to behold. The author does an adequate job of detailing the age and the times of West Egg. Although the lavishness and splendor of the many parties that took place in West Egg were nicely detailed, I found the imagery somewhat sparse and lacking detail at times. The author does a great job of portraying his characters and their morals but for some reason I didn't find this in itself to capture my attention. The story line was so-so in my opinion and could of been better. But in the end, this novel was worth the read. I'm happy I had the opportunity to finally have read this book and eventhough slightly disappointed, say that I experienced what it must of been like living in West Egg during the Golden Age."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I'm not sure if it's possible to not like this book.

I'd recommend it to anyone and since it's a short book it only takes a weekend to get through."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I remember reading The Great Gatsby in my high school English class and thinking it was boring. In retrospect, I think I was an idiot. Reading it ten years later was a truly amazing experience. Fitzgerald lays down some stunning prose and brings a lavish era of American history to life. I was struck with how that culture of excess in the 1920s seemed eerily similar to the mid 2000s. . . and right before another crash, nonetheless. Great book. If you tried to read it once and failed, try again. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's insight in this book cuts through the blinding American optimism of the time. Though at the time he wrote The Great Gatsby he could not have foreseen the economic and cultural crisis approaching in 1929, he is clearly suspicious and wary of the culture surrounding him, and the tone of this book expresses that he expects evil will come of it. His characters put their faith and their trust in unstable things- wealth, social superiority, commercialism, the power of culture- and their typical american idealism and ambition makes them reach too far for things they don't have, and they end up losing what they did have. Fitzgerald's narrator, Nick Carraway, is ambitious, but is not blinded by the glamour and excess of the society surrounding him. Nick is the only character who is actually grieved by the tragedies which befall the other characters, because he alone values human compassion above society and ambition. From a Christian perspective, this book shows what happens to culture and the individuals who make up that culture when Christian ambition and even basic humanity are sacrificed for social greed."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is less about the American Dream and more about the death of a dream; a dream one holds in one's heart, for such an inexplicably long time, that it becomes something more than a dream, something ineffable and austere. Like the previous sentence, this book is permeated with ambiguous phrasings and sentimental, other-worldly prose - that is to say, Fitzgerald has a certain writing style, and chooses to imbue his novel with a certain unabashed romanticism.Most peoples critiques of the characters are incomplete. Sure, they have money, and that might make them frivolous or careless to a certain extent, but they all have depth and breadth. The characters only seem overtly despondent because we view them through the eyes of the narrator, a person who seems somewhat detached from things, as he should be, as the novel is essentially his recollection of events. The net effect is that the novel achieves sort of a dream-like quality. The most likable of the characters is the novels name-sake, Gatsby. I read somewhere that the original editor/publisher of the book had Fitzgerald omit much of Gatsby's biography - I would have liked to know more about Gatsby. That's the great trick of the novel, the reader wants to know more about Gatsby, and when his identity and his character is revealed, it can seem anti-climatic; but when we discover why Gatsby has amassed his wealth, created his persona, and built his estate in a certain place, we realize his true intentions, and recognize them as being the best of humanity, even if they are naive and romantic notions flush with sentimentality.The plot to the novel is interesting and includes one or two twists that make it feel like an urban legend.The main sticking point of the novel (for me) is that wealth does not create happiness, nor is it a means to an end. The wealthy face all the same problems, regrets, and insecurities as everyone else, with the added burden of having money.The novel is a relatively short, enjoyable read, poetic and sublime. An excellent addition to anyone's general library. Recommended."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Book was bent at corner, some writing inside.....otherwise, it's still a book, was read, now shelved."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I found the first few chapters of this book a struggle to read and enjoy, but once the love story line was set up and the two characters of Gatsby and Daisy were finally introduced (or re introduced) to one another I pretty much read the rest of the book in one sitting as I was so desperate to find out what happened to them.

After seeing it on all of the \\"Best of\\" lists and being told that it was inexcusable to have not finished it already, I took three days and read it. And it is great.The story itself is intriguing and beautifully-told. Fitzgerald had a \\"pretty\\" (for lack of a better word) style of writing -- the way he worded things in this book just read so well. The story is simple (as it must be in a >200 page novel), but every word is used to great effect.The symbolism is perhaps more what I am left with, however, after reading this novel. As Nick Carraway (perhaps, the only \\"good\\" character in the novel) loses his innocence on his 30th birthday, it seemed to be a commentary as to the end of the 1920s -- the end, in many ways, of American innocence. And Gatsby's tale, the mystery behind his rise, the inevitability of his fall, all shrouded in rich parties and mansions -- they aptly reflect the decedent materialism that often comes with success but leaves one empty and incomplete.The Great Gatsby is a wonderful novel that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I know this will be lost in the thousands of reviews already written for this book, but it is honestly one of the best I have ever read.Why can I say this with so much confidence?Because I wrote a term paper involving critiques from the historical, feminist, and more lenses on it, with weeks of research (by choice -- we got to choose the book). So trust me, if you haven't read this book, do yourself a favor and buy it. I'm a big library person, and this is one of the only books I actually own.The characters, the imagery, and everything contribute to this being a classic. It's not just a book about partying or rich people, although first read, it may appear to be -- it's about the human condition. It's about our lives. It's about love and growth. It's about us.I like how this edition looks, too. Very simple cover, and very light to carry around, which I had to do a lot.

I love reading books that have a tragic turn of events."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When F.Scott Fitzgerald finished up this novel in Paris, he was a man with his hands full. Zelda was beginning to show signs of mental deterioration and infidelity, and his cavorting and hell-raising left behind a wake of bad reputation in the social set he used to party hearty with. He was a bit old for such shenanigans to be tolerated anymore.This is reflected in The Great Gatsby. What is also reflected, and refined, is the paradox of an American trying to live to the ideal vested in the grail known as the American Dream. Fitzgerald was indeed talented and lucky as a young writer, but he was also undisciplined and still seeking to \\"prove himself.\\"It is refreshing, upon perhaps my third read in about 10 years, to realize that none of the characters are meant to be likable. They all have shadows and weaknesses of character. Though the narrator tries to portray himself as an innocent; an outsider, he is culpable as much as Tom Buchanan for the events following the climax of the book. This is important, and had I realized it earlier, it would've served me as I passed through the ages exhibited by the characters in the book.As with America itself, there may be ugliness, indifference, and malice in some Americans. They are, after all, people. Yet people love America despite these bad apples. Their affection more to do with what America means...what it meant to stand for. what it has hoped to be from its inception.Hope carries the dream. Hope endures even beyond what others would deem \\"reasonable.\\" Hope transcends age.Hope is Gatsby's specialty.Read this book and feel for yourself the quality Fitzgerald describes as \\"vitality,\\" and never take it for granted again."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Simply put, Gatsby is a perfect book.

I was on vacation at the Jersey shore, and, as I lay in bed in the evenings, sunburnt and calm after swimming in the ocean all day, I discovered a thrilling new world. The world of seductive glamour and heartbreaking tragedy. The story has stayed with me, more than 30 years later. I've re-read Gatsby many times, and have thought about it throughout my life. The words of Nick Carroway, the narrator, who tells us the wisdom his father imparted to him as a child...basically to never forget the advantages you were born with, and that there are others who were not born so lucky. This is the story of America. It is also the story of F. Scott Fitzgerald. He was the not-so-rich, not so aristocratic, lover of rich girls and aristocrats. He lived in the world of the very rich, and heard the money tinkling in the voices of the rich girls he met in prep school, and then at the Princeton dances. These are the girls that melded into his greatest heroine (or, perhaps, anti-heroine) Daisy Buchanan. Daisy lives on the the top of the heap of all of the Fitzgerald girls. Well, perhaps just a notch underneath Zelda, the real-life Mrs. Fitzgerald. Gatsby was the beginning of an obsession for me. I went on to read everything by and about Fitzgerald. One of the most exciting parts of my first visit to Paris at age 18 was discovering a collection of his short stories that had never been collected in book form. In college, I spent many evenings browsing the stacks of the BU library reading the biographies of FSF. Although all of his stories provided enjoyment, and I would recommend them all to any budding romantics out there, it is Gatsby which is closest to perfection. So many wondrous details. I believe they called it \\"A Novel WIthout a Hero.\\" But Gatsby is the hero, because he dared to believe that he could re-capture the first rush of young love. It's like capturing a falling star in a milk bottle. And it's something we all long for. To keep the magic of first experience. The act of reading this novel for the first time is an act of magic. Do not pass it up."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Jay Gatsby lives in a large mansion on the water in Long Island, New York, circa 1925. He hosts enormous parties each weekend attended by hundreds of people whom are uninvited and do not even know him. But that does not bother him. He is the perfect host, always making sure that his guests have everything their heart's desire. Nick Carraway lives next door and works in the City selling bonds. He is originally from the midwest but has relocated East to seek his fortune. He is befriended by Gatsby and others in elite social circles including a college friend Tom Buchannan and his wife Daisy, who is also Nick's cousin. But the world appears smaller and smaller as Nick discovers that Gatsby is in love with Daisy and that they dated once, years before, prior to her wedding to Tom. Gatsby has never gotten over Daisy and spends his every minute in an effort to win her back and prove his love.Fitzgerald's best known novel is filled with love, hate, intrigue, and friendship. He describes the frivolity of the time as contrasted with the sadness of human lonliness and insecurity. What seems to say so little given that it is a very short book, really says quite a bit in what it does not say. Romantic relationships that are described as happy clearly illustrate the dispair and sadness that is truly being suffered by those that are not truly in love with each other. Platonic relationships that seem losely connected actually describe tight friendships that are closer than others that portend to be strong.With each reading of this novel more of what Fitzgerald meant to convey comes through. It is the type of novel that grows with the reader. Reading it at different times in ones life will change what the reader gets out of it and enjoys. It is a timeless classic that continues to get better over time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is extremely good reding material for High School students.

Only six weeks after we finished &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; it was ranked as the second-best English novel of the century, and I wasn't surprised. The book is concise, with the language for the most part easy to understand so that it becomes possible to try to find the novel's deeper meanings and implications. Plus it really helps that I'm a resident of Queens, New York. Using descriptive clues from the text, I was able to apply the plot to where I live.

The inside flap of the cover is perforated and is designed to be removed and used as a matching bookmark.The cover art for this set of F.

Not only is the literature itself classic, but the books look like a classic collector's item as well! Friends compliment me on them all the time when they see them on my bookcase!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I firmly believe that \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a novel that cannot be fully appreciated in a first read. I read it for the first time after college, and hated it. Now, 10 years later I have read it half a dozen times, and find it to be a richer and richer experience every time.Fitzgerald was a talented writer, and there are times that the prose in this text is breathtakingly good. But that is not what makes this novel stand out as one of the greatest pieces of truly American literature. Rather it is the eternal optimism, sometimes misplaced, of Gatsby (and some of the other characters) that keeps calling to the reader long after the last page. Fitzgerald wrote a book that speaks to the American ideals and persona, and he did it in the guise of a love story. There is no better description of the indefatigable American spirit than the last page of this novel. It is literary perfection, and even if the book that preceded it was not incredible it would be worth the price.I won't rehash plot points here, but I will say that in Gatsby, Daisy, Jordan Baker, and the amazingly well drawn Tom Buchanan, Fitzgerald created a cast of characters that will long reign as one of the most recognizable in the canon of American Lit. I recently reread this novel for a book club, and it is no coincidence that despite the many varied reactions to the book, everyone agreed that Tom stood out. We all knew a Tom in our lives. It speaks to Fitzgerald's honesty as a writer that one of the least likable characters in the text is one of the novel's standouts.Don't read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" because you have to. Read it because you want to. And then put it aside and live a few more years of life. Then come back to it. You will be amazed what you will find in its pages that you did not find before."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I've read this book several times, and each reading shows me something else that I didn't know before. If you want a clarifying perspective on the great, powerful, capitalistic engine that we call the United States, read this book. If you have ever had a dream that you just couldn't let go, look in the mirror, and you'll see Jay Gatsby staring right back at you."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is absolutely my favorite novel of all time. No matter how many times I go back and re-read this book (that I was first introduced to as a sophomore in high school), it never fails to take me to a different time and place.I love the descriptions of the lazy and decadent ways of these characters and the struggle Nick Carroway has to be a part of them. I love the scandals that are around every curve. But, most of all, I love the easy-going manner of Gatsby himself. He's quite possibly the greatest character in all of American literature and I feel that, often times, he's the least appreciated too.I've heard many say that this novel is \\"too slow\\" or \\"too descriptive\\". But, I really feel that Fitzgerald was trying to completely overwhelm the reader with excess. It's an underlying theme in this novel and his writing style makes the reader feel the fact that money can not buy happiness. Sure this novel is wordier than some - But there's beauty in each and every carefully chosen one."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have always loved FSF's writing. His prose is beautifully poetic. This is his best work by far. The book comes alive in this reading by Alexander Scourby. I have listened to this recording probably 10 times over the last few years and I never tire of the story or the way it is read. I have also listened to the version read by Tim Robbins and he doesn't do the book justice. He portrays Gatsby as kind of a dour fellow. I have always viewed Gatsby as the ultimate romantic and that is how he is portrayed by Scourby in this reading. I cannot recommend this audio enough."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a difficult novel that successfully polarizes readers, especially ones who take it seriously. That marks great literature. When serious readers react oppositely to the same work, you know you are looking at good, if not great, art. Please note, too, that the range of reviews today mirrors the range of reviews that greeted this book when it arrived new in bookstores over 80 years ago. You can easily search those then-current reviews on the Internet for your own amusement and instruction and once again be surprised over how little people change. For some of us, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a wonder, while it leaves others wondering at us.To describe briefly the novel: Set in the American 1920s at the height of a stock market boom in the Roaring Twenties, this novel is narrated by Nick Carraway, a wealthy, young Ivy League graduate who's learning the bond business on Wall Street. Nick tells us about his life at the time as it connects with a second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, from Louisville, who is married to the fabulously and formidably wealthy Tom Buchanan. Tom and Nick schooled together at Yale where Nick had an uneasy relationship with the larger, wealthier, and crueler Tom Buchanan. The story unfolds with Nick, Daisy, Tom, and an attractive female golf pro, Jordan Baker, out on the glistening lawns of the wealthy sections of Long Island. Fold in Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson and her clueless, but devoted husband, George, and we have a strong story, but nothing about this Gatsby guy. Only when we are well into the story do we hear about the title character, Jay Gatsby, and he is slowly brought into plot and character development. Gatsby has been driving this novel from the beginning, but we don't know that. We learn in subtle, indirect fashion that Daisy and Gatsby have a mutual past that neither our narrator, Nick, nor her husband, Tom, discern or know. And in that past connection we grasp the proximate, animating force of the novel: Gatsby loved Daisy then and loves her now. The novel unfolds as Daisy learns that Gatsby owns a mansion across the bay from her estate. The old lovers cross paths again - one forcing the reunion, the other gliding into it - and we have all the action that will drive the remainder of the novel. I reveal nothing more and observe: The novel is simple and obvious, a story of wealthy, sophisticated people in boom times, with a narrator watching a married couple that has romantic rivals.The basic plot and character in part explain why serious readers can be so seriously divided over \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Virtually everyone who dislikes the novel finds it to be simplistic, boring, and obvious. Gee whiz, let's try to get interested in people who have everything in life yet have trouble doing anything in life well. Tom and Daisy have it all, yet are stupid, shallow, and thoughtless people. Gatsby at least strives for something better and while he achieves great wealth, notoriety, and popularity, he, too, suffers from problems that should be easy to solve given his talents and resources. Jordan Baker, the female golf pro, is successful, famous, and attractive, but alas she can't make her life work. And, Nick, our narrator, seems to observe everything well, except for himself. All in all, we have a cast of characters who warrant scorn, dismissal, and contempt.And yet, other serious readers see Gatsby as a great novel, a work of art. How?Start first with a quality that almost all serious readers notice and admire: The writing. Fitzgerald writes romantic sentences with a Hemingway edge. His words are at once beautiful and descriptive. Even readers who overall disparage the book, heed the writing, and marvel at it. The voice is unique, esthetic, and sharp. Gatsby is Fitzgerald's finest writing and certainly some of the best writing in English anytime. But writing skill alone will not save this book for some serious readers.What earns this disdain, I think, is found in the deceptive simplicity of the book. At a genuine level of analysis the story is rather easy to grasp, understand, and evaluate. Especially if you are reading this book under requirement as it appears many students experience, the psychological demands of the classroom (it's required, a specific timeline, deadlines for completing various chapters, assignments in class or for homework on the book, etc.) I think lead many readers into the worst outcome for a reading class - you read to survive the course rather than for your own simple entertainment and education. Under these conditions, the obvious, simple, and designed elements of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" attract immediate attention in the short term demands of required reading and lead some readers to obvious, simple, and designed conclusions about the book. If you've \\"had\\" to read Gatsby, give it a year, and try once again. It's not a maturity issue. It's a motivation issue: Read it for yourself on your own terms.If you read for yourself, you can reflect on complexities in the book. Realize first that Fitzgerald writes differently about Tom and Daisy than he does for Nick or Jordan Baker, or the minor, but important characters like Myrtle and George Wilson, but most especially for Gatsby. With Tom and Daisy, Fitzgerald tends to offer direct and immediate observations of their behavior and thoughts as if he is looking them right now with a God's eye view and telling us about them. He really gets under the skin with Tom and Daisy. With Gatsby, by contrast, most of the writing is a narrative recounting of the past that is cloudy, perhaps misremembered, and operates as description with little interpretation or with contradiction from an unreliable narrator (Nick). This makes the characters of Tom and Daisy seem like high quality photos while Gatsby comes off more like a portrait done by an Impressionist painter: Clearly a portrait, but with shadows and no sharp edges. Tom and Daisy are objects. Gatsby is all subject and he becomes a Rorschach test allowing us to project ourselves onto him.Next, you need to be alert to absolutely crucial plot actions that are briefly presented and can be easily missed. The climatic action of the story in particular requires the reader to do a lot of work and keep certain actions in mind through a long series of character reactions and developments. Recall the scene late in the book that takes place in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Who's in the scene? What do they say to each other? How are relationship conflicts resolved? Then, the characters move rapidly out of the Plaza Hotel and drive back to West and East Egg in separate cars. How do those car rides manifest behaviorally the relationship conflicts resolved earlier in the Hotel? Stated another way, in the Hotel we hear conflict and resolution. From the car rides we see how that conflict and resolution play out in action. This sequence is the ultimate plot point for the novel that drives interpretation. You need to read it carefully.Finally, you need to relate what we hear and see regarding relationship conflict and resolution with the interpretation and understanding of Jay Gatsby. You'll recall that Tom and Daisy are bright, detailed, and sharp characters while Gatsby is vague, shadowed, and blurry. You can try to understand Gatsby through the events that occur following the car rides back to the Eggs. For you see, the whole point of the book is in what happens to Gatsby and what happens to Gatsby is caused by his character. (So, Fitzgerald exemplifies that maxim that all writers steal and that good writers steal from the best which in this case is Fitzgerald stealing from Heraclitus!)For many people the basic theme of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is this: Be careful what you wish for. I think at a simple level of analysis this is true. At a deeper level (one that follows my suggestions above) I would refine that theme into this: Be careful what you aspire to. For me, this novel is a great cautionary meditation on the American Dream and its less pleasant possibilities. In positive form, the American Dream is that you can be more than you started with. That explains in part why this book is often required for younger readers in high school or college who are taking their first real steps toward realizing their own American Dream. Fitzgerald offers Gatsby as a caution to those of us who think that aspiration past our beginnings is a good thing, a desirable thing, and the point of ambition. Everyone in this novel aspires to be more than they seem to be or who they are. Everyone in this novel suffers loss, failure, or disaster. No one in this novel leaves with any awareness of why they failed. Yet most of the characters can be described as either great challengers to the American Dream or else already living the American Dream. How is it possible for such failure to occur?In my eyes, the answer is found in the last sentence of the novel: \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" Aspiration moves \\"against the current.\\" Ambition motivates us not to a positive manifestation of the Dream, with the Dream as the Vision or Goal of one's life, but rather ambition motivates us to a negative manifestation of the Dream, with Dream as Fantasy or Psychosis or UnReality. And for those of us who aspire, we will find ourselves \\"borne back ceaselessly into the past\\" a modern Sisyphus doomed to push the stone uphill to the crest only to see it roll down to the valley every time.That is a soul-chilling thought. Isn't this kind of ambition a good thing? Don't all good parents aspire for their children to aspire? Doesn't it all fall down if we don't aspire? It is not that anyone in the novel aspires badly or stupidly or illegally, but rather that they aspire at all is the root and branch of their failure. Here, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" argues that it is ambition itself that will cause people to fail and worse still to fail without insight and repair, for as long as you continue to aspire you will continue to fail.This is an interesting and heuristic interpretation. First, it breaks free of the simple and obvious surface appearances and misdirections that divert some readers: It's the 1920s and irrelevant; it's about a bunch of spoiled white folks; it's about the vita loca. Clearly, there's a lot more going on here and it requires careful, thoughtful reading and reflection. Second, it explains why Gatsby is still appealing to so many people even after 80 years. It turns out that we are still living in a Modern age and the current Postmodern foolishness is explained by the past: Gatsby and Tom and Daisy and Nick would call themselves Postmodern today. The American Dream here is the defining element of Modernism and the fact that we're still aspiring the same old way like Jay Gatsby connects with us at a deep level. Third, it reinforces the perceived greatness of the novel that many readers see and continue to see. This is not only a well written, well structured, pretty novel, it also addresses eternal human nature and the repetitive futility we experience in life. Gatsby is dramatic philosophy, a better written Platonic dialog.Or so I think."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The beauty of this book is that Fitzgerald's elegant prose flows so nicely into the story being told. It is wonderfully written, but not distractingly so.I can't give the book 5 stars -- I save that for only the books I truly think are perfect -- but The Great Gatsby is definitely worth reading. For anyone who has ever felt that deep sense of purpose or meaning in a world that feels bloated with socialite zombies, Fitzgerald's novel is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald broke literary ground with this novel. His style--clean-chiseled characterizations and sentences that cut to the chase--was unlike the work of his contemporaries.Most novels that influence literature in this way die a short death. They are stylistically innovative, but soon other writers perfect what they pioneered. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald manages the amazing feat of simultaneously innovating and perfecting. In that, the novel is pure genious.The Great Gatsby is the saddest novel I have ever read, because it goes to a deeper level than just tear-jerking. It ends in a place of complete emptiness, despair, and loss. It's a book that will satisfy you emotionally and intellectually, and also a book that will show you how powerful true emotion can be."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It is true the story is not particuarly Original, but to qoute the wisdom of solomon The only reason something is believed to be new is because we have forgoten the past. It is extremly well written with lavish description that is not laborious, but enjoyable. The choice of Narrator as Nick carroway is brilliant, as it gives proper perspective. I don't believe the Previous reviewers understand what Fiztgerald was trying to convey. The perspective reminds me Seneca's Thyestes in the it is about are desire to fill the emptiness in our souls. The charecters in the great gatsby are longing for something that will make them happy. Something that will revive the joys of the past. Tom buchuan and Gatsby are both trying to pursue the oldest pursuit of mankind; the Pursuit of Happiness. The Tragedy is that nothing will fill their emptiness even though they think they can."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Now, at the age of 15, I am reading this book, The Great Gatsby.

It certainly characterizes the period well and for that reason I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Time, love and dreams are what give value to life, and in The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald shows us the truth of this statement as if it were frozen in a crystal. Without doubt this book has more depth and expresses more of life in one moment than many novelists capture in entire works. The dream of love that Gatsby lives for reveals so much about life that it motivates thought about what we ourselves value.

Observed mostly through the eyes of Nick, the neighbour, the Great Gatsby brilliantly sums up the idealism of the roaring twenties.A touching love story and some wonderfully written extras, including Mrs Wilson and Jordan. Tom is also a great villain type.Not as good as it is cracked up to be, or anywhere near for that matter. Balzac has written similar story's which are all vastly superior. F. Scott Fitzgerald seems to get very caught up in his descriptions sometimes, spilling out metaphor after metaphor describing someones beauty.

Tom cheats on Daisy as if nothing is wrong with that and Daisy runs away for the death of Myrtle as if she hasn't done anything wrong. They both believe that they are too good for such things to stand in their way and just move on as if nothing as ever happened.Background Information: During this time in the Novel the country had just came out of the great World War I.

Nick, the cousin of Daisy, is the narrator of the novel. We see the novel through his point of view and from what he sees go on in the story.

What a waste of time! :) If you're a person that is in American Studies at Shorewood High School.... we feel ya. :("},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I was forced to read this bland, slightly layered and blatantly metaphoric book in high school. Aside from being traditional bourgie literature about the convoluted drama of rich people and not-rich-enough people, it makes several displays of Fitzgerald's attendant racism; not only in his caricatures of blacks and Jews, but in his character Tom's discussion of the excellent \\"scientific\\" book he is reading, \\"The Rise of the Colored Empires\\" by Goddard, a thinly veiled reference to \\"The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy\\" by Stoddard. One could dismiss this as Tom's racism and not a reflection of Fitzgerald if it were not for Fitzgerald's constant stereotyping of blacks as clowning, ill-spoken servants. One could add a taste for highly inappropriate adjectives such as \\"niggerish feet\\" and \\"noisy niggery street fairs\\" in his other works.One may ask, if this is a Great American Novel, which America are we speaking of? Certainly, Fitzgerald's sentiments were shared by many people in his time, but I would like to think that we are progressing as a nation. We should be able to acknowledge both the literary merits of this novel (although I, myself, am hard-pressed to find them) and it's place in a long history of literature steeped in subtle and not-so-subtle white supremacy."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"There is no need to establish that this novel is considered to be one of the finest pieces of American literature of the twentieth century, but why does this work deserve such praise, it's storyline is common, it's prose bore most, it's seems more related to a soap opera magazine than to a novel, but it is loved so dear to many, ... WHY? I recommend that this book is read just so people can say to themselves &quot;why&quot;"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As I was reading this book, I was very bored. I then decided to look online and see what some other people had said about this book. Some of them were bored, others thought it was amazing. I think I misunderstood the main point of the book. Since i found there to be none. I would not recommend this book to people.I found the author to put to much detail into the things that I thought were unnecessary, and definetly not enough in the aspects that I thought would have been important. And from the beginning of the story I was confused and lost to as what was going on and where he was. The way we writes just didn't flow in my head. I could not grasp what he was trying to say and what he was attempting to show me. When he would talk about one person, I would think he was talking about someone else, and I was completely lost as to who he was or the relavence to the story. I got the feeling that the narrator was schitzo. or something along those lines, just from the way he seemed to jump around and completely change. But I am not totally sure on that.I understood that Gatsby was a very important man, he had a large effect on many people around him. But I could not get over how Fitzgerlad wrote about him. I had such a hard time figuring out what was what. Gatsby was a very wealthy man. As I go on reading others reviews I am beginning to understand that there are three settings and they are simply there so the reader and be in awe of how Fitzgerald writes. I was not in awe, I was very bored through the entire book.I am very picky with the books I like to read, they have to hold my attention from the veryt beginning, or else I just set them down and don't pick them up again. Perhaps he has another book that is written differently and i will read that. You must always give authors a second chance, for they may have just written something different one day and you may like that."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The subjects of the book, The Great Gatsby, are Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchannan. If you are rich and money if no object to you then you would see it as a non-fiction story. But if you are like the majority of other people around the United States, then it would be fiction. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote this \\"great\\" novel that everyone proclaims it to be, which by some and sometimes many will tell you the opposite.The greatest book ever written in American Literature is just a man (Gatsby) who claims to be in love, but looks to be more obsessed, and is trying to win back his lost love (Daisy). Nick Carraway tells the story in third person. He tells of his summer spent in Long Island, New York with the rich and the richer. Nick describes in a very wordy way how each major event of the summer unraveled and played out. With love, suspense and heartbreak, Nick takes you in and even when you try your best to pull away, you just cannot.It is not so much the book is great as it is addicting. As human beings we are all curious, and one proverb states that curiosity kills the cat. People love drama, and that is what Fitzgerald perfectly describes in his novel. After fulfilling your curiosity with such descriptive and sometimes complicated wording, some might come to realize that there was nothing great about Gatsby all along. Sure the book maybe interesting but that is because people cannot keep their nose out of their own business. People are curious about other relationships and flings and try to dig deeper into them. So just as in the Great Gatsby, you find yourself digging in for more dirt on the romance of Daisy and Jay.Once completing the novel, you can see the resemblance to Jay and other people in the modern world. Mr. Jay Gatsby was the pioneer of rich people who swoon the females with his money. He is not great; he is just a bootlegger and a liar, just like a lot of people you might be familiar with in Hollywood. And Daisy Buchannan, what is there really to love about her? She is a shallow, gold digging swine that seems like she needs a taste of what it feels like to have no money. If you watched the movie like I did, then you'd hope she was poor to begin with. Jay Gatsby is nothing but a fool in love and Daisy is just a fool in love with money. Nick Carraway, well he is just a fool who cannot keep his nose out of where it doesn't belong.The ending had me wanting more though, wanting to know what in the world just happened. A relationship ended abruptly with no closure, well if this in fact is take from certain events from Fitzgerald's life then I most certainly feel sorry for the many. The end could have been as worded longer and complex just like the rest of the book. But in my opinion Mr. Fitzgerald just got lazy and decided to end the book at that.The Jay Gatsby was as great as claimed to be, then so is everyone who hustles for a women (Donald Trump, me and every other rich non-attractive male with an overly-attractive partner) is great. And if that is true then so be it.

Difficult to understand because it was written in the language of the times, say others. It is neither. I borrowed this book because it was supposed to be a classic. Instead I found it was lacking in sympathetic characters, focus, meaning (aside from the very obvious, played-to-death 'everything is superficial' theme), and thoroughly unabsorbing. From the moment it started out, it rang false. It begins with the narrator (Nick Carraway; even his &gt;name&lt; is mediocre) giving the reader a lot of pointless information. Do we need to know that he looks like a painting of his great-uncle? He goes over in very abstract terms, what he got out of the experience that this book is about, which would have been infinitely more meaningful toward the end. I'm sorry that I have not read any of Fitgerald's other works - I hear &quot;Tender is the Night&quot; is supposedly better - but that leaves my opinion unclouded by prejudice. This book is amateurish, meek, and clumsy. Where is the elegant prose that other reviews go on about? The most I can say about this book is that it ends correctly, though somewhat predictably. For marginally better books on the same era, try PG Wodehouse's Jeeves or Blandings Castle series. They may not be quite as serious, but that can be a good thing."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I truly, truly do not understand how and why this book is considered a classic novel. Excluding foreign works that put this book viciously to shame, even for an American novel, this is not an extraordinary achievement.

I do not mean to sound harsh in this review, but I wish American readers had the ability to recognize great work. But as I was commenting on earlier, even as an American novel, to place this swill on the same level as \\"true\\" American classics such as \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" \\"The Awakening,\\" and \\"Walden\\" is an insult to the genre.

It is something which Americans have always vied for. Perhaps not as significantly in recent years, but it is still an important facet of our culture. It is the idea that everyone and anyone can attain prosperity and wealth in this country, even if you are penniless. This dream, however, does not hold as validity as it used to. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald sharply criticizes a materialistic society by juxtaposing the lavish lifestyle of Gatsby and the more commonplace existence of the character of Nick, illustrating the decline of the American Dream.Along with his current extravagant living arrangements, Gatsby's original rise to fortune also contributes to Fitzgerald's social criticism. Gatsby is first introduced as what may seem to be the paragon of American prosperity--living in complete and utter opulence. However, as the novel progresses, it is revealed that Gatsby, in an attempt to win the heart of Daisy, had become prosperous by bootlegging alcohol and by trading stolen securities. Prosperity is the epitome of what the American Dream can amount to, and, while most accomplish their objectives through hard work and integrity, Gatsby illegally finds his way around to immediately gain that elite status. Fitzgerald illustrates Gatsby's illegal rise to fortune as a reflection of the American mindset of that time, sharply criticizing society of cheating its way towards fortune. Nick advocates Fitzgerald's beliefs of American society through his judgment of the higher class. Nick is always the bystander of the social scene, as he is Gatsby's neighbor and watches the festivities from his own home, suggesting him to be more of the everyman than the decorated man. It is Nick who notices the socialites are ruthless in their undertakings to attain fortune, and it is also Nick who criticizes them for it, asserting that it is their doing that the American Dream has diminished in integrity. Gatsby and Nick both characterize the common American mindset of the 1920s. Where Gatsby is depicted as the end result, however, Nick is more of the everyman who judges socialites for their lavish behavior and ultimately exposes the decline in the integrity of the American Dream.F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is often dubbed as the great American novel and has been considered a classic for many generations. After reading it, I can surely see why. Many of the books that we are required to read for school are easily dull and hard to interpret. The Great Gatsby, however, is an interesting read and more importantly, it is interesting to read again and again. While it can easily be deemed a period piece, reflecting upon 1920s society, the major theme of the novel can greatly be relevant to today's materialistic culture. I have always interpreted the American Dream as being the concept of working hard and doing whatever it takes to achieve prosperity. Perhaps now, you don't need to work hard. With corruption, politics, and immoral actions in today's society, many people only have their eyes on the prize, and not on what it takes to get there. Fitzgerald only saw the start of an ongoing downfall when he forecasted of the decline of the American Dream."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I won't repeat any of the previous rave reviews, but I will make a couple of suggestions for those struggling with this book.First, I've taught this book over 20 times, and find that with proper guidance most students can at least see the artistic mastery, if not appreciate the text.Second, if you are having difficulty with the text, try to draw some of the key scenes. Yes, sit down with a blank sheet of paper, and a box of crayons and sketch the following scenes: chapter one when Daisy and Jordan are sitting among the French windows, chapter two with the description of the Valley of the Ashes, and chapter three with the description of Gatsby's house. As you read continue to notice the way that colors and sunlight play a dominate role in the book.Third, read chapter 7 in one stretch and if possible assign roles to each speaker. I argue that this chapter is pretty much self-contained and could be considered a novella within the novel. There is more action, irony, and plain literary fun in these 50 odd pages than most longer novels.Fourth, if you still don't get the novel, AND if you are being forced to read this book for high school English, pick it up again once you turn 30 and have had life jade you a bit. I, too, didn't really get it until I hit 30 and could identify with Nick's thinning hair and ever diminishing list of single men to hang out with as we all speed onward towards death in the cooling twilight."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a beautifully written book. Perhaps its greatest strength lies in the sheer magic of the writing. Fitzgerald spins sentences of such wonder, such clarity and honesty, that we are left to do nothing else but shake our head in amazement. Jay Gatsby may be a great mystery, he may be the Great American Dream personified, but if he sparkles, then the novel itself shines.Nick Carraway has decided, at twenty-nine to 'go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man.' By chance, he finds a cheap house, a 'weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month' that is nestled amongst the huge mansions of the rich. He doesn't know it to begin with, but he is neighbours with Jay Gatsby, The Great Gatsby.Gatsby holds parties on the weekends, grand affairs of cocktails and party dresses, his house filled to the rafters with people, some invited, most not. He is endlessly hospitable, allowing his alcohol to be drunk, his food to be consumed, his pool, his books, his home - they are open to his guests. Guests, not friends.He is a mystery. Nobody knows why he has these parties, though everyone attends. Just as nobody knows how he made his money, or who he really is. Gatsby, when he enters Nick's world, refers to him and everyone as 'old sport', a distancing technique that is prevalent throughout the novel. 'It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.'But he is not completely unknowable, though the romantic beliefs about him are accurately held. No, Gatsby is more and less than the stories that surround him. He is in love, his mansion lies directly across from that of Nick's cousin, Daisy, an old flame he cannot let go. At her jetty a green light winks across the water, and it is this that Gatsby watches on lonely nights, nights which are filled with people who mean nothing, or nights he spends alone.Gatsby is mysterious and alluring while he remains unknown. When his love for Daisy is revealed, he becomes more known and less ethereal, his character growing from an enigma into a person. It adds warmth and humility to his personality, and is something beautiful. 'He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths - so that he could 'come over' some afternoon to a stranger's garden.'But it is when Daisy 'becomes his' that Gatsby's character loses its shine and lowers to the ground. He is now a normal man, with the same strengths and weaknesses as everyone else. Perhaps there are more weaknesses - it is hard to consider cuckolding Tom Buchanan an admirable quality. Gatsby represents the dull, ordinary routine of a dream realised, that failed glow of actualised fantasy.Nick's presence in the story has its own plot, but it runs adjacent to Gatsby. Perhaps Fitzgerald's greatest inspiration was to make Nick a 'supposer', to remove Gatsby from the immediacy of intimate narration and make him the refracted imaginings of Nick. 'I am one of the few honest people I have ever known', Nick says of himself. But Gatsby isn't honest, so how can an honest man understand someone's whose life is built on fantasy and deceit? More importantly, can an honest man understand someone who exists - has created himself - out of a love that has fallen into the past? He can't, which is what makes Gatsby, and Nick, so interesting.Gatsby's love lies in the past. Fitzgerald refrains from sentimentalizing Gatsby as a younger man, but it is evident from the text that the sadness of his - our? - lives comes from an unwillingness to leave the past and live for today, or better yet, the future. Gatsby is sad and melancholy, a friendless man who wants a friend, an unloved man who wants to be loved. But can a man who only looks backward expect love or friendship in people that necessarily live in the now? He can expect it, but it won't happen. Romantic, yes. Fulfilled, never.Fitzgerald's writing is beautiful, both understated and grandiose, mellifluous in its gentle rhythms. 'On the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.'It is worth noting the quality of Tony Tanner's introduction in the Penguin Classic edition. He goes to some length to show that part of what makes The Great Gatsby such 'A classic, perhaps the supreme American novel' is what Fitzgerald cut out of the piece, not so much what he left in. He analyses passages in the first draft and their remains in the completed piece - it becomes clear that Gatsby can survive only as a mystery, with as little exposition as possible. So many times, what Fitzgerald cut was explanatory dialogue or comments from Gatsby, which would have dramatically weakened the piece. We cannot and should not know Gatsby, even when he becomes 'known' and explained by the text. He must remain a cipher, such that we can impress upon his impressionable facade anything at all that we wish. I say facade, because we cannot probe deeper into what Gatsby is. The Great American dream? Perhaps - but what is he, even with that? He's a mystery, and so is the dream."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As Americans, we have the God given right to be blond, blue-eyed, rich, beautiful and to get what we want when we want it. It's our Manifest Destiny. Gatsby knew that then. And, we know it now.Much like today, in the America of 1925 all things were possible. The country, having only recently been born yet again following its latest Baptism of Fire, was in its second or third childhood. As in previous reincarnations, progress was fast. The USA was now the most powerful country in the world. Women could vote. Negroes were driving their own cars. Radio, much like the printing press before it and the Internet after it, was providing access to whole new classes of people. Farmers in Iowa. Pennsylvania Coal Miners. Cowboys. Truckers. They all wanted their piece of the pie. And the pie was growing like wildfire. The stock market was setting record highs on a daily basis. Fully a third of the population was new immigrants. Joe Kennedy, the son of an Irish immigrant, was making his fortune running scotch into the US through Canada. Italian immigrant, Al Capone was getting even richer selling bootleg booze made right here in the good old USA. These newcomers proved that it was possible to get rich overnight. If they could do it, anyone could do it. Why, a poor man could even aspire to becoming president of the USA. Old Abe proved it was possible. In America, a man like Gatsby, if he had enough money, could even win over a Daisy Buchanan. It was possible."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Gatsby was a bootlegger and a penny stock hustler. He was \\"great\\" only in a delusive sense. Thus the title of Fitzgerald's celebrated novel is ironic, and that is something to keep in mind when reading it.But Gatsby is seen as a step above the tony East Egg society that lived in their plush estates across the Long Island sound from his nouveau riche mansion--at least that is the revelation that narrator Nick Carraway eventually comes to as we learn from his famous line, \\"They're a rotten crowd. You're worth the whole dam bunch put together.\\"It is ironic and proper that Daisy Buchanan, the wispy, languid and privileged beauty escapes blame for the tragedy near the end of the novel. It is her class that had always escaped blame, that had always lived on in its narrow-minded, greedy luxury. We can see their class--the Buchanans and their crowd--as Eloi-like children of the robber barons. Although Gatsby was dishonest and a criminal at least he had some gumption. And in the end we see he had some sense of integrity and courage as well.He is \\"great\\" then as compared to the listless, privileged people who had inherited much of the vast wealth that this young nation had accumulated during the westward expansion following the Civil War. Gatsby's failing and the failure in general of the rich was that they knew not what to do with their leisure and privilege. Gatsby threw lavish parties and affected an air of mystery while the Buchanans indulged in racist and class war philosophies while they pursued adulterous affairs and the mind-numbing qualities of drunkenness.When I first read this as a young man I thought it was a rather mediocre novel. The infidelities that so drove the story were commonplace to me at a time past mid-century, and I really missed the deep irony that Fitzgerald intended. The Great Gatsby was not \\"great,\\" that much was obvious; but that he was great relative to the Buchanan crowd was what I missed. He serves not only as the \\"up from poverty\\" character so often seen in Jazz Age and depression novels, but he is a more deeply realized character. Not a brutal man like most bootleg operatives, instead he is almost a dilettante bootlegger, yet a hugely successful one, so much so that hardly any of the details of his business now occupy him; indeed one of the reasons that I mistook his character upon a first reading is that the actual reality of the lifestyle of those who fed the speakeasies is not in the novel. Fitzgerald was more interested in the social life of the degenerates and how they looked upon social climbers like Jay Gatsby.Nick the modest narrator is in-between. An educated man of the upper middle class, a graduate of Yale, he represents the objectifying device in the novel. We see everything through his eyes and through his sensibilities. Initially in ambivalent admiration of both his cousin Daisy and Gatsby, Nick eventually becomes disillusioned with their differing but shallow lifestyles and their shallow values while he comes to realize that while Gatsby is a cut above, he is still a man with a tragically limited vision.In short, The Great Gatsby is an indictment of the Jazz Age and its easy money mentality with attendant moral corruption. Perhaps this is why it did not sell well when it was published in 1925--the jazz agers were not interested in self-portraits--but now has become a stable of American literature, and certainly Fitzgerald's most read and most celebrated novel.Fitzgerald the man may have borne witness to the excesses of the Roaring Twenties but he did not learn its lessons. He died young in Hollywood in 1940 of a heart attack, an alcoholic trying to write pot boilers for magazines and scripts for B movies. The tragedy of Jay Gatsby in some strange way may have foreshadowed the tragedy of F. Scott Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Like most of its current readers, I was exposed to \\"The Great Gatsby\\" through high school and college cirruculum and was impressed by both the way that it distinctly and vividly portrayed a certain time and place while still offering a timeless take on love, loss, hope, and human nature. It is a powerful story and one that stays with the reader long after the last page is turned. It deserves the praise it receives from academics and general readers alike for managing to seem highly relevant when it is read even in today's world, as the themes it touches on, universal and yet uniquely American, resonate as much today as they did when the book was first published."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is part of a four-volume series of books by F. S. Fitzgerald produced by this publisher; the other three being The Last Tycoon, This Side of Paradise, and Tender is the Night. The Great Gatsby is of course, the most famous of them all, and probably one of the most famous novels of American literature. Written before the economic growth post WWII brought riches to everyone, this book provided the American masses an in-depth glimpse of the lives and loves of the rich and famous. The book here revolves around Nick, his friend Jay Gatsby, the love of Gatsby's life, Daisy, and her shallow husband Tom. Gatsby rose from poverty to become incredibly rich thru means both scrupolous and not, and then spends his thoughts and energies pining after the beautiful Daisy. Every aspect of his life is devoted to enriching himself and/or his stature in the Long Island community he has transplanted himself into. All for naught are his efforts as the book ends.This book did not begin that American literary genre of books that critique the rich, but coming out at a similar time as Veblein's \\"Theory of the Leisure Class\\" this book is the perfect fictional complement to Veblein's nonfiction account of the rich and their vices. Here, in these pages we see the sins of alcoholism, adultery, pride, arrogance, jealousy, shallowness, and irresponsibility that are allowed by a wealthy lifestyle where much idle time allows for many dishonest thoughts. At first unpopular, this book eventually became the mainstay of classrooms that it now is. Hollywood and modern American literature has mimicked the themes and often storylines of this novel; think soap operas, the Kennedys, and Danielle Steele novels. Overall, the book is a classic, worth reading and having, though it does not get this reviewer's vote as the best book of American literature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"+++++This interesting novel was written by F.

Some include (1) wealth (a key theme), (2) superficiality and shallowness (3) selfishness (4) materialism (5) societal expectation (6) societal stratification (7) immorality and (8) appearances.Something else that this novel is known for is its \\"breathtaking lyricism.\\" As a writer, Fitzgerald is very sensory-orientated. Here is one small example of his fantastic writing found throughout the novel:\\"He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in a many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange and monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\\"This particular book includes other relevant information and insight about the novel and its author. The most helpful for me were the \\"explanatory notes\\" that explained key terms in the novel. Here is an example:\\"West Egg/East Egg: The fictionalized geography of [this novel] was based on the actual geography of Long Island and the borough of Queens. See map [that has the caption \\"Long Island: East Egg to Manhattan].\\"Finally another interesting thing about this particular book is that its cover (displayed above by Amazon) has the original dust cover that was on the first published novel. This is \\"the most celebrated--and widely disseminated--jacket art in twentieth century American literature.\\"In conclusion, be sure to read this engrossing novel to discover for yourself why \\"Fitzgerald stands out as one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century!\\" As well, also discover why the social insight found in this novel is still highly relevant for the twenty-first century!!(first published 1925; this particular novel published 1996; 9 chapters; 175 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book has come back into the limelight in the post-Enron, post-Tyco, post-Refco, post-Worldcom, post-Adelphia world of ethicless business. Like the major rich characters in this novel, today's ruthless robber-barons, cheat on their wives, demean their employees, spend money lavishly on conspicuous consumption. But Gatsby never gave a million dollar party like the head of Tyco did.So much is similar: no one knows where the rich people's money is coming from. Everyone assumes there is something illegal about a few people having all the money and the poor people being pushed further into poverty. But, no one seems to be doing anything about it.When General Motors steps away from its commitment to employee pensions, and United Airlines, and IBM, this book becomes more and more contemporary. Even more so when executive pay rises in the double digits every year. Tom Buchannan, the adulterer in this classic, would fit right into today's business elite.Gatsby himself is mysterious at first, but his background in the First World War is revealed to be similar to that of many of today's veterans who returned from Vietnam, or Iraq, to find that the rules of business had changed, and for the most part, there was no effective enforcement.The real lesson of this book is that the wages of sin is death. Gatsby dies in a case of mistaken identity. His death is triggered by Buchannan's infidelity. This is a message America needs to hear.I had to read this book in high school. And I watched MTV, and the Dukes of Hazzard, and the Flintstones. But that was before Enron. I read this book again after the Internet bubble burst, just like the stock market imploded in 1929, shortly after this book was written, sweeping millions into poverty. And I read it a couple of times since Enron was looted for billions of dollars and sank into bankruptcy, leaving many of its employees without pensions or savings.I think it is a classic because, aside from little things, like air conditioning, which had not been invented yet, the book is as relevant today as it was when it was first published.By the time this book became popular, thousands of people who had hoped to be like Gatsby were living on the streets. If they read the book during the depression they would have been happy that Gatsby got what was coming to him.What will you think of him?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" was an interesting book, about confused love, scandalous affairs, and gallant parties. I thoroughly enjoyed all the secrets and decieving. It gives a vibrant discription of the lifestyles in the early 1900's. Really giving you an understanding of people. My favorite character was Nick Carraway, who lived the simple life, but living a glorious one because of his connections and nextdoor neighbor Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby was one of the richest men, living a mansion one could lose themselves in. If you are into scandals and drama this book is sure to keep you interested."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"My ex fell in love with this book when it was assigned in his English class. He didn't exactly tell me to read it but I got the impression I should. In History class later this year, we went over the Jazz age and I remebered I hadn't read the damn thing yet. I got it from the library.I was expecting bells and whistles, stars, hearts, explosions, so forth from it. This is one of those novels bright eyed twenty somethings mention in gasping tones when people ask them about \\"what changed their lives.\\" But to me, it was not much more then a sad, sparse love story. There's a delicate artistic undertone to it that propels it into the range of \\"art.\\" The \\"eyes of Dr. T Eckleton\\" (sp) were a powerful and disturbing image, and Fitzgerald's descriptions of the industrial wastleands of West Egg were horrifying and stark. But I didn't form much of an emotional rapport with the story or the characters. That \\"green light over the water\\" caught my interest but not my soul.I found it nice but something I did not contemplate for long. It's enjoyable, worth reading, and short enough for even casual intellectuals to whip on through with minimal pain. Fitzgerald writes descriptions damn well, and I can admire that.I will give it this - the last sentence is superb."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Good read, worth the time.

Everything is nearly perfect: the plotting, the setting and above all the language a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Told from the point of view of an not always unbiased narrator, this novel captures the essence of the 20's as well as an earlyview of the divide in our country. Aside from the social aspects, it also tries to show the individual's responsibilities incontributing to that society and the failure of many of taking responsibility for anything other than personal needs.It is easy to see why this book is often used in literature classes and I would recommend it to serious readers."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Not everyone's cup of tea, I know but Fitzgerald paints a picture of a world of selfishness and opulence - a world we hate to love and love to hate - before brining it all crashing down in a way that leaves you uncertain about you future, your past and the obsessions that bind the two. Absolutely worth the read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Stop being retroactively pissed at your high school freshman English teacher and just admit it: The Great Gatsby is a damn fine novel. This is the third time I've read it (first and third for fun, the second for the aforementioned English teacher, who did indeed manage to suck the joy out of it), and I'm still struck by two things:1) That Daisy Fay is easily the most contemptible female character in literature since Catherine Earnshaw.2) That Jordan Baker's story of how most people (including herself) are \\"careless drivers\\" truly shaped my worldview growing up. She ain't wrong.Get over the acne flashbacks and give this one another chance."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have always been a reader, but I have never been terribly interested in fiction. Over the last three years I have slowly developed a taste for it. Because I am such a novice to literary analysis I am not sure how beneficial my review will be, but I will give you my thoughts on this important work. I never had to read this book in High School but I decided to read it in preparation for teaching a High School history class on the 1920's. F. Scott Fitzgerald's book is an important social commentary on his own time. For that matter there are things in this book that are applicable to the world that we live in. It is is a book that is essentially centered around morality and the woes that come to us when we throw off moral restraint and embrace hedonism.The 1920's was a fun period in many ways but it was also bloated. This was an age defined by crime, the tearing down of old social mores, and excess. F. Scott Fitzgerald has strong feelings about this issue. The characters are hard to like and yet they are hard to completely hate. The main character, Nick Carraway, is a small town boy that moves into a nice neighborhood in the city. He is relatively naive in his understanding of the world. He is attracted by the glitz and glamour of city life but soon finds that he is confronted with moral dilemmas that place him in an uncomfortable situation. His cousin Daisy is a fun-loving swinger who seeks, fun, thrills, and financial security even though she is not happy. She is silly and frivolous and likely stands to represent the spirit of the era. Her husband is an arrogant, bloated, racist, hypocrite who expects his wife to live by standards that he himself does not keep. His attraction to racist ideology reminded me that it was in the 1920's that the KKK was expanding as well as the eugenics movement in Europe. Jordan Baker, the friend of Daisy and the girlfriend of Carraway, is the quintessential carefree Flapper girl that was fun to be with but not necessarily \\"the marrying type.\\"Gatsby is the center of the story. He is the wealthy neighbor of Nick. I thought that Gatsby was the hardest character to analyze. He is at certain points a likable character and yet while he is a better guy than Tom, he seems to have become caught up in the lifestyle he has made for himself. He is empty and hallow and seems to lack a strong moral compass. At times he is commendable and chivalrous. It makes you believe that underneath what was apparent was a person who had the potential to do well. Yet the way he made his money and the seedy, gritty nature of his business showed another side to Gatsby. Nick becomes a friend who feels both admiration and disgust. The most interesting character is not even a character but a pair of eyes on the billboard in downtown New York City. The T.J. Eckleburg sign is in my opinion representative of the eyes of God who sees the entire scenario and silently watches everything.The book was well-written but one of the negative aspect of the book for me was the fact that there were places where it was easy to get lost, and a few times I did become disoriented as to what was going on. The book is thick with symbolism and I found this to be both unique and cumbersome. I am sure there is so much to this book that I was not able to really explore. I was hoping that I would find a unique passage that I could have my students analyze but the book did not really offer a section that was reflective. For example: Dostoevsky in his book \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" has the great writing called the \\"Grand Inquisitor.\\" This is a piece of literature that can be isolated from the book and examined as it provides great insight into the issue that Dostoevsky is attempting to address. Fitzgerald chose not to do that with this book. However, despite these small issues I am certainly interested in reading more of Fitzgerald's works as it is apparent that he has a lot to say to his generation whether they wanted to hear it or not.The Great Gatsby gives us the message that not everything that glitters is gold. The 1920's look fun and carefree but not everybody thought they were a healthy time. It is message about the emptiness that comes from opulence and indulgence and warns not only his time but every generation of the danger it brings. Wealth and power often bring corruption and while they appear enticing they offer very little. It is a warning of what happens when people throw off moral constraints to rush headlong into a life of pleasure and party. Overall, the book was well done and gave me a good look at one of the ways that people living in the 20's saw their own time. School textbooks tell a \\"Disney\\" version of history where everything is good and everyone is having fun. The Great Gatsby challenges that idea by offering another perspective of the time. I think this benefits students to enable them to see events through various sets of eyeballs. Needless to say, this is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book takes a slice of a certain aspect of American life and holds itself up to inspection. What is love? How does expectation versus desire affect who we are and what we do?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote TGG, it was during an age of social elitism often built on the backs of crime and underhand dealings. Gatsby builds wealth by illegally moving alcohol, and many other elite members of society in the book are also involved in seedy rackets.To understand this book, its subtle humor, its deep tragedies, and its social mores requires only one question. Should the rich be allowed to do whatever they want just because they are rich? Fitzgerald answers this question in an elegant love story turned all wrong.Consequences have actions, and misbehavior is often punished.Gatsby is rewarded for his avarice by loaning his car to a murderess.The fact that Daisy gets away with murder is rewarded by endless hell with her psychotic husband.It is a great book if one can get past the fact that almost no character has much of a redeeming quality. It is a lesson in life, written as much to educate as entertain."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby hardly needs an introduction...This is simply my favorite book of all time - from the first time I read it, the characters were etched in my mind forever and the story-line is simply unforgettable - it will haunt you forever. Every self-respecting reader owes it to her / himself to read this incredible book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I believe novels should be accessible to people of all tastes, from those who prefer history and biography (as I do) to those who prefer science fiction. Truly great novels transcend personal preferences and that is exactly what the Great Gatsby is-- a story of human nature, set in a time of recklessness and ambition that seems to parallel, in some ways, our world today. It is written with soft prose and vivid imagery-- the examples are too numerous to be listed here. As most know the plot, I won't delve into that, but just to add that, considering this shouldn't be a spoiler, one question I have always wondered (and wished to the contrary) is, &quot;Why did Gatsby have to die?&quot; Despite his surely illictly-garnered fortune and reckless nature, the reader cheers for Gatsby, who is far from perfect, but represents a small part of each of us. That is truly the magic of Fitzgerald's piece and I hope, especially if you've never read it before, that you find a little enchantment yourself."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"There are only two books that resemble America, our past, our present, and our future.There are only two books that tackled the issues so subtely, and with so much imagination, they are nothing short of classics.The Great Gatsby is one of them;Huckelbery Finn is the other."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Can you imagine a man rummaging through newspapers for years in search of a single name? Can you imagine a millionaire who would give up everything he owns just to be with the girl he loves for another second? Joe Gatsby is such a man. After years of fruitless searching he has finally found the girl again he loves more than life itself; and he is determined to win her back, no matter what the price might be.In my opinion Fitzgerald does do a great job in portraying New York's high society of the 1920's. As the plot carefully unfolds the reader gets to know more and more about the protagonist's past and can consequently form his own opinion not just about Joe Gatsby, but about a whole class of society.I would recommend this book to adults of every age. Fitzgerald uses a variety of different symbols and a rather elevated style which is not always easy to understand upon the first reading. However, I think that one should take the time and let oneself be enchanted by a storey of love and betrayal that will be unlike everything one has read before."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Every once in a while, it is important to go back and read a classic, to remember what it takes to make a novel memorable. THE GREAT GATSBY is an example of perfection, both in prose and in plot. As such, it is timeless.In this book, author F. Scott Fitzgerald perfectly captures the energy of that moment when the Gilded Age was ending and the Jazz Age was beginning. Set among the estates of Long Island's elegant North Shore, Fitzgerald illustrates why \\"the rich are different from you and me,\\" a classic line straight out of this novel.Treatises have been written on whether Fitzgerald was the best American author of the 20th Century. Regardless of the conclusion as to whether he was the single best, there is no dispute that he belongs in the pantheon of the writing gods. To read GATSBY is to lose oneself in Fitzgerald's lyricism.So, re-read THE GREAT GATSBY, and enjoy what it takes to make a book truly great."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F Scott Fitzgerald's celebrated and vivid Jazz Age tale describes the rise and fall of a charismatic character and the society around him. The story is somewhat reminiscent of Heart of Darkness. Both are first person narrations of the downfall of fabulous, ambitious social outsiders. And \\"Gatsby\\" points to the heart of darkness in American life, not only in the shady and criminal wellsprings of Jay Gatsby's wealth - and, by implication, perhaps, all wealth - but also in the coldness and cruel indifference of the privileged classes in the social hierarchy.The story touches on many traditional American themes. The loss of innocence and the seduction of the new world by the wicked old one - roles often assumed by America and Europe - are here played out here in the second-favorite context of heartland versus New York, as the young sons and daughters of the Midwest are drawn into the web of the old, worldly, moneyed, Jewish metropolis. As the narrator, Nick Carraway, observes, not only does he hail from around Minnesota, but so do the other major characters - Jordan Baker, the Buchanans and Gatsby (and indeed Fitzgerald himself). Fitzgerald's America is different from today's. Whiter, much more parochial and homogenous, and smaller - Carraway uses the terms west and midwest interchangeably, whereas today west means LA not Chicago. Yet it is still familiar and its concerns regarding the struggle for success, the discovery that its attainment need not mean happiness, and the fickleness of social approval are as pressing today as they were then. The role of money is not as primary as that of acceptance and prestige, and certainly less important than in many 19th century European novels where it is a true nexus. Here - as in the lives of the super-rich today - it is mainly just a way of keeping score. The themes of remaking oneself, of moving and making a new start, and the gap between one's newly constructed self and one's enduring personal reality are likewise as topical (and American) as ever. The lurid denouement also has a flavour which is all too familiar today and is reminiscent of any number of recent classic American violent scandals among the newly rich - cases like Harris-Tarnower, the Menendez brothers, OJ or Ted Ammon.Obviously, many of these issues were of direct personal import to Fitzgerald himself, yet \\"Gatsby\\" is a truly mature work without a trace of autobiographical flavour. Fluidly and assuredly written, it has stood the proverbial test of time, while many contemporary and later works have begun to date or are entirely forgotten. The epigram at the start is perhaps one of the funniest to preface any major piece of fiction (although Fitzgerald - or his editor - chose well in not using it in the title). Yet for all its merits, \\"Gatsby\\" is a slighter work than its reputation suggests: a novella, perhaps, but it has the feel of a short story. The Great American Novel it is not, but certainly a classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Firstly let me say I found this book unusually interesting and unlike many &quot;classics&quot; easy to read. The tale is a romance, Jay Gatsby longs to be with Daisy, a girl from a different social world that he knew for a short period of time mamy years before. On a different level the book describes the pointless existence of the idle rich and their dissatisfaction with their lot, although set in the 1920's it is still applicable today in many ways. The characters Fitzgerald paints are shallow and undeserving, having achieved their wealth through inheritance or crime. The author clearly is critical of his creations, but at the same time seems to be entranced by their mixture of style without substance. My one dissapointment was the lack of any character I felt I could identify with or empathise with, even the narrator Nick Carroway came across to me as having few if any endearing qualities. Probably just my personal prejudice in a novel rather than any literary requirement."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book is called the Great Gatsby but the story is really focused on Daisy - surely a precursor for every 1940s femme fatale. She may have been called the original obscure object of desire. Jay Gatsby hungers for a past where he was happy with Daisy. But is she is part of the moneyed world which is entered by crime or by inheritance. No one really earns it. Fitzgerald seems at odds with the American dream of wealth, but attracted to the glamour and excess of it.The lack of a moral compass in financial matters, can also be seen in the directionless lives of the novel's characters. Gatsby uses his fortune in an ill fated attempt to bring back Daisy. The narrator has empty affairs with people in his office. Daisy and Tom \`smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money ... and let other people clean up the mess.' The author seems attracted to fame and fortune, and yet horrified by it. There is no moral centre in this universe.A very sad novel that has haunted readers for almost 80 years."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"My high school English class read this book this year, and at first I figured it would be like the other not-so-interesting books we had read, and that I'd just get the Spark Notes. However, the few people in the class who had read it before raved about it, so I decided to give it a shot. I found it a little hard to get into, but as soon as I did I absolutely fell in love with it, and it has become one of my all-time favorite novels. The honesty and accuracy that Fitzgerald writes with makes The Great Gatsby a timeless piece of literature, and the social comments that Fitzgerald makes are as relevant today as they were in the 1920s. I can honestly say that The Great Gatsby allowed me to see society in a way I never had before. If you read only one book this year, make it The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is another classic that everyone should read again - after having read it the first time in jr. high school - as an adult in order to truly appreciate it.The story is now part of American Mythology: Jay Gatsby, mysterious millionaire, Oxford graduate, WWI hero, is actually a naive midwesterner, recreated and transplanted in Long Island to regain the love of his Fantasy Golden Girl. What he should have known but didn't is that rich girls don't marry poor boys.Gatsby is American ingenuity, determination, zest for life and innocence ripped asunder by American cynicism, banal materialism and bigotry."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"With &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, F. Scott Fitzgerald takes us into the life of Nick Carraway, who - at the height of 1920's glitz and excess - has just moved to the East Coast with the hopes of getting in bonds sales. Detached but forever present and trusted by the characters, Nick tells the story of Jay Gatsby, an enigmatic neighbour who throws lavish parties, and Daisy, with whom Gatsby is infatuated. As the story evolves, we are slowly given insight into an odd love triangle, the penalties of excess, and who Jay Gatsby really is.The Great Gatsby is a smooth read which maintains its capacity to be called a classic throughout the ages, despite having been written 80 years ago. The themes it investigates (infidelity, greed, class struggles, etc.) are as timeless as Fitzgerald's wonderful prose, and the carefully interwoven and surprising storyline makes for an exceptionally entertaining read as well. Although I would struggle to call this a &quot;love story&quot;, as some have, I would certainly concede that it is a story about love. More than just a love story, though, it deals with the ramifications of infidelity, the consequences of infatuation, and the effect wealth and security has on it. Fitzgerald's statement can be found in simply considering where everyone is at the end, and what they have done to be there. Is that justice?A welcome read for everyone. True classic.Matty J"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In the beginning of the story,Nick Carraway is introduced.

This story contains affairs and murders that are common in soap opera shows. ."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I think Fitzgerald has the smoothest-flowing prose in American fiction. That's why I got so absorbed in this book -- even though some of the characters are people I know I wouldn't especially like in real life. I found myself questioning myself &quot;Why are you continuing to read about these fatuous individuals? Do you really care what happens to them?&quot; But I couldn't put the book down. I felt I was right there, actually participating in the storied 1920's decade, albeit a certain slice of that famous decade (which many liken to the 1990's). That's the magic of good writing.While Great Gatsby brings a distant generation to you, today's young generation (or a certain slice of it) comes right to you in &quot;Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf&quot; by Asher Brauner. In a similar way, this book has a hero you don't especially like at first, but the whole story is so engaging and the humor is so charming that you can't put it down either."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I thought that the book was very interesting.

Portraying a mans obsetion and an olusion. The excesses and carelesness of the rich, delightful to read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a very smooth and entertaining book. A classic of twentieth-century literature. F. Scott Fitzgerald carefully picks his words as he depicts the breathtaking and fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his ventures and strong efforts to proclaim the love of the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. A tragedy that is melancholy but funny; light but insightful; and most of all, it's about something everyone can relate to: almost delusional kind of love that in the end, whether rightly or wrongly, robs life of all its purpose and vitality. Fitzgerald very eloquently writes a wonderful novel, that without a doubt, can be called a masterpiece. His choice of words is very articulate and the description he includes in every sentence is admirable. Fitzgerald helps the reader to become part of the novel and associate with the characters; as well as be able to imagine the story and picture it perfectly down to the very last detail. His use of figurative language in this piece is what makes it flow and sound like poetry. He created somewhat fictional characters, such as Gatsby that one can appeal to and enjoy reading about. This novel is hard to put down, its very easy flowing and one can run through the pages like the waves through the sea. The book is so entertaining that it's easy to miss the fact that it's beautifully written."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Wouldn't read Fitzgerald after the obligatory HS Gatsby tour. Boring progressive high school teachers of course praise a \\"cautionary tale\\" that warns about the \\"meaninglessness\\" of the \\"American Dream\\" (progressive trademark attached to that phrase) as if there were a mass disorder everyone who doesn't subscribe to their pablum suffers from.Then, I read the short stories collected in Flappers and Philosophers and a couple of novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned. Well, Fitzgerald had quite the cool imagination. I tried to re-read Gatsby to see if my opinion had changed.Leave Gatsby to those who think The Catcher In The Rye is a great book. Catcher was written by a phony using the subjective voice of a phony adolescent surrounded by straw-phonies.

FSF states, with a singlemindedness, that in the 1920's, the American dream was corrupted by business, industry, misconceptions, and not living in the present. Also, the narration mirrors that of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" because both narrators are full of contradictory ideas. The first line of Gatsby reads as follows: \\" In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I have been turing over in my head ever since.\\" Shortly after the narrator follows by saying that his father helped him to realize that he should reserve all judgements. But throughout the novel he is constantly judging every single person, and is ambivalent to every single person.In summation, The Great Gatsby is a good book, but is overhyped and does not have that great of a plot."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When I first start reading chapter one and two I wanted to give up reading the book because I couldn't understand what the author was talking about. When he said \\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had\\" and \\"In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.\\" I didn't understand it until later. It means that it's not wise to judge people by the looks because sometimes you might misunderstand that person and create some problems. However, I think the story was mainly about how wealth, popularity, love, loss, betrayal and emptiness. The whole story is kind of depressing because two of the characters die. Everyone's life is depended on money but nothing else. People tend to care about money than the social problems between groups of people. There is a social problem that caused through many years. People divide themselves in to three groups, high class, mid class and low class. If you're not very wealthy, people would just ignore you but when your fairly rich people would remember your name. If your like some millinery person than you become famous. Someone of the chapters' mood changes by the weather. For example, when Nick invites Daisy to his house and have cup of tea, Gatsby feels all nervous which then the weather changes to cloudy and rainy but when Gatsby was satisfied the weather becomes sunny. Even though it's depressing I would recommend other people to read it, which that is who haven't read this book yet. How the author describes things are great, you can feel what the author is going through. It feels like you were there in the past. When I first start reading chapter one and two I wanted to give up reading the book because I couldn't understand what the author was talking about. When he said \\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had\\" and \\"In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.\\" I didn't understand it until later. It means that it's not wise to judge people by the looks because sometimes you might misunderstand that person and create some problems. All the characters live in wealth and having relationship problems with each other. For example Daisy and Gatsby. Gatsby is madly in love with Daisy and want have a life together but Daisy is already married. But the story ends tragically.However, I think the story was mainly about how wealth, popularity, love, loss, betrayal and emptiness. The whole story is kind of depressing and exciting as you read along. Everyone's life is depended on money but nothing else. People tend to care about money than the social problems between groups of people. There is a social problem that caused through many years. People divide themselves in to three groups, high class, mid class and low class. If you're not very wealthy, people would just ignore you but when your fairly rich people would remember your name. If your like some millinery person than you become famous. Someone of the chapters' mood changes by the weather. For example, when Nick invites Daisy to his house and have cup of tea, Gatsby feels all nervous which then the weather changes to cloudy and rainy but when Gatsby was satisfied the weather becomes sunny.Even though it's depressing I would recommend other people to read it, which that is who haven't read this book yet. How the author describes things are great, you can feel what the author is going through. It feels like you were there in the past."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book first starts off with Nick telling the readers that he is not a judgmental person. As he goes on he describes the type of environment he is in. How the East Egg and West Egg differ, yet they both share the same sort of problems. The East Egg is full of the aristocratic, while the West Egg is known as the area for the \\"new rich\\". He is assosciated with Daisy (his cousin), Tom (Daisy's wife), and Jordan (Daisy's friend) who all reside on the East Egg. All of them live in a world where they are surrounded by wealth, and in other people's eyes \\"problem free\\". Nick lives in the West Egg and lives beside a mysterious man, only known as Gatsby. Gatsby is everything that Nick scorns, but disregards that comment because he isn't a person that judges people. As the story moves on we Nick and Gatsby becomes friends. Gatsby tries to win back his past love, but finds that difficult for she already is married. Many surprising events happen, and it all ends tragically.Overall, the book is full of adventure. When you first read it, you feel as though this book has no point, and you want to find out who Gatsy is. Luckily as the story moves on, NIck and Gatsby develop a close friendship, and we actually get to see who this man is -- behind all those lavish parties and life a luxury. The story unfolds and you actually see that these wealthy people actually have a big load of problems, and that they are not as they seem. The way the author choose his words, make you think about a deeper meaning that goes beyond in the book. I think this is one reason why the book is so interesting, because it is just full of surprises. The Great Gatsby is one of those classic books in American literature that you have to read. I definitely recommend other people to take the time to sit down and read this book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The disintegration of an American dream; a rekindled, undying love, held together by the empty pursuit for pleasure. The Great Gatsby is a book about a love remade between Jay Gatsby, an extremely wealthy man who was known for throwing lavish parties, and Daisy Buchanan's, a woman who is charmed by a mans wealth. The two meet through Nick Carraway, (Daisy's cousin) a young, educated man who moves to New York to further his knowledge in the bond business. It begins with Nick meeting Jay at one of his parties where he doesn't feel that he really fits in. Here he learns that the locals pride themselves on material possessions more so than that of more noble goals.As the story grows you learn more about Daisy's husband, Tom, who has a side relation with Myrtle Wilson of which Daisy knows about. Although Tom is just as guilty, with his gain in knowledge of his wife's affair, he becomes more and more jealous of the relation between Daisy and Gatsby which is growing more intense as time goes by. With the progressing tension building, things take a twist to end the book with an exciting, unexpected ending.This work by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a remarkable display of the way society was folding in the 1920's. The way people were falling into a trap where moral values were deteriorating, greed was taking over, and the reckless lifestyle of parties displayed most of the times ideas of wealth. The unrealistic ideas of money could have been related to the rise in the stock market after the war which led to a newfound materialism. This allowed people of any social status to become wealthy. The difference between the East and West egg in the book demonstrated this idea of \\"new and old money\\".The symbolism in the book can become baffling at some point making it an unpleasureable read. In order to understand the whole concept that Fitzgerald is trying to convey, you need to recognize and understand the meanings behind what he is actually saying. Although this was a good book, this aspect of it threw me off a little bit and created a confusing read. If you enjoy reading about a meant to be romance and the confusion that comes with realizing that to late, then this is defiantly a book I would recommend for you."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book started out as a bore. It was just a bunch of older people sleeping around. It was a love septagon.Nick, the main character, just moved into west egg island near New York. He makes friends with the couple next door named Tom and Daisy Buchanon. They are good people but dishonest toward each other. Tom has a mistress named Myrtle and Daisy is still in love with another person.The whole community gossips about one man named Gatsby, who lives across from nick. One day, Gatsby invites the neighborhood to a lavish party where Nick accidentally meets Gatsby. Nick and Jay Gatsby become good friends and Jay tells nick that he is still inlove with Daisy Buchanon because they were lovers five years ago. Gatsby pleads with Nick to make them meet up again and Nick agrees.Nick sets up tea for Daisy and asks her to come over. She comes and finds Gatsby has come as well, and they fall back in love.So now, Tom has Myrtle, Daisy has Gatsby, and Nick has Jordan (another neighbor). And it all begins to fall apart. Daisy secretly knows about Myrtle and Tom accidentally finds out about Gatsby. Tom angrily tells them all to come with him to New York. So they all go to his secret affair apartment to talk.On the way back, Myrtle is running from her husband because he has locked her up in her room. As Myrtle crosses the road, she is hit by Daisy and killed. Myrtle's husband is infuriated by this and he vows to kill the person who did this to her. He eventually gets to West egg and asks Tom Buchanon where the killer is. Tom points to Gatsby's house and Myrtle's husband shoots Gatsby and then himself.Daisy, back with Tom, moves away with him, and Nick is left alone in the neighborhood. He decides to move back to his home town. On his last day he goes to Jordan's house and finds out that she is engaged now and they can't be together.In the end, I was satisfied with it but it wasn't the best.

This is, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, believe a classic of my time. I remember reading this to my biddy those cold midwinter nights oh so long ago.

Little did Gatsby know that shortly after, he would be exiled to Darkest India due to the evil government stooges. Alas, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, digress.

Instead, he became the Great Gatsby, moving like a Homeric Gyad among the party-goers of East and West Egg. His money came from a dubious &quot;gonnegtion&quot; with the wolf (Meyer Wolfsheim, rather than Lanski), to whom he had presented himself in his uniform, covered with medals, because he lacked the cash to buy clothes.Like many an able lad of plain background (North Dakota) Jay encounters the leisured class, particularly the beautiful and popular Daisy (she loves me, she loves me not). Supposed to wait while he went to war (that one again), she marries into Buchanan money and has a daughter. Jay comes back to hover around the green light at the end of her dock and build a life &quot;founded securely on a fairy's wing.&quot;We are treated to a catalog of party-goers parallel to the catalog of ships in the Iliad. The denizens of the two Eggs are more fragile than heroic. Jay makes his move for Daisy, who nods back and forth between him and her husband, Tom. The significance of the daughter seems to escape Jay totally (what's it all about, Jay?).Finally, one horribly hot evening, Daisy, driving Jay's car beside Jay, runs down and kills her rival for Tom's affections, Myrtle Wilson. Tom, driving in a subsequent car, tells Wilson, Myrtle's husband, whose car it was. Wilson shoots Jay. Tom never finds out the truth, and Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story, walks away from the entire irresponsible crowd.This writing is a fictional story from the mind of the great F. Scott Fitzgerald and is not a document of American society. Perhaps people like his characters have existed, but America is bigger than he.

The character the book is revolved around is a man named Gatsby. In the first part of the book Gatsby does not take the role of a main character. No one knows much about this man Gatsby except that he owns a house on the Long Island Sound and hosts many parties. Gatsby is a very rich man. He has servants take care of his house and himself. He also owns an enormous house with a pool. Sometimes Gatsby even takes people up in his hydroplane. When referring to a hydroplane he means a seaplane. Gatsby claims that he is rich because of a large inheritance from his family out west. Gatsby is also a self made millionaire. He also states that he made some of the money in the oil and drug business. Gatsby is a mystery that many people gossip about. Many people say that he supposedly went the Oxford while others disagreed and said he lied about that. Other rumors that circled around the neighborhood are that he was a soldier and killed some Germans. What Gatsby did is for you to find out? Gatsby's true character finally comes out during the book. He becomes good friends with the main character Carraways in the book who eventually finds his true character. In my opinion, Gatsby is a very discreet person not sharing any of his secrets with anybody. Gatsby meets this woman Daisy who is married to Buchanan. This is where the story unfolds."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is the classic novel known as the American Dream.

It is confusing and boring. But if you take my word for it, the rest is worth it. I'm very sorry I judged this book by its first pages, considering how great it turned out....What I want to know is how a classic like this can resemble a soap opera so much?! And be so entertaining? It has adultery, murder, suicide, parties, abuse, long-lost love, deceit, everything! Though its language isn't as easy to follow as today's modern language is, the book still retains its clarity.Aside from its ability to enthrall, The Great Gatsby also addresses the American problem of superficiality and greed. It proves that \\"money can't buy me love\\" and greed gets you nowhere."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's masterpiece presents memorable characters in a memorable setting. Gatsby is a mysterious tycoon that throws wild parties although no one seems to know him. Although Gatsby's intentions are to become wealthy and well-regarded, he is actually after something much more difficult to attain: the affection of a high-status woman.

Scott Fitzgerald with additional content by Matthew J. Bruccoli and Charles Scribner III.The Great Gatsby is a book which deals with the actions and consequences surrounding life in which an individual has no purpose. It deals with the quest of one with a purpose, and his attempt to attain it and the purposeless person accompanying it. This copy includes the sections; &#65533;Forward&#65533;, &#65533;Preface&#65533;, &#65533;The Text of The Great Gatsby&#65533;, and &#65533;A Brief Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#65533; by Matthew J.

The added material is useful and informative, providing the reader with welcome information on various aspects of both the author and book.The book is quite faithful to its time period, presenting a world uniquely of its own, a world content to be defined as the 1920s. There are many historical inclusions, creating an atmosphere of unexpected reality. The author also sticks to his thoughts concerning social matters, being sure to complete and keep up any attempted efforts in the area.The literary style is very involving, not giving a hint of boredom or disinterest in his work. His countless corrections and drafts prove their worth in the masterful storytelling ability of its conceiver through the work. However, Fitzgerald displays more than a few discrepancies regarding geographical and chronological matters. The style the contributing author, Bruccoli, presents conveys a sense of at least slight disinterest in the topic, damaging his rather valuable additions. Scribner presents a style that is slightly over praising, but does contribute meaningfully.The chronological and geographical discrepancies detract little from The Great Gatsby, as its true worth and meaning are presented in the lives and actions of the characters. In conclusion, The Great Gatsby is a very pleasurable read and deserves its classification of literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a story about a group of characters that all see things in the wrong perspective. Gatsby, the main character, lives an illegal life for the love of a silly married rich girl named Daisy. Daisy thinks that ignorance will get women far in life. In my opinion she is pretty ignorant her self. Tom, Daisy's husband, thinks that money and power gives him the right to do what he wishes to do, including hit women and cheat on his wife with Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is also married and hopes to one day live a glamorous life with Tom, but Tom is lying when he said he would leave his wife for Myrtle. Myrtle's husband, George Wilson, is a depressed man that looks at life as though it were covered in ashes. The others live in West Egg also known as New York, the city of sin. These confused individuals all have one thing in common and that is that their outlook on life is all wrong.In the story I found that F. Scott Fitzgerald used colors to help express the characters. He did this by using the green light outside Gatsby's house to show that he had money; he used white dresses that Daisy, Daisy's daughter, and Jordan wore to show they were rich. The Valley of Ashes is a gray gloomy dark depressed place. The author did this to describe the setting more clearly to the reader. I enjoyed the color coordination in the book. The colors make this book more interesting and unique.The characters were overall selfish people that really did not care much about anyone else. Gatsby's love for Daisy clouds his mind and the facts that Daisy is married already and has a child. Their love affair could jeopardize Tom and Daisy's marriage and the daughter. Tom cheats on his wife regardless that there is a child involved. No one in the story really mentions anything about the welfare of the child. Everyone seems to be much too involved in other things. George just wants to up and leave so bad that he overlooks Myrtle's feelings. Myrtle hurts George to the point of depression, and won't even go to a church when his friend suggests it to him. Daisy leads Gatsby on, knowing that she can't and won't leave Tom. Nick's need to be friendly to everyone blinds him to the point were he can't prevent the tragedies that occur when it's possible to do so.If I could change one thing about the book The Great Gatsby it would be Gatsby's love for Daisy. The whole love thing between Gatsby and Daisy dose not make sense at all. I would change this because Gatsby's love for her leads to tragedy. Gatsby could have done better. Gatsby was a strange guy that did too much for too little. Gatsby let himself be taken for granted.I would recommend this book to anyone that is selfish or someone that looks at love, money, power, or dreaming as though this means everything in the world. These things may be good to have but, like in The Great Gatsby, too much can lead a person to his end. This is a book that made me really think about the consequences that result from selfish actions. This book has a great message about life."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"While in high school, a number of people prodded me to read The Great Gatsby and I never took their advice.

Great Gatsby is a book that I would highly recommend to others. It maintains a readers interest, and also tends to be a thought-provoking book. The characters throughout the novel seemed to be almost as real people. With the plot fulfilling everything you could ask it to be, and with an unexpected twist. The author F. Scott Fitzgerald developed the novel thoroughly throughout the entire novel. The way in which he utilizes every aspect of the book to keep the attention of the audience is remarkable.As you can tell I admire the author's writing gift, with each and every character having characteristics that are possible to relate to people in real life situations. The main character was Nick Carraway, and he seems to be a very studious, and intelligent person. Along with this main character, the author added in many other characters to help makeup his cast. The main focus of the book was Nick's wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby. He is a mystery to many of the people around his area, and everyone wants to know, or find out about him. The other characters that the author develops are all of an authentic and credible nature. The writer explains each character with just the perfect amount of information, and in a way in which the reader can feel as if he understands how each character thinks.Along with the creative nature that he introduces, and maintains his characters throughout the story the author makes the plot thicken with wonderful ploys. The author made very unique descriptions of everything, no matter how large or small throughout the scheme of the novel. He manages to seduce your thoughts by keeping the story running through your mind, even after you sit the book down for a minute. This way of writing was very elaborate and tended to make an obvious impression on the reader.The author manages to keep the readers interests in the plot and develop the story very elaborately. Throughout the development of the book, there are new things being entered into your mind, which tend to keep you thinking. This makes the reader stay on his heals, and wonder what may occur next. Even until the end of the book you wonder what will occur next.I would definitely recommend this book to others. It will make you want to keep reading, and even think about the book after you put it down. This is the kind of book that will keep you coming back for more.

I'll simply say that you must read it. It is one of the greatest pieces of literature in history."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald took place on Long Island. This book was a very good example of the roaring 1920's. After studying the prohibition that happened in that decade and the depression in the following decade it really shows how the stock market really can change the world. The Great Gatsby is a good example to what happened during the prohibition. It was never said in plain English what was going on but if the reader knows the events of the 1920's it was very apparent.While reading The Great Gatsby, I was amazed by all the money that was spent. One example was when Jay was having large parties and driving very expensive cars. It also occurred to me that Jay Gatsby has a very dark side that nobody knew about. The people that did know about his income weren't willing to talk. This was one reason that the 1920's are called the \\"High Times\\" nobody cared how much money they spent or how they made money.I enjoyed reading this book. It was very easy to follow and had a lot of descriptive clues about the time period. It seemed like the whole book was an adventure because Fitzgerald never paused on one subject for a long amount of time. I liked how Fitzgerald wrote it on the events that really did happen in the 1920's. This gave the reader a glimpse into what a person at that time could have been doing or was doing to have fun or make a living for his family.I would highly recommend this book for anyone that is studying or going to study the 1920's. It is a very good example to what could have happen to someone during that time period.

It seems that most times when books are assigned reading students are not always in a place where they can appreciate a novel. However, this true classic was one I could not put down! The language was brilliant and the characters well-developed and interesting.The story basically revolves around Daisy and Jay Gatsby, two people who met when they were very young at the close of WWI and fell in love. Unfortunately, Gatsby did not have the wealth that Daisy required for marriage and she married Tom Buchannan, a man obscenely wealthy - and spoiled to boot! Gatsby, rejected and heartbroken, invents himself anew and aquires the fortune he feels he needs to win Daisy. But he never acknowledges that time moves on and people change - and Daisy wasn't the woman he thought she was.None of the charcters in this book are very likeable, with the possible exception of the narrator. All are spoiled, rootless, careless, inconsiderate, and unconcerned with the consequences of their actions. Yet, all are tragic figures as well, and deeply unsettled.Reading through this novel, it is hard not to imagine F. Scott Fitzgerald isn't writing about himself or people he knew. It is hard not to place Zelda in the role of Daisy. And this makes the characters come to life in a huge way. It is so easy to become swept up in this story, to be on Long Island that summer in 1922, to be at the parties at Gatsby's house. A beautiful, tragic, and certainly classic novel!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When Fitzgerald wrote \\"Gatsby,\\" the Great Depression was still several years away. World War I, only a few years past, seemed already a vague memory to the men in the story. Parallels in Fitzgerald's and Gatsby's lives are not so subtle, and if \\"write what you know\\" is the best advice a writer can take, Fitzgerald here takes it and runs with it. Reading the book as a teenager, as many people do, left me with no particular feelings, but experiencing \\"Gatsby\\" again as a middle-aged man, I can more fully appreciate Fitzgerald's lyrical talent with words and the themes he explores. Loyalty, longing, and living for a dream that has, without your noticing, already slipped away.

The idea of Daisy is represented throughout the first half of the book by a physically distant but emotionally near green light at the end of a dock across the lake outside of Gasby's house.When Gatsby finds out that Daisy is Nick's cousin, he proves himself to Nick and tells Nick his life story (which no one truly know and even from told from Gatsby's own mouth, can't be fully believed) for a favor from Nick to arrange a meeting between him and Daisy. Although Daisy, living in the East Egg (the wealthier side of Long Island), is married to a wealthy and mucho but cynical Tom with whom she already have a daughter, Gatsby nonetheless ignores the present and focuses more on making the past (a past with only he and Daisy) the future. Gatsby dwells in the past, the life he could have had with Daisy, and is focused on bringing it back while ignoring what is.Gatsby's image is in many ways, larger than life, and so are all his beliefs. His character is indeed gorgeous for its rarity and capacity. The great Gatsby, is a incredible young man who has the tangibles but wants the intangibles, who physically lives in the present but emotional lives in the past, and who dreams about the future while pursuing the past. Gatsby, his subtle but incredible character, opens a knew level of conscience and understanding towards the vast human nature and the world in general.The Great Gatsby, while showing several divisions and struggles of all the characters between society (the East Egg and the West Egg) and geography (the Midwest and the East), the core of the book, dreams, possibilies, freedom, and Gatsby who represents all, brings us all together.

Though I liked the book, I felt it was too long for the information that was to be given & could have been a lot shorter, getting to the climax quicker. It was a bit confusing at times because of the way the author presented it, going back and forth between one of the main characters lifestyle to his past lifestyle, explaining it along the way. Yet, I did respect the great deatil presented by the author F. Scott Fitzgerald considering it gave you a vast understanding of all the characters and the multiple settings described in the book. I am a sucker for love stories, so the idea of the main character, \\"Gatsby\\", doing all of this out of wanting his past relationship with his object of affection \\"Daisy\\" back, made me feel with him, and put myself in his shoes. This was another reason why I thought it was worth the many pages of description. It kept you wanting to read more in order to find out if he would get the girl or not. I would recommend this book to others being that I had a good time reading it, yet I did feel it is a bit biased. If you are not interested in the time period as well as the basis of again the \\"american dream\\", it may not keep your full attention.

Daisy left him for Tom Buchanan, who is a superbly stuck-up jerk from Long Island.Each of the main characters, Gatsby, Nick, Tom and Daisy, are comparable to elements. Gatsby is Water, because he lives on the water and throughout the end of the book, it is constantly raining. Wind is related to Daisy because she seems ephemeral and untamable, flowing in and out of Gatsby's life. Nick can be paralleled to earth because he is steadfast in his beliefs and morals. The final element, fire, belongs to Tom because of his flaming temper and his tendency to explode at people. At times, the language of the book can be tough, but the pain is eased by the glossary of words and phrases in the back.

And now 8 years later I found myself picking up this book. I read the book in two days, I just could not put it down.

I had to read this book for a class i was taking. I had already seen the movie, and based on that i wasn't excited to read the book. The movie was not very appealing. I am quite sure i wouldn't have read thiis book, based on the movie, if i wasn't forced to in my class.But am i happy i read it. The book was much more enticing and also was a lot more intellectual.

Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest works of our time. Fitzgerald's portrayal of the money, romance and scandal remains unmatched to this day. The story is about the lives of two men Nick Carraway, and Jay Gatsby, and their high class lifestyle back in the Jazz Age in New York. This tale about how Gatsby tries to rekindle the love that him and Daisy Buchanon, who happens to be married. once had. Being the story is not too predictable and keeps you wanting to know more, this is a great read.The greatest thing about The Gatsby is that it's not as long as an encyclopedia lokie some books; it's a fairly quick read. But none the less, it's a good book. You know it's good when I actually read the book, I hardly ever read anything! What separates this book from the other love stories and makes it a masterpiece is the way that it's not too conceptual or corny. On the other hand the book's also not as conservative, the storyline's like of a soap opera's. This book is great because it's relatable. In the book you can see the materialistic attitudes of America in the 1920', in how they were not evenable to see that their wealth will be short lived and though this is set in the 1920's New York, the same hopes and desires of the characters still applies today. The Great Gatsby is one book that everyone should read, because it's not boring and it's definitely not overrated like some other books. Everyone should pick up a copy of this book. It lives up to the hope."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is more poetry than prose. A great novel about America. For those of you who were initially not impressed, look past the somewhat sordid plot. His characters are living breathing people, but also emblems of America. This book was carefully constructed. It requires more than one reading to appreciate its beauty and wisdom about our nation. I re-read it every 1-2 years. Initally disatisfied? Come back to it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I was expecting to like this book more than I ended up doing, since it's one of those books that is lauded as a classic, one of the things you're led to believe is a classic even if you've never even read it. I did like it, particularly the prose, but didn't consider it &quot;great.&quot; I was led to believe it was a story of life during the Jazz Age, an era I am very much interested in, and didn't find much in the way of describing life in the 1920s apart from some nightly parties thrown and attended by overly rich people and the title character being involved in bootlegging. I was expecting more descriptions of things like the actual process involved in bootlegging (how they made the alcohol in their bathtubs, for example), the kind of clothes people were wearing, popular songs and dances, flappers, movies, that sort of thing.I found what remained of the story, after the lovely prose and descriptions of Twenties life, to be plotless and unconvincing. Why is Nick Carraway narrating this story? What does he do that's important? This book would have been better served with third-person narration instead of being narrated by Daisy's second-cousin once removed. It was also really unrealistic how Daisy and Gatsby instantly are as close and loving as they were before Daisy jilted him when he went off to war in 1917 and because he wasn't a rich man. Daisy has since married and had a child; she hasn't sat around waiting for him all these years like Penelope waited for Odysseus! I'm supposed to believe that their romance is rekindled overnight, and applaud Gatsby for throwing these lavish nightly parties only out of the vain hope that Daisy might come to one of them and see him again? He even has his house right across the way from Daisy's, and became so rich only in the hopes of winning her back, which seems really obsessive instead of sweet and romantic.The book would have been better served having a hundred or so more pages so the reader could figure out the solutions to all of the whodunnits on his or her own. These are some great and intriguing mysteries, yet very quickly we're handed all of the answers on a silver platter. That takes away the thrill of figuring out what happened on one's own. The ending also was very dead-end and disappointing. I would have liked it more had the plot unfolded slower instead of too quickly to be realistic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Green light means go.In The Great Gatsby, green light means don't go..The green light is mentioned three times in the novel: at the beginning, at the middle, and at the end.Before I proceed, should I also mention that the The Great Gatsby is one of the most important novels in the American language.I emphasize, this novel is uniquely American. You will find no other work of literature that can hold a candle to this book. It may be required reading in high school, but oh what a work of art the world considers this book to be. Read it and be forever thankful this country can produce a novel like this.The style is decptively simple. When Gatsby says, \\"Old sport!\\" I think of Holden Caulfield saying, \\"For Chrissakes!\\"Salinger owes Fitzgerald a lot. Without The Great Gatsby, there can be no Catcher In The Rye. Nick Carraway is a grown up Holden Caulfield. Carraway is confiding in you. He is talking to you one on one. You listen to him because you want to be his confidant.Going back to the green light.The green light means the green American dream. How ironic that the road ends on your side of the intersection when the traffic light flashes go!Gatsby stands at land's end and stares at the green light hanging at the end of the pier behind Daisy's home. The road ends at his feet. He can get no closer to his American dream that this! All that money he has doesn't help him win Daisy one bit.. All those flashy shirts he pulls from his closet, all those different color sports cars he drives, all of it means nothing.Money can't buy you love. (That;s a good title for a song!). That is what The Great Gatsby is all about.. Green light, go.....My copy of this hard bound Scribner edition of The Great Gatsby has the printed price of [price]. That is how long ago I bought it. I suggest you run out and buy this edition before the price goes any higher. The book is worth every penny."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is just my simple opinion, but when I read The Great Gatsby, I found it to be 1) extremely difficult to follow, and 2) drastically overbearing. People describe F. Scott's Fitzgerald's writing as poetic, and indeed it is at some points in the book. However I believe that as a result of this, Gatsby is much more difficult to read and comprehend. I would have preferred a more traditional writing style instead of a over-embellished, over-done, and, most importantly, an overly-complex style of writing."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"To me, this book was a little on the dull side. The life of Jay Gatsby was less than fascinating and his obsession with Daisy Buchanan was pathetic. This doesn't mean that the book isn't well-written or that it isn't a &quot;classic&quot;- that's why I give it three stars. Its slow moving plot and lack of action is the reason why I only give it three stars."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Simply put, this may be the greatest masterpiece ever written by an American author. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is superb during the classic tale of Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan, and the other supporting characters. Fitzgerald's masterpiece is depressing, and it is much like Romeo &amp; Juliet, in that happiness is never attained. However, it is his writing style that saves this book. The eloquence of F. Scott Fitzgerald has never been more clearly shown than in this book. Readers can literally see the hours he spent poring over his manuscript, for every line, word, and phrase is carefully thought out. Concise, witty, and lyrical, Fitzgerald's writing style quickly captures the reader through sheer humor through the first 50 pages, and leaves the reader breathless through the last 3/4 of the book, detailing his romance with the problems that arise from it. The true brilliance is not the story, for the story has been told before. This novel is a vehicle for Fitzgerald's skill as a writer. The book must be read more than once, for Fitzgerald pieces together his story very carefully, giving the reader hints of the outcome before the ending, hints that are easily missed on the first read. Every word in every sentence is carefully thought out, a phenomenon clearly seen after reading the novel more than once. It is that unquestionable brilliance as a writer, that amazing style and eloquence, that gives this book its greatness. Fitzgerald has never been this witty, this dry, this powerful, this sarcastic, and this thrilling. Are there flaws? Absolutely. The book is ambiguous on the ending, and the book must be reread in order to be fully appreciated. Yet, the book is so good that those flaws are ignored easily. The wittiness, the humor, the sarcasm, all mixed with the sadness and depression, creates an atmosphere of life breathing through the pages. The characters are timeless, the writing brilliant, the story simple, this is a book for all time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In this book the reader is introduced to Nick Carraway who describes his friendship with the new millionaire in town, Jay Gatsby. Jay has changed his surname and become rich all in the vain hope that can rekindle an \\"old flame\\" i.e. his long lost relationship with Daisy who is now a married woman. There is nothing \\"Great\\"about Gatsby or this book which is considered by many to be \\"The Great American Novel\\". The reader does have some sympathy for Gatsby as he engages in a futile attempt to relive something which only exists in the mothballs of his distant memory. I give this book 5 stars because somehow it made my High School English teacher decide that it was worth reading so 60 teenagers had to go out and buy this book. That is a very clever Marketing Ploy!!!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Gosh, what can I say about The Great Gatsby. This classic book, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was a required novel that I had to read for my Introduction to the Novel class. It is a story about a man that discovers that he wants so much more in life than most people had. He wanted success, wealth, and a trophy wife. Put in the lovely Daisy Buchanan, the woman in which Jay Gatsby found his love of wealth and his love for her. However, to thicken the plot, Daisy is already married to the cold, hard Tom Buchanan. When Tom finds out about the affair between Daisy and Jay, he throughs a fit in a deluxe suite at the Plaza Hotel. But what does Tom have to complain about, he is also engaged in an affair with his mistress, Myrtle. It is through Myrtle's early death that Jay Gatsby's life also ends in sorrow. One pitiful scene occurs before Gatsby's death, he is waiting outside Daisy and Tom's bayside home, dressed in a pink suit, hiding in the shadows in case some emotional fireworks go off. The Great Gatsby is a fine classic, and it is quite thought provoking about life in the 1920's and today. No small wonder that my English professor wanted the class to read this novel. Even though we are a small class of six people, we certainly had about to say about The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\`The Great Gatsby' is a novel that attempts to probe into the heart of the American Dream. Implicit in its portrayal of the subject, the novel uncovers the pragmatism and the callous indifference that characterize the thinking of the individuals of the society then. Through the lucid writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald, we see the lofty ambitions of Gatsby and Daisy being played out. Gatsby, in order to get close to Daisy and propel himself to a higher social stratum, lied to her about his background. Daisy, on the other hand, took to Gatsby because of his stint at Oxford.The American society of the 1920s saw a steady rise in prosperity of the nation and the standard of the living of the people. It was a period of hedonism and extravagance, with the Americans \`believing in the green light' and striving to \`run faster, stretch out their arms farther' to reach out for their \`orgastic future'.The novel is short and sweet, but it did not resonate very well with me. Perhaps the author positioned himself too remotely and distantly from the story, resulting in a failure to present a more impactful depiction of the \`Jazz Age'. This novel has also been touted as one of the most representative American work of fiction. But upon careful reading, I did not find an extremely distinct \`American-ness' in the novel. The story appeared universal enough to be transplanted to any country experiencing its own version of the \`Jazz Age'."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Yes, I'm but another unfortunate soul who had to go through this book because of the wretched school. Let me try to be fair, the book started decent. I thought the writing style of the author was good, but nothing egregrious. I was interested in finding out about the narrator, of course, the story turns and introduced a mob of characters from parties and dreaded plots. It was plainly, and simply and tediously S-L-O-W. Reading this book is a torture. Okay, that was my first impression of the book. After finally reading it through, however, I guess I should say it was better than I thought. The story speeds up a little, still retaining the air of elusiveness. It is hard to grasp the theme of The Great Gatsby. But perhaps when you do it is worthwhile to you. Though I still feel unable to relate this story very well. But different people have different opinions."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Are you people stupid?

Ah...The fact is that Gatsby deserves its consideration as a Great American Novel. It's fascinating in language, story, and scope (as well as, you know, meaning), and it's like as American as possible. Unlike many other modernist American novels, it actually explores America in America from an American perspective. Like, it doesn't take place in Europe and it isn't about America compared to Europe. It is actually able to comment on American aristocracy as it is because of this, not as it is in comparison to other societies. So, seriously on the 'America' part of 'Great American Novel' is what I mean.I actually feel hesitant to write a review on it. Everything that needs to be said about The Great Gatsby is is the book. Everything I could write has been explained better by Fitzgerald. This is by no means a bad thing (check out my rating, come on), and in fact it's a great achievement. Fitzgerald managed to embody the modernist idea of an artwork that stands for itself, by no means an easy task. This is a book that must be read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This classic book got my daughters attention when we saw a trailer for it when we saw the movie Lincoln, I put it in her stocking and she's already dug in.

When Gatsby finds out that they are cousins, he gets Nick to invite Daisy and Tom to one of his huge parties. When they finally meet, Gatsby and Daisy rekindle an old romance.Conflict is a main literary element that is used in this story. Gatsby is battling with society because he smuggles alcohol to earn money to impress Daisy. He thinks that if he has money that she will come back to him. He is using illegal means to try and get money to impress her. Even though this was during the prohibition, Gatsby still manages to get alcohol."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is a good book but not a great book. After deciding to go back and read some of the classics I fell upon &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. The problem I have with this book is it leaves to much up in the air and you want to know more. You get a feeling for the 20's but not much since this is such a short novel and very little is written describing the 1920's parties and events. The people seem interesting at first but you never learn anything of value about them and why they are in their current condition. After reading 1984 and Slaughter House 5 I was enthralled by their charters and their situation but that just didn't happen here. Maybe Fitzgerald is showing how shallow the 20's era and people are bye making everything so empty and non-descriptive but that doesn't make for great reading by my standard."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I really enjoyed This Side Of Paradise&quot; so I thought I'd have a go with this one.

I love the symbolism, it is so complex. From the contrast between East Egg to West Egg, to the colors used throughout, even to their names, the symbolism runs deep and true.

If you are not sure whether you should buy it, YOU SHOULD. F Scott Fitzgerald is my #1 favorite author. He knows how to display a scene so vividly that's unlike most authors. His books can render much emotion in a small way. This book is the presentation of pitiable people and displays people in a realistic light-people with flaws and worries, not characters that do one bad thing and that's it, or characters that are all angel or all villain. The whole book is rather sad in my opinion. Nothing seems to be particularly happy or motivating and then ends on a tragic note. Yet Fitzgerald weaves a web around the reader that makes him want to continue with the rainy-day feeling and leaves you with a sad/wonderful/bittersweet/memorable book.And that is how it is."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Gatsby has achieved legendary status in the American canon because it plumbs perpetually attractive themes: unbridled ambition, wealth, power and their inevitable diminution in the face of the most powerful human reality of all-that these are like springtime blooms, satisfying, evanescent and ultimatley to no purpose. For that alone the book is worth reading time and again, ironically rather like the Bible."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"One way to describe The Great Gatsby is to compare this piece of literature to a treasure hunt.

However, I find this style of writing a little annoying because I am not one that usually goes back to read a book again, so for this book I was left confused.

Enter nosy neighbour, add a bad boy, throw them all into the same place at the same time and watch the fireworks. While the formula is a known one, it is F.

It will no doubt be spectacular but all the more so with Fitzgerald's words swimming in your head."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"With the movie pending, this seemed like a good time to re-read a novel I haven't picked up in years. So long, in fact, that I can't remember my first impressions of it. So we're stuck here with my impressions from the re-read:Gatsby, you fool. You're smart enough to pull yourself out of poverty and desperation (albeit perhaps not in the most legal way, but one takes what one can get) and then waste it all on a silly girl? How are we supposed to feel any sympathy for that? My guess is that we're not.Fitzgerald was one of the Lost Generation, so we have to expect a lot of pointless stuff here. That's not to say it's not interesting - on the contrary, it's a regular soap opera: love affairs, cheating, lying, crime, rich people, etc and so on. He clearly disdained the idle rich and this novel showcases that. Yet as much as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy irritate (especially Daisy, as we never really get to know her at all), they also fascinate, something I believe Fitzgerald was disdainful of.The most fascinating character, in my opinion, is found in Myrtle Wilson, the poor wife of a garage-owner who longs to escape her existence. Although Fitzgerald devotes far more time to Daisy, it is Myrtle who is complex and compelling in every way. If nothing else, you should read the book just to get a glimpse of her.The book, of course, is a tragedy. Or is it? Tragic events certainly happen, but it is difficult to feel any sense of sorrow or compassion for them.With the movie coming out, I would suggest you read this one if you missed it during your primary education years. At only 160 pages or so, it's a short read and worth your time if only so you can poke fun at the inaccuracies/exaggerations in the upcoming movie and talk about what Fitzgerald himself would have thought of the production. ;)"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Great book, and the physical book itself was very high quality?

Furthermore, they were not satisfied with their wealth which contributed to the surprise ending. I think the author is trying to tell the readers that everyone wants to have a successful life, but some people may have to work harder than other people to obtain a successful life. Also, there are a lot of people who started with poverty but still succeeded in life.

I deleted that review, and now, six years later, returning to the book, and reading it in one sitting, I have come to an entirely new conclusion. After literally hundreds of books, from Hemingway to Faulkner, to Joyce and Woolf, to Kerouac and Heller, the poetics of this book, of Fitzgerald's writing, is to be marvelled and enjoyed.The story of Jay Gatsby, told through the eyes of Nick Carraway is a wonderful experience that every American, nay I say, every human being should experience. This is a text of utter beauty, filled with the poetry of life in it's lines. It moves us forward into the realization of the failure of the American Dream. It is a tragedy, it is a romance, it is a story of class, it is the story of an American soul seeking both victory and redemption. The writing erupts from the page like sparks from sparklers, each page burning with radiant descriptions, powerful imagery, and insight that you wish was constant in the literature of today.The Great Gatsby is a timeless novel, capable of being enjoyed by anyone, black or white, rich or poor, American or European or Asian. It is a novel that goes beyond that of a moment in history, and becomes a part of the soul. It captures more than the heart of man, but the heart of life itself.

Scott Fitzgerald, takes place in the fantastic city of New York. Nick Carraway, a southern boy, leaves the farms and hills of the South to live where the noisy traffic and tall skyscrapers of the North surround him. Of course to Nick, everything is so different. For one thing, New York is a more \\"open minded\\" kind of place and Fitzgerald allows us to explore the feelings that Nick encounters on such a drastic change. We move along with Nick throughout the novel, bouncing around from character to character. We also find the dramatic difference between \\"West Eggers\\" and \\"East Eggers\\".Daisy, a second cousin to Nick, is in fact an \\"East Egger\\" and she and her husband, Tom Buchanan, unload a boat load of secrets, lusts, and well kept mischievous acts. Nick of course tries to keep out of things but there is no avoiding what Tom and Daisy are dealing with. Jordan Baker, a pro-golfer, becomes a good friend of Nick's and they both are on the outside looking in on the Buchanan's rocky marriage. Nick finds that he's very fond of Jordan but tries to stay alert so that he will not be sucked into any of the chaos.What will this novel be without Fitzgerald's most mysterious character, Jay Gatsby? Jay Gatsby, from the very start of the story is a very fine, handsome, and yet awe-inspiring man. Nick's curiosity of this creature only lure's the reader to find out what this Gatsby character is all about. Now of course you'll learn that \\"East Eggers\\" are not too fond of the \\"West Eggers\\" and Gatsby just happens to be a \\"West Egger\\". So, of course there's some dispute between Tom and Gatsby when they are first introduce in the novel. However, this dispute goes far beyond where each men are living. The reader finds out about Daisy's past and how she and Gatsby are more then just acquaintances.It seems that many of characters in Fitzgerald's novel are looking to attain something. What that something is, well it all depends on that character. Throughout the book we still find that even though Nick begins to talk with Gatsby he still doesn't know anything about him. Gatsby throws these extravagant parties and yet is rarely present at the occasions. However, Nick and Gatsby become very good friends and all the secrets begin to spill out to reveal who Gatsby truly is.Toward the end of the novel you may think that the story may slowly fade out and the book will come to an end, however Fitzgerald throws a huge shocker that will keep you suspended in your chair. Lives are changed forever and all Nick can do is watch helplessly from the sidelines. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is truly a remarkable story. The characters all have their place. You're able to create bonds and dislikes which make up a great book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"THE GREAT GATSBY BOOK REVIEWThe novel, The Great Gatsby, is a work of fiction written by F. Scott Fitzgerald around 1924-1925. It is told to us from the perspective of Nick Carraway, one of the main characters. Through Carraway we learn about the rest of the characters and their way of living. The book introduces time, love, and reality as its major subjects. From beginning to end, Carraway mentions time for an event that takes place, along with the season which gives a certain type of mood. The character of Jay Gatsby runs after luxury and wealth in order to gain the love of Daisy Buchanan. Through this action Fitzgerald demonstrates the hardship he had to go through in order to be with his love, Zelda. Similarly, other events in the book are related to the author's life.Fitzgerald raises the issue of morals and decency in this novel, however, each of his character face a problem with morals. Nick Carraway believes he is the only one who is honest and decent but I believe he is not as good as he thinks he is. Carraway secretly forms opinions about the others but when he needs information or company he has no problem being around them. I don't believe this action of his to be decent behavior, consequently he is not decent as he says to be. At first, Carraway is very curious to meet the famous Jay Gatsby, a mysterious and interesting guy everyone talks about, but towards the middle he changes his opinion about him, making Gatsby the mean guy and in the end Carraway is once again on Gatsby's side because he feels sorry for the guy. Carraway's cousin Daisy is dishonest with her marriage and to her Gatsby, her love. She appears to be innocent and unaware of her husbands affair and yet she herself goes of with another man, not caring about the consequences her marriage would have to face. Jay Gatsby has lied his way into the lifestyle that he is living, all for his true love, which he hopes will someday return back to him. As you can see, Fitzgerald has his characters based on a web of lies and problems, which hardly leaves them any room for happiness.I believe the novel to be very informative and descriptive. All the characters are introduced with a full detail of their appearance, actions and achievements so far in life. For this very reason, the book did not hold my interest. I thought it to have no real meaning behind it and didn't quite enjoy it even after we were done with the book and surely didn't think of it as a classic. I definitely would not recommend this novel to read but if you enjoy drama that is pointless than go right ahead and read the book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Written about 1920s culture this book still has a powerful effect today. After having lived through the 1990s, which was another prosperous time for the economy, I can relate to the characters quite well.If you are an F. Scott fan you already know how well he writes. Many of the more recent authors aren't as good at developing a story as he is.If you like the book there's a most excellent movie to supplement it. It stars Robert Redford and follows the book quite well."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Sypnosis:The Great Gatsby is narrated by Nick Carraway, a young man from the West who moves to New York City in the 1920's to learn about the bond business. This book is about Jay Gatsby, a young wealthy neighbor who lives in a huge mansion, and his tragic love for Daisy Buchanan, Nick's beautiful cousin. However, she is already married to Tom Buchanan. Gatsby once dated her before World War I but had to leave to fight in it. He still loves Daisy though after many years and moved back to New York to impress her with his wealth. Apparently, she does not realize Gatsby even lives there because he asks Nick to organize a reunion with her. Nevertheless, Daisy falls back in love with him during the reunion and the two begin an affair. Gatsby then stops throwing his extravagant parties as they were only meant to attract her attention. Before long, Tom learns of their relationship and is outraged by his wife's infidelity, even though he is already involved in an affair with a woman named Myrtle Wilson. Afterwards, he forces a group of friends including Nick and Daisy to accompany him to a hotel where he confronts Gatsby. There, he accuses him of making his fortune illegally by bootlegging alcohol. Attempting to prove he cannot hurt him, Tom sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby. However, while driving through a road, Nick, Jordan, and Tom discover Gatsby's car struck and killed Myrtle earlier. Nick then learns from Gatsby that Daisy was actually driving the car when it killed Myrtle but he intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom mistakenly tells George Wilson, Myrtle's husband, that Gatsby ran over her. George concludes that he must've been her lover and shoots him dead in his mansion. However, he also commits suicide. Nick is the only one left to organize Gatsby's funeral and after doing so, he heads back West, disgusted by the life in New York.Essential Questions:What is the truth and how do you know?This question refers to the truth that Jay Gatsby hides behind his rather superficial faade. In an attempt to impress Daisy, he lies and creates an appealing past far from his own. Her high status would not suit his low birth so Gatsby makes up many stories. For example, he claims to be an Oxford man when he really in fact dropped out of this prestigious university after only months. Also, his \\"drugstores\\" sell things far from medicinal such as alcohol. In addition, Gatsby does not tell Daisy that he loves her but throws wild parties instead in an attempt to attract her attention, assuming that money could always cover up for anything."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A classic that has concured time. Start reading and you'll only let it go out of your hands if you turned the last page. You can actually feel the heat -as in warmth of the weather as well as the personal relationships between the characters- that is described!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"[...],There is the brighter blue and the darker blue. For the brighter side, blue is the color of the earth and the sky, represents purity and beauty, and holds wonders to the limits beyond the eyes. For the darker side, it is synonyms with dreary, dismal, depressed and gloomy, and phrases like into-the-blue are associated with extreme exasperation. These two different and contrasting qualities of blue come into perfect match in The Great Gatsby, with the brighter blue matching the dreams and glories of Gatsby's life, and the darker blue matching the cold gray sadness of Gatsby's reality. The blue ocean and sky, the BLUE music, and the blue eyes of Dr. Eckleburg are three themes showing these contradictions. Blue is the color of Gatsby's tragedy.Rain, ocean, and the swimming pool are where Gatsby's dreams once lay, but also where they vanish. Gatsby loves Daisy, but he is always separated from her by blue water. At first it is the Atlantic Ocean, and then it is the water that separates East Egg from West Egg. Gatsby dreams of Daisy all this time and the blue distance is the medium through which his dreams grow into the grandest proportions. In fact, blue, the color without edge gave Gatsby too much room of imagination, and at the end, golden fruits turned out to be the same old apple trees. Really, who can argue that the ocean is not a beautiful thing, but yet with all the tragic dreams that this grand blue beauty empowered people to, is it not also the greatest curse? Then there is the rain and the swimming pool, which further add to the sadness. It is significant that it rains both during the meeting of Gatsby and Daisy, and Gatsby \`s burial. Gatsby's blue dreams was a cloud building up in all these years. It gets too heavy that it collapses with reality and falls on to the hard earth. Gatsby dies in his swimming pool, on one of the last days of summer, when the pool is drained. The pool represents his blue dream, and Gatsby dies in this pool of dream, or more accurately, was killed by his dream. At the end, the once flourishing bright hopes of light blue, becomes the smoke of gun shot, a darker blue dimmed by the setting sun.Blue is the music of the 20th , it is popular, beautiful, creative, full of soul, and relieves people of their pains. Yet, the songs are about Poverty, hard times, Lost love, Sexuality, and Oppression. Listening to BLUE music is using sadness to defeat sadness itself, and this contradiction has the same quality as the contradiction of the color blue and of Gatsby's life. The \\"wailing\\" of the Beale Street Blue's \\"hopeless comment\\", while \\" a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.\\"(P158) during Daisy's party with boys after she losses patience with Gatsby is a good example. All night saxophones will play this music among \\"golden slippers\\" of happiness, but inside there is only the depressing notes of the \\"wailing hopeless\\" BLUE. It presents happiness as a brief stop on the train of a depressing life. Then there is the \\"There is music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens.....\\"(P42) when Nick witnesses Gatsby's magnificent party. This \\"Blue Garden\\" is where Gatsby waits, and where sad music of the Blue flows with a million bottles of gay champions in a lonely and crowded symphony. There is grandeur, yet inside this grandeur are fighting husbands and wives, people talking who did not know each other, and drunker who attempts to drive a broken car. The people are empty, they are searching for \\"fun\\", only because they are confused about life and their place in their life. The \\"blue garden\\" did not have blue grass, but had blue music, and a blue soul, and that blue soul belongs to all the people at the party, and the host himself.The symbol of the valley of ashes is \\"The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg\\". They are \\"blue and gigantic--their retinas are one yard high.\\", and its \\"persistent stare\\" is always watching over. This stare by this brighter color over the lesser colors around it makes the pure blue eyes seem like a ruler. A ruler to which all the forgotten ashes and decays are hopelessly compared to, and the reality around is so corrupted and ugly that they even clouded the ruler itself. Words \\"pale\\"(P167) and \\"faded\\"(127) describe the blue eyes, which to a greater extend show this overcrowding of darker forces. The gray ash field is the reality of the world, and underneath the grand mansions of Gatsby and Tom is a thousand valley of ashes. They support the superficial happiness, but that happiness is to fall and to become a part of the gray burial mound at anytime. In fact, Gatsby becomes a part of the ashes even before he dies, he has nothing real, except a empty dream for Daisy. The blue here represents the only hope inside a hopeless world, because it is the only color inside a colorless valley of ashes. It is clear that the blue here is different from the blue ocean and BLUE music. It is still about hope and despair, but of a different and higher sort. Near the end of the book, Wilson repeats \\"God sees everything\\" as he looks at the blue eyes. It is questionable if Fitzgerald is calling people to turn away from the fate of been buried in the evil ashes and turn back to the promise of God. But it is clear that those blue eyes of a certain moral values are been ignored, and it is Fitzgerald's intention for people to pay more attention to this only color of promise.Gatsby lives in the fancies of the blue music, sleeps in the dreams of the blue ocean, and is buried under the blue eyes of God. The use of the color blue shows not just the contradictions of Gatsby's life, but also that of his generation, the roaring 20th with all its laughs of the brighter blue and tears of the darker blue (as on the cover). The Great Gatsby is about hope, the collapse of hope, and more hope, and blue, with all its contradictory qualities, best mirrors this tragic story."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Anyone whose read this book will know what I mean.

Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby was written during the time of the roaring twenties. The novel has many themes, but the most dominating one is the death of the American Dream which died because of Jay Gatsby's involvement in organized crime. Nick Carraway is the narrator of the story. The story starts when he [Nick] is leaving the Mid-West to start a new life in New York. There is where he meets Jay Gatsby, who is a rich man and the protagonist of the novel. Gatsby is in love with Daisy Buchannan, who is coincidentally Nick's cousin. Even though Daisy is married to a man named Tom Buchanan, she is very much in love with Gatsby. Tom is the bad guy in the story or the antagonist. Tom is having an affair with a lady named Myrtle Wilson. He treats Myrtle very badly, but she puts up with it because of his wealth. Myrtle is married to George Wilson who is the hard luck guy in the novel who in the end takes out his revenge on someone that did not deserve it. Jordan Baker is the woman in brings Gatsby to Nick and consequently Gatsby to his long lost love Daisy. In the end it is revealed that Gatsby and Daisy are very much in love. When Tom finds out about this he gets very upset and tells George Wilson that Gatsby is having an affair with his wife. Raged, Wilson goes and murders Gatsby for something he did not do. The story ends tragicically because Myrtle and George are all killed in violently. Fitzgerald's main purpose of writing this novel was to briefly describe what it was like in the 1920's. In the critical essays that I read it seems that Fitzgerald's purpose in writing the essay was to relate himself to Gatsby. Gatsby is described as Fitzgerald which I don't believe is right because he [Gatsby] is described as the &quot;victim&quot; in the story when really he is not."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"C'&eacute;tait tr&egrave;s bon! j&eacute; l'ai lu pour mon classe d'anglais.. je n'aime pas Robert Redford Au revoir !"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I recommend this book because it gives a realistic view of the American Dream in the 1920s. The '20's were a time of change for women. They were cutting their hair, working for the right to vote and playing golf. These new freedoms were enjoyed by the character Jordan Baker.The '20's were also a time of getting rich. Lots of people were making money on the stockmarket, but only white people. All of the characters in the Great Gatsby were Caucasian.The '20's were a time of organized crime and bootleggers. Gatsby was rumored to be earning his wealth illegally. Life had lost its meaning for the rich. Daisy Buchanan's life was filled with material comforts and luxuries, and empty of purpose. &quot;What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon, and the day after that, and the next thirty years?&quot; she asks one afternoon.Nick Carraway, the main character, symbolizes the average, middle class person who dreams of being rich. He moved East for a better job and more money. During the course of the book, he learns to know rich people. (Daisy is his cousin.) He realizes that the American Dream is not as dreamy as it appears to be. In fact, part of the American Dream is a nightmare. Still the desire to be rich and have the American Dream is strong and hard to resist. Myrtle Wilson is treated shabbily by Tom Buchanan a rich man with whom she is having an affair.

This book not only moved me with its lyricism but left me often with a sort of physical feeling that I simply cannot find words to explain.This novel says so much about the emptiness and excess of the jazz age as experienced by the wealthy leisure class.Fitzgerald so wonderfully portrays the idea that it is the STRIVING for greatness that counts in life, because once it is reached, it can never possibly live up to the grandeur that one envisages in dreams. In many ways, this book suggests the end of the American dream, and while Gatsby himself is not far from reproach, he represents the desire in all of us to be something better. He is both flawed and beautiful; lonely yet eerily surrounded.If you want to be moved, read this book...and really pay attention to the language and the mood; it may very well change the way you see the world."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby holds a special place in my heart. Like Nick Carraway, the narrator, I am a Midwesterner that ventured out East to Yale and returned somewhat disenchanted with the rhythm of life on the East coast. So there are personal reasons for me to identify with the novel, in addition to Fitzgerald's unusual brilliance and mastery of the English language.This was not always the case. Many people-- some of them very intelligent- often faulted The Great Gatsby for being 'soft' or 'too easy to read.' This is not intentional academic snobbery-- how often have readers taken up a facile book without coming away satisfied? Indeed, the critics of Fitzgerald's time did not take him seriously for similar reasons-- I myself fell within this skeptic group until I reread the novel four years later after heavy exposure to the other literary lights of that time.Having now read The Great Gatsby approximately twenty times, I have come to recognize the unique power of the novel. It is, as described in the introductory essay, a complete miracle. It is a miracle of social criticism as witnessed by the unsurmountable gap between old and new money; it is a miracle (one might almost say an inevitable result) of the modern schism between the age of hard-nosed science and pure romantism; it is a miracle of story-telling, combining Hemingway's lucid economy with Faulkner's innovation and power. The result is Fitzgerald's characteristic 'magic voice,' which has yet to be duplicated by any author since.And above all, it is a good story. At the heart of the tale is the use of a partially-involved first person narrator (in the form of Nick Carraway), combining the power of the first-person POV with the sweep and scope of the third person narrative. This stroke of genius becomes even more evident as parallel story lines develop, resulting in the convergence of the two paths and the famous closing scene with the now-transformed Nick brooding on the deserted beach.There is so much to this book that it is impossible to list all that I admire. Yet paradoxically, unlike other masterworks like Absalom! Absalom!, it is possible for everyone who reads The Great Gatsby to view the work in its totality. It is so natural that it is almost as if Fitzgerald did not write it, and rather, the work appeared completed and perfect of its own volition-- a masterpiece for everyone."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I am sorry to have waited so long to read this masterpiece. F. Scott Fitzgerald's crowning achievement is a relatively concise, easily readable gem of a story, which goes much deeper than the average genre fiction (obviously), but not in a dull way.It is very easy to picture oneself as Nick, the protagonist, attempting to piece together this strange character, Jay Gatsby, and the elaborate world he inhabits. Character development is beautifully accomplished as the book progresses, and there is no wasted scenes or characters. In fact, there is a great deal of substance to the entire story, despite its focus on the lack of substance for the characters presented.The Great Gatsby will help you understand the lives of the fabulously wealthy in the 20s, but more importantly it will help you begin to understand the real world, and what is really important. Gatsby's &quot;Green light&quot; is each of ours as well, if we would only see it.If you have a soul, you will love this book, and either way, it will certainly make you think."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel has been characterized as the quintessential American novel, and even as &quot;THE&quot; American novel. Whether or not I agree with that characterization, F. Scott Fitzgerald's short but dense tale is a masterpiece. That said, there is not much I can add to the years and years of analysis and praise. This book is simply stunning.I will not rehash plot details here, but I will make a few comments. I studied this book as an English major at college, and just reread it for fun 10 years later. I remember reading it as a student, and learning about all the symbolism present. If you look for it, you can find symbolism contained in every paragraph. A few symbolic themes I remember studying were those of colors, the weather, religion and the Bible, and numbers. I remember learning that different colors represented different traits. White, for example, supposedly represents purity, while yellow represents artificiality. Therefore, the name Daisy is itself a symbol: a daisy is white on the outside and yellow in the center. Accordingly, Daisy appears to be pure but inside is tarnished and artificial.While it is fascinating to study all the symbolism in this novel, this time I read it purely for the story. And the story is more than enough. Strip away all of the symbolism, and this would still be a masterpiece. This is the tale of a twisted perversion of the American dream--one of Gatsby's ambition to amass a fortune in order to win over Daisy. Yet he will never win over Daisy, for she will never love one who has to earn his wealth. It is the story of Gatsby's failure to win even one true friend, despite the fact that his house is always filled with people, and everyone &quot;knows&quot; him. Even the narrator only arranges Gatsby's funeral out of a sense of obligation and pity.This slim masterpiece is beautifully and concisely written, and heartbreaking without ever being sentimental. This book has survived 75 years worth of critical analysis, and it still going strong. In another 75 years, people will still be studying this grotesque manifestation of the American dream."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read this book in high school for a class and thought it was one of the most boring pieces of crap I would ever read. I now realize how absolutely wrong I was. In some ways, I think it is impossible for anyone who has not had to make a living to understand so I forgive my past opinions as the inexperienced feelings of an immature mind.This is a book for all of those who work for a living and yet meet with those who are affluent who never have to worry about a thing. I found it enthralling."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The first time I read this book I was a sophomore in highschool and I had no choice about it. I read the book and didn't enjoy it and felt many of the same emotions as the other kid who read it and said it was predictible and annoying. I breezed throught the book, often skimming, and was done, and dissapointed.Fast forward to the present day. I had been thinking about how The Great Gatsby is considered a classic, and how i didnt enjoy it at all. I decicded to read it again, carefully trying to asorb some meaning.And I found it.This book is really profound, a great work. The characters all fit together so well, and the story just takes you back to another time.If you are 14-18 years old, and just read this book to read it you wil not enjoy it. I think I just wans't mature enough to appreciate this work before. Don't judge this book by the first time you read it. Take the time to read it again and think about it; you will love it.A good analogy is how a diamond in the rough just looks like glass on the beach, sanded and hidden in a fog. Only when the diamond has been processed is its value apparent, and only when you take the time to process a book of this magnitude is it's value appreciable."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Even a jealous Ernest Hemingway had to concede that &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a gem. Re-reading this book nearly 100 years after it was written, I realize that no one else has better captured the essence of 20th Century America, nor described it as eloquently. Not a single word is wasted in this work. The last lines are an amazing summation of not just this novel, but of human existence (they are engraved on Fitzgerald's tombstone). &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; are the only books about America that are even in the same league as &quot;Gatsby,&quot; but they are not as brilliantly conceived and executed."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I am one of those \\"freaks\\" who makes sure to read this novel at least once a year. It brings me a sort of solace.This is as close to a Salinger novel as one can get. Moral lessons spoken thru New York City in the early 1900's.In this case we have the author and his 2nd cousin, a worldly woman who steals hearts and refuses to let go.Gatsby accomplishes everything he can create in his mind, but he cannot compare to what Daisy demands. She is noy human it seems, and Gatsby cannot keep up, no matter how hard he tries.This novel was required reading in high school, and thank God for that. Even after my 12th grade english teacher pounding into my head the symbolism of the eye-glasses on the billboard in the city of ashes. And also why Gatsby was a \\"heroic figure\\".Basically, this novel ends the only way it can. Death is necessary and we all will perish. But sometimes we die a bit too soon.No matter where I am in my life, this book always sets me straight. What will be...will be.Gatsby could not have lived any other way. It's all good."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"No more perfect American book exists. Jay Gatsby pursues the American dream with a single minded zeal and the closer he gets to his dream the emptier he is. The greatness of the book is both in this theme and in the way Fitzgerald makes Gatsby stand for all of us Americans. In his later works Fitzgerald falters but here every last detail is in its proper place. The narrator Nick is the perfect voice for this story. Through his eyes we may see that Gatsby is not all that Gatsby wants to be but like Nick we let ourselves be seduced anyway. The most superficial creature in this book, Daisy, is the object of Gatsby's lifelong obsession. She is about as weak as that flower and no more complex. Only Gatsby with his undying ability to dream which is unmatched by any character in fiction and the reason we all love him can imagine she is anything more than the common flower of her namesake. Everything functions and happens exactly as it should. No plot, I suggest, can be repeated by more readers. I put this in a tie with Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises for greatest book by an American. Hemingway's book is equally great though for quite different reasons. I think in his next book Tender is the Night Fitzgerald is trying to cover Hemingway's terrain but unlike Hemingway Fitzgerald does not really belong in Europe. Hemingway uncovers what it is to be American by showing Americans outside America and in contrast to Europeans. Fitzgerald never brings his Americans abroad in contact with anything but each other. But in this book he is brilliant. I just wish he would have stayed put."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I loved this book! Sure the first chapter is boring, but the rest of it is great. This is a difficult book to understand, but if I read it again I'll enjoy it more for the new information I find. I even gave a copy to a friend of mine so she could read it. One thing troubles me. Did Daisy drive past her husband's mistress' house on purpose, or was just on her way? If it was a deliberate act, then it seems like she meant to kill her. Or am I just completely insane?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Yes the first 25 pages is really quite astonishing and it's difficult to continue with your eyes open , it's a classic so i guess you have to make an effort to keep them open if you want the fruits. The description is through the eyes of a cynical, mysterious and a wierd man which is why it gives the whole story a different outlook, but that what i enjoyed best, this book it written so differently from what we're used to read, the man gatsby, his stories - all taken so cynically by the narrator nick, i love the way he puts it and then how he ultimately becomes so credible that he takes everything as it is given by gatsby. Gatsby's lust for money and love for daisy is icing over the cake, the end's just a little sad but that makes the book a classic. I think it's a must for the lovers of classics and to those who want to write in future, it's a piece of the finest writings i've read. If you're looking for a plot or continuous reading i would not suggest the book.This book is a masterpiece when it's writing and chharacterisation is concerned."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I am not surprised that this book falls into the category of one of the greats of American literature. The eloquence with which Fitzgerald writes with is somewhat rare, however the story would not have worked had he not. I was required to read the novel for my English class, and although I despise analysing literature I found the story impossible to understand without analysing it. It's a plot that you don't get engrossed in, but one that you eventually want to know the outcome. Recommend it to anyone? Yes. It's worth the read. Rave about it? No. It's not worth arguing if you meet some opposition."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I usually hate the books I have to read for school, but this one was the best book I have ever read. Fitzgerald writes this novel remarkably. It is awesome, but to get the &quot;full experience&quot; you have to look for symbols and stuff. The depth of this book is remarkable. You have to read this book. Tragically, it truly portrays the American Dream for what it is. The characters are wonderfully discribed. This book is surely the best American novel."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The novel seems boring in the first two chapters but after all is very interesting. The novel is about the main character, Gatsby chasing after his romantic dream with Daisy. If you like the novel, &quot;Great Expectation&quot;, I am sure you will like this one."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have heard many comments and praise about this book, and I had to read it for myself over a summer to see just how good it was. That first time I read it, I thought it was extremely boring, and couldn't even get past the first 8 pages. However, when it was assigned to me in my English class the following year, I learned how rich it was in it's symbolism and style. It really made me question where our society is headed in terms of ethics and materialism. I can see how people who may not totally understand this book will find it boring and slow, as I had experianced it when I first read it. However, I recommend it as a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone in high school or above."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a novel that is probably one that I will be able to remember for the rest of my life. I say this because it has so much to do with the realities of today, not just of the early twenties. These include issues of love, social status, and money. Following the life of Gatsby makes you realize how much all of us has experienced at one point in our lives what he is experiencing. The novel was well written with numerous methaphors to give readers their own interpretations of different scenes. Take for example the locations of East Egg and West Egg separated by the harbor, symbolizing the separation of the rich and the poor and that Jay Gatsby may never be with the woman he loves. This and many other things make this a great book. I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys to read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read this book because it was assigned to me in my english class. I had heard a lot about it, but I was sceptical of how good it would be. In the end, I really enjoyed it. I felt it did an excellent job of conveying the greed and materialism of Americans in the 20s and it can certainly apply to Americans today. Fitzgerald is an amazing author. Every word of his novel is important and included for some reason. There is also remarkable symolism that I thoroughly enjoyed discussing in class."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Well, the first time I read this book was when I was 13 and trying to fit into the &quot;big leagues,&quot; modeling after my brother who gave me the book and said I'd hate it because the content would seem all too mundane. Well, I hated it. I hated it so much, I would have never recommended it...Now, I'm 16 and I re-read it three days ago, and I have to say it's the most wondeful piece of American Literature ever written. It stands above and beyond To Kill a Mockingbird (though that is VERY debatable), The Grapes of Wrath, An American Tragedy, and even Old Man and the Sea.I would suggest reading the book if you are into a master perception of the human character, and enjoy stories of rich people and greed and luminous lifestyles.At times, I wanted to tear the book right in half because I got into it so much and actually had real emotions, which is something very few books have allowed me to recieve. The only two are A Prayer for Owen Meany and Of Mice and Men...wait...also Lord of the Flies. But once I finsihed the book, I thought about it, and realized how damn good it really is.Read it if you have a good sense of diversified taste. Now I am reading some James Joyce and buying Advil by the package...DAMN YOU, ULYSSES!--It's really a good book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I had heard a lot about this book, but when I finally read it, I was disappointed. The plot is just too silly and predictable.... The only positive thing I have to say about this book is that Fitzergald writes it well. This novel is another example (along with &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;) of a bad plot well written."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"What a wonderful book this is, capturing the essence of the ambition, lust, love and gay abandonment, not only of the 1920s, but of the human spirit itself. Widely regarded as a classic of modern literature, Fitzgerald manages to capture something very American, very modern, very sublime and truly timeless in this novel; from the relatively simple narrative of romantic yearnings, to the greedy ambitions, the lost loves, the complex enchantments, and the underlying despair; this is a journey of life.This book for me is just too much. Take the exchange between Nick and Gatsby about the 'past', and following 'lost dreams';- \\"You can't repeat the past\\" (Nick). \\"Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can\\" (Gastby). Can you? I still don't know. How about the early quote of \\"the foul dust that floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the shortwinded elations and abortive sorrows of men\\". A dark promise of things to come. And what about the exhileration and excitement of the \\"returning trains of my youth\\", near the end, where Nick decides to leave the 'big smoke' in New York, permanently tainted in his mind, for the wide plains, the homely townships, and to escape from the shallow, superficial and 'messy' lives of the Big Apple pretenders.I won't spoil you with intricate details of the story, if you haven't read it and you want to understand modern literature and the modern western world, you have to read it. It is as simple as that.This book is a unique expose of the human spirit, the western dream, the love and despair of life; quintessentially 20th century and quintessentially beautiful.I wish I was seventeen and could read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald is a pure genius. The Great Gatsby was beatifully written and completely captured the 1920s and its American Jazz Age. On the surface, Fitzgerald's novel seemed simple, but after a months study on it the book revealed so much more. Only a literary mastermind could have come up with such a subtle novel that came to be more complex and insightful than expected. Fitzgerald's characters is what brought life to the book. Nick, being the narrator, showed sensibility in the novel. Although Nick represented the middle class people striving to upgrade their status, he maintained his ground. Through the experiences that he had gone through being with the high society, there was a major turning point for him. Nick realized that that corrupt and shallow class had absolutely no morals. From there he moved back West, too afraid that he may experience what Gastby had experienced. Jay Gatsby on the other hand, was somewhat of an honorable mystery. He was a mystery because he was never seen directly, but mainly through other peoples perceptions. Nobody really knew him as a person and nobody knew his identity. Although, Gatsby was on a quest in search of something that meant his whole life to him. He wanted to re-live the past that he had with Daisy and didn't stop for a second to come back to reality no matter what other people had told him. Now Daisy was simply a basketcase and represented her society quite well. She was materialistic and extremely shallow, thus the name Daisy. She had played with people's minds and seemed to play with her own mind at the same time. The novel just came together very well with the connection of the seasons to Gatsby's dream to even the slightest detailing of the colour of clothing and even the vehicle's interior. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel was very insightful and well-crafted, but before making any first judgements after reading it thorough research will make you believe how great The Great Gatsby truly is."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The story of Jay Gatsby is narrated by Nick Carraway. Carraway had graduated from New Haven in 1915, had participated in the Great War and, returning restless, decided to move East and learn the bond business. In the spring of 1922, he rents a house in West Egg, Long Island next to the mansion of Gatsby - a mysterious host of large and extravagant parties.It seems that few people know anything about Gatsby, so speculation is rife. Gatsby is wealthy and powerful, and knows how to get things done. And yet, while many flock to his parties, he seems to have no friends, only business associates. A man of mystery.Nick Carraway's second cousin, once removed, is Daisy Buchanan. Daisy and Tom (and their daughter Pammy) live on the more fashionable East Egg side of Long Island. Nick had met her husband Tom at New Haven and Nick calls on them soon after moving to West Egg. During his visit, Nick also meets Jordan Baker who tells him that Tom has a mistress, and finds that here as well that Gatsby, his parties and his wealth are a topic of discussion. There is a lot of restless energy here, as well as a sense of dissatisfaction, of boredom and of wanting more from life.Myrtle Wilson, Tom's mistress, lives with her husband Tom near an expanse of land known as the Valley of Ashes. A wasteland of sorts, between New York and Long Island, constantly under the view of an advertisement for an oculist.\`But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.'Through Nick and Jordan, Daisy is reintroduced to Gatsby. She had been engaged to him before her marriage to Tom, back when he had no money. Gatsby still loves Daisy, and hopes to recapture this past romance.\`\`Can't repeat the past?' he cried incredulously. \`Why of course you can.''Unfortunately, for Jay Gatsby, he cannot repeat the past. And a series of unfortunate coincidences and tragedies obliterate his future as well as that of the Wilsons. It's of no consequence to Tom and Daisy, the destruction that they cause and retreat from. They live in and for the moment, without loyalty and without care.\`They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made ...'\`Her voice is full of money', he said suddenly.' And money talks in this novel, but it has to be the \`right' sort of \`old' money. There is no place for a parvenu like Gatsby, and there are few mourners at his funeral.It's been forty years since I last read this novel, and while I remembered the story fairly well, it had a different impact this time around. The first time around I wondered how people could be so fickle and shallow, this time I was more focussed on how Fitzgerald manages to complete such an unsettling story within fewer than 150 pages. All versions of the early 20th century American Dream portrayed in this book are flawed: those who can see the flaws can do nothing and those who strive to live it are doomed to fail. Equality is not realisable.And if I read it again? Who knows what I'll think of it.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It's a powerfully written classic with uncommon, often devastating insight on the human condition, worthy of all the praise its earned for generations. The kind of book every idealist (myself included) should read, regardless of what we're idealistic about (love, God, country, ourselves, etc.), and a story so fundamental that it makes you rethink who you believe you are. It may be set in the Jazz Age, but the lessons will always be relevant, no matter the era. Fitzgerald's economical prose is second-to-none and makes the book highly re-readable; and most authors could write for a lifetime and never come up with as haunting, and true, a climactic line as \\"I'm thirty - I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.\\""},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I fell in love with F. Scott Fitzgerald's brilliant novel, The Great Gatsby, when I was in high school. I was captivated by the lush, lyrical prose that was such a distinctive characteristic of the novel. I think that Fitzgerald has given us a searing, powerful take on the rich dilettantes of the 1920's. He slowly and skillfully reveals the shallowness and callousness of these people, as they manipulate and deceive everyone. It seems that Fitzgerald's heroines were always reincarnations of his real wife, Zelda. It is clear that Gatsby has hopelessly romanticized the superficial and hollow Daisy Buchanan. He has elevated her to a pedestal that she does not in any way deserve. Yet he is determined to pursue her and his dreams, at all costs.Fitzgerald is unmatched when it comes to character studies. He has used his own real life experience among the elite, to peel away the beautiful artifice and show us the truly ugly, heartless soul inside these people. Daisy and Tom are unhappy and unfulfilled people. Tom uses Myrtle to escape from the boredom and inanity of Daisy. He could care less if it all turns out badly. Consequences, morality and decency are not qualities that one finds in the likes of Tom and Daisy. They take what they want and try to steal moments of happiness at the expense of the humanity of those who are manipulated and played like chess pieces. Life is a game to them, a game to be played out in grand style and if someone gets crushed in the process, so be it.Fitzgerald finds his own voice in his narrator, the conscientious and astute Nick Carraway. He is the observer, watching the carnage and emotional wreckage unfold before his eyes. Through him, we see the horror of what Tom and Daisy do to those who have the misfortune to those who cross their path. Initially, Nick is enchanted to be in their company, but by the end as he surveys the tragedy and destruction that has been wrought, he is repelled and wants only to put as much distance as he can between himself and these monsters. Fitzgerald's own ideas and thoughts are expressed through Nick. It's a masterful way of illuminating the reader. Nick is the moral compass in this novel. He sees the truth, the ugly reality of what makes up the rich and famous, their lack of character, their emptiness, their need to lose themselves. In the end we feel the way he does. The beauty and lavishness of the lives of these people are just a brittle exterior, covering up the hideousness that lies underneath.As I read this novel again, years later and much older, it has taken on a whole other dimension. I have enough life experience now to truly appreciate the dark and sinister reality that can lie behind beauty and wealth. It is now a richer experience, because Fitzgerald's novel is timeless. He provided a stinging, harsh critique of the kind of people he knew all too well, of an era, a time in which people satisfied their greediness at the expense of others. The book can never become outdated, because what it says about people who have too much money and time on their hands with too little humanity, applies to generations through the years.This is a seminal work, a beautifully crafted tale about a time that was captured forever in these richly drawn characters. Fitzgerald had the most distinctive style of writing I have ever experienced. No one else has ever even come close to his genius. He can dissect and carve out the essence of his characters using the most lovely prose. His descriptive phrases still leave me breathless. I am only sorry that he died prematurely in 1940 at the too young age of 44, thereby depriving us of the privilege of reading more of his magnificent writing. We must make do with what he was able to give us in the brief time he was on this earth."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is nearest the perfect novel our country has produced. The first twenty pages represent the smoothest prose to be found in a modern novel, and introduces the ideal narrator, Nick Carroway, truthful, dryly humorous, accepting, nonjudgmentall, kind, modest, and likable. The story moves along briskly, though not big on magniloquent ideas. Rather, the story is a chronicle. It etches in stone the Jazz Age, with all its superfluities, excesses, and bubbly froth. It has every American theme--the nostalgic look backwards to aristocracy, the striving for success, the have's and have nots, the intersection of the old and new, the loss of hope for those who can't keep up with their dreams, and the bumptious, hyperactive quality that supposedly characterizes our country. There is rarely a paragraph that does not have wit, poignancy, and the eye of the narrator registers all with a detached discernment. Indeed, the overarching consciousness and morality of Nick Carroway may be the best part of this great novel. Through Carroway, the action of the novel moves along, giving a moral ascendancy to all the sordid and comic activities he views. The novel is uniquely evocative, rousing in the reader feelings of humor, sadness and regret that only the best art can, so that the reader himself experiences a sense of yearning for all that has passed, for the romanced past, just like the protagonist, who seek vainly to regain it. And the last lines of the novel are amongst the most poignant ever written. Damon LaBarbera, PhD"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Personally this is the second time I have read The Great Gatsby, the first time in college and now 20 plus years later. I had remembered the main storyline but had forgotten what a good read the book can be. Fitzgerald provides a nicely written, not overly long or multifaceted story that is full of complexity and insight into America in the 1920s (and in some ways today).Everyone's life in the story seems to be based on or involves a lie (Tom and Daisy in their marriage, Daisy in her role in the death of Myrtle, Jordon's success in her profession, Myrtle and Wilson in their marriage, Meyer Wolfsheim's notoriety, and of course Gatsby in his whole being). Even Myrtle's sister Catherine, a minor character, lies when arriving at the site of her sister's death. All of these lies exist under the ever vigilant eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, though no one seems to have any reservation about being watched. Nick, our narrator, claims he is one of the few honest people he has ever known. Yet he is complacent and allows the lies to occur and, in some cases, is an actual accomplice in the carrying forth of many of the lies. Does this make him a liar, or worse.Though ultimately a story, or statement, about 1920's America the story contains a timeless theme, true wealth can correct a lot of wrongs. Tom and Daisy left a horrible trail behind them. Their wealth will allow them to move forward with little to no impact. While many of the others are not poor they lack the means, financially and mentally, to move forward the way Toms and Daisy's wealth allows them to do.Was Jay Gatsby great as supposed in the title, I don't know. Nick seemed to have been converted to believing so at the end after despising him earlier. Better than the whole lot he states. But can some who is completely a fabrication be great? The obvious answer is yes as we have seen it through the ages but I don't know about Gatsby.Enjoy the book. It's a great read that has multiple layers."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This story of the 'lost generation', those who came of age in time to fight in WWI and, if they were lucky, returned home to find that everything had changed, especially themselves. This generation was no longer content to stay in the small towns and cities that their families had lived in for generations. The young men did not want to enter into the family business and settle down with a suitable young woman from nearby. The young women were not content to stay in their parents' house and wait, they wanted out in the world to 'do something'.The story is told, not through the eyes of Gatsby but through those of Nick, a young man from the midwest who has settled in New York to learn the bond game. By chance he has rented a house on Long Island for the summer, a small cottage stuck among much grander mansions and, again by chance, across an inlet from a cousin, Daisy and her husband Tom, who, also by chance Nick had known slightly in college. Also by chance, Nick's neighbor, the mysterious Gatsby had been one of Daisy's many suitors before she had settled down with Tom. Nick soon finds himself swept into the glittering, glamorous world of Gatsby and Daisy and Tom. He is made an unwilling witness to Tom's infidelity, the one sided romance of Gatsby and Daisy and finally to the tragic results of it all.THE GREAT GATSBY is a very American story, one that depicts the American restlessness, the desire to be more, better, different from all that has come before. As with many books that are assigned reading this one is often forced on an audience that is too young to appreciate it. Like many others I hated this novel when I first read it (I was an 18 year old college freshman) but found that it stuck with me, unlike many other assigned books, long after the final exam. Over the years I have read it several times and each time discovered something new, a different aspect of the novel becoming the 'point' of the story.This is one everyone really should read at least once, perferably a couple times, in their lives."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have just finished this book and it is a very pleasant read. The 1920's have always intruiged me and this book has made me even more hungry for stuff from this decade. I love Mr. Fitzgerald's method of writing, almost poetic in nature but borderline overly-sentimental (although the Age of Excess as the 20's were deemed may have aided in this extra drama).The way Fitzgerald characterized the rich is also very interesting. From Tom Buchanan to Jordan Baker, these rich social elites are wonderfully crafted with complex personalities. I love it! I also enjoy the the descriptive detail given to each scene...its amazing.Overall..a stunning piece of work that I would readily reccommend."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is so simple, and so brief, and it's not really about much more than a wealthy, mysterious, lovesick man who throws parties to attract a girl he loved and lost.But, it's amazing.F. Scott Fitzgerald was a true wordsmith. He knew how to use the english language, and in \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" he used it more skillfully than he ever had before. He was a painstaking writer who went over every sentence over and over again, and his exactness shows.That's not to say that the book is flawless--there are whole books that exist just to list the book's faults, especially in its chronology--but let's see YOU write a book this good. The book is streamlined and focused, in part due to Fitzgerald's time spent writing an unsuccessful script right beforehand. The structure of a script--in which every scene leads to the next, and every scene moves the story forward, and the whole thing is resolved in about ninety minutes or so--taught Fitzgerald immeasurable amounts about what this book didn't need to make it great, and about how to propel a story forward.The characters are memorable, the place and time (the jazz era) are vividly depicted, and the writing will surround and enfold you.Ignore that kids have to read this in high school--that it's almost a textbook to them. Just be glad it exists, and give it a read. It gets better every time, and you may find yourself wanting to re-read it almost immediately after finishing it.I know it's happened to me more than once."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have not been able to read this book yet, however, it came in great condition and fast! I am so thrilled to read it :) Thanks!!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is one of the only books I read in high school that I remember vividly. This is one of the great American novels. It is is not a very long book, but it truly captures the time, and upper crust New York life. The characters are wonderful and the plot moves quickly. There are references to many things that happened in the 20's and issues of the time. The ending was pretty anticlimactic as well."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a timeless classic that can be appreciated decades after its publication. The mysterious Gatsby looms over the lethargic beginning, but as he comes into focus the novel becomes enthralling. The mysterious Gatsby is at first depicted as a wealthy, powerful man, but shocking irony reveals the truth. Gatsby's love for Daisy has driven him to an extravagant lifestyle. Gatsby, once portrayed as the wealthiest and most powerful man in New York, was nothing more than a hopeless romantic. Gatsby is further berated - Daisy's wife, Tom, accuses Gatsby of criminal activities and involvement. Nonetheless, Gatsby and Daisy still meet privately on several occasions, and Gatsby's ornate portrayal of Daisy is not fulfilled. Over the years, Gatsby has exalted Daisy with his immense wealth and imagination.The overarching theme throughout the novel is exactly that mentioned above. Gatsby's exalting of Daisy has turned her into nothing more than a possession in his mind. This can be paralleled to the American Dream, the desire for success, prosperity, wealth, and a family. Gatsby can never have Daisy because of his immense wealth, an ironic cynical idea that was likely portrayed since this novel was written in the midst of the Great Depression. Another theme parodies the constant quest for money in America. The upper class, repented by Gatsby, is motivated by greed and desire. On the surface, the upper class appear superior an powerful, but in reality they are so desperate that they seek wealth to fill the hole in their personal American Dream.Overall, the Great Gatsby is a timeless classic, brilliantly written on multiple levels. The entire storyline brilliantly parallels and satires the quest for wealth, needs, and desires. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is elegant yet precise. As previously mentioned, the beginning, though lethargic and descriptive, is still intriguing. At first, the verbose details may seem extraneous, but it proves to be a great beginning to an amazing novel."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I think, or I glean, that American high school students are required to read this book, held up as a shining example of national literature. Perhaps because I'm not American, this novel wasn't on any lists when I studied English in high school and university. Just as well; I mightn't have appreciated it then.It's understandable that The Great Gatsby would be taught; it's damned good. It's tight, compact, linear, and practically every sentence is a work of art. I bought the audio book and listened to it twice. Then I picked up the novel and read it in a couple of days. It's excellent; there's no way around it. It's also rather different from Tender is the Night, also good, perhaps more evolved, but not nearly as flash or impactful.If someone employed Fitzgerald's style today, their prose would likely be labeled too ornate. A shame, because it's poetic and powerfully descriptive.Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Brilliant, a simple conversation scene in the book make me sit up, enthralled, and laugh out loud. Perceptive, erudite. A genius."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The thing that this book brings out more than anything is the idea that the rich gained their power and notoriety through some type of moral superiority. That is completely trashed in this book.First of all, Tom Buchannan is the most unctuous character in this book, if not all literature. He is the picture of the eastern establishment rich kid who had everything given to him. And he is a leach to his wife and skulks around with Myrtle.Daisy and Gatsby are also pathetic characters. The thrust of the novel is also important in that it brings to light the fact that money and vast riches cannot bring happiness. We still see that today. The 1920s and the Jazz Age were the beginning of the era of conspicuous consumption and while Gatsby throws weekend long parties, he almost never partakes in them, and he is rather quite miserable.The ending of the book, not to give spoilers, demonstrates the conceit of the era. A seminal work of American Fiction."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite classics. I read this when I was high school, but didn't get my own copy of the book until later years. I thought it was an interesting read. To read about the main character and how it was possible to redefine or recreate yourself and try to persuade the world around you to accept this new definition was amazing to read. Then to mix in a love story with Jay Gatsby and his love for Ms. Daisy Buchanan was a good read as well. Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to read a good book and a classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"And I mean the book and me. Although I am not perfectly aged. I mean by my title that with age, I have been able to really appreciate the beautifully poetic words that Fitzgerald used for his story. I think that teachers must assign this because they think the simplicity of Fitzgerald's words are easy for teenagers to understand. They may be able to understand all the words, but I really don't think most teenagers can truly understand the meaning behind the beautiful word choices Fitzgerald made. I for one, did not and I just loved this book the second time around. Life experiences make it easier to see Daisy and Gatsby for what they truly are, very shallow people. I think only Tom shockingly looks good in this book. He recognizes his life for what it is. When I was young, I really thought Tom was a bad guy. I feel differently after reading it the second time. I still see this as such a sad, sad story, where nothing happy takes place.A must read!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I thought everybody already knew that. There is no better American novel in existence. I read it first in high school and it captured my heart and imagination. I have read it many times since, and each time discover more depth and nuance."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"and lacking in content to be memorable such that I actually read it twice.It doesn't say much about me probably, but this is a book I've been interested in enough that I read it twice, but not on purpose. I read the book on paper once 10 years ago, but apparently found the book lacking enough substance to remember I had read it. The second time through, I read it on Kindle. You'd think in starting a book a second time that something would click, but when you read a book such as this... a book that works as a character study in a setting I've read about multiple times (I find this book similar to The Sun Also Rises), the book starts out a bit typical to the point I passed off the familiarness to the genre rather than to having read the book before. It wasn't until the climactic scenes at the end of the book that I realized I had read this before.Of course, we often read books twice when we like them, and we even occasionally find we like things on a second go around. In this case, I found I didn't like the book on the second go around. The book is a character study on a man named Gatsby whom moves into the \\"neighborhood\\" of his former girlfriend in the pursuit of ultimate happiness. In this pursuit is where the character flaw begins. It boils down to the ideal that money can buy happiness. And, of course, we often see that greed is more of an addiction that can rarely be overcome, and Jay Gatsby has that greed.The setting is in the jazz era of the early 20th century, and of course Jay Gatsby isn't the only character stricken with greed. The book is simple as far as plots go, and the plot wouldn't even be all that out of place now nearly 100 years later. The biggest strength of the book is really in the intricate weaving of characters surrounding Daisy Buchanan, the girlfriend Gatsby pursues. While Daisy and Jay are the most important characters in the book, it is what I call the character flaws for all the characters including those two that give any interest to the book. It is unfortunate that as the book progresses it is Jay Gatsby who dominates.I know the book is a classic, and I know many people like it. I am actually surprised I don't; I liked The Sun Also Rises, which seems to be the opposite of many people (many like this book and not that one). I'm not sure what it is. I really seemed to me that liking one should lead to like in the other, and in that regard giving the book a second chance was worth it. My biggest complaint is that the book is in someways too simple.Gatsby is a complicated character, but we are never fully given a view into his complicated mind. I was left at the end of the book wishing I knew more about him especially what happened to him before the novel. Of course there are hints and background, but I felt like I was wanting more. The book almost seemed too simple and in some ways too predictable. Perhaps that is unfair too having read the book twice, but I remembered feeling that way at the end both times I read it. Gatsby and Daisy were relatively likable characters (not lovable for their various flaws), and I felt they deserved a bit better.Of course, it isn't Hollywood, and the ending provided only enhances the novel since as far as plot goes the ending makes the novel. Never-the-less, I felt like there could have been more; more insight into the characters, more to the plot, more resolution, etc."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I used this CD to supplement student read-alouds in my high school English class. Muller is an excellent reader -- he really brings the characters to life."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I loved The Great Gatsby when I first read it in high school English class, and I still love it today. I reread it about once a year, and I never fail to be impressed by F. Scott Fitzgerald's use of language. Quotes like this - \\"Can't repeat the past?\\" he cried incredulously. \\"Why of course you can!\\" - are just classic.The Great Gatsby is a story abut Jay Gatsby's quest to track down the girl he loved in his youth, and his inability to come to grips with the path her life has taken in the interim. It also follows narrator Nick Carroway, Gatsby's neighbor for a summer. But most of all it is a story about the American dream - about love, money and ambition - and a slice of life in the 1920s, full of wild parties and glamour and tradgedy."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby was one of the books that I read in high school that I have been meaning to re-read, in an attempt to see whether it would mean more to me when I was older, than it did when I was young and easily bored.In my mind the book is still OK. I agree that it shows countless flaws in the the character's pursuit of the American dream. I'm not sure which errors in judgement were more pronounced in this story - trying to solve problems and win love through money, or the acts of infidelity themselves.I was left wondering what I would have thought if I had been in the position of the narrator Nick Carraway. It seemed as if he moved to West Egg only to find himself in the middle of the affairs of Daisy and Tom Buchanan and then unexpectedly he became the confidant of J. Gatsby. How strange it would have been to be expecting to start a new career and life, and to be caught up in so much drama.In all, I enjoyed the story and I am glad that I took the opportunity read this classic again."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald makes great use of color as symbolism in this book, particularly in the ironic use of the color white which represents innocence. It is to be noted, however, that if I hadn't had to do an assignment on the use of color in the book, I may not have noticed.As far as the story goes, I could not like any of the characters, nor could I understand their motivations behind any of their actions. I found myself questioning why they were willing to do so much for a woman who wasn't in the least bit interesting at all. This generally made it a read that I dreaded."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"One of the great pieces of American literature, The Great Gatsby is picture into the lives of individuals living in the Northeast during the 1920s.

In brief, the Doppler effect addresses the perceived frequency of waves, such as a fire truck's siren, by taking into account the actual frequency, and the relative speeds of the source of the sound, and the observer. So too with books; your opinion is so often determined by your particular circumstances, perhaps rushing towards the source, or enjoying the lengthening perspective that life in its fullness can provide. Unlike so many of the now familiar 1-star reviews, written by students forced to read the book as an assignment, I first read this book, of my own free will, more or less, when I was in Vietnam, some 40 plus years ago. When you are living in a bunker, the whining of the rich, and their self-induced troubles, does not go down well, and if Amazon had existed then, the best I could have mustered would have been a 2-star rating.But a friend chided me into undertaking a second read. And I found a finely crafted novel, yes, concerning the rich, primarily; set in the early years of the \\"Roaring 20's.\\" The story is told through the voice of Ned Carraway, standing in that proverbial inertial reference frame, a migrant from the Mid-West, attempting to scratch a living by selling bonds on Wall Street, and living in modest circumstances on Long Island. The book's essential theme is lost love, or more precisely, lost opportunities in courtship, and involves the title character, Jay Gatsby (n&eacute; Jimmy Gatz), and his desire for Tom Buchanan's wife, Daisy, whom he had briefly known before her marriage. She requites, for sure. The \\"minor characters\\" do their share of suffering. There is plenty of philandering all around, and a somewhat predictable Greek tragedy denouement.Fitzgerald tells his story well, and it is relatively fast-paced and dense. There are sufficient insights to maintain the interest. Tom exudes much of the stupidity and bigotry that so often goes with wealth. Consider the following statement: \\"...Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they'll throw everything overboard, and have intermarriage between black and white.\\" At another point, Fitzgerald says of Tom: \\"As for Tom, the fact that he \`had some woman in New York' was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his preemptory heart.\\"But the primary focus is on Gatsby. And therein were some problems. Somerset Maugham did the \\"obsession with a woman\\" thing to perfection. Fitzgerald's explanation of Gatsby's obsession was substantially weaker. And then there is the matter of his rapid acquisition of wealth. Could it have occurred so quickly, under any circumstances, since the novel was set in the early 20's, instead of the late 20's?The Rich really are different than you and me, as the old saw goes. The concentration of wealth in the United States, even in the midst of the Great Recession, exceeds even that of the \`20's, so the foibles, prejudges, and contrived problems of the lucky, or is it unlucky few, from that prior era, merit another look, as the wavelength of that receding period lengthens, along with perspective of the reader.A 5-star read, but not one of the 10 best American novels of all time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I just ordered this book as a gift for a friend and when it came I was so delighted with the quality that I purchased another one for myself, even though I already own several copies of Gatsby.

Definitely a gift quality item."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is Fitzgerald's third novel and his best novel.It is better than any of his short stories even though he is a better short story writer than a novelist. The novel focuses on the lives of young and shallow rich people .Nick Carraway is the narrator who provides the perspective and the main focus is on the title character Jay Gatsby who is fabulously wealthy. Gatsby invites many people to his grand parties but none of them are his friends as future developments in the novel show.He has a fake life which he creates to win the hand of Daisy Buchanan, a woman he loved in hiss youth but could not obtain because of his poverty.Gatsby gains wealth in illegal and immoral ways and when he has an affair with Daisy,her husband investigates Gatsby's past and exposes him destroying the affair and eventually destroying Gatsby.The novel is how wealth without character is worthless pleasure without purpose is worthless and using money to buy friends without developing ones relationships so that friendship is not dependent on money is also a worthless way to live. Fitzgerald clearly sees the pointlessness of the young and wealthy of his era who live primarily off the inheritance from their parents but his life in many ways would end up becoming like those he criticized partly because of the unstable alcoholic he married who enticed him to join in her self destructive lifestyle.After Gatsby, Fitzgerald's writing declined but the magnificent dialogue and descriptive phrasing plus his keen and compelling insight into the hollowness of a live driven by wealth and the desire for pleasure make this a great American novel"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Who was it who advised writers to get rid of as many adjectives as they could in their manuscripts, and then reread the \`mani' to get rid of some more?

That we never get a true picture of Gatsby or Gatz, is perhaps the strength of the novel as a modernist text, in the way it sets questions about identity and the construction of it in place."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald is such a poetic, transcendent author that you are moved through the nuances of this tragic and yet fulfilling story in an extravagant and engrossing manner.

There is not much else to say about this timeless American masterpiece. The writing is stunningly good, the symbolism is inspiring, and the characters are sympathetic despite their gross materialism and hollowness. This book resonates as much with our own time period as the Jazz Age that it is set in.On the surface, this is a book that tells the story of a tragic love story. Simmering just below the surface, the novel is a first-class commentary on the hollowness of the pursuit of money and things. Gatsby is at once admirable and pathetic, rich and the poorest of men. Finding purpose beyond the material world is the only thing that can differentiate us and him.If you read this in high school and remember not liking it, try it again.

The words so clever you may be lead to believe you were reading poetry instead of a novel. His precise use of words does well when describing the characters; who are created perfectly and paint a vivid picture.

I feel in love with Daisy Buchanon her candid way of speaking along the naivety described in her voice creates such a complex character. When the plot unravels; we find her to be the opposite of what we had been lead to believe. The main character Nick narrates his adventures of a time different from our own.

I recently saw the theatrical innovation based on \\"Gatsby,\\" \\"Gatz,\\" and was struck anew by its transcendent beauty and also by the freshness and fascination of its narrative. The voice of Nick Carroway is a beautiful one, moral, full of world-weary sympathy, and always astutely tuned in to the voices of the grubby characters around him. You hear it and you feel as soon it as begins, and reading it is no less haunting than hearing it aloud on stage. Fitzgerald--and Nick, too--- are unerring in their understanding of Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Jordan's, all their their sordid badness masquerading as glamor, all their innate incapacity for happiness,their fragility, sadness and their brutality. Finally, I love his clarity about the tragic self-delusion that is America. Fitzgerald may have been glamor-struck himself as a young man but he sees through it as surely as Proust his own snobbery. I wish folk would not teach it as a high school book unless they are true devotees; teaching it at a less than fever-pitch enthusiasm will surely kill off its beauty.

However, my reaction to the story was different than when I first read it in high school. I recall that back then I was hoping that Daisy and Gatsby's love story would ultimately yield a happy ending. Now, I found them both to be such shallow creatures that they inspired no pity. While I considered the characters to be emotionally stunted, that dooesn't mean I was not impressed with Fitzergerald's skillful rendering. As in most forms of art, in literature it is more difficult to accurately and interestingly portray nothingness than to describe a richly endowed subject. At this more cynical age, I found Daisy to be a remarkable emotional void, and Gatsby's quest to pour all of his hopes and dreams into such a shallow cauldron only confirmed his own vapidity. One thing that hasn't changed in all these years is my amazement at Fitzgerald's ability to set a scene. His descriptive passages are truly poetic, and his command of word choice in unparalleled. All this made for a stimulating and delightful read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It's difficult to give any even-handed critique F. Scott Fitzgerald's standard-setting Jazz Age novel since it was required reading for most of us in high school. However, if you come back to it as a full-fledged adult, you'll find that the story still resonates but more like a just-polished cameo piece from a forgotten time. At the core of the book is the elaborate infatuation Jay Gatsby has for Daisy Fay Buchanan, a love story portrayed with both a languid pall and a fatalistic urgency. But the broader context of the setting and the irreconcilable nature of the American dream in the 1920's is what give the novel its true gravitas.Much of this is eloquently articulated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's modest Long Island neighbor who becomes his most trusted confidante. Nick is responsible for reuniting the lovers who both have come to different points in their lives five years after their aborted romance. Now a solitary figure in his luxurious mansion, Gatsby is a newly wealthy man who accumulated his fortunes through dubious means. Daisy, on the other hand, has always led a life of privilege and could not let love stand in the way of her comfortable existence. She married Tom Buchanan for that sole purpose. With Gatsby's ambition spurred by his love for Daisy, he rekindles his romance with Daisy, as Tom carries on carelessly with an auto mechanic's grasping wife. Nick himself gets caught up in the jet set trappings and has a relationship with Jordan Baker, a young golf pro.These characters are inevitably led on a collision course that exposes the hypocrisy of the rich, the falsity of a love undeserving and the transience of individuals on this earth. The strength of Fitzgerald's treatment comes from the lyrical prose he provides to illuminate these themes. Not a word is wasted, and the author's economical handling of such a potentially complex plot is a technique I wish were more frequently replicated today. Most of all, I simply enjoy the book because it does not portend a greater significance eighty years later. It is a classic tale that provides vibrancy and texture to a bygone era. It is well worth re-reading, especially at such a bargain price."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Scott Fitzgerald, a monumental talent who only occasionally got things working right, made Gatsby great by the extraordinary invention of Nick Carraway. Carraway as narrator provided the exact perfect pitch: more awestruck than he would admit, more moral than it was fashionable to reveal -- always objective and distanced and subtle and charming, genuinely decent and impeccably well mannered, a little dangerously smitten himself by the lovely but corrupt Jordan Baker.Alexander Scourby, one of the greatest reading voices of his era (overlapping Fitzgerald's enough to know and feel it all) here does Carraway in a way that cannot, therefore, again be quite equalled. Imagine having a recording of a great contemporary actor reading Ahab's speeches in Moby Dick, and one begins to appreciate the gift that we only now have in recorded sound, something we are already quite casual about. But there is much more here than historical accuracy. Scourby's voice wraps around every phrase of Fitzgeral's text with both an actor's professionalism and a good reader's care, making it not only uncannily his own monument but also a monument in audio book history. It sets the bar, and anyone interested in the recorded voice as an art form should own this for repeated learning."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I listened to this book over a few nights with my wife, after having read it first some sixteen years ago. It is a masterpiece, and known widely as such, but what surprised me on hearing it was how the book I'd remembered as terribly romantic was actually rather clear-eyed and dark. My wife, who had never read it, listened spell-bound, and at the end burst into tears at the sadness of it. A word about Scourby as reader - he is restrained but emotional, captures the personality of each character with a slightly different tone, and - most importantly for me - brings out the fact that the closing pages, which are often quoted out of context as deeply romantic, are in fact painfully cynical, a voice of disenchantment about the cost of America, not its promise. A masterpiece on the page and on tape. Can't recommend it too highly."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I'm troubled that many young people in these reviews don't seem to appreciate this novel. Even when &quot;forced&quot; to read it in high school, I loved it. I've read it for probably the tenth time recently and I can say that every single time it's better than I remembered it. I was prompted by the character is Haruki Murakami's book Norwegian Wood who carries it with him and reads it to cheer him up. This narrator calls it the most perfect book ever written and says that you cannot find a page that's not perfect. I have to agree -- it's not just the plot, it's the beautiful writing and incredible characters and scenes that stay with you years later. Even after years, who can forget the scene when Gatsby shows Nick all his custom made shirts, or Nick describes his first vision of Daisy by comparing her posture to someone balancing something on his/her chin, or any of Gatsby's parties, or the broken nose -- you get the idea. For some reason, rereading this book reminds me of picking up a relationshp with an old friend. It's so very comforting to read the best prose you can find in English and find that certain passages are almost committed to memory. Don't miss out on this one. If you didn't like it in high school, try it again when your reading tastes mature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The first time I encountered \\"The Great Gatsby\\" it was as an assignment in a high school English class. My recent re-read occurred after my son had read it in his high school English class. The reread brought back memories of a form of academic study from which I have been separated for many years.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is an excellent book in which to study the writer's art. In this short book the reader can detect a collection of symbolic details which make the story much more than the tale which appears on the surface: the ash heap, as a symbol of the waste of American society; the green light on Daisy's dock, which means so much to Gatsby as a symbol, until he again meets Daisy, when it again becomes, for Gatsby, as for everyone else, just a light.The characters all play their roles in the development of the story. Shallow figures fill Gatsby's parties, but show their true level of concern for him when they all absent themselves from his funeral. The class distinctions between Daisy, a true upper class maiden, who can never lower herself to accept Gatsby, the aspirant to a class rank which wealth and parties cannot buy. Gatsby's source of wealth is hinted at by his association with Meyer Wolfsheim, the gambler who fixed the World Series. Like others, he will associate with Gatsby in life, but has no time for him in death.The unnatural core of Gatsby's world is illustrated by his act of moving east, rather than the traditional westward migration, in order to achieve freedom and advancement.Tom and Daisy Buchanan represent old money, which will not accept Gatsby and, in the end, destroys him.Nick Carraway is the one character in the book who develops his own moral sense. His role as narrator permits us to see Gatsby's world through his eyes. It is he who sees, and is repelled by, the rotten cores of Gatsby and the worlds in which lives and into which he aspires. He sees the corruption deep inside Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Most of all, we see the innate goodness in Tom. Observing, but not entering Gatsby's world, he is able to understand and judge it. His final evaluation of Gatsby's world is seen when he abandons it all to return to his native Midwest.As I re-read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" I remembered what I had not liked about it the first time I read it. The causal acceptance of infidelity seems at odds with what I have always viewed as the ideal as well as the reality. As one studies the commentaries of this book, with all of its symbolisms, I often wonder if the symbols were really in F. Scott Fitzgerald's mind as he wrote the book, or whether they are constructs of later commentators. Either way, they give the book a depth which so many others lack. When my son speaks of other books he reads in English class, he always says \\"It's no Great Gatsby.\\" The more I think of it, few of novels are."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have always looked forward to reading the classic book The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. When I finally had time to read it, I wasn't disappointed. The Great Gatsby, written in 1925, is a fictional tale that takes place during the American Jazz Age. The story is set in the eastern U.S. and follows the journey of a young man named Nick. The book trails Nick from his home in the West to his new life in West Egg, New York. Nick becomes involved in the social scene is West Egg, which is mainly centered on the weekly extravagant parties thrown by the incredibly wealthy and strangely mysterious Jay Gatsby. As the book progresses, Gatsby's past is slowly unraveled. Nick witnesses Gatsby's gradual admittance of his significant secret. He discovers that Gatsby is deeply in love with Daisy Buchanan, a beautiful socialite, trapped in a miserable marriage to an unfaithful husband. Though Nick does not want to be involved in any way with the illicit love affair between Daisy and Gatsby, he is gradually takes a larger part in Gatsby and Daisy's dangerous romance. When Jay and Daisy decide to declare their love to one another, it leaves Gatsby in an unforgettable and risky situation that changes the lives of all involved. The Great Gatsby was one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. It included a beautiful love story, danger, suspense, tales of true devotion and friendship, and a wonderful, thought-provoking commentary on the society in post-World War I America, a time of excess and confusion. I have learned several lessons from the novel, whether they are about loyalty or remaining true to oneself. I would recommend this book to anyone above the age of thirteen because of some parts of the novel that might be difficult to grasp. The Great Gatsby is a truly wonderful book, and sure to be enjoyed by many for many years to come."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I question whether I should even write a review of a book I dislike which most people, even most of my friends, seem to adore. What it comes down to, for me, is that all the characters, even the best of them (namely Gatsby) are amoral, and the worst of them are vile. I ended up reading this book for school twice. The first time, in high school, I finished it and thought, &quot;I must be missing something,&quot; so I bought and read through the Cliffs Notes, and then said, &quot;Well yes, I knew all that, but so what?&quot; In college I was assigned to read it a second time, and that time I got more substance out of it. The book will never be one of my favorites, though. I just haven't got enough cynicism in my soul (at least not yet, anyway) to look into a moral vaccuum and find much enlightenment there.Perhaps I should read it a third time; it's a short book, after all. I'm older now, and I do get the point in a way I couldn't have then--Gatsby falls in love not with a real woman, but with his own dream vision of her, and confrontation with the real thing shatters him. (Then again, Don Quixote did the exact same thing without making me dislike him.) The equating in Gatsby's mind of love with money is also worth understanding as a very American hang-up, but it does just make him seem pathetic. And yes, I know that's the point.I also concede that one reason I disliked it was the sheer glut of tragedies I was forced to read in school. I find that I have more patience for unhappy endings in fiction now that they're not being forced on me. (Heck, I read Dostoevsky for fun, now). But unhappy endings need not be the same thing as nihilism. Gatsby's universe is a highly nihilistic one, a world so far gone that even the saddest ideals seem priceless simply for being ideals.Perhaps it's the kind of cynicism the book represents--it's not &quot;grumpy old man&quot; cynicism like Vonnegut or Twain, which at least feels earned and honest. No, this is youthful &quot;look how worldly I am&quot; cynicism, the sort that drives us as kids to write bad poetry and wear lots of black. Perhaps that's inevitable--the characters ARE all young, and the book is about decadence.It may also be the humorlessness of the book that sets it aside from Vonnegut and Twain. I enjoyed de Laclos's &quot;Dangerous Liasons,&quot; where the protagonists are both insidiously evil, but at least the cynicism there is laced with black humor. Gatsby carries an unrelenting air of &quot;I'm writing something important, dammit!&quot;It's not my cup of tea. You're free to like it. Most folks do."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As you can tell by many reviews which surround this one, our world is filled with minds who probably feel that the height of pathos is reality tv, or having to wait in line more than 5 minutes at an ATM.But about Fitzgerald--I'm reminded of Eliot's phrase \\"infinitely gentle, infinitely suffering...\\" (paraphrasing). His descriptions and evocations here are gorgeous, tender--and most of all subtle, which is why Gatsby is lost on so many modern readers. All of this novel is excellent and parts of it absolutely shimmer--Nick's description of the way Gatsby smiled at him. Look at this...\\"It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced---or seemed to face---the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far a you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.\\"Who wouldn't want to believe in that smile?Or take, for example, the scene in which Gatsby shows his closetful of rare, extravagant and wonderful shirts to Daisy and Daisy weeps....not because of his sartorial excellence but because she knows even at that point, in her heart, that she will forever be stuck with that clod Tom.This is about the American Dream, and how the pursuit of it can kick the living s**t out of you....how friends come and go...and how society often rewards generosity with disdain.I beg you to read this book, because it is good for your soul.Just my opinion."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"There are two Kindle editions of The Great Gatsby, both at the same price.Unfortunately the edition I bought, from Old Landmark Publishing, has a number of minor transcription errors. The most notable is the occasionalinsertion of multiple paragraphbreaks within a sentence. There are also occasional misplaced paragraph breaks in dialog paragraphs, which sometimes leads to confusion about which character is speaking.I downloaded the free sample of the Scribner Edition and although that is only a short sample, it appears to be a much better quality transcription.So since there are two Kindle editions available, you might want to avoid the Old Landmark Publishing Edition (the one with the car on the cover) and try theScribner Edition(the one with the stark black and white cover)."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a great Modern American Literature novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It takes place in the early 1900's. The main characters are Jay Gatsby, a very rich and handsome man, Daisy and Tom Buchanan, and Daisy's cousin Nick Carraway. This book is written for entertainment. It captures all the romance and glitter of the Jazz Age in its portrayal of a young man and his tragic search for love and success. The theme of this novel is that Gatsby wants to get Daisy back as his true love. The problem is that Daisy is already married. Gatsby believes that once Daisy sees him again, she will fall back into love with him. One day, Gatsby wants Nick to invite Daisy over to his house for tea. Nick said that he would do it, so he called Daisy and asked her to come over. When she got there, she started talking to Nick, then Gatsby appeared. Daisy hadn't seen him for a long time. They just starred into each others eyes. Finally, they started talking. This scene is a major event in the story because this is where Daisy starts to fall in love with Gatsby again. The use of irony in this novel is repeated throughout the story. For example, if Gatsby is so much in love with Daisy, then why would he have even thought about leaving her in the first place. Then, if Daisy was so in love with Gatsby, why did she marry Tom and not wait for Gatsby to return to her. A quote that is repeated in this novel is &quot;good morning, old sport.&quot; This quote is said to Nick by Gatsby. Gatsby never calls Nick by his real name. He always refers to him as &quot;old sport.&quot; A person that likes love stories would like this novel. It keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to read more to find out what might happen to Gatsby and Daisy's love for each other."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Jay Gatsby's life plays out like out like a biography on F. Scott Fitzgerald because it is. The Great Gatsby is a better book because the author experienced everything that went on during the twenties. In fact, if Fitzgerald had wrote this book today it would be a plot line on Days of Our Lives. I didn't know this book would be so entertaining. Jay Gatsby is a millionaire with a wonderfully mysterious past. He is madly in love with his old girlfriend Daisy who rejected him because of his poor beginnings. Now, Gatsby is back with an extravagent life and an obsession with Daisy. Only problem is, she's married to the rich and jealous Tom Buchanan. Gatsby throws crazy parties(a reflection of the decade)hoping that one day Daisy might stumble back into his arms. Nick Caraway, Daisy's distant cousin, moves into next door to Gatsby and soon the inevitable happens:characters start getting tangled up in each other's lives. This book was satisfying in all aspects:love, scandal, suspense and humor. And will you look at that: all before major motion pictures. Screenwriters didn't make this stuff up."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby wasn't just great, it was fantastic, excellent, amazing, and most importantly fun to read. Fitzgerald's style of writing ingrigued me from the beginning. His exquisite use of figurative language had me fully engaged. I never wanted to put the book down. His characters had me enthralled throughout the whole novel, and I felt like I was watching the events happen, just as Nick was.When I first was told I was going to read the Great Gatsby I wasn't that excited. Although the 1920s were a fascinating time in our history, it didn't seem the book would be that great. Once I read the first page, I was proven wrong. There were many themes that taught me. Instead of running away from the question &quot;What are the themes of this novel?&quot; (usually asked by English teachers), I wanted to know the answer and understand the novel more.The symbolization in the novel was also great. The green light across the bay represents the far away love Gatsby has for Daisy. The clock falling represents the way that love has been lost and will never be retrieved; that too much time has passed.All of the symbolization, the themes, and the distinct description throughout the novel make it a wonderful read. I enjoyed reading this novel so much. It was one of the best written novels I've ever read. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"THE GREAT GATSBY superficially is the story of what happens to Nick Carraway, and the conclusions he draws from his experiences. Yet the very experiences of his own become the theme of the book. Nick, as a narrator, becomes significant in the thematic content.Like many American novels in the same time period, THE GREAT GATSBY relies heavily on variety of symbols. A symbol may function on several levels at once. A symbol may represent an idea but also function as an idea throught the book.One of the central idea that stands out and persists throughout the other novel is wealth. Fitzgerald's persoanl life has contributed a greal deal to this idea of wealth. In fact, his own life has more direct pertinence to his work than the lives of most writers. The idea of wealth ocuupies a great deal and achieves a central role in the novel, as well as Fitzgerald's life.Nick Carraway is able to see the self-destructive nature of fascination of wealth. Maybe this is the message Fitzgerald wants to get across as he was deeply possessed by such fasination of materialism."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"&quot;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&quot; These are the last words in the novel, and sum up its theme. Our minds (like moths to the light) are drawn irresistibly to the most wonderful moments we have experienced. Our mistake is then to build our future around them, not realizing that they can never be recaptured. In pursuing the past into the future, we deny ourselves the real potential of the future.The Great Gatsby is developed in novel form around the story line of a Greek tragedy. Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbor, is the narrator, serving the role of the chorus. This choice of structure creates a marvelous reinforcement for the book's theme. The novel is constricted by the tragic form, even as Gatsby's future is by his immobilization by the past. If you like that sort of irony, you'll love The Great Gatsby.Nick knows both Gatsby (his neighbor in West Egg, Long Island) and Daisy Buchanan (his cousin who lives in East Egg, Long Island). Daisy knew Gatsby before he was Gatsby and before meeting Tom, her husband. Gatsby has made himself into a rival for Daisy over the five years since they have last seen each other, and makes his play for her again through Nick about mid-way through the book. Daisy and Tom's responses shape the tragedy that is this story. I won't say more because it will harm your enjoyment of the novel.The story itself is somewhat dated by the romantic perspective of the Roaring Twenties, and few will read it for the instant connection they will feel with the characters. Why would someone want to read this book? I see three reasons. The first is to explore the theme of moving illusions about the future built from the happiness of the past. The second is to see a fine example of plot development. There are no wasted words, actions, and thoughts. The third is to enjoy the language, which is beautifully expressive. For example, consider the book's opening sentence: &quot;In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.&quot; Fitzgerald goes on one sentence later to give you a clue about how to read the novel. &quot;He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.&quot;These are not characters you will find uplifting. &quot;They were careless people, Tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness . . . and let other people clean up the mess they had made.&quot;Why did Fitzgerald create such characters? Precisely, because he did not approve and did not want you to approve. 'Everything that glitters is not gold' is another way of summing up the lessons of this novel.Why should someone not read this book? A reader who wants to be inspired by positive examples will find little to uplift oneself here. Someone who wants a story they can personally identify with will likely be disappointed. A student of how to create love and happiness will mainly find out how to create heartache and unhappiness. So the book is not for everyone.After you have read the book, I would encourage the self-examining reader to consider where in one's own life the current focus is dominated by past encounters rather than future potential. Then consider how changing that perspective could serve you and those you love better."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I did not go to school in America, and read this book about a year ago, but for whatever reason, I ended up here, and have to write some kind of upbeat report on the Great Gatsby to try to balance the tide against all the revisionist critics.The reason I mention school is that it would appear a lot of people have had traumatising experiences with classics being thrust down their throats. I do not know if it is a case of bad teacher, bad student, or simple incompatibility, but I would say this - if you really did not enjoy a book, DON'T TELL OTHER PEOPLE NOT TO READ IT! One of the most disappointing experiences of my literary career (if you can call it that) was when I recommended my girlfriend to read Catch-22, and had it metaphorically hurled in my face after &quot;3 chapters&quot;. That's her right, but the negative reaction will always hurt more people than help them, whereas vice-versa for the positive one...especially since I have noticed that works that someone has always been attached to can still be reduced for them in the face of violent enough criticism. If you had a bad experience at school, it's fair enough to be upset about it...but this truly is a great book which should only have great things written about it.Both of Catch-22 and the Great Gatsby have humour and grace, and not a little hidden dignity. But Gatsby is clearly the superior work for the symbolists and amateur students of literature. It is a period novel, but like all the greatest of these kinds of works of fiction, it reaches far beyond its time. The writing is timeless, and the mystery makes for a latter day Much Ado About Nothing - perhaps it is boring on the surface, but boring like tectonic plates: fundamental, dealing in huge issues in subtle and slow movements. Yet it is not even a particularly long novel - several hours of great entertainment and effort well expended.I hate having to write prescriptively, but sometimes you can't help reacting, you know?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald wrote this classic in the grip of a stroke of archetypal genius. Hemingway, who previously disliked Fitzgerald, said that the book's cover was the ugliest he'd ever seen.

Now mysteriously wealthy, Gatsby moves to Long Island where Daisy is ensconced with her husband and proceeds to re-establish contact with her.Gatsby is an characature of a famous Mafioso of the twenties that always stood behind the scenes, never in the news. Alas, for all his guile in the underworld, he succumbs to love or what he thinks is love.The end of Chapter Six reveals the archetypal nature of the book, that Daisy is the object of a projection and transference. The absolute proof lies in the final paragraph of the chapter in the words of &quot;Nick Wheat&quot;, the first person chronicler.We should all take heed of the last page in the book, where the message comes across that pursuing old dreams is living in the past. &quot;...so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&quot;"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As a teacher of American literature, I have read many of the American classics, and since to teach is to learn something twice, I've had to read them often and closely.

The thematic and symbolic issues in the book heighten the reader's enjoyment of the story, but even the basic story is enough. I simply love this book. I couldn't put it down when I first read it.

Scott Fitzgerald's classic short novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. What I've found was a much richer, much more perfect book than I'd remembered-- a book that evokes a time and place, and yet manages, I think, to speak to all times and all places where people have dreams, and where dreams go wrong.Because of it's brevity, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; aspires to a kind of structural perfection that longer and more ambitious masterpieces such as &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, for example, cannot begin to approach. Every scene contributes to the careful design of Gatsby's disillusionment and his eventual undoing. Every sentence, every word tells. Fitzgerald's prose is as tight and vigorous as it is rich and elegant.On this reading, I noticed the complexity of the emotional tone that Fitzgerald evokes. His narrator, Nick, seems to celebrate Gatsby's extravagant romaticism, even as he exposes its shortcomings. The effect is lyrical and cynical at once, much like life itself.I also got a better handle on the ambiguities that inform the character of Nick. The very first thing that he tells us is that he is slow to criticize others, and yet the narrative that follows is informed with Nick's judgement and implied criticism throughout. Later, he tells us that he is one of the few truly honest people he has ever known-- and yet in the end, Jordan Baker accuses him of fundamental dishonesty. I haven't figured out who is closer to the truth. Perhaps I'll approach the answer in some future reading.

Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece is one the finest novels America has produced. It centres on the lives of a few wealthy New Yorkers during the 1920s, and is now thought of as epitomizing the \`Jazz age' more than any other novel (hell, more than ANY other book for that matter).Through the main character Gatsby's love for Daisy, Fitzgerald shows us how we become blinded by our dreams, and yearn so much for them that they take over our perception of reality. But Fitzgerald was also giving a scathing criticism of the materialistic lives of the wealthy, as the sub plots and numerous conversations in the novel show. The narration of the character Nick is superb, and the numerous flashbacks that he describes are brought on so effortlessly that the reader often forgets they are occurring.I have read the Great Gatsby twice, because this really is the type of book that needs to be read more than once. It works on so many levels that cannot be fully grasped in a single read. The books slimness (most editions are around 200 pages) make it is a quick but by no means light read, Fitzgerald packs more than one could ever imagine into these 200 pages.

Gatsby's house is an overwhelming mansion that serves as the location for many a party among the city's idle rich. Nick gradually becomes entangled in their lives and carefully observes the drinking, carousing and (oftentimes) harmful behavior.As Nick tries to unpeel the layers of the mysterious Gatsby, desiring to discover the source of his fortune, he instead discovers a secret he'd be better off not knowing.

Jay Gatsby- highlighting the strength of the appeal and ultimately failure of the American Dream, Daisy- beautiful, rich and reckless, Tom Buchannan- encapsulating the snobbery and harshness of many of the East Coast rich, Nick Carraway- a subtly drawn narrator who has many of the reactions associated with those who enter the inner circle of the wealthy- the curiosity, the fascination, the horror and the despising of their values. And Mrytle Wilson- representing the other side of the coin- from a poor background yet desperately enamoured with the world of the rich and turning up her nose at those close to her to climb up the social spectrum.The Great Gatsby shows up the hollow, nasty, reckless, superficiality prevalent in certain sectors of society better than any other novel I know. A timeless classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Set in the 1920s, The Great Gatsby traces the tragic James Gatz (Jay Gatsby) and his yearn for his past love, the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The novel is narrated by Gatsby's next door neighbor, Nick Carraway, as he views everything that happens to Gatsby. The setting takes place in Long Island, New York, in two places: \\"West Egg\\" and \\"East Egg\\" separated by a bay. Gatsby is this filthily rich guy who lives in a gigantic mansion next to Nick in West Egg. Rumors about what kind of a man he really is swirl about Gatsby, but Nick keeps his own opinion until he actually meets the great Gatsby himself. Gatsby holds extravagant parties in his mansion, and people from all over the Island come, even uninvited. In reality, he has moved to West Egg and holds these big parties hoping to attract the attention of the woman he once loved during World War I, Daisy Buchanan, who is now living across the bay in East Egg. Unfortunately, Daisy married during the war, so she is technically unavailable. Gatsby, who values the past and money above anything else, does all he can to win her back, but alas, Gatsby is not called a tragic character for nothing.Beautifully written, mostly in prose, The Great Gatsby makes a reader step back and examine his own values. Even though Gatsby has all these bad characteristics attributed to him, the reader cannot help but empathize with him and his romantic idealization of the past. We all do that sometimes--live in the past and forget about the present.F. Scott Fitzgerald, when he died in 1940, thought he died as a failure in life. Well, with this classic The Great Gatsby that I have just now read, I beg to differ, Mr. Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Sadly, the Great Gatsby has been relegated to the pantheon of books we are forced to read in high school and dutifully summarize in book report format or else address the endless concerns of whether this or that character should have done this or that thing. I have made the similar mistake with works like the Scarlet Letter, or Emerson's Essays, which equally require a greater degree of maturity and perhaps experience to appreciate.The core of this book lies not in a simple unrequited love story. Fitzgerald addresses a much larger theme of how the mythic aristocratic ideal triumphs in American society while the fundamental reality of this ideal is denied. It must of course be remembered, that this paradox is distinctly an American one. This is a book written in and for a culture that embraces the value and rights of all of us and believes in the ability that we can all fulfill our unique destinies in life. There are no institutionalized lineages of kings and queens believed to be ordained by God to embody qualities above the common lot. No! We may say 'God save the Union!' or (until recently) 'One nation under God!' but never 'God Save the Queen!' The Great Gatsby was not written for a British or French audience who have believed in the authenticity of royalty and royal power, but for an American one. The Great Gatsby challenges each of us to question how we can reinvent and embrace a notion so fundamentally contrary to our stated beliefs and constitution?Primarily through the title character Jay Gatsby, we see how the aristocratic ideal triumphs, particularly over the unfortunate ones who choose to inadequately embody it. Gatsby fails in his pursuit of aristocratic grandeur for one simple reason: he is not an aristocrat. He comes from a poor family and is primarily a self-made millionaire, scrappy and opportunistic. If this were not condemning enough, we get a glimpse into some of the questionable business practices he is perhaps too closely tied to (we are led to believe bootlegging. It is the Roaring Twenties after all). Thus, one of the two must perish; either Gatsby or Gatsby's dream. We learn that it is Gatsby who does.At first inspection, the title seems contradictory. Gatsby fails, so therefore he is not great. However we see that he is - he achieves great success, purchases a great house on the Long Island Sound for a great sum of money, throws great, if not spectacular parties. The problem is that he is only great and great is not enough. He wants to become royalty and royalty is not great - it simply is.Those who do embody the ideal successfully are Tom and Daisy Buchanan. They are the victors. While we see that they win and those around them fail, what is it that they win? Who and what are they? Fitzgerald constantly defines them in elusive terms, the indescribable melody of Daisy's voice, the majestic athleticism of Tom Buchanan, the Yale man. The activity of life is not perpetuated by these two demi-gods. They behave as if they are spectators, bored and dissatisfied ones. While they have connections, wealth and beauty, what of a fundamental nature do they do that makes them admirable? Nothing. And therein lies the eternal source of disappointment for the imitators and emulators and worshippers. Inherited wealth and privilege cannot be achieved or pursued it can merely be had.The book is the story of a disappointed and disillusioned man, but not a mad-man. Gatsby is not someone who worships say; toothpaste and we can veritably call him crazy. We can relate to his quest for grandeur. We may even root for his success with Daisy. This is one reason why this book resonates and can be called a classic and should be read. Gatsby is not nuts. In fact, we are like him. Why? Because the myth has persisted through time as a way to make life taste more real and exciting, to create aspirations based on more than tangible considerations. We embrace the mythical because the converse is to embrace the mundane. Yet... How can we also embrace authenticity and meaningful values in our lives? And what about embracing values that contribute to stability and continuity? These are the timeless questions that remain."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Set in the 1920s, this now-classic-piece of literature has more than stood the test of time. Fitzgerald has so perfectly captured the era between WWI and the Great Depression, that it is forever engraved in our minds--the colors, sights, sounds, and even moral forays of the time. And all of this melds wonderfully with Fitzgerald's characters; the way carry on with reckless abandon. But don't think that Fitzgerald is preachy. No, he simply presents the material and lets you decided what kind of karma, if any, should be passed around. The beauty of this book lies in its simplicity (seeming) and execution. This is a keeper.

In fact, if Fitzgerald had written this book properly (no extra junk I could care less about) it would have been EXACTLY two sentences long- &quot;I'm rich.&quot; and &quot;Oh, boo hoo.&quot; The plot line resembles an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 (namely &quot;Let's sit around and whine about being rich.

If you are a teacher, please save the children and assign them a more interesting book. For those reading for pleasure, I recommend skipping this poorly written book. The characters are cartoons.

This book is obviously more than just a boy meets girl who is married to another boy book, but it is not much more. Sure, it raises interesting issues of consumerism and 1920's post war culture, but it never sets its heart on it. It touches it half heartedly, but it doesn't attack it like it should. Or as english teachers would say, it doesn't \\"commit murder\\". Fitzgerlad is too busy telling the story which happenes to be dull and unexciting at the most.The plot, the storyline, the story, and the execution of it is just poor. It's boring. It's futile. It's dumb. I fail to understand why Fitzgerald chose to use Nick, this incredibly dull and uninteresting character, as his narrator when he could have written it third person, or used a more interesting character for the narrator. Even the conversation and dialogue is quite useless. Take this for a sampler, \\"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year...or wait a minute- it's ust the opposite- the sun's getting colder every year.\\" And this quote comes from nowhere and has to do with nothing.Gatsby was obviously drunk, or smoking marijuana when he was writing this book, and must have thougth that this book was pretty clever. It isn't. All I can say is that, I don't consider it a classic. It's just so haphazard and bad that people mistake it for being good."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I absolutely hated this story.

I wonder how many of these teachers, if you got them alone and really talked with them, actually like this book? We were assigned to read this in an English lit II class in college (an evening class composed of mostly \\"older\\" students). As anyone who's read this book knows, it's a relatively short book. I was looking forward to it since I hadn't read it before and obviously, \\"it's a classic!\\" I thought since it was a shorter book I would read it twice -- once through to get a feel for the story and then back more thoroughly for the \\"hidden meanings\\" and \\"symbolisms\\" that were required for our essay. I could barely get through it the first time let alone go through it a second time. I ended up having to get the Cliff Notes, which I've never done.

The Great Gatsby is certainly nothing I would have finished had it not been so short.My basic response to this book: It lacks depth of any significance. The descriptions are minimally imaginative, and never spark excitement. And the characters? The characterizations, the portrayal of the characters and their actions and emotions, are all simple and don't transmit any of the passion they are supposedly feeling. Supposedly, for example, the several main characters in the book, most notably Gatsby, have the Chalice of Life just at their fingertips, but are afraid to grasp it. But I got no feel for the inner anguish and turmoil and tortuous yearning that must arise from such fear and self-denial.In short, this book, while having a decent plot and overall structure, was boring, because the writing is boring. If The Great Gatsby was a serious attempt at good writing, then it is evident to me that Scott Fitzgerald had never in his his life experienced any significant passion or the thrill and thunderburst excitement that is the reward of spirited creativity."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Bought this book because it was recommended as a great american classic.Once I finished reading it, I threw it into the \\"poubelle\\"."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I heard this book was a classic,a must read,so I read it.It was a bad book!

Since I was supposed to be teaching the thing I read it three times (well, to be frank, two and half times; midway through my third reading, I gave up in disgust, both at myself, for having persisted so long, and at the novel itself).

Scott Fitzgerald's 1920s novel of The Great Gatsby really is. It is quite comical to know the many dissimilar viewpoints there are because from several people, they praised the book and had said that it was one of their favorites, whereas others opposed it stating otherwise. So honestly, I unable to take any of their opinions of what they thought of the book into consideration, thusly I had to read it myself.When I first heard that my literature class and I had the opportunity to read The Great Gatsby, I had an open mind and frankly, I grew with such anticipation. The first few pages immediately begins with the narrator, Nick Carraway, a rather timid man from the mid-west, who becomes quite interested into all the glamour and glitz of the New York, along with the wonder of his uncanny neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Nick is definitely not your average narrator. He generally judges all his surroundings by its cover, and basically has something to say about everything. And with Fitzgerald as the author, all that is being judged is extremely detailed as it can get. Some may say detail is good, but I say, too much detail can get others thrown off and indifferent toward the novel.As the novel progressed in content, I began to grow uninterested. I felt that I wasn't as into the novel like others had appeared to be, and my mindset toward the book wasn't quite as good as I hoped. To be honest, the novel's storyline wasn't half-bad; it was typical, a so-called \\"classic,\\" but nonetheless it was rather acceptable. Fitzgerald focuses on a plethora of different characters dealing with their lives of betrayal, love, and sometimes even death; doesn't that sound quite alluring?Charm is brought into this tragic tale as Fitzgerald adds his romantic side into play. He shows how one character loses his love and strives to regain his love back. It is certainly reasonably endearing, but it appears to show originality on Fitzgerald's part. To me, I feel as if it has already been done. Uniqueness is the basis to any story, in order for the reader to stay fascinated, the author must create something that is out of the ordinary, therefore keeping the reader more than satisfied.All in all, Fitzgerald's \\"Best American Novel of All Time\\" unfortunately isn't at its best. Honestly, the way he expresses his writing with such perplex detail isn't the smartest approach an author, who supposedly is seen as one of the greatest American novelist in American Literature, should make. As a reader you should consider these factors as to how to judge this so called \\"classical\\" novel written by the infamous and supposed great writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald for yourself. But truthfully, if you, as a reader, define Fitzgerald's archetypal storyline as great as its title; that is beyond me."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A bunch of rich snobs complain about how boring life is while putting down or bullying poorer people.

I read this in fifth grade and everyone liked it. Sure not everyone caught the true meaning of the book when they first read it but when they did, they realised that they were reading a truly good piece of literature. When you read each page you can tell that the author has put alot of time and thought into this book. This book isn't for people who want a fast, action, packed read. It takes some time and thought to finish the book as you mull over each page. If you're looking for a great classic, then read The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A required book for my English class, _The Great Gatsby_ has become one of my favorite books. The symbolism is amazing--a green light, the watchful eyes of an eye doctor's ad, the owl-eyed man, driving, Gatsby's library... it is amazing how Fitzgerald pulls it all together. And on top of it all, Fitzgerald creates what is considered the perfect narrator in Nick Carraway (give or take a letter). All in all a great read!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Yes, this is a classic, but not everyone was required to read it in school. I wish I had been, since I would have discovered a wonderful, heart-wrenching, beautifully written novel much sooner than now, when I am in my late twenties. This book made me feel so much emotion, and every word Fitzgerald uses is brilliantly perfect. The story is very compelling as well, and it drew me in so much that I did not put it down on the second day I read it (the beginning drags just a tiny bit--keep reading! ) for a full eight hours until I finished it. If you have never read it thus far, DO...for the women, it has a touching, tear-jerking love story, and for men, all the violence and egotism you've come to expect from a good read.

Fitzgerald's now classic piece of life in the 20's set in New York, Long Island. I cant think of a more moving book than this one, however, I had realized that I felt more when I was done with book. When I had a chance to see the story as a whole that the emotions began to set in. Truly wonderful writing that is top notch among any of the writers I have read. His reading does not &quot;talk&quot; over you, but rather with you. Which is what makes the story attractive. Although many people complain about being forced to read it for school, its probably best read on your own time without constrictions. The story of Jay Gatzby, party man, millionaire, mansion owner. Everyone knows Jay. But who really knows him? Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I've yet to read a better crafted book than The Great Gatsby. It is simply the most beautiful book you can come across. The prose is gorgeous and deceptively simple, all the more stunning for its simplicity, because it almost makes you believe you could write a book like this yourself. You can read the novel on many levels. Few readers can avoid finding symbolism. Daisy is the untouchable American Dream, perhaps, and Gatsby is the immigrant who, like all new Americans, throws himself fully into the idea of America while ignoring or hiding his own and America's reality. The opulence and decadence of 20s America is brilliantly conveyed, and there is also a considerably amount of realistic description of the time. The Great Gatsby more than any other book made me realise just how pervasive and persuasive the idea of the American Dream is, and just how empty the reality can often be."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby was absolutely wonderful. The book takes you back to the post-World War I era where you find the narrator, Nick Carraway, a young midwesterner moved to New york to find a home in West Egg working as a stock broker. The book journeys through Nick's experiences in high society at West Egg. When the narrator first arrives to West Egg he meets up with his cousin Daisy Buchannan, and her quite wealthy husband Tom. Shortly after coming to New York he attends the party of Jay Gatstby, a racketeer of the 1920's. He then becomes fast friends with Gatsby, and finds himself everly more intwined in Gatsby's life. Overall the book was very good. I enjoyed the many themes at hand, especially those about high society during the 20's. Such as the idea that Gatsby's own constant reinvention of himself is what inevitably destroys him. A fantasic book for those who enjoy books about people."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The language of this incredible book is rich and tangible. As the background of each scene is subtly created through descriptions of colors, tones and textures, all the strange and brightly colored building blocks of a masterpiece are set in place. It is a book full of the dismal philosophy of early 20th century America and full of the irridescent vitality of human passion and pain. I was hesitant to read it at first because of its overexposure--it seemed as though everyone had the same things to say about it.

The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite books now. Its short, but full of substance. I like that it moves quickly when reading and how human the characters of Gatsby, Daisy, and Nick all seem. The reader can connect with these characters and I think Fitzgerald did a wonderful job on creating this novel. It is about the great American dream, so I like it even better. However, Fitzgerald does an expected twist at the end which makes the book even more effective. I really like this book, I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes a little bit of reality, humor, and a great American story."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In my life, I have read many books; however, none has affected me as much as _The Great Gatsby_. When I read reviews that claim it is over-rated or trivial, I almost take it personally. How can anyone miss the beauty, eloquence, and depth of this novel?Fitzgerald creates some of the most magnificent characters and scenes in the history of literature in this book. Gatsby is the embodiment of the American dreamer. He is so insecure that he shrouds himself in glitter. He wants one thing he can't have so much, he surrounds himself with every other possession. He finds that getting what you want is often the worst thing possible, and that, to be very cliche but borrow from Fitzgerald's own images in this book--everything that glitters is not gold. The character is classic because a part of him exists in so many people.Daisy and Tom are also classic characters. Haven't we all met this shallow type that takes what it wants at whatever cost and leaves the world to clean up their messes? Sure we may feel sympathy for Daisy in some more tender scenes, but isn't that how people like her get away with hurting others?Finally, Nick is a wonderful character because he is so like the reader. He is the man who can't help but stand on the side of the road watching an imminent disaster. There is little we can do but watch and once it happens, we can't force ourselves to turn away.These characters are incredibly developed, and because they are so universal, so archetypal, we can identify society through them.I have failed to touch on the unity of effect of the novel, the poetic prose, or the incredible theme that permeates the novel, but I hope that readers will find these for themselves. Let Nick take you for a xfat drive through East and West Egg; you won't be sorry you took the trip."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Many years have passed (alas!) since I read this American classic in college. So, I decided to give myself a treat and reread. Here is some of my marginalia: \\"Not a great paragraph. Nice image and flow. Could Gatsby be so successful while being such a clumsy liar? Anti-Semitic image. Great scene. Great chapter. Thought is confused. Another terrific chapter.\\" So, what am I saying? Fitzgerald writes with flawless lyricism when the subject is money and society. But when his subject doesn't evoke this lyrical mood, his writing can become choppy while his attitude toward certain types of people becomes superficial and harsh. Regardless, it's amazing the book is nearly eighty years old, since it still conveys what many people probably regard as a contemporary experience. My advice: Read Gatsby again!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I would have to agree with Mr. Thompson on this one. I can't add any new words of wisdom that haven't been written already by one of the other 600+ reviewers of this book. This deserves 6 stars, and is the quintessential american novel, putting the American Dream under the microscope and finding the ugly truths that lies beneath the glammor. The jazz age of the 20's is the perfect setting for a novel like this, about the American Dream, and the people who would do anything to acheive it. This is the era of bootleggers (how Gatsby got his money) and the sort of reckless spending and investment that sent the country into the Great Depression. If you are in high school, you should definitely read this book, and most high schools make you read it. I read it back in high school and didn't think too much of it, but after reading it again on my own, without useless worksheets or stupid deadlines, I got a lot more out of it, and that's what I suggest, read it on your own. If you are over high school age and haven't read this, shame on you. Pick this book up now, and read it front to back. No cheating! Do yourself a favor, and pick up this american classic, old sport."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a classic novel of the Jazz Age about aspiration in America. As V.S. Naipaul was recently quoted in the NY Times Book Review: &quot;The only valuable life is one that is shaped by the anguish of aspiration and that is engaged in a struggle against the void of nonachievement.&quot; Gatsby's life personifies the aspiration of a young man who has just returned from World War I so poor that he wore his uniform after his discharge because he couldn't afford to buy new clothes. Through his own entrepreneurial talents he rises to attain an immense fortune, which he hopes will renew the affection of his much beloved object of desire, Daisy Buchanan. She once jilted him because of his abject poverty and married another wealthy man. Now that Gatsby is rich, he wants Daisy to become his wife at any price. He asks her to forsake her relationship to her wealthy, philandering husband. The denouement of the novel is opulent in its irony. Gatsby's demise and the response of his many friends to it is truly memorable. Fitzgerald as Nick Carraway is an intelligent, articulate, noble and faithful narrator in this great American novel. At a time when so much focus has been placed on the hubris of American CEOs, the message of this novel about the unbridled pursuit of material wealth plays with as much high fidelity now as it did in the Jazz Age.

Hopefully you all will enjoy it too. Thanks~"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is a quality Classic, full of enchantment, and taking us back to the twenties just after the war.I took my time and savoured every word as it flowed along with a mysterious edge, causing me to be somewhat unsure of where you I was actually heading next.Narrated by Nick Carraway who had been anxious to come out to the East (New York) after spending a rather dull childhood in the Midwest, I found Carraway a very interesting person. A bit of a schemer sometimes; one is never sure how he really feels about Jay.Jay Gatsby is the enigma in this story; a rather poor officer who before he goes to war falls hopelessly in love with the beautiful Daisy Fay from Louisville. But what happens after the war???The Great Gatsby having heard that his lovely Daisy has tied the knot with the uncouth, ill-mannered and filthy rich Tom Buchanan, goes to great measures to become wealthy too.... by all means. When he accomplishes this, he buys an elaborate house not far from the Buchanans where he hosts glittering and five star parties most weekends; with the hope that Daisy will eventually turn up.You will be entertained and shocked by the things Jay Gatsby does all in the name of love. His parties filled with lots of celebrities and Hollywood people do nothing to assuage his troubled and lonely soul. I felt his pain in this book and his isolation which you will experience too when you read this book.This is one of the best Classics on the market, even more so now that it has been updated. I highly recommend this book and can't wait to get my hands on F. Scott Fitzgerald's other updated ones; The Beautiful and The Dammed and Tender Is The Night. Fitzgerald is a boss and oh; the cover is soooo beautiful."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Yes, I've read this many times,since high school, where it seemed like a force fed waste of time.I never knew the types described in this book then.Like &quot;Bond Business&quot; Nick,a business based on trading money (update to Tom Wolfe'S BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES,which has many similarities to THE GREAT GATSBY!) But, that was a long time ago. Usually I breezed thru it,but recently I gave it a more serious try, and found it to be just as great as they say! Why? Simply, because the characters are incredibly true to life. I've met Tom Buchanan types so many times it makes me want to (I won't say here.) The world is full of arrogant smart alecks who never had to do a thing on their own,and who look down their nose at their supposed &quot;inferiors&quot;. And Daisy...How many shallow,money grubbing,self obsessed young ladies are there like this? One wonders what Gatsby saw in her too,but that's probably the point. You know, the ones who get thrilled by looking at dozens of colored shorts in a wardrobe, as she does with Gatsby. Both types really care for nothing except themselves and their little toys. FS Fitzgerald probably knew hundreds like this...Now the Gatsby character is more unique and refreshing,even if he is dull.The self made guy who may have made his money under shady conditions. Then again,how about the dot-com millionaire rage of recent memory, and the way the world and the media were lapping it up. Now, the Enron fiasco where it's obvious the bigshots could care less about anything other than lining their own pockets at everyone else's expense.A little like Tom perhaps. But Gatsby seemed to have a heart, shallow as he may have been. And the New York 1920's locale rings true too...This novel easily can be read by a 15 year old,even though his life experience will not be able to understand it. And an 80 year old can appreciate it too. If Joyce's ULYSSES was the best novel of the century, how many can figure it out?. Really, almost no one! Same with most others on the list,like say Faulkner.ULYSSES was not about what FSF called &quot;the bitch goddess success&quot; which is what THE GREAT GATSBY is about...As far as another reviewer here questioning what the final line meant..ie &quot;So we beat on,boats against the current,borne back ceaselessly into the past&quot;...Surely it was THE GREAT GATSBY'S obsession with the past,even as the future beats away, and Daisy's disappearance from the past into the present, that was responsible for his terrible demise at the end!! Tell your Professor that's the obvious answer to his 20 year question..We should each learn to deal with our own past darknesses. The tragedy of a person like Gatsby is that it becomes an obsession resulting in a sad ending...Also, this is without question a monument to the language, the second reason it is such a classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"&quot;So we beat on, boats against the current, born back ceaselessly into the past&quot;.Surely one of the most apt and, to the reviewer who claimed no one can understand it, clearest conclusions to a novel. The Great Gatsby is a novel about the pursuit of a romantic ideal. Gatsby/America pursues its ideals in vain. For all our optimism, for all the pure belief in the ideal/the green light/the orgiastic future, it recedes before us, year by year. It is unattainable, it does not exist, it is but the projection of our past desires (for Gatsby, read the Daisy of his past, for America, read the untarnished new world). Still, no matter, we will keep trying, we will row on, boats against the current, our goal folornly already behind us... we are born back ceaselessly into the past.As for the anti semiticism/racisim - Tom is a racist, but is clearly an unthinking ignorant racist - did Fitzgerald really need to expressly condemn him? The condemnation is implicit.Perhaps the professor referred to in the first review had his own political agenda. If so, i suggest he read Roth's the Human Stain."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel takes place in the 1920's and is based on some of the things that happened in the earlier part of F. Scott Fitzgerald's life. I felt that The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald was an amazing novel for many reasons. Some people felt that around the first fifteen pages or so were not needed, but I thought that the pages helped me a lot with understanding the setting. It was incredible how well written this novel was. Every page just keeps pulling you in deeper and gets you more interested. As I got into the book, I had to think twice about whether it was a true story or not. If you read this book straight through like any other book, you will think it was well written and had a good story line. However, this book is much more complicated then it seems. There is symbolism throughout the whole book that you should lookout for. Once you identify it, you will have a whole new understanding of what this book is really about. I loved the way that this novel was such an easy book to read because one idea just flowed to the next. Most books that are considered classics are relatively difficult to read, but this really wasn't. It was really amazing how you could relate what happened in this book to what happens in everyday life today even though it is a completely different time period. For people who like reading good literature, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"by far, the best novel i have read in my 20 years of existence. i ask every girl i'm interested in if she's read it. a response of yes=we'll keep in touch and no=no love"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Each time I was forced to read a book during my four years of high school, the first thing I would say was \\"this one must be boring too\\". I read The Great Gatsby in my senior year of high school, and of course, it was not particularly my favorite book. If someone asked me why I did not like it for the first time, I would say that I was not concerned about the author's language but the plot of the book.About a year after I had read the book, I chose to read The Great Gatsby for the second time because I wanted to know what other people meant when they referred to Fitzgerald's \\"beautiful writing.\\" Even though I chose to read The Great Gatsby, by myself, I did not expect to get something different out of it. However, surprisingly, the second time was so much better than the first time.Before I read this book for the second time, I did not understand what my English teacher meant by \\"beautiful writing\\". I do not want to say that it is the best book that I have read in my life, but it has descriptive writing that keeps people's attentions. I can say with confidence that it is a well-written book that has \\"beautiful writing\\" and engaging characters. I can picture Gatsby's parties and what Daisy looks like because of the metaphors that Fitzgerald uses in his book.I consider The Great Gatsby one of the \\"greatest\\" American novels because it not only entertains people but also leaves many questions. However, I looked at other reviews from the Amazon.com, and I was little upset that some people did not appreciate Fitzgerald's writing. My advice to high school students who did not enjoy this book is that they should try to read it outside of school. I guarantee that everyone will have a different reaction to the book the second time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Nick Carraway was born into a well-to-do, wealthy family, and lived the life of privilege. Attended the best schools, wore the best clothes. So after he graduates from the University, he informs his father that he plans to move East to learn the bond business, and that's how he ends up in West Egg, living across the way from Gatsby. Nick knows nothing about the man, except for the fact that he throws lavish parties almost every day of the year - complete with celebrities in attendance. However, when he pays a visit to his old friend Tom Buchanan's place, and meets up with Miss Baker, a friend of Tom's wife, Daisy, he discovers more than he ever intended. Soon Nick is caught up in a friendship with Gatsby, one that involves covering up the affair that Gatsby and Daisy are secretly having with each other, as Tom looks on angrily - becoming more and more determined to break it up each day, at whatever cost.I usually am a reader of mysteries and teen fiction, but lately I've really gotten into the classics, so I thought that I'd give THE GREAT GATSBY a whirl. I was not at all disappointed. THE GREAT GATSBY has now become one of my favorite books. F. Scott Fitzgerald is truly a literary genius. His character development involving Tom, Daisy, Nick, Miss Baker, and Gatsby is utterly marvelous, and the plot developments keep the reader enthralled with the lives of the rich and privileged from the very first page to the very last. This is a book that should be read by all, young or old.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is one of the all-time greats. No other book out there fleshes out the pre-World-War-1 era like this one. Everyone knows the story is about a man who amasses a lot of wealth by various dubious means, solely to please Daisy, a socialite that he has his heart set on. Daisy had rejected him once before in favour of a social equal, Tom Buchanan. But poor Gatsby. No matter how high he rises, he is doomed. When he takes the blame for a hit-and-run murder committed by Daisy, he is murdered by the victim's husband. Gatsby is an anti-hero. His main fault is that he has fallen in love with the wrong girl. Fitzgerald was very brave to write this book since it took such a blatant shot at the \\"American Dream\\" and the shallowness of the idle rich. This book is classic that will endure for a long time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is written superbly. Fitzgerald does an amazing job of creating the feeling for his reader of being there with his characters. The characters themselves are purposely soulless people who have chosen to chase after the emptiest form of the American Dream, capturing its trappings without any of its sense of accomplishment. The characters and story are gradually exposed as you make your way through the story, learning who the characters are and how they became the way they are.Long after you finish the novel, you still feel transported to another time and place when you think about it. A wonderful American tragedy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A lot of people tend to say The Great Gatsby is an overrated piece of literature, however I agree with the majority that considers it one of the finest pieces of 20th Century American literature (or literature from any period, from any country for that matter). The story is pretty familiar to most so I won't summarize it, however if it's possible for you I highly recommend listening to the 1984 audio cassette version narrated by Frank Mueller (who was and indeed still is probably the greatest audio-book reader anywhere). Mueller's rich and inflective voice is a joy to listen to; he makes the story's prose -- already inherently poetic -- even more beautiful by greater life by stressing certain words/phrases and changing his voice slightly for each character.This book seems a little short but it accomplishes a lot for what it is. It's a simple basic story with a lot of complex symbolic meanings, and that's probably why it gets studied so much. If you want further fascinating reads, a biography of Fitzgerald's turbulent life (he died young at 40) reads like a true-life allegory of his stories.So, definitely read the book! Definitely listen to the tapes! Definitely watch the 1974 Redford film NOT because it's particularly well dramatized but just for the great costumes and period settings. After watching the movie, even though I didn't think it was a good one, I still picture Robert Redford as Gatsby, the shrill Mia Farrow as Daisy, and that one dork whom I can't name as her husband, Tom.A special treat might be the 50s version starring former heartthrob and current dead actor Montgomery Clift. He gives a subtle, nuanced performance compared to Redford's \\"it's okay if I can't act well in this movie because I'm good looking!\\" portrayal."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is one of the better books that I have read. The Great Gatsby by Francis Scott Fitzgeralds. It is a novel that will expand your intellect and is also a very popular book that a lot of people enjoy reading and find it easy to understand. The book was published in 1925, and the setting takes place in 1922. The narrator, who is also one of the main characters Nick Carraway is a fairly young man from Minnesota who went to an Ivy League School which is also known as Yale. After the war he moves to New York and he works in the city. The other main character Jay Gatsby young man alittle older than Nick he is very rich and is a very mysterious person. He dosnt allow people to know his true identity and people make up stories about who he is but no one in the beginning has ever seen him before. He fell inlove with Nicks cousin a while ago her name is Daisy and she lives across the pond from him. He ask for Nicks help throughout the story to try and get back with her. Nick in the beginning gives advice that his dad has given him and talks about his life and what he enjoys about it. Is this book he doesn't critisize other people and just tells the story as it is.Nick is learning business that's why he moved to New York. The house he has in rented which is right next to Gatsbys house, he throws parties nearly every night. One day he goes to visit his Cousin Daisy and her Husband, he meets a young women who seems to take well to him her name is Jordan Baker she is a profesional tennis player. She said that her and Gatsby used to date before the war. Gatsby now asks of Nick to arrange a meeting with him and Daisy at Nicks house. By this time Nick has met with Gatsby a few times and they are becoming more familuar with eachother. Once they have the arrangment and Daisy and Gatsby are reuinited this is where all of the problems begin in the novel. Gatsby's true self begins to reveal once he starts seeing Daisy the relation ship between Nick and Jordan is getting stronger while the relaiton ship between Daisy and her husband is weekening. Daisy's husband is having an affair while he is with Daisy with a women named Murtle she is the wife of a guy who owns a gas station in the middle of the town that Gatsby often travels through. Gatsbys affair with Daisy tends to get him into some trouble along the way it is a exampl of love and affairs and what happens to them along the windy road."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"What's not to love about this book? The glitz of New York in the 1920's barely overlays its moral decay. Our ambiguous narrator, Nick, is repulsed by this at the same time as he is complicit in every event of the story. The distant and pining figure of Jay Gatsby, who longs for a woman he can never have, represents the belief that money can buy anything and the purposelessness that would occur if a dream were fully realized. As a near-perfect example of modern literature, Gatsby uses symbolism itself to show that symbols only hold the meanings with which we vest them. For example, the symbol of the eyes is so haunting because it infuses the story, but has no fixed meaning or context. As long as this novel remains a beloved classic, America will never fully be able to divorce itself from its past."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Obviously so much has been written about this great classic of American twentieth century letters, that my renderings will hardly add to the pantheon of acclaim and recognition that this wonderful story invokes. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a prime example of one who writes so well that he makes it seem easy.Like his contemporary Hemingway, he had the ability to make shocking statements without exclamation or over-emphasis. Also, his narrator is in a way a step removed from the central story, although having his own demons and hang-ups; in the end he is an irreplaceable part of Gatsby's sad ending.The story transports the reader into the 1920's, when bootlegging and infidelity were taboo but evidently commonplace. Idealistic love, and its dissolution, are at its core. This makes the novel timeless. Daisy Buchanan (the central female character) represents the type of ideal, rich, carefree woman that the 1920's is known for; Jay Gatsby the swashbuckling and debonair type that women sooned over; urbane and unaccountable. Perhaps the novel shatters the shallowness of those simple stereotypes. It is not by any account a feel-good reminiscence of the Jazz Age. bit something much deeper. The brilliance is that it makes you pine for the era while exposing the obvious superficiality present within it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is a small thought, but GG is more pertinent today than the year of its publishing."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The great gatsby is probably the best book I have ever read, and certainly the most life changing. I read it recently in class, and connected so well with the characters. It is a book that takes multiple reads to understand fully, because of the amount of symbolism in it. Fitzgerald's words are so beautiful, and his descriptions paint verbal pictures that are truly magnificent. The Great Gatsby is a book I intend to read over and over again. It is am american classic that every person should read at least twice."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When I first heard that my English teacher gave us the opportunity to read \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" I had an open mind and frankly, I grew with such anticipation. The first few pages immediately begins with the narrator, Nick Carraway, a rather timid man from the mid-west, who becomes quite interested into all the glamour and glitz of the New York, along with the wonder of his uncanny neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Nick is definitely not your average narrator. He generally judges all his surroundings by its cover, and basically has something to say about everything. And with Fitzgerald as the author, all that is being judged is extremely detailed as it can get. Some may say detail is good, but I say, too much detail can get others thrown off and indifferent toward the novel.As the novel progressed in content, I began to grow uninterested. I felt that I wasn't as into the novel like others had appeared to be, and my mindset toward the book wasn't quite as good as I hoped. To be honest, the novel's storyline wasn't half-bad; it was typical, a so-called \\"classic,\\" but nonetheless it was rather acceptable. Fitzgerald focuses on a plethora of different characters dealing with their lives of betrayal, love, and sometimes even death; doesn't that sound quite alluring?Charm is brought into this tragic tale as Fitzgerald adds his romantic side into play. He shows how one character loses his love and strives to regain his love back. It is certainly reasonably endearing, but it appears to show originality on Fitzgerald's part. To me, I feel as if it has already been done. Uniqueness is the basis to any story, in order for the reader to stay fascinated, the author must create something that is out of the ordinary, therefore keeping the reader more than satisfied. I don't agree with Fitzgerald's title for the story. To my knowledge there was nothing great about Gatsby. He used people to his advantage like the way he used Nick to get to Daisy. To get Nicks help he would even in a manner, bribe him. Was it because he was rich and famous? He became rich through illegal activities such as bootlegging with shady figures such as Wolfshiem and he was just as famous as rumors about him were. There is nothing great about that struggling man. A more appropriate title would be \\"The Late Gatsby\\". He is dead inside.However this novel does not end in fairy tale. It is more of a Shakespeareans play, a tragedy. Although I'm more partial to happy endings, the twist in the story does very well suit it. The story is pieced together well, in stormy plot, but lacks excitement towards the ending. Maybe Fitzgerald was headed in the direction of simplicity but that wasn't the case here.All in all, Fitzgerald's \\"Best American Novel of All Time\\" unfortunately isn't at its best. As a reader you should consider these factors as to how to judge this so called \\"classical\\" novel written by the infamous and supposed great writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald for yourself. But truthfully, if you, as a reader, define Fitzgerald's archetypal storyline as great as its title; that is beyond me."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Prepare yourself, because the following is a less than glowing review of a revered classic. Yes, it's true, I am making myself vulnerable to all sorts of negative votes to express an honest, yet negative, opinion on a &quot;classic&quot; book.But first, a little plot overview. This is a tragic lovestory told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a Midwestern transplant to New York who happens to live in a modest house in a very rich neighborhood. He is the narrator, but most of the action is happening with other principal figures, most prominently J Gatsby. Gatsby is a mysterious figure who has gained wealth quickly from questionable means and goes to great lengths to win the heart of the woman he loves...who happens to be Nick's cousin.The story twists and turns and describes Gatsby's high-rollin' lifestyle -- which would make a great episode in today's world of MTV Cribs -- and melds together several love stories with a great description of the &quot;bored rich&quot; living in the 1920's. The story is very entertaining and moves you along quickly.So, if this were a novel I picked up without knowing anything about it, I would probably be glowing and gushing all over the floor about it. But it's not. It is &quot;classic&quot; literature whose merits to fit into that category seem to be in debate. Well, here are my two cents.Some of the arguments that I have seen for this book's greatness are its beautiful language, Fitzgerald's economy of words, and the portrayal of the Jazz Age. And to that I say, first, that yes, the language is very good and I liked alot of the writer's descriptions, but they simply did not blow my doors off like other classics seem to. My personal grade would be a B+.Secondly, hey, economy of words is great, and I appreciate that an author is able to express him/herself succinctly (as opposed to many non-classic current authors,) but that in and of itself is kind of like an add-on benefit for me, like if the car dealer throws in some customized floor mats or something. That's great, but it's not a deal maker-or-breaker.Thirdly, I appreciate the portrayal of this period in history. But I really don't care that much about the bored rich in that period of history. By reading some reviewers' comments, you would think that this would be akin to learning about the hardships of Western pioneers or the tribulations of flood victims or something. It's just not that captivating of a topic to me to carry a story, but I guess that is personal preference.So, to summarize. I liked the book. I give it four stars. But it has a wagon-load of expectations that it is carrying, and I just felt like I was missing something when I was reading it. And perhaps that just means I don't have enough edgukashuns to &quot;get it,&quot; but this feeling seems to be a common one among other readers, even those who have finished high school.Go ahead. Commence with the negatives."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"If you're thinking of buying the Great Gatsby (a classic example of the literature elite trying to cram a book down the people's mouths as a &quot;classic&quot;), read the yellow pages instead.

Every word is so carefully chosen, each element so intricately interwound, you can't help but feel your also glimpsing into Fitzgerald's very essence as you thumb the pages. While I'm not going to review the plot, it's actually a simple story of love's power and the human desire to be more than we are. The real strength is the way Fitzgerald draws you into a world of the bored rich and let's you see every detail through the eyes of the narrator. Gatsby himself is the essence of a tragic fugure. So rich, so powerful, yet even he can't have it all. Maybe my love for this book comes from my identification with Gatsby. How he was determined to become successful and acheived his goal. Read this book, read it slowly, savor the language like it is a fine port. So many things happen at once, you need to move through it carefully, so you don't miss any nusances. Finally, I noticed that many other &quot;reviewers&quot;, mostly pimple faces high school kids, absolutely hated the book. Don't be fooled. There is nothing boring about here. I read it in High School, I'm now an attorney, and absolutely loved it even then. The book is just too rich to be appreciated by many kids who refuse to take the time to look below the surface. They want a fast plot, simple language and an exciting story. That's all they are capable of handling since they are exposed to crap like &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Titanic.&quot; Anyone who didn't care for the book is just showing their own shortcomings and lack of intelligence.

Much to my disappointment I found nothing more than an a superficial plot based mostly on descriptions of the 1920's. Fitzgerald succesfully caught the spirit of the 20's so if you're looking to get a feel for that era this would be a good book to read, on the other hand if you're looking for a grand literary work, there is a lot more out there. Fitzgerald's characters are shallow and unidentifiable, his plot weak and slow-moving to an extent which becomes tiresome even though the book is relatively short. Fitzgerald is not an author but rather a social historian, something apparent in other of his works, such as &quot;Bernice bobs her hair&quot;. So if it's insight on the 20's you want, this should be great, but it falls short of anything else it's reputation demands."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It was too &#34;wordy&#34;.

I still don't get what makes this book so highly acclaimed. As a Christian, I do not condone the adulterous affairs portrayed in the novel, one character beating his girlfriend, nor the rumored illegal means by which Gatsby earned his wealth. Perhaps if I didn't care about those things, I would have felt more favorably about Gatsby and the other characters.I did find the narrator, Nick Carraway, somewhat likable. Nick observes all the immorality around him, and he seems to keep himself from being sucked into the abyss; however, his being seeing as an outsider was likely due to his modest means compared to most others in the story. I was happy to see Nick had a sense of honor about him and his chosen profession of selling bonds. It seems his independence separated him from the filthy rich, but he was friendly enough that people entrusted him with their secrets."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I bought this for my daughter because it was on her summer reading list.

Personally, I dont believe that they have the mind for it. He or she is not mature enough to understand the value of this book. They dont see the agony Gatsby goes through. The lust he has for Daisy and wanting her more than every material object on this earth. He puts this girl in his mind and he cant get her out.

Great story, wonderfully rich prose and fantastic imagery. You might even say it was an allegory of its time. And you might even call it The Great American Novel. It even has a tragic ending.My only real beef with this book is with the characters.First off, what is up with the lame protagonist Jay Gatsby? Is he for real? What a plonker. He is every bit as wet as Darcy in Pride and Prejudice and Heathcliffe in Wuthering Heights. I thought those kind of wimps only existed in ye olde English literature but here is another one of these love-sick fools turning up in American literature.What this genre of classic literature needs is a hero who really knows how to sweep a girl off her feet. A man who races motorcycles at dangerously high speeds, knows kung-fu, has a bad attitude, no patience and can find all the cool late night bars. If he has Style and Nice Teeth then so much the better. Now that's a proper hero. What we don't need is another clown who doesn't know how to chat up girls and doesn't have the balls to go after what he wants. Gatsby's problem is that he's a wimp and he doesn't know how to have fun.And what about the other characters?Nick Carraway: what is up with him?

In fact I didn't really care a damn for any of them. And it certainly didn't make me want to live that version of the American Dream."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel is useful to those teenagers who wish to seek the American dream of becoming successful and make a great deal of money. Reading The Great Gatsby gave me a look into what the High Society of the early 1920's was like. To many, this era was not really that important because World War 1 had ended years before and the world was just trying to get back on its feet. I thought this time to be dark and mysterious.F. Scott Fitzgerald's portrayal of a young businessman from the Mid- West, living in one of the many posh neighborhoods along the coast of Long Island, was brilliant. The main character, Nick Carraway, who is also the narrator, brings a sarcastic, yet genuine truth to the secret life of the rich and powerful. After waiting for a while, Nick finally meets the man named Gatsby. Despite all the rumors about the way he acquired his money and all the illegal actions that he might have taken part in, they become very good friends. The storyline continues and blossoms into a few love triangles, adultery, and murder. Reading this book will be an advantage to those students in high school who wish to do well and succeed in life.Some say that this Fitzgerald's novels should not be required reading for high school students. However, I believe that reading them can be life altering. The Great Gatsby allows you to take a glimpse into the lives of the rich and powerful. Within the walls of this aristocratic society there is great despair as well as great success. Fitzgerald is trying to send the message to those young enough to realize that money and power are not everything. Also, when power is obtained, work hard to keep it and do not let other things distract you. This novel is exceptional and should definitely be used in the classroom."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the top classic novels of all time. It is fairly familiar to most people and instantly recognizable when its title is said. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the author of The Great Gatsby, was very detailed in his writings and used a lot of imagery and emotion in this novel. It takes place in the early 1920's in the heart of New York. Near Long Island, Nick Carraway (the main character) rents a house here and lives for the summer of 1922. In his time of living here, he has heard about the wealthiest, most popular, and most luxurious man in all of Long Island, Jay Gatsby. This man is known for his lavish parties, extreme amount of money, and a bad past. Come to find out, these two are connected in some way from their past, and will be reunited through different meetings. Jay turns out to be Nick's next-door neighbor, and through a series of events, both bond strongly.This all sounds like a good plot, and a good read for anyone, including high school students (like myself) on up. This however is not necessarily the case. Although I am in an AP English class that is more of a college level class, I found this book to be hard at times to get through. There is too much that goes on that strays away from the main plot and main point of the story. I just simply found this book to be boring. It is not a book that young adults should read. It is very drawn out, long, and detailed. It uses very sophisticated language and is written with very much detail. The only reason I found this book difficult to read was possibly because I had to keep myself from nodding off. Respectfully, yes it is a classic and should be read, but maybe for college students or adults instead of teenagers."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is book is one of the best books I ever read.

It was the period of time which was known as the Gilded Age. The Gilded Age could be used as a comparison to a gilded vase. Things during this time looked nice and perfect on the outside, while on the inside, things were rotting, diminishing, and disintegrating. The poor were becoming poorer, while the rich were becoming richer. The lives of the rich were perfect, for they had nothing to worry about. It was a time of fun , games, amusement, parties and women. However all was not as good as it appeared to be. This time was filled with deceitful men and women; it was the time of prohibition, where the so-called drug stores sold about every kind of liquor; it was a time when bribes ruled the way things were run; it was a time when the World Series was fixed, and the profiteer was not found. F. Scott Fitgerald's novel The Great Gatsby was written to show the lives of society of both the newly rich, and the ones who inherited the wealth, the ones that were born rich and stayed that way. To show their inside lives, and to depict the morality of these people, the author has used to depict the themes of Gold Imagery of moral corruption, misplaced idealism, and waste of potential in the lives of the fictional characters."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"&quot;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&quot; Awsome....if you like Death of a Salesman, check this book out.

But Mr. Fitzgerald has hit upon th perfect balance of low-carb dining and exercise. His insights into plums are unparallelled. Thank you Fitzy, you truly are a &quot;great&quot; gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby was voted number two on the list of 100 greatest of the twentieth century and I never questioned this rating until confronted by an influentual college professor who made me examine the novel more closely. Many of the thoughts I now have on Fitzgerald and Gatsby I owe to him and I think it would be good to share them and allow people who read these reviews to rethink Gatsby somewhat. The fact is that Fitzgerald's &quot;great&quot; novel of the &quot;American Dream&quot; has serious problems that make it a questionable text for number two on such a list, especially considering it is placed above such novels as Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury and Light in August and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man.From the beginning of the novel, we are in the hands of a first person narrator in Nick Carraway, an empty shallow young man from the midwest who moves to the east to try his hand at the &quot;American Dream.&quot; The problem is that although most people would regard Nick as a shallow character, Fitzgerald doesn't seem to offer an underlying critique of this moral void inside of his character but instead forces the reader to accept what Nick says at face value. Then we meet Tom and Daisy Bucchanan. Tom is the quintessential Aryan prototype spouting racist propaganda about how it has been scientifically proven that the blond haired blue eyed Nordic male is superior in every way to other races, and again there is no satiric edge from Fitzgerald to say that Tom is not correct in his beliefs and assumptions. Then we reach the introduction of Gatsby and the melodramatic love story of Gatsby and Daisy. Gatsby is the nouveau riche who throws large excessive parties for anyone who will come to his mansion hoping that Daisy will someday show up. Fitzgerald goes down a list of participants in those parties and most of the people there are Eastern Europeans. This is a criticism of the parties in Fitzgerald's prose and begins to venture into the anti-semitic areas of the novel. The introduction of Meyer Wolfsheim, the stereotypical Jew seals the deal on that. We also soon discover that what attracts Gatsby to Daisy is not a human bond of understanding and friendship, but the fact that Daisy's voice jingles like money; and yet, people seem to view this love affair as stirring and tragic. The sad thing about the book is that all of its characters are shallow and money hungry. There is not a redeming figure in the book though the narrator Nick would like to say that the hero is Gatsby. Gatsby was all right in the end. It was what prayed on him that was bad. This is Fitzgerald's judgment.If this is the quintessential novel about the American Dream, if the lust of Gatsby is our lust as Americans and the love story of Daisy and Gatsby the type of love we as a people aspire to, we're in a great deal of trouble in this country. When books such as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn come under attack in high schools across for using the word &quot;Nigger&quot; and others such as The Grapes of Wrath are banned for using profanity such as &quot;Christ,&quot; The Great Gatsby, which is a far more damaging and subversive novel, slips by unnoticed. I'm not for censorship in any form, but we must think about what we want to tell children or any other students about America. While Huckleberry Finn and the Grapes of Wrath are being banned yet are permeated with important and positive messages about the meaning of America, The Great Gatsby is a staple in cirriculum everywhere saying that this is really what America is about. Part of the problem is that Fitzgerald's prose is so exquisitely poetic that the themes of the book sometimes disappear beneath the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleberg or get clouded by a green light at the end of a pier. Half the time if you stop to think, you can't even figure out what Fitzgerald is talking about. &quot;And so we float on, boats against the current borne ceaselessly back into the past.&quot; At the end of examining the novel in an American literature class in college my professor asked the students what this line meant. No one could come up with a satisfactory answer. The teacher who had been teaching The Great Gatsby in class for twenty years told us that he had never met anyone would could tell him what it meant. Perhaps the novel should have fallen to a lower spot on the list of the twentieth century's greatest novels."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful tale of an era.

The novel brings the glitter of the jazz age back fullforce. The devil-may-care freewheeling lifestyle carriesthe reader along with the young man Jay Gatsby (the maincharacter of the novel) in his sad search for love and riches.The story is also narrated in the third person which I reallythought gave the novel more perspective.

The book is agreat read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The protagonist takes you through the highs and lows of 20th Century high society. The protagonist, introduced to polite society by an acquaintance (Gatsby), shows you the landmarks and windfalls along the road to dinner parties, and points out the many trappings of culture and conscience that befit a beautiful young fool surfing the upper crust of industrial-age America.Much of this book draws from the writer's own life, as he watched his own wife suffer from many of the same symptoms of society as his book's characters; obsession with the trappings and trimmings of the social elite; greed and spite; treachery and manipulation;alcoholism and insanity. This genuine point of view is distilled by careful selection in a tour de force o the ballroom lifestyle.The author's style relies heavily upon narrative, and his descriptions are potent. He mingles Western cultural artifacts (billboards, warehouse districts) and signs of life in America's dustbowl (parked cars) to spot the low and high income parts of metropolitan culture like the warm and cold spots in the river. All in all, this is a book which draws its power from subjective interpretation of the narrative; very little is decided for the reader, who feels much like a back-seat passenger in Gatsby's car, listening in and seeing the sights."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I decided to read The Great Gatsby because it is a classic, and when I was supposed to read it in high school, I got the Cliff Notes instead. The story still did not impress me much, but it is a short read and well worth it in the end because the message is one we can all learn from. Gatsby is in search of his true love, which is something all of us look for in life - that relationship of heroic proportions that seems almost surreal and timeless. Perhaps the last page is the best clincher of the book: \\"Gatsby believed in the green light (true love), the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us.

It holds your interest because of the subject matter - love, betrayal. Most of the characters aren't likeable, they are dislikeable. It is one of the most overrated books of all time because it is often called one of the greatest books, which it definitely isn't.

I really found it disappointing, for before reading this book I thought it would be interesting enough to capture my attention. This did not happen because those parts that would be considered the climax were not interesting (I found theses scenes dull and predictable).Furthermore, I would like to say that most characters were not good at all. I consider that some scenes, such as the one in which Daisy starts crying on Gatsby's shirts, are meaningless (perhaps because what these parts want to symbolise, is not clear enough). Moreover, I think that the story should not have been told in the first person by Nick, because by doing this Fitzgerald gave no possibility of including an account of the emotional relationship between Gatsby and Daisy from the time of the reunion to the catastrophe.Finally, I would like to make clear that my opinion should not be taken as an insult towards Fitzgerald, who is a worldwide well-known writer, but as a personal comment in which I highlight what for me was wrong in the setting and development of \\"The Great Gatsby\\"."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I guess that this novel come into the hands of today's readers mostly due to the fact that it has been designated as one of the U.S. literary icons of the XX Century. Undoubtedly, the precision to detail and the smoothness used by the writer to convey its ideas is fantastic. My problem with it, is that the drama in which the love story is build seems rather silly. We have a character like Gatsby who is a young fellow who decided to become rich the fast way (smuggling and other unidentified dirty business) to gain social recognition for the sole purpose of being worthy of a rich girl of whom he had fallen in love. Nevertheless, the author never takes the effort to outline why in ruthless 20's, when wild capitalism was on the rise and pragmatism was the only name of the game, a person like Gatsby, who is the living symbol of those forces, who have laid more women that he can remember and who have \\"known the world\\" from every possible angle, decides to waist his life in pursuit of a romantic love and challenge the husband of her beloved with the tact and style of a 14th year old.

A good writer ought to tell a story that is interesting enough to spark a natural curiosity in the reader over its deeper implications. The Great Gatsby is a good example of this. Fitzgerald subtly interweves social commentary into a solid story, providing entertainment for the casual reader and enough material for the critical reader to keep himself occupied.I only had two problems with this book: First, Fitzgerald's drawn-out, boring writing style, and secondly, the novel's climax, which seemed a little hokey to me.

Scot FitzgeraldTitle: The Great GatsbyPublished: 1925Type of Book: fictionTheme: differences between social classes and conflict with loveBackground Information: The author of this novel can greatly relate to one of the main characters. Like Jay Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald was ambitious when it came to women they wanted. They both had a sense of a rich lifestyle and they just had to be successful people.Content: Nick Carraway, who is also the narrator, moves to New York during the summertime to learn about a bond business so he rents a house in West Egg. Jay Gatsby is his rich neighbor who always throws parties every Saturday night, but he does not really engage in them. All the main characters that are in a marriage either have a mistress or another significant other.Reactions: The book becomes very appealing because all the suspense builds up as you read. You would have to keep on reading to find out what really happens next. For example, there is a part in the novel where someone gets killed but the one who killed that person seems very unlikely of them. The book affected me in a few good way too. It is better to be honest in any relationship and try your best to express yourself in a decent manner.

When the murder occurs, you really don't care. Even when the individual is struck by the car, you kind of go &quot;Oh, wow, that's too bad,&quot; but nothing more is felt. And there are a few minor loose ends that are never resolved. I finished the book with a feeling of &quot;Is that all there is?&quot;Perhaps the big rush to get this into print was part of the reason for its shortcomings. I'm not sure.

Apart from that, I really fail to see all the fuss surrounding this book. None of the characters carry a unique personality, nor the interaction between them is anything special.

That was probably the only thing I enjoyed about it. Nick Carraway, he was the narrator, the thing that I didn't like about him was he claims to be objective.

Gatz enlists in the military and upon the end of his service is befriended by a wealthy benefactor who employs him \\"in a vague personal capacity\\". Gatz's employment provides him the opportunity to see the world, and experience life on the other side of the social strata. His adventures allow him to reinvent himself and upon the death of his benefactor, Gatsby purchases a mansion on Long Island, near the now married Daisy, and begins the process of recapturing her favors.On Long Island, Gatsby is known for the lavish parties and ongoing entertaining at his mansion. The east coast rich and famous are regulars at his parties but no one knows the origins of his wealth or his family background. Unable to connect Gatsby to his riches, the socialites create their own version of who he is and where his money comes from. Meanwhile, Gatsby pursues a meeting with Daisy in an attempt to woo her from her marriage; now that he has attained the wealth that will certainly please her.

This is nothing more than an adequately written soap opera of a love triangle that ends in tragedy. I expected great writing; I found the author's writing to be merely adequate and the characters to be wooden. The story is of the lowest common denominator type: a sleazy romance that would have been equally at home in the Harlequin Romance series. The supposedly brilliant portrayal of the Jazz Age was anything but. I am a big twenties fan and know a good deal about the period and Fitzgerald certainly did not capture the feeling of the period for me. The twenties were about Jazz in New Orleans and Chicago, movies in Hollywood, hustle and bustle in Manhattan, not about some spoiled and bored people in Long Island who don't know what to do with themselves (how could anyone have been bored in the 1920's ???!!! There was a good reason why they called it the Jazz Age; it was exciting - to everyone but the clueless numbskulls in this novel). Daisy is supposedly irresistable; she comes across as the twenties version of a valley girl. Any grown man moronic enough to fall for her deserves what he gets. Gatsby is as wooden as any toy soldier.Why, oh why, do academics go crazy over these novels? I think it is because they spend so much time in academia that they have no sense of life outside of universities.

Scott Fitzgerald examines the theme of aspiration in America during an era known as the Roaring Twenties. Jay Gatsby, the hero in Fitzgerald's novel, embodies every aspect of the American Dream, fancy houses, flashy cars, and glamorous parties. Yet, his attempt to obtain true love is the cause of his downfall. Fitzgerald uses this novel as a satirical attempt to unveil the truth behind this so-called glamorous time period. Although I felt that Fitzgerald was successful in creating an interesting plot, his execution causes the story to seem slow and it leaves his characters well underdeveloped.Fitzgerald uses this novel as an expression of his views of the nineteenth century. The Great Gatsby is narrated by Nick Carraway. Fitzgerald uses Nick to interweave his characters, but according to Sashee \\"he did not do much to give a true insight on the feelings of each person,\\" which leaves the characters unfinished. Another reader, Shalom Freedman says \\"Fitzgerald's remarkable ability to create or capture an atmosphere, a feeling of time, of a special kind of American world.\\" Fitzgerald spends too much time creating a sense of place in his novel, that he has left my imagination wondering about the characters. Novels of tragedy are supposed to contain something that tears at the readers emotions and this novel failed to do that in many ways. In a sense the characters were extremely one dimensional and I am only able to grasp the surface of each characters personality. The deaths of Mr. Wilson, Myrtle Wilson, and Gatsby had no major effect on my feelings, because Fitzgerald did not shape the characters into memorable characters, that drew emotion from his audience.Another problem that I encountered was Fitzgerald's slow and dismal writing style. Fitzgerald's style focused on the details of every scene, for example when Fitzgerald lists the pages of \\"important people\\" that attend Gatsby's parties, he loses my attention. By adding unnecessary details to simple scenes throughout the story, Fitzgerald postpones both the climax and ending of the novel. These are two pivotal points for readers. Sashee finds that \\"although the plot might be fascinating enough to keep some readers going others may find the general story far too detailed and at some parts boring.\\" Fitzgerald's story contains minimal surprises, even the climax is hard to distinguish from the rest of the novel. Anticipating the ending might motivate some readers to plow through this novel, but they should not have to wait until the end of the book for it to become interesting. In contrast to what some may think, this novel is not a work that according to Freedman, \\"simply holds its readers in a very special charm and grace.\\"Fitzgerald allows readers insight to the atmosphere of the nineteenth century, as he captures \\"a feeling of time.\\" Yet, he fails to understand the concept... time. The Great Gatsby is a classic story of achievement and aspiration, but wordy pages, a slow climax, and ending make it a hard read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I've read and reread The Great Gatsby for most of my adult life, and it's the greatest American novel because it shows America's endless ability to re-invent itself, and ourselves.

Scott Fitzgerald wrote a true classic of the 1920's and the affluence of a distinguished facet of society. As a high school student, I am quick to judge any novel I read, yet this one caught my attention and had me wondering the truth about the book's title character, Jay Gatsby. Fitzgerald mixes romance and tragedy to create an unforgettable plot which keeps the attention of its audience. It proves that wealth cannot buy happiness and does so with unexpected circumstances that surprised me and kept me on my toes until the tradgic finale. The only unfortunate thing about the book is that it ends and leaves you wanting more. For an intriguing and different read, The Great Gatsby does not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is great in two aspects of books that I look for. First is the general story; plot, characterization, setting, storyline. Second is the way it is written which keeps you reading it over and over.The setting is a fictitious New York suburb of East and West Egg in the early 1920's, a location dotted with large estates build with immense wealth. The main characters are the narrator, Nick Caraway; his new found girl and golf pro, Jordan Baker; Tom Buchanan, the husband of Daisy Buchanan; and of course James Gatz also known as Jay Gatsby, self prescribed culturist of old wealth.Concerning the first aspect, this book is an art of obsession, treachery, deception, hubris, crime and murder. It is the original soap opera (though not annoyingly melodramatic). It will keep you turning pages and ends with a bang.The second aspect, the one that makes it a classic is the brilliant prose and mastery of the English language. Like a movie that presents something new every time you watch it, this book has many subtle subplots and philosophical outlooks.I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in reading and rereading the classics. A book from \\"the lost generation,\\" written by an author from World War I, it definitely has the era's deserving undertones."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Next to the Sun Also Rises, the Great Gatsby is simply the greatest American Novel written in the 20th Century. And on the last page, the reader will be able to find the finest paragraph of prose to be discovered and enjoyed in any language.If you've never read this book before, you're in for a wonderful suprise. Fitzgerald's imagery and allusions (think T.S.

The first seventy pages of the book were filled with so many details and so much information that I kept getting confused. Luckily, one of my friends, the one who recommended the book to me, was always able to answer my questions and explain things to me in a manner that I could comprehend. I feel that the book does not really begin to pick up and make any sense till page eighty or so. After that point though, I feel that the plot really picked up and became more interesting. I am one who watches soap operas, so it was a little bit of a resemblence.

The Great Gatsby is more authentic and wonderful because the author himself lived in the twenties. He wrote about what he knew and his finished product turned out to be a great contribution to American canon. The two settings contrast the other as the story moves along the sparkling East and West Eggs to a old run-down gas station. The setting is important as they show the power money and greed hold over people. Jay Gatsby is a &quot;new money&quot; millionaire that is in love and slightly obsessed with Daisy who rejected him years before because of his shabby upbringing. Gatsby, determined to be Daisy's &quot;gold-hatted lover&quot;, makes himself a fortune that his mysterious past helps him with. Gatsby throws elaborate parties(a reflection of the twenties) hoping that his beloved Daisy will come running back into his arms. The only problem is Daisy is married to the rich and jealous Tom Buchanan.The narrator Nick Carraway, Daisy's distant cousin, moves in next door to Gatsby and the inevitable happens: character's lives start to mingle and intertwine.There is no happy message and hardly anyone gets what they want at the end but I was entertained and moved by this book. It is a realistic story that has all the elements it takes to enjoy a book: jealousy, suspense, love and humor. And will you look at that: all before the days of major motion pictures. See, screenwriters don't make all this stuff up."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"What can really be said about The Great Gatsby that hasn't already been said? The novel itself is near perfection. In this Fitzgerald is a genius. Using as few words as possible, Fitzgerald has richly constructed a story as fitting of the American experience in 2009 as it was during the Jazz age--all glitz and glitter, pomp and circumstance based on thin air, imorality, and chimeric dreams. The Great Gatsby as a novel is a great achievement. As a story, it is bankrupt."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book came in pretty fast and it was in a very good condition for being used.

I found the author very capable of crafting words, but I did not sense a \\"I can't wait to know\\" moments. Of course like all classics you have to over look the vernacular. The author also used a few words that I was not familiar with. This would make this book better for a more sophisticated reader. I am interested in reading other reviews by more learned people to see just how much I might of missed."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"Pursuit of happiness\\"? More like the pursuit of money leading into happiness. The novel starts off with a dull beginning but soon develops into what is known as one of the greatest written novels during the First World War. In the Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald uses the theme of importance of social class along with money status to show that Mr. Jay Gatsby is a symbol for the average American during the 1920s. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway who is a young lad living in West Egg, Long Island. Next to him lives the infamous Jay Gatsby who falls in love with a taken woman. Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan had met five years earlier and had fallen in love but unfortunately Jay left and was not able to contact Daisy for some time. After waiting for five long years Daisy decides to marry Tom who is one of Nick's friends from college. Sooner or later Gatsby and Daisy meet up again at Nick's house and fall in love all over again. Nick ends up being caught in a love tangle when he finds out that not only are Daisy and Gatsby having an affair but also that Tom has an affair with Myrtle Wilson. In the end three people end up dead due to the entanglement, but it is made clear that Daisy's choice to stay with Tom is solely based upon the recently found news that Gatsby was actually a poor man who inherited money. This then ties in the theme of \\"money does matter\\" and the downfall of the American society due to a shortage of money in the 1920s seen on pages 40-41. I recommend this book to those who are interested in reading twisted romance novels with a little rising action thrown in."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The writing is pretty good but unfortunately that doesn't make up for a weak storyline. The plot is so far-fetched in places that it spoiled my enjoyment of the book. The ending was particularly trite and melodramatic. The fact that this book comes in at less than 200 pages long is good because if you don't like it, well at least you didn't waste a lot of time. This is the sort of book that other \\"celebrated authors\\" apparently think highly of but many \\"casual readers\\" don't really enjoy it and I am one of the latter. Sorry, but only 3 stars."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The west was conquered and the midwest cultivated, so in The Great Gatsby set in the 1920s we turn our attention back east, where to midwestern narrator Nick Carraway and his neighbor Jay Gatsby the green light at the end of the Buchanans' East Egg dock seems to represent the fertile promise of America, and the dreams and the money that are supposed to make them reality. Some dreams, like the dream of recapturing a romantic past that never really was, become nightmares.Although he witnesses and participates in deception, including both sides of the Buchanans' infidelity, Nick wants to appear to be a reliable narrator, which he emphasizes when he says up front, \\"I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me.\\" Later, Nick identifies himself with \\"the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him, too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\\" Nick's authorial viewpoint sets the tone for his story and his observations of the brutish Tom Buchanan; his shallow and unsatisfied wife, Daisy; his class-climbing mistress, Myrtle Wilson; and the mysterious Jay Gatsby, the hero of the different unbelievable fictions he tells (when Nick asks him what part of the middle-west he is from, Gatsby responds enigmatically, \\"San Francisco.\\") A confused Nick hears solemnity in Gatsby's voice and sees sincerity in his look, despite the obvious prevarication.The most influential literal voice is that of Daisy Buchanan. Lacking the romantic substance for which Gatsby has idealized her as the symbol of his youth--his real youth--Daisy becomes a siren with a siren call. Nick writes, \\"The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.\\" Her friend, Jordan Baker, tells Nick, \\". . . and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . .\\" Later, Nick mentions that the \\"exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain,\\" and \\"I think that voice held him [Gatsby] most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that voice was a death song.\\" Nick says of Daisy, \\"Unlike Gatsby and Tom, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs . . .\\" By contrast, Myrtle is earthy, with \\"an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continuously smoldering.\\" Tom, whose affairs we are told have included a hotel chambermaid, seems mostly unsusceptible to Daisy's voice, while even Nick notes its influence and Gatsby is destroyed by it and by his desire for the real past that every story he tells effectually effaces.A compact novel concentrated on only a few months in the lives of a few characters, The Great Gatsby is rich with symbolism. During his reunion with Daisy, Gatsby almost stops time literally by knocking Nick's clock down, but instinctively he catches it before it falls. \\"We all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor,\\" Nick writes. Gatsby even apologizes as though he had broken the clock and as though it were a significant loss that his countless money can't replace. As the reunion continues, Nick says of Gatsby, \\". . . in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock.\\"Throughout, time is a consistent theme; it is part of what Gatsby futilely endeavors to recapture. He can reinvent a past in which he was \\"educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years,\\" but he and his means cannot recreate the real past. As Nick observes, \\"Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.\\" He adds later, \\"Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.\\"The Great Gatsby reminds me of The Count of Monte Cristo. Both Gatsby and the count start life as ordinary men and, through circumstances and the determination to achieve a much-desired goal, transform themselves into extraordinary men, ciphers to all but the most observant of their fellows. One seeks to revenge a past wrong; the other ignores the present and tries to reinvent the past as though there had never been a Tom Buchanan and as though Daisy had never loved him. Both efforts take time and unlimited patience and money, but only one is successful. The count revenges his past so he can live better in the future, but Gatsby fails because he does not understand, or want to understand, that the past is written and that the future begins with the present.Somewhat lacking in heart--the only character who displays genuine emotion is Tom Wilson, Myrtle's despised husband--The Great Gatsby captures the jaded excesses of the post-World War I era and the American faith in time, money, and effort as the sources and creators of success. The novel also shows the greater power of circumstance and fate. I've read The Great Gatsby only once, but to appreciate its structure, symbolism, and richness would take several re-readings. Read once for pleasure, then read again to explore Fitzgerald's craft."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A portrayal of the glamour and superficiality of the Roaring \`20s, The Great Gatsby focuses on the tragic love story between millionaire Jay Gatsby and young beauty Daisy Buchanan. Narrated by Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway, the first half of the tale traces Gatsby's past--how he met Daisy, left to serve overseas, and how she married harsh but practical Tom Buchanan in the meantime. The book traces this event as the inspiration for Gatsby's wealth: we witness his numerous, lavish parties thrown in vain attempt to attract the attention of Daisy, who lives in a different sector of New York. He resents the fact that Daisy feared marrying him due to his financial status. We learn that he obtains his money through shady means, thus underscoring the values of a goal-oriented society. Gatsby, with the help of Nick, is eventually reunited with Daisy, yet Tom grows suspicious of their close relationship, leading to Gatsby's tragic demise.Throughout the novel, the reader sees the extravagance and excessiveness of Gatsby through his reckless lifestyle, yet as we look closer we see a certain emptiness pervading it. For example, although he lives in a gigantic mansion, only a few people live with him. At his funeral, only four people show up, and Daisy is not included in that number.F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby in order to illustrate the American dream as a vain, empty journey without progress, exposing the tragic flaws of an achievement-oriented society. Fitzgerald is essentially criticizing society's tendency to concentrate on the goals, rather than the new experiences and learning we ought to gain from the journey. Thus, he asserts that the entire point of the American dream--freedom, individualism, and the pursuit of happiness--has been lost to the new cynicism, extravagance, and greed that now characterize it. Gatsby, though a seemingly friendly and gracious individual, undergoes his downfall due to his lack of integrity in his pursuit of wealth.We can see that The Great Gatsby mirrors Fitzgerald's own tragic love story with his lover, Zelda. In his state of disillusionment after losing Zelda, Fitzgerald wrote the book in order to emphasize the decline of the American dream; Gatsby's willingness to cheat and swindle his way to riches marks a shift in the American dream in the 1920s from integrity and individualism to extravagance and greed. Though he tried to hide his past from Daisy, it eventually caught up to him, establishing another of the book's themes: the inescapability of the past.Although this novel does not make for the most entertaining or action-packed read, I completely recommend it to everyone. The characters, in truth, are not at all likeable, yet this is exactly what Fitzgerald was aiming for: flawed individuals. From first-hand accounts, he has tremendous insight into the faults of humans in a goal-oriented society. There is also abundant symbolism, allowing for a very in-depth analysis of the novel's purposes. I advise any potential readers to fully chew and digest this novel for full enjoyment, as it is no hollow work."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In a world that celebrates capitalism to a T, The Great Gatsby brought me back to the negative aspects of a world that celebrates spending at the cost of meaningful relationships. Not only is this story well-written, it is also fundamentally relevant. In a nation where the gap between the rich and the poor slowly, but steadily grows, a book for the twenties is as equally important for today.Nick Carraway is a disillusioned banker who introduces the story in a generally negative tone. The reader finds out why as we are introduced to the one, the only, Jay Gatsby. This story is completely tragic, as it explores the moral gaps between the old wealth, the new wealth, and the poverty. Daisy and Tom represent all of a conservative society that looks down at everything from the new wealth (aka Gatsby) all the way to the financially strapped characters, and I leave the rest for you to sort out.It's an extraordinary novel and it is the best novel that shows us today how the twenties represented the major dilemmas of consumerism and its detrimental effects."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel demonstrates the importance of creating one's own happiness and not relying on material things to generate that. Gatsby believed that by becoming rich he could solve all his problems, but that only made him more somber with his already tainted life.Gatsby had been living a tough life of rejection and decided to turn to the one thing he thought would help--money--and poured his life's ambitions into procuring that. He became so dependent on this solution that he would go to any means necessary to become rich. Gatsby would devote the next five years of his life to cheating and scheming his way to the top. He began illegal drug sales to generate more profit. His riches were gained by no honest means and represent a life of lying and shortcuts. That is no way to go about happiness. Happiness can only be achieved if one actually makes it for themselves. They cannot rely on material possessions to create that for them. Being truly happy takes effort, and that is something Gatsby does not know how to give. Taking the easy way out will never lead to any blissful ending.Gatsby has to learn that lesson the hard way as his riches begin to worsen his life, not better it, and people take advantage of him and only want him for his money. Gatsby feels lonely in this world as he begins his new life as an elite \\"business man\\" so he invites people over to his house to enjoy his money with him. He soon realizes that spending time and money on strangers does not make him any better off than before his riches. His money can only make others happy, not himself. Those people who he begins to believe are his friends do not care about him in the least bit; they only want him so that they can enjoy the same luxuries as he does. These people that spend all hours of the night at Gatsby's house do not appreciate him enough to come to his own funeral. No one cares about him except his father and neighbor. Having money does not make Gatsby happy and it will not make any one else happy. The only thing that warrants true happiness is having people who love and care about each other and that will not forget their true friends when they need them the most."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Okay, I'm guessing if you're reading this review, you're a teenager as well, and have to read it for school, or you are an adult curious to see other perspectives of a hated or treasured novel.

He came out on stage holding a copy of THE GREAT GATSBY, sat down on a stool, and told the audience that he had never really understood the book when reading it in school, and proposed that he and the audience read it aloud and discuss it, so that he could understand what it was all about. Maybe that is needed here.I am not anti-kids or anti-teens. But high school students need constantly to remind themselves that they are not experienced readers, and that their opinions on books should be proffered with a necessary dose of humility--humility that they might not yet have learned to be a first rate reader.To pass a judgment on THE GREAT GATSBY like \\"it isn't so great\\" or \\"this is a bad book\\" or \\"this is boring\\" says absolutely nothing about the novel but a great deal about the presumptuous oaf uttering the statement.THE GREAT GATSBY--like ULYSSES, THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, LOLITA, MOBY DICK, MIDDLEMARCH, or Proust--provides the measure of what a great novel can achieve. But one isn't born able to read and appreciate great books; it is a skill achieved over the course of time.My advice to all the high schoolers who want to trash this book out of revenge for having been forced to read it: wait a few years, learn to read novels, gain a little more understanding of history, grow up a little, and then go back to it.

Now I wonder what all the fuss is about - for the novel has been a major disappointment. If this is one of the pinnacles of the American literature - and I keep hearing it is - I shudder to think what some of the lower peaks must be.Whether I was prejudiced against the novel by its classical status, or sceptical about it because of the huge amount of praise conferred on it, or simply had too high expectations, is hard to say. But I surmise I might kinda exclude the first two possibilities - for there is a precedent for a classic which I was both prejudiced against and sceptical about, but which I enjoyed quite a lot and which made me an ardent fan of its author (or authoress, because I am speaking of Jane Austen and ''Pride and Prejudice''). As for the high expectations, if one doesn't have them about the classics, what is there to have them about? Certainly, no one is obliged to like any book under the classical label, but I certainly think everyone should give a good deal of time and attention to the classics. The fact that they were first published many decades ago and the reading public, generation after generation, has found them valuable enough to keep them in print is a good enough recommendation. It fills me with respect and awe; sadly, they are not always reflected in the works themselves. ''The Great Gatsby'', alas, only proved again what a wonderful series Penguin Popular Classics is: it gives me the excellent opportunity to acquire at a really cheap price classics that simply don't worth more. As far as I am concerned of course.To start with, the story is good enough for a mediocre novelette, but it is hardly remarkable, much less compelling, and surely unworthy of a novel: Gatsby is fooling around with an old girlfriend of his and that's just about all - until an ill-conceived and badly paced series of dramatic events lead the reader to a lurid end out of the blue. What is much worse than the inanity of the story - which is not so rare a thing after all - is the fact that it is simply very poorly written. It is well beyond me how such prose can be described as ''beautiful'', as I so often hear it described; to me it seems convoluted and laboured, ungraceful and heavy, from time to time bursting with affectation and odious sentimentality. The worst thing of all is that the florid, hideously purple language often completely parts with lucidity. Indeed there are moments when I am left perfectly at sea what at all happens or what the characters are talking about. Nor is the dialogue much better, though sometimes it is remarkably dramatic and meaningful. On the whole, the book certainly is readable, but I was neither entertained by it, nor sorry when I finished it. Nor do I have any intention of re-reading it - I do that only with books which have succeeded to give me a unique and valuable experience.As for the characters, they don't fare much better. The narrator, Nick Carraway, is the only one who shows some hints of depth, complexity and charm. One of the book's major flaws is that Nick is far more interesting a character than Gatsby himself. Certainly Mr Carraway doesn't suffer from modesty:''Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.''Well, neither with the other characters nor with his readers is he as honest as he wishes he would be, but at all events he tries really hard to be - which is highly commendable. We are given to understand that he is poor, so he naturally has nothing but scorn and contempt for the rich. This only makes him more acute observer, which in turn makes a fine combination with his sharp tongue. The sarcasm of Nick Carraway virtually pervades the whole story and leaves no doubt about his opinion of the wealthy. It is often not a little amusing but it is rather unfortunate that the narrator should harp on it so much; every third sentence it gets quite tedious indeed. Moreover, Mr Carraway is not exactly a skillful narrator: few times does he turn to Gatsby's past but he invariably fails to say much that is less confused than the numerous rumours flying over Gatsby's mansion; except that he didn't earn a single cent of his fabulous wealth but inherited it all - which only makes Gatsby less and less compelling, if that's possible.It is Nick Carraway, too, who is there to make some sense of Gatsby's otherwise perfectly incoherent behaviour and singularly boring character. The only sign of greatness that can be ascribed to Jay Gatsby, as far as I can see, is that he is an exception of the rule: much as Nick despises the rich strata of the society, and disapproves of the man who ''represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn'', he cannot help but being attracted to him. But what is this attraction founded on? That, I confess, remains a mystery to me. For Jay Gatsby is as boring a character as there ever was one. There is somebody there, perhaps some fascinating hint of contradictory nature as well, but we are never given anything more than lots of ''old sport'' stuff together with a strange mixture of an urbane, aloof host of the most glittering parties on the East coast of America and incoherent, infantile and devoid of simple common sense man who is head over heels in love with one Daisy. And who on earth is Daisy? Nothing more than a silly girl with one-track mind and affected manner that borders on the incredible. Her pathetic cries in the beginning ''Sophisticated -- God, I'm sophisticated!'' are just too ridiculous to be amusing. Nor is her husband, Tom Buchanan, any less dull and lacking anything that might be called appealing, though in general he is much better drawn; as a matter of fact, he is perhaps the most complete character in the novel after Nick Carraway which, in a way, makes Tom fascinating, if by no means likeable. Jordan Baker, with whom Nick had something of an affair, so sketchy and insubstantial that it might have been spared to the reader, together with Mr and Mrs Wilson, surprisingly shadowy characters given their crucial part in the story, only complete a list of dramatis personae more poorly presented than many a mediocre play can offer.I surmise what makes ''The Great Gatsby'' a classic is its vivid representation of the so called Jazz Age, term invented by Fitzgerald himself as I am given to understand. He is certainly at his best describing monstrously expensive parties full of monstrously wealthy people whose ultimate goal is to get perfectly drank and to talk the most stupendous crap one can possibly imagine. Nick's devastating tongue has a feast here all right. The emptiness and the decadence of an era in which one of the most popular waltzes could be named ''Three o'clock in the Morning'' is vividly described, with a degree of verisimilitude which Mr Fitzgerald should certainly be given credit for. But I have two rather simple questions: 1) is this Jazz Age, or whatever name one might wish to call it, worth the trouble to write and read whole novels about?; and 2) can the Jazz Age in this particular case, evocative as it is, compensate for uninteresting story, flat characters and indifferent narrative?This has been my first encounter with the work of Francis Scott Fitzgerald and I am not at all sure that it won't be the last one as well. For my part, despite charming moment here and there, the best thing about ''The Great Gatsby'' remains its short length. A classic it may well be. But certainly not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I had heard a lot of great things about The Great Gatsby but never read it before and was eager to finally read it. It was well done and an easy read even after all this time.The tale is told by the neighbor of Gatsby. It is a twisted tale of adultery and adoration. Some say it is the quintessential American novel. Gatsby's neighbor tell us of Gatsby's quest to win a married woman's, Daisy's, heart. Daisy struggles with a husband who cheats on her with another woman and she married him for money. The whole tale ends in a tragedy not unlike a Greek play.The tale was an easy and quick read and fairly engaging. Fitzgerald does an excellent job describing the era and the surroundings, making everything easy for the reader to picture.The story quickly gets twisted and complicated with various characters involved with other characters that they aren't supposed to be with. The tragic ending is strangely ironic and suiting of all the selfish characters present.I can understand how some might root for Gatsby and Daisy and their supposed quest for true love; but personally I found all of the characters to be selfish, shallow and deserving of what they got in the end. This tale truly shows an era of American decadence.Overall a decent read and I am glad that I read this. I loved the ironic symmetry of the story, but didn't really enjoy any of the characters much. The story is paced well, has great description throughout, and is engaging. I wouldn't run out and read everything by Fitzgerald based on this book, but I enjoyed this book and am glad I can say I finally read this."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A great read.

A story of a man who dared to live a dream - for a woman who didn't. A story of one great and foolish love that's been squandered by those not capable, those that chose to watch from the outskirts of life, because it's safer that way. Because he, the great Gatsby, lived a dream that threatened to expose their own blank existence by comparison, so they participated in the feast, they tore the juiciest pieces off each dish, only to wipe their greasy fingers on the table cloth, when the party was over, with the words, that \\"poor son-of-a-bitch.\\"Of course I can only dream to capture what The Great Gatsby is about, but this rang true to me when I closed the book.

Don't you dare dreaming of style and flair and exuberance, I will yank the carpet from under your feet just so you know where you belong. Don't you dare. But I do. I will read this book many times over, to hear the story anew each time, to learn the beauty of language from those impossibly long sentences that wrapped their ideas around my head in an exquisite silk of thought. The way only Francis Scott Fitzgerald could command them. My hat off to the master."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Back in high school, I read F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 The Great Gatsby and Ernest Hemingway's 1926 The Sun Also Rises. At the time, I wasn't impressed with either, considering both to be shallow tales of spoiled rich folk. I gave The Sun Also Rises another chance a couple of years ago, and was so impressed with the power of Hemingway's novel that I quickly read the rest of his major works, and some of his minor. I just finished re-reading The Great Gatsby, and while it didn't leap up as much in my estimation as The Sun Also Rises, I did appreciate it more than I did back in high school.The story of The Great Gatsby does, in fact, revolve around the discontent well-off of Jazz Age New York. Our narrator, Nick Carraway, is the one decent guy in the book, while the titular Jay Gatsby, his old flame Daisy, Daisy's husband Tom Buchanan, and Carraway's love interest Jordan Baker are all despicable people in one way or another, though this time reading it, I was able to appreciate as certain tragedy to Gatsby that had previously been lost on me.The main thread of the novel it Gatsby's attempt to win Daisy back to him. There are also parties. Lots of parties. You may not know much about the mysterious Gatsby until the end of the novel, but one thing you know from the start is that he throws a hell of a party. You might also finish the novel with an urge to start calling everyone \\"Old Sport.\\" Try to resist it.What I enjoyed most about the novel this reading was the language. Fitzgerald at times seems to be writing poetry as much as he is fiction, so lyrical and evocative is his writing. You'll finish the novel with many memorable phrases and scenes still echoing in your mind. While his contemporary and friend Hemingway wrote powerfully using as few words as possible, resembling a minimalist stone sculpture, Fitzgerald strings together glittering, complex phrases that call to mind a necklace of sparking diamonds. Between the two, I like Hemingway's approach more, but those jewels of Fitzgerald's - they do shine brightly and catch the eye.I listened to Blackstone Audio's 2007 production of The Great Gatsby, read by Anthony Heald. Heald did a fantastic job with the novel. The tone he used for this production fit the Jazz Age drama perfectly, and he captured all the characters very well. I had not listened to anything narrated by Heald before, but after listening to his recording of The Great Gatsby, he's on my audio book narrator radar. The unabridged recording runs approximately five hours.In the end, I'm glad I gave The Great Gatsby another chance. I don't love it as much as I ended up loving Hemingway's work, but Fitzgerald's most famous novel was well worth reading again, and it has a fitting place as an American classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Mr. F. Scott Fitzgerald is an exceptional writer. Always has been---always will be. There is no other Fitzgerald. In many ways, the same can be said of The Great Gatsby. It is an hauntingly beautiful novel. Yet, it is a very sad novel. For, it reveals the fickle nature---of the human race. In the beginning, Mr. Gatsby is greatly taken with Miss Daisy. Yet,---what he neglects to realize is the fact that the attention that Miss Daisy is projecting towards him---is simply a form of self admiration, whereby---she is the center of attention: Almost as if, she is standing in the midst of a chamber full of mirrors. The surrounding mirrors are the men which are encircling her: Projecting back to her the great and beautiful image of herself. She sees it,---reflected in their eyes. She feels it,---reflected in their mannerism. Mr. Gatsby is but one of the many admirers---just one of the mirrors. Yet, for the moment, that image which he projects back to her is the one which is the most pleasing to her---that is,---for the moment. However, sadly, Mr. Gatsby feels as if he is not worthy of her. He walks away---from her, from all that she represents, and all that which---he madly yearns for. For years, he does---whatever he deems to be necessary---in order to rise up to her level of, what he believes to be, her existence. He arrives at a point where he feels that he is now in a position to consider himself her equal. He is now good enough for her. He strives for wealth and power, because he correlates wealth and power---with Miss Daisy Buchanan. Yet, what he fails to understand is that Miss Daisy Buchanan is not good enough for him. He has been faithful to her, but she has not been faithful to him. What he fails to understand is the fact that she is indeed married to the right person---Mr. Tom Buchanan. For, just the way that he is boorish and unkind on the outside,---so is she---in the inside. He is a reflection of her. But, alas, it is well hidden behind the soft looks and the gentle demeanor. Tom Buchanan portrays the physical aspects of the characteristics which they both share---in one way or another. This is why they came together, and this is why they stay together. She is a fickle woman. Yet, she is not weak. She knows exactly as to what she is doing. The destroyed lives of men have no meaning to her as long as the image in the mirror continues to be. It is the image which must survive. At the end, she is just as much responsible for the tragedy. At one point, Mr. Gatsby states, \\"Her voice is full of money.\\" It is as if he is saying---she represents all that I have strived to achieve, and have wanted. Again and again, he tries to prove himself to Daisy---that he is indeed good enough for her, but what he fails to understand is the fact that the quest was not worth it,---because she was not worth it. It is indeed a very sad testament to human nature, yet it is so very true. This is why, this book lives on and on. The world has not changed much. There still exists many a Daisy Buchanans and Tom Buchanans. Sadly,---there are also many Mr. Gatsbys---trying desperately to prove themselves to the fickle Daisys of the world. Human nature has not changed since Mr. Fitzgerald penned this great novel. What Mr. Gatsby fails to understand is the following fact---that his tragic end came to be on the very day---in which he met Miss Daisy Buchanan. For she reflected in the mirror,---the very image---of what he wanted to become."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"East Coast America, 1922, and young Nick Carraway decides to rent a house in the fictional town for the rich, West Egg, while he tries to make it in the city trading bonds. Except his life is about to change as he meets his flamboyant and rich neighbour, Jay Gatsby, whose charisma and lifestyle will spirit Nick away to catch glimpses of how the rich live in 1920s America, the good and the bad. But Gatsby isn't all he seems and when Nick introduces him to his married cousin Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan, their fatal company will reveal to Nick the sordid and black-hearted side to the American Dream.What to say about this book that's not been said before? Should there be a superlative limit for this novel? And where should someone start? Well, I read this book several years ago and decided to re-read it recently to see if the novel was as good as I remembered, as clever and well written, as fun and as sad, and with a beating heart still behind it; and I was glad to find that it still did.Nick Carraway is a brilliant narrator, flawed and biased, yet all-seeing out of all the characters; we see Gatsby as a charming personality at first and then slowly and subtly see the flaws in his character, see through the lies that go into the creation of his persona and the darkness beneath. We see Daisy and Tom as a sad married couple - Daisy full of regret yet unable to leave because of her love of Tom's money and Tom with his numerous infidelities and foul temper showing how the rich can live a life free of consequence.The book contains many images of startling beauty such as Gatsby's glittering parties wearing his pink tuxedo, the green light from Daisy's window in the night, the decayed ruins of Gatsby's mansion, the decadent empty Buchanan household - and the stench of squandered privilege, crime and death that accompanies it all.The writing is of the highest quality, each sentence perfectly written and filled with layers making up rich paragraphs and textured pages - it's not hard to see why Fitzgerald is canonised and celebrated when the writing in \\"Gatsby\\" is this good. But that's not to say that it's unreadable to people looking for a good read - it's perfectly approachable, understandable, and fun. The scenes are so full of life and action that it's as compelling to read purely for its story of doomed love between Gatsby and Daisy. The scene between Gatsby, Daisy and Tom is as explosive to read the first time as it is to re-read it again and again.But because the writing is so good, the story so layered and full of symbols with a strong theme and message, it's no wonder this book has had untold numbers of books and papers written about its complexities and nuances - how truly magnificent a work of art it is. I won't go into the various themes and sub-texts as this review will turn into a sprawling mini-book of its own but suffice it to say Fitzgerald explores the theme of how wealth in America means the rich can do what they want to the poor and the law can't touch you if you have cash, with a wry and precise eye that still has relevance nearly a century after it was written.And why is Gatsby great? Because he is the embodiment of the American Dream - a working class boy who became rich; a self-made man, yet his pursuit of riches and love were all illusions in the end. Riches come and go and love can be fickle and deceitful. In the end, Gatsby represents the poor to Daisy and Tom's rich, and like the poor paying for the sins of the rich, Gatsby too must pay the ultimate price for attempting to join their ranks.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a haunting, bitter, and powerful novel of America's elite and their excesses, a damning yet beautiful work of art that captures perfectly an era and a class through wonderfully realised characters in an unforgettable story. A modern tragedy that's of its time but for all time, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" continues to enchant readers and earn and re-earn its status as a Great American Novel. If you've never read this masterpiece, let me be the first to introduce you to Mr Jay Gatsby - he'll take it from here."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book, of course, is wonderful and gets a million stars.

When Nick Caraway rents a home nearby, Gatsby accepts him into his circle with the hopes of luring Daisy back to him. For you see, Daisy is Nick's cousin.Oh, to be rich and young in the 1920's! At its core, this is a love story and has been called one of the greatest American novels of our time and I can certainly see why. It's gorgeously done and Gatsby is a character that stays with you, long after finishing the novel. He's complex and just mysterious enough for you to understand everyone's infatuation with him.

I think it might be the first assigned classic literature novel that I made me to read beyond the assigned pages (ok, maybe Of Mice and Men had the same effect too.)I particularly adore the Nick Carraway. Even if he is a rather passive character who seems to get dragged everywhere by Tom, Jordan, and Gatsby. He comes off as someone trustworthy and humble. I admit I get frustrated with his passiveness at times; somestimes I just want him to slap the characters, but I guess that would be acting out of character. For a guy that only knew Gatsby for three months yet held a funeral for him, and is aware that he was used as a pawn to get close to Daisy, Nick is admirable. There couldn't have been a more perfect narrator.Gatsby is beyond redeeming. He is a friendly, likable character, but it is apparent that he is a desperate mess behind his overwhelming wealth. He is clearly deluded by the idea of having Daisy and social status, even when Daisy is clearly a mess herself. I'm not sure what he even sees in her, but I suppose his undying love makes him likable, albeit frustrating.I'm not sure how Daisy can murder someone and not be terrified.

It is a book history buffs might enjoy as much as those seeking simple entertainment, becauseFitzgeraldset out to write a story of the times in which he lived--The Roaring Twenties. Accuracy in contemporaneous fiction is challenging, because historical elements were included, such as the World Series debacle of 1919, and everyone's a critic!Fitzgerald sought to make it an extraordinary work, only part of which he accomplished by sketching a larger than life character, Jay Gatsby. Fitzgerald's first novel was published when he was only 24, still wet with a commitment to excellence that is available only to the young--not that more mature souls aren't allowed excellence, but no one has it in his or her own mind as much as those who've been less knocked about by sorrow, misfortune or tedium.\\"The Authorized Text\\" adds to the pleasure of reading, becauseBruccolipresents some of Fitzgerald's own words on the novel as well as on writing in general, such as \\"An author ought to write for the youth of his generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolmasters of ever afterward.\\" Two out of three isn't bad. The youth of his generation were too busy living the life Fitzgerald described to be bothered with reading about it.This version also opens a peephole to common paperback publishing by tracing some of the errors that crept into the work over time. Corrections were made by comparing various editions to the galleys, which contained Fitzgerald's hand-written edits and rewrites, some of them notably more difficult to decipher than others, yet vast improvements to an already splendid tale.Finally, two more points stand out from reading this authorized edition. Fitzgerald's editor, Maxwell Perkins (Scribners), absolutely gushed over the manuscript,\\"I think the novel is a wonder.\\"As effusive as Perkins was, he was not totally so. \\"You are right in feeling there is a certain slight sagging in chapters six and seven...\\" and \\"Gatsby is somewhat vague.\\" Perkins went on for pages about Fitzgerald's treatment of Gatsby and his wealth, simultaneously accusing the author of saying too little and too much. Bruccoli calls Perkins a genius, so his critique may in fact be brilliant. Even so, they're both talking about the greatest book of one of the greatest writers of all time. All writers should take heart.The ONLY THING THAT COUNTS: The Ernest Hemingway/Maxwell Perkins CorrespondenceGatsby was a legend in his time. Only in his own mind? He did, after all, make himself up as Fitzgerald squeezed him out of his pen. And part of the greatness lies somewhere between knowing what is true and what we only wish were so. In Fitzgerald's own words, \\"That's the whole burden of this novel--the loss of those illusions that give such color to the world so that you don't care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory.\\"For me, \\"the magical glory\\" showed itself by racing me to the next page, though I wanted to linger over the words, and then too soon I finished the race, and there was no more Great Gatsby to read.

Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel about life in the roaring twenties and the pitfalls that accompanied that mostly carefree time has remained a classic for many years, and will remain for years to come.Told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, this timeless classic focuses on the life of self-made millionaire Jay Gatsby and his pursuit of love and happiness. Gatsby lives next door to Nick, and it seems that Gatsby's house is always full of people who have come from near and far to get a glimpse or hear a story about him. Many have formulated their own ideas, but Gatsby has remained mostly a mystery to his guests. He's frequently torn away at his gatherings to attend to business or to speak with some fellow captain of industry. Most people never meet him, but they enjoy his lavish gatherings.Gatsby's story really begins five years before the events of the book. During this time, Jay ment and fell in love with a young lady named Daisy. However, Gatsby was enlisted in the Army at the time, and he was forced away to fight in World War I. He distinguished himself in many battles and earned the rank of major, but he longed for a life with Daisy. Not content to wait for Jay to return, Daisy met and married Tom Buchannan, a bullish and pig-headed man. Five years later, Gatsby, now a wealthy man, bought his luxurious home which happens to be very near where Daisy lives.Meanwhile, Jay's neighbor Nick Carraway dropped over one evening to one of his parties. The two meet and soon become friends. Over the remainder of the book, Nick becomes very close to Jay, and he remains his only true friend. Events transpire among Gatsby, Nick, Tom, and Daisy that end up changing each of their lives forever. Some survive; some don't. In the end, greed, envy, betrayal, and even murder rear their ugly heads.This is an excellent work of contemporary literary fiction. The reader gets a very real sense of what life was like during the roaring twenties. The depression had not yet come, so life was good. This book has remained popular for decades, and has been called F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work. His story of the larger-than-life Gatsby is both exciting and tragic.I recommend this book very highly. The story is well-written, and the character development is excellent. I did have a problem with some of Fitzgerald's style of writing, but this in no means detracts from the overall story. Read this classic work of American fiction and discover what life was like for a group of people during the roaring twenties."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly.

Scott FitzgeraldHow many times can you, honestly, say that you have seen a smile quite like this?The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, a well-known classic, is about Nick Carraway's experiences in transitioning from the laid-back life of the Middle West to the more up-beat scene in the East. Mr. Carraway moves into a house in Long Island's West Egg village that neighbors the great mansion of Mr. Jay Gatsby. Gatsby frequently has lavish parties with many wealthy guests, at one of which, the two neighbors meet. Carraway is also welcomed by the Buchanans; Tom, whom he knew from college, and Daisy, his second cousin. This book, set in the 1920s, tells of the lives and affairs of this circle of people, and a small number of others, through the eyes of Nick Carraway.I, personally, wish that there were more people out there that had the good qualities of Gatsby.

Death as inevitable in the face of all of our efforts to reach that green light across the waves, is not a thought most are comfortable with. If you can look life in the eye, without the candycoating, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"even if this may be required reading in many schools, don't let that put you off. It's a hugely enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I felt, that this book was a very good read. It was somewhat boring throughout the first chapter, but once you move onto the seconod third forth and so on chapter the book starts to become entrancing and I felt that I could not put it down. I wanted to just keep reading to see what drastic effect would occur next to the characters. Fitzgerald, offers a very interesting look into what life was like in the 1920s. He Shows the reader how life was somewhat deteriorating back in the 1920s, what with the love problems and money problems. He shows how people always look back into the past to try to relive everything and have everything that you had when all you had to do was stop living in the past and start living in the present. Stop living on past moments and look at what is right in front of you and what you have. Fitzgerald writes the book with such vivid description of everything and it makes the reader feel like they are there, witnessing everything that is happening. I feel that I could read this book many more times and never get tired of it!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby (1925) by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a well-written fictitious book about the lives of people living in America during the 1920s. Fitzgerald wrote this book in the 1920s, and some believe he modeled many of the events after his wife who longed for the lifestyle of the financially prosperous people of the time. This book is representative of many issues in the roaring twenties like alcoholism, racism, adultery, and many more, although they are somewhat exaggerated. Fitzgerald does an excellent job of writing about the settings and gives readers a great concept of the situations and feelings of characters. I believe that Fitzgerald's main theme of the book is while many desire the American Dream of easy, quick money and measuring success and happiness only with material wealth, eventually they realize this perfect dream is ultimately unattainable. In this speech, I am going to give a brief summary of the book, give my evaluation of the book and compare it to two reviews from Amazon.com in order to help you understand my thesis. While The Great Gatsby is a fiction novel that tells of the lives of fantasy characters in the twenties, Fitzgerald has done a great job predicting and describing the happenings of what we now know to be the truth of the roaring twenties and are vastly applicable to many eras of time.The Great Gatsby focuses on the extravagant lifestyles of a group of Ivy-League graduates in the 1920s. Nick, the narrator, always finds himself in the middle of his friends' problems. Being caught in between the secrets and controversies of those around him is not something that he is comfortable with by any means. The issues that his friends are facing eventually climax and their elaborate lives begin to crumble.Fitzgerald does many things to help the reader understand the happenings in the book's sequence of events. This book at first glance seems to be almost a childish book because of its large print and lack of hundreds of pages, but as one reviewer points out in her review, in order to understand this short book one needs to read it with a fine-toothed comb. I completely agree with Emma because in different parts throughout the book, he uses weather, colors and many other things to help describe the feelings in a setting. Like in Gatsby and Daisy's reunion during the pouring rain at Nick's house, which shows the awkwardness between them, but their love rekindles just as the rain stops and the sun begins to peak through the clouds. Gatsby's white flannel suit that he wears in their reunion represents his image of innocence and purity.Fitzgerald writes of the problems of these characters as if he is looking back on the 1920s. He brings the topics of alcoholism, Gatsby's bootlegging, Tom's racism, the common adultery in the group, wealth prejudice prevalent in the book, and many other issues almost as if he knew these things were going to be major issues in the twenties. Or are these issues universal with humankind throughout time? With some thought, one can see that the characters of this book can be compared to many people who live extravagant lifestyles today and throughout history. Thinking about the issues presented in this book can bestow the idea that this book is not only relevant to the 1920s, but possibly the entirety of humankind. However, another reviewer disagrees with me, presenting the idea that this book should have only been printed in a 1920's newspaper because of its unimaginative storyline and irrelevance to any period other than the twenties. After reading his review, I found that he should read the previous review that I mentioned and analyze the themes and details that this novel offers and possibly recognize that although a little more exaggerated, this novel is comparatively applicable to today.In conclusion, The Great Gatsby tells of the problems of fictional characters in the 1920s, but I believe it can be compared with people at any point in time. This shows that Fitzgerald did a great job writing this book because people today and people fifty years from now can read this book and in some way be able to identify with it. Although the book was very short and a bit confusing due to intricate details, the author did well to put everything that he wanted into his story in a small amount of space. With a little critical reading, one can find Fitzgerald's main ideas and the concepts of The Great Gatsby. The issues that Fitzgerald put into this book make it seem as though he wanted to point out the problems of humankind. Maybe he did this in the hopes that readers would see this and possibly try to change the thinking and actions of humans that are producing these problems."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"i have read this book about a month ago, and it simply follows me around since, i find myself thinking of both charecters and plot but most of all the unique way in which scott fitzgerald see and describe the world. the man's simply a words wisard, with simple methapors and discription he spreads befor my eyes a complete world of glamore and coraption.i just love the way he melt down imagery with actuall descriptions to make the views and people in his books apear as a monsturose vertions of themself. and twist the scenery in his book into somthing that's both extreamly realistic but also fantastic. sort of like seeing things through glasses of a dream.it's a wonderfull book and i have enjoied it deeply."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book has lost none of its punch. Fitzgerald's prose is heartachingly lyrical, the story tawdry and the times legendary. I have read it thrice now and it only gets better.For those who want a basic plot sketch, here is my take:Wealthy man (a bootlegger?) Jay Gatsby moves into a mansion across the bay from his former lover and throws a continual party in hopes of winning her from her husband. The carnal excesses of the Jazz Age ensure that this won't end happily for anyone, including the seemingly detached narrator, Nick Carraway.Kids, skip the Cliff's Notes and just read this one. It's short and beautiful."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The great Gatsby is a book about rich people and how there lives are not what they seem at all. it is told by a &quot;outsider&quot; Nick he is like the boy looking into the fish bowl and the fishes are the rich people Gatsby or daisy. it is very interesting and gives a good view of the 20's. i give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I consider this book to be the greatest American novel EVER. Don't take my word for it, however, read it for yourself. Even if you end up not liking it, I think everyone should at least read this book. I also think many people don't see the depth that there really is in this book. It's not just about love, or romance. It is the persuit of a dream, a dream that is not all that it seems. A dream that is represented through one character, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is an illusion. Read it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It was a fast paced, thrilling ride through all the love and mistakes that we make. A brilliant novel by Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is a classic of American literature. Many people have read it in school, but I came upon it later in life. I admire the beauty of the language and the story. No need for me to comment on the symbolism, etc.- many others can comment more intelligently.After reading it twice now, and appearing in a bit part in a stage production of the novel, I have had time and opportunity to reflect on the book. What sticks with me are the characters. Tom Buchanan is a blustery bully, but very vital and interesting. His wife Daisy is beautiful, period. Gatsby is a fool who refuses to grow up. The &quot;love of his life&quot; is taken by another man and he should just get on with it. He is attractive and magnetic- he could find any number of beautiful, intelligent women to be with, but he fixates on the unworthy Daisy. His tragedy seems to be his inability to live in the present. So that gives us Tom and Daisy in the category of People I'm Glad I Don't Know and Gatsby in the category of People Who Need a Vigorous Kick in the Seat. However, the character who ended up making me angry was Nick Carraway. He is so often mentioned as some kind of Greek chorus. This is not how I see him. I see Nick as the one person who could have done something or even just said something that might have averted the tragedy of this story. He does nothing. He sees people make bad decisions and do stupid things and doesn't say a word. In fact, he helps things along. Obviously, Fitzgerald would never have written it any differently. Gatsby with a happy ending would have been forgotten immediately if ever published at all.It's a wonderful read, and part of the American Lit canon. I do recommend The Great Gatsby, but I can't get the bad taste of Nick Carraway out of my mouth."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Gatsby is simply the greatest American novel. Enough Said. I believe the Publisher's Afterward, by Charles Scribner, is excellent as well."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest American novels ever written. Much has been said of it supposedly chronicling the &quot;Jazz Age&quot;, but I think the themes are much deeper, penetrating the heart of what it means to be an American. The prose is near flawless, and the character of Gatsby is equally enigmatic and familiar. The idea that America is a place where one can continually reinvent oneself and spin a life out of dreams is as prevalent today (maybe more prevalent) as it was in the 1920's. Gatsby's seduction by this myth and its tragic consequences shows Fitzgerald's complete understanding of the limits and and even dangers of such a romanticism. The themes aside, his command of words, paragraphs and structure is something that all writers aspire to."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The novel \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald ranged between the two extremes of liking the book then hating its ending. The characters of the book were excellently described, from Tom Buchanan's enormous size and temper to Jay Gatsby's strife for prestige to wealth. The story line was well written, except for the disappointing ending. My favorite parts were of the great parties Gatsby threw and of the confrontation between Gatsby, Nick, Tom, Jordan, and Daisy in the hotel room; this is where I was totally tuned in as a reader. These incidents portrayed the intriguing, lavish lifestyle that Gatsby enjoyed and the turmoil of the lovers' quarrel. The thing in this book that just irked me was how fickle some of the characters turned out to be, and how easily swayed by their emotions. This really upset me, but what also bothered me was how Nick appeared spineless in the face of defending his friend. Yet, these two dislikes do not add up to my hatred for the ending. It left me disappointed in all of the characters and mad at the senselessness. Even though, it was a good book overall."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I put off reading this book for quite a long time because I thought &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; was awful. But I finally caved in after it was voted #2 (behind Ulysses) by the Modern Library and I have to say it is worthy of the #1 spot of 20th Century Fiction. One of the only books I've ever read where I actually had to set it down after certain passages and think &quot;Good grief, how did he come up with that?&quot;"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I was required to read this book for English II. I am a bibliophile by nature and have always loved books.This is one of my favorites. We were required to extensively research the 1920s in order to fully understand the background of the book, the time period, the setting. That research and this book have made the 1920s one of the most interesting decades in the 20th century for me; certainly, the one I am most attracted to.THE GREAT GATSBY is written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, \\"social historian\\" of the Lost Generation of disillusioned writers in the post-war world. Fitzgerald's prose and style so eloquently capture the fleeting spirit of the 1920s, the breaking through of social taboos and finding little on the other side, the desire for something impossible, the continuing themes of disillusionment, spiritual isolation, and death."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Note - this review assumes you've already read the book.Writing is excellent and east to get into, and you feel you know the narrator despite his lack of emotional openness. Gatsby however I found elusive and even somewhat unbelievable - maybe that's the idea but the notion that this otherwise capable guy lives his entire life in pursuit of his elusive Daisy and what-might-have-been strikes me as, at best, fanciful and at worst bad romance-novel blubber. Maybe I'm cynical but I just don't believe anyone without severe emotional disorders - a stalker, a depressive, etc. - would idealize someone the way Gatsby does Daisy, and after what seemed like a pretty superficial, if intense, initial relationship. If Gatsby is supposed to be so emotionally or psychologically damaged that he would thus lose all perspective, Fitzgerald does a lousy job of having it manifest in other ways that would give the reader a clue. Overall I come away finding Gatsby, who is supposedly this tragic hero, to be a histrionic schmuck. Not that he deserved his fate, really, but c'mon - he shows up out of the blue to steal a woman away from her husband and child? How am I supposed to sympathize with that?Having said that, the book is very evocative of the time - jazz age, flappers, etc. and this is its true attraction. A generation of people with wealth, health and opportunities who fritter it away with gaieties and shallow pleasures - this I can understand, and relate to when I look around me at my own age. Fitzgerald may not have been a huge critic of this (he was too busy participating) but his portrayal of the life of the bold and beautiful doesn't exactly come across as an endorsement either. Tom and Daisy Buchanan in particular provide a good and not too heavy-handed example of carelessness, as Fitzgerald thoughtfully has Nick point out at the end of the book. The utter self-absorption of running your life based on \`what do I want?' causes them to be oblivious to the lives they ruin. Nick, to his credit, at least has the decency to feel tawdry about his involvement in it all, and to escape back to the west. A parallel English novel is Huxley's Point Counter-Point, about a similar demographic (rich, spoiled, idle) in England at the same time.Other thoughts - interesting sub theme of midwesterners adrift in the wild east, that I hadn't picked up on much and can relate to, after living in the east, though I think the midwestern mindset has gained some confidence (or the east has realized its vacuity) since I found it more pathetic than intimidating. I had also forgotten how obvious it was that Gatsby's wealth came from the Jewish NY mob and his connections to it. Not sure of the significance of that (some comment on the American dream?) but it does undermine Gatsby's shine a bit, and made me even less sympathetic to him as a character. I also thought the giant eyes of DR TJ Eckelberg were an interesting touch that I had previously overlooked - cuckolded Mr. Wilson, in his rage and grief, focuses on the eyes as he rants \\"You can fool me, but you can't fool God!\\". Considering how little justice there is to be found in this story, this is the most comforting line in the book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As a thirteen year old boy growing up in a small town in Kansas this book changed my life.Reading it again as a lit major in college I got even more out of it.Now, as an adult my original copy is one of my most read, most treasured possesions."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Jay Gatsby is a tragic figure blinded by his own ambitions to rekindle romance with Daisy, a woman from his past. The story is told through the eyes of Nick Carroway, who sees from all perspectives the world of the rich: the hollowness of the Buchanons, the &quot;mask&quot; that Gatsby must wear to attain his goals, the many &quot;acquaintences&quot; of the Gatsby parties who only attend his parties because it serves their own purpose of having a good time.At the heart core of this tale is the question of how far one must go to follow the aquistion of a dream, whether realistic or not. Nick admires Gatsby's determination, but he sees the dangers of Gatsby continuing to follow his dream. However, what Nick learns from Gatsby is the most essential part of the book.This is one of those books that starts off relatively slow, but picks up as we move on. It is set in the mid 1920s and has a few flashback references to Gatsby's former affair with Daisy. Overall I would recommend reading this book if you have never done so. I will admit that I was assigned this book in high school, but never even finished it. When I reread it a few years later, I was pleasantly surprised. I think what you should take from a book like The Great Gatsby is what it says about not only life in the 1920s, but the times we live in now."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of those works both blessed and cursed: blessed to have gained literary immortality, cursed to spend much of that immortality as assigned high school reading. Let's face it: most of us dislike WHATEVER we had to read in high school, regardless of what it was. When I was a senior, I hated this book. But, perhaps in an attempt to prove to myself that I really have grown and matured since that time, I recently took up my old copy of the book and started over again. I must say that not only was I satisfied with the work, but I was BLOWN AWAY! \\"The Great Gatsby\\" in my opinion is well worth all the praise which has been thrown onto it over the years.

If it isn't the finest novel ever written (which I've been known to argue it is) or the finest American novel (which again I've been known to argue it is) or the finest Twentieth Century novel (which, you know the drill), it is the finest crime novel ever written. I read this book annually. Many other crime fiction writers do the same. THE GREAT GATSBY is perfectly constructed, with ambiguities within enigmas, as it recounts the Jazz Age, capturing that era's ambience splendidly. It is a crime novel, yet, as with the best crime novels, crime does not dominate the entire book. At one level, it is the story of a poor boy who dreams of becoming rich and marrying an American golden girl. On another level, it is the story of the American upper crust personified by that golden girl and her polo playing husband. On still another level, it is the story of a young Midwestern gentleman who matures into genuine manhood one summer amid the parties and social events of East and West Eggs in Long Island. It is the Tale of America. No one has told it better than F. Scott Fitzgerald, either before or since. Ever."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Delivering no comforting message or feeling of warmth, The Great Gatsby glitters and dances off the smooth and lively words of F. Scott Fitzgerald. \\"It is a shocking book,\\" wrote Walter Yust, \\"one that reveals incredible grossness, thoughtlessness, polite corruption, without leaving the reader with a sense of depression, without being insidiously provocative.\\" The book is captivating; when the story becomes calm and relaxed, the words themselves remain thrilling as they impel the pages to keep turning. Set in the 1920's, The Great Gatsby explores the life of the wealthy and hopeful J. Gatsby as he pursues his love, Mrs. Daisy Buchanan. Through the narrative of the gentle and level-headed Nick Carraway, we learn to love Gatsby and to loathe those who cause his downfall. Money, love, selfishness, infidelity and misdirected passions are woven together to form a net that ensnares the larger part of the book's characters. \\"Gatsby turned out all right in the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men\\" (pgs. 6,7). Yet, through many understated, despicable acts, there is a light of goodness and hope: Gatsby's hope. It is seen shining brighter than the great and twinkling lights of Gatsby's summer parties. \\"It was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found before in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again\\" (pg. 6). Fitzgerald magnifies the underlying ideas of the novel in each of Daisy's tears and every splashing drop from Gatsby's fountains. When gathered together, the droplets reflect Fitzgerald's own life of money and misfortune as his own wife caused him heartache over an extra-marital affair. Furthermore, Fitzgerald also battled against the troubles of living a lavish life without an incredibly stable income. As the story can be paralleled to Fitzgerald's own life - Gatsby can be paralleled to the ideals of America in the 1920's; a generous visionary with a goal and, also, hopeful enough to pursue his goal. \\"Gatsby believed [in] the future that year by year recedes before us... So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\\" (pg. 189). As time went on, the world around Gatsby changed, and, outwardly, Gatsby changed right along with it. But, inwardly, Gatsby longed for and strived to regain his past, just as so many people of the twenties were torn between the past and the present. The Great Gatsby shows a hero like we have never seen before. A hero who unconsciously battled against an evil force: corruption caused by money. He also, consciously, fought for the sake of his heart as he tried to regain the love of his past. Despite his valiant efforts on both battle fields, Gatsby is trampled over by the effects of the thoughtless, calloused actions of others. With the book thus ending, Gatsby can still be called nothing short of heroic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This remarkable book is one of the chief reasons I am such an avid reader of classic fiction. The reasons for this novel's greatness are unexplainable and somewhat mysterious to me. i.e., I have no idea why I love it so much, but I do! With this masterpiece, I believe that Fitzgerald has captured some unknown and unpracticed form of writing that is seldom equalled. With a style all his own, he took an ordinary, everyday setting and plot, with your average &quot;next door&quot; characters, and created something exceeding extraordinary. Nick, the narrator, has a refreshing, honest way of letting the reader know exactly how Gatsby's story played out, at the same time bringing us, somewhat, into his own life. I found myself sympathizing with Gatsby, and his love for Daisy, as I would with a member of my own family, and even having feelings that weren't present in the book, but that a man in Gatsby's situation would likely have. It is easy to see, however, how one could misunderstand the book, and have a low opinion of it. There are a number of time-line and grammatical errors, but if it is read for what it is, it will be a cherished classic forever."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Contemporary readers likely go into this work expecting the quintessential American novel, and though I found it less than world-changing, I was pleasantly surprised to see it live up to my expectations, a nice combination of lyrical beauty and economical pacing. The tone of the storytelling is fascinatingly whimsical and monumental at the same time. As it satirizes the lifestyle of a group of free-wheeling upper class twenty-somethings partying through a summer on Long Island in the early 1920's, the title character displays an innocent desperation that resonates profoundly, indeed, on the meaning of the &quot;American dream&quot;. My only major qualm involved some apparent contradictions regarding this said character. At the outset Mr. Gatsby is referred to mysteriously as a celebrated self-made man who few can get close to. When we do get close to him, however, he suddenly becomes two-dimensional, a love-crazed sap. I wished Fitzgerald had gone further to make the Gatsby we come to know match up more with the far more complex character we have imagined. However, this problem is minor. Among the many more numerous things to admire, it stands out how Fitzgerald reaps benefits from using an the unconventional narrative style perfectly appropriate only because of the idiosyncrasies of the tale, a terrific example of content dictating form. This is one &quot;classic&quot; you will not regret reading."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I enjoyed reading &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It was a book that really kept me interestd in it with its exciting plot. Chasing dreams and lost loves, love affairs, lavish houses, and big parties make the story exciting. The characters in this novel really draw you into the story. Some are mysterious, some are cruel, some are kind, but they're all interesting in their own way. Their obsession with wealth, chasing after dreams and goals, and wanting to repeat the past gets the characters into a big mess of problems. Not only is it a very good story, but it is also very well written. The book has deeper meanings to it and many symbolisms that make you really get into what you are reading. You would also enjoy this book if you like history because it demonstrates what life was like in the 1920's. The Great Gatsby was a really great book, and I would recomend for people to read it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I am now reading F.Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby for the fifth time. Each time that I read the work, it yields more gold. In many ways this novel is a metaphor for a failed American Dream; however, it is only one possible dream. I am not so cynical(yet) to believe that there is only one dream. Martin Luther King's dream of service to humanity is certainly a viable one that remains. Gatsby's only flaw was that he loved his mental projection of Daisy--his ideal woman. But the Daisy he loved and the real life Daisy were as different as night and day. The real Daisy was shallow,self-centered, and materialistic. Daisy could not love because Daisy was not really a person. Instead, she was a one-dimensional imitiation of a human being; her husband Tom is her male counter-part; neither one is a whole person. Yet, as Nick tells us &quot;They could always retreat into their money.&quot;In many ways, Gatsby has as much relevance today as it did for the twenties. In our super-materialistic, name brand society peolpe are brain-washed into pursuing Daisy-dreams of designer clothes, prestige cars and bigger, better houses.Maybe, Gatsby even has moral and ethical implications: To pursue the empty god of materialism(Daisy) is to choose death. &quot;Gatsby turned out alright in the end.&quot; At least, he found a reason to live and a reason to die(even if it was misguided).The Great Gatsby captures the emptiness of an American Dream."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A short book, a simple story, but Fitzgerald does things with the English language that few human beings have ever been able to do. This novel floats ethereally through the mind and settles in a place where it refuses to be dislodged. It is a pity that it is on almost every high school reading list because it is worth much more than the simple distaste that comes from most required reading. And what might be simple can also be classic. This is one of those books that resonates stronger and stronger with each succesive re-read. The movie (despite Robert Redford's presence) does the book absolutely no justice."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is certainly a period piece that pays tribute to the excess of the 1920s. But more importantly, Fitzgerald's writing style is an excellent model for fiction writers looking for examples on charcter development. The author's descriptions are vivid, enticing, brutally honest, and, as far as I'm concerned, flawless. A beautifully tragic book and a must-read for any serious scholar of American literature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The setting of The Great Gatsby by F.Scott Fitzgerald plays an important role in the development of the novel. The unique way that Fitzgerald never refers to a specific year or era leaves it up for you to decide when you would like the novel to occur. Most people assume that the 1920's would be the most likely time period for the book to take place, but it is just as easy to say it took place in 1990. The way Fitzgerald did this leaves the book for the reader to enjoy as he or she so likes. Fitzgerald did, however, describe some of the setting. The West Egg and East Egg are perfect examples of this. He does not go into great depth to describe the shapes, colors, and proportions of these locations, but rather the characters surrounding them. During most of the book the characters you follow show you the atmosphere they are in, again leaving it up to the reader to chose how these places look. Fitzgerald's writing technique leaves it open for the reader to use their imagination more than any other book I have ever read. Usually when comparing a movie from a book I can think in my mind what I thought was similar and different. However, this book made it hard for me to disagree or agree with any of the scenes in the movie because Fitzgerald left it so wide open. Overall I think it was the best way to do it!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald looks into the hearts of his characters with such accuracy that you actually taste their pain when their glass shells are smashed. By the same token, you may never look at yourself in the same way again.

Symbolism is prevelant throughout the book, so read carefully! The characters show the shallowness of people, and the idea that money buys everything...even love is hinted at throughout the novel. A definite must read. For those who read it at a young age, read it over again, you won't regret it. I read it sophomore year and I also thought it was a &quot;soap opera,&quot; but now _The Great Gatsby_ is my favorite book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is probably one of the best novels of its time in the sense that it depicts the disillusionment of the Jazz Age to a tee! Gatsby's love for Daisy is not &quot;love&quot; in the sense that you or I know, but a kind of sick perversion or more aptly put - the inability for him to come to terms with his past. The need to have money and the need to be known in the Jazz Age is forever present in the book, and, from what we know of Gatsby's past, is something that Gatsby strove for his entire life. The reason his love affair with Daisy failed was because he had nothing! Love was not enough for Daisy in the relationship, and *her&quot; disillusionment was with her need for material possessions: money, cars, fancy dresses, fabulous parties, etc. I find the role of Nick in the entire novel to be somewhat strange since I think that it would have been a good story without his presence, and my favorite part of the book is when he realizes it is his birthday - as if that is something one can forget. Gatsby's death at the end is envitable since I think the book comes full circle. Gatsby is violently awakened, and, perhaps, never realizes his disillusionment. I think though the end of the book reinforces this sense of disillusionment with the American dream when Nick sums up his encounter with Daisy and her husband. They apparently carry on as if nothing had happened, Dasiy doesn't leave Tom, and Gatsby's &quot;role&quot; as a martyr is ignored. Not even the death of Daisy's former love could bring her out of her disillusioned state. Of course there are many other themes - the relationship between Daisy and Gatsby, the mysterious glasses which recurs throughout the novel and many more... All in all...a very good book historically, sociologically, and psychologically. I've read it at least four times and will probably read it many more times!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As I was reading through the other reviews, I noticed something.

The reason (as I believe itto be) is that the Gatsby shows characteristics that we allhave inside of ourselves, that all our descendants will have, and that all ourancestors had. We all havea yearning to return to the past and to avoid the mistakes that we made. To return to theGarden, and avoid giving into temptation. To find a new land(i.e. America) and have a new beginning (as the dutch sailorstried to do and as Gatsby fails at). We all believe in the Myth of Edenic possibilities(the belief that one can return to his/her past and avoid themistakes that they made) and so does Gatsby. But that's not theentire reason readers are fascinated with Gatsby. Throughout the entire novel, F. ScottFitzgerald debunks the American Dream of going west to startover. He does so by having Gatsby go east, and making it sothat he can't be successful without going outside the law. But throughout the novel,Gatsby never gives up. He's like the man who was standingin the trash after one of Gatsby's parties. Just as this manrefused to acknowlege that he couldn't live in the past, so Gatsby refuses. Gatsby refuses toacknowlege that he can't go back to when he first met Daisy, before she marriedTom. There is a lot more to this book than what others havesaid, and there is still a lot more than what I have outlined. Although, I hope that thiswill allow some people to realize that The GreatGatsby is more than just a love story between two people. Everytime I read it (I've read it at least 5 times), I pick up new symbols and archetypeswhich allow me to see this masterpiece through new lenses.It truly is an American Classic, which everyone should read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As an English major I've come across numerous examples of excellent literature. Fitzgerald's _The Great Gatsby_ is, in my opinion, THE definitive American literary classic. The author's use of language, characterization, and subtle symbolism is simply amazing! The last line of this novel has become one of the most hauntingly beautiful lines in literary history. Do yourself a great favor and read this novel--my highest possible praises!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is the best short novel of the twentieth-century.

That's about it. The love story is kinda wishy washy and the ending is a downer.At least I can say I read it.*****This is a review of the kindle version of the book. $11.99 I paid for this book. This old book that was written in the 1950's. Why would publisher's raise the price on this? Also, there is no audible speech for this book. $11.99 and I can't plug it in and listen to the story while I am driving?The publishers should rethink their price for this book and enable the audio."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I don't really need to review the actual book.

That's not really Amazon's fault, but the publisher really needs to update it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I recently re-read this after having first encountered it 14 years ago. What amazed me is how so many of Fitzgerald's phrasings remained with me during that time. It was like the story and the characters were timeless. My perspective on some of the individuals, however, did change. As a younger person, I saw Daisy as a more innocent actor in the final tragedy. As an older person, I recognize her silent complicity in evil. Years ago, I also saw Nick as naive. This time, I recognized that, in many ways, he grows throughout the story and becomes a good man.This is the first book in my lifetime that I've re-read. Based on the experience, I imagine I'll be doing it again and again with books I read as a younger person."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I'm assuming this book is considered a classic. I don't read the classics that often, so I wouldn't know. But anyway, I've heard of this one all my life, and watched part of the movie a couple times, I think. The other day, it so happened I was in the mood for literary fiction, and already having an armchair historian's interest in the 1920s, I waded in.Story-wise, I didn't quite know what to expect. Turns out, the plot is an age-old standard about a poor boy's devotion to a privileged girl. Thrown into the mix is a rags-to-riches theme, a couple intersecting love triangles, the futility of material ambitions, the disease of wealth and much analytical fodder for social anthropologists.Gatsby is great, as I see it, only in his heroic determination in conquering the world (well, financially conquering a significant piece of it, anyway) to win the heart of the narrator's cousin, Daisy. Daisy is one of those girls who is fun and bubbly at casual social events, held at arm's distance. Under her attractive surface, however, is a shallow, vapid conformist hardly worth the efforts Gatsby has labored at to ascend to her snobby caste. Daisy's hypocritical two-timing blowhard husband is even less likable. Though Gatsby has amassed his wealth by extra-legal means, he was by far the most sympathetic character for me, even without the poignant destiny.I don't know if this was considered light reading in 1925, but today Fitzgerald's prose would befuddle all but the most literate. Not to say he meanders into introspective tedium as James Jones did 30 years later. Fitzgerald reminds me of Victorian-era authors who spent considerable time spelling out their observations of subtle human nuances/intuiting/speculating about the cognitive patterns they translated to. It's actually enjoyable, and didn't tax my 21st Century attention span too often. It was obvious, however, that F. Scott's favorite word was \\"vitality.\\"There is a murder, of sorts, in this novel, but the mystery that makes it worthwhile is the title character."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I thought the book would be a in a little better shape, but it is still in its binding so I guess that's okay, thank you for the speedy shipping."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"At the instigation of an Amazon friend, I am about to read a noted novel of the Jazz Age, \\"Manhattan Transfer\\", by John Dos Passos. Before doing so, however, I decided to re-read what is commonly regarded as THE novel of the Jazz Age, THE GREAT GATSBY, which not too long ago I had proposed to another Amazon friend as one of the ten best American novels. I did so based on having read it in high school and then, over the years, having from time to time heard it nominated as \\"The Great American Novel\\".Well, upon re-reading it, I now would dispute it as THE great American novel and I no longer would propose it as one of the ten best. For one thing, it is somewhat superficial. For another, it does not really hang together. For a third, its characters tend towards the one-dimensional. (But then, its author was only 29 when he wrote it.) But, despite its flaws, THE GREAT GATSBY is powerful. There is something mythical about it. And it is a distinctively American myth - about mammon and materialism; dreams and desires; craving and crassness. And it ends in operatic tragedy. So even if it is NOT one of the ten best American novels, it IS quite possibly one of the ten best novels ABOUT America - perhaps not America as many of us would like to envision it, but America nonetheless."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"After about a million name drops, Facebook reading tests and dopey confusion with Marsden's the Great Gatenby, I finally read Gatsby over a Saturday afternoon.Mixed reactions. Certainly set in an unusual time for the setting of a novel - the jazz age apparently - the time after the Great War, but before the Great Depression. It's odd for an author to focus on a time not automatically associated with great strife and suffering.Or so I thought. What struck me most about Gatsby was Fitzgerald's portrayal of opulence was filled with this desperate hopelessness and lack of morality, a theme which carried right up to the end of the novel.I'm no great literature connoisseur, however to me the balance of Gatsby was a little rushed. Almost everything about the setting and the characters of the novel were well set up. Our narrator Nick's earnest disposition, his friend Tom's darkness and Gatsby's mad optimism. However when the action truly started in felt like it was all over in a second.Nonetheless, I will say the Great Gatsby has a unique flavour to it, quite unlike anything you will read today, and in a market where literature seems to mean languishing for endless pages over every detail, a novel where we as readers are thrown about in sudden events makes for pretty compelling reading."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I love the way he writes.

The story is timeless and the characters beautifully developed. It's been my favorite book since college."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is a true masterpiece with a wonderful plot and incredible artistry of language which opens up the roaring 20s era in all its glory. This is not only a love story of the rich Jay Gatsby and the glorious Daisy Buchanan, this is the epitomy of all which that time period stands for. Fitzgerald paints an era where money and status were the true faces of the American society and people were defined by their glamourous houses, expensive clothes, and lavish habits. It was the era of the parties lasting until dawn, the era of nightlife and gossip. But it was also a very unsteady era where that green light which could bring you up to the top of the mountain could just as well make you fall from grace. Nevertheless, one finds himself hoping that \\"one fine morning...\\"I was never forced to read the Great Gatsby in school but reading it now I know instantly that this will be one of my favorites and I will read it many more times because one time is not enough to understand all of its levels and fully appreciate this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald captures the yearnings of a man's heart, no his very soul, in the pages of The Great Gatsby.

I thought that the author could have gone a little more in depth with each character. There is a good amount of symbolism in the story though so it's good if you want something to think about.I know it seems like I am putting the novel down but actually I do recomend reading it. I think you will really enjoy it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Why is ' The Great Gatsby' so loved? Why is it so popular ? Why do literary critics value it so highly ?I will venture a few speculations without providing of course a definitive answer.One is that it is simply a beautifully written work. The tone the voice from the very beginning have a charm an appeal that draws us.Secondly, the book is about glamorous American, about money and success, great American themes.Thirdly, it's more deep theme is the theme of dream, also American dream, and reality. It is the green light of the great American future, it is the dream of young American making himself over into his own ideal. It is the American theme of the self- made man, the American dream story from Franklin on.Fourthly, it is the charm of Romance and great wealth.Fifthly, Fitzgerald's remarkable ability to create or capture an atmosphere, a feeling of time, of a special kind of American world. Consider the way he describes Grand Central Station or the trip out to the West, or the two Eggs of Long Island.It is about human loneliness and abandonment. The great scene of the aftermath, of Gatsby's home , of no one coming to the funeral except that one belated guest of the never- ending party.There is too the famous list of characters at the Gatsby party, a satirical list of America's social- climbing reality.And again the great dream and romance. Of the new continent opening before us. Of the American hero whose very dreaming is his greatness and romantic quality . And the failure too and the tragedy of Gatsby's fall. And the veniality and trivality of the American reality which contradicts and confounds the dream. The sordidness by which Tom Buchannan and his mistress bring Gatsby and Daisy down.And the final so American note of still seeking the new and better world, the great dream ahead .A work which simply holds it readers in its very special charm and grace, the quintessential American embrace.Out to the territory ahead of us, the green light , the orgiastic future a man's got to live and dream by."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a story that consists of a lot of drama dealing with life, love, and social status. Each characters personalities and behavior is an example of every human beings temptations, flaws, wants, and desires. F. Scott Fitzgerald created the book The Great Gatsby in a way where it symbolizes a typical human being. Each character shows a human flaw, our arrogance, needs, wants, and temptations within life. He describes the steps we use to get there and how we try to be on top to achieve things.Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Jordan, Myrtle, and George are images of an idealistic American life. The way Daisy and her other family live is full of riches and never a day full of work. At the beginning of the book, Daisy admitted to herself that the things nobles do, like go on picnics, was a rather odd thing. That alone was a big point in the book because she segregated herself from the commoners. That proved that she thinks of herself of being different. Also, Gatsby, Daisy, and Myrtle all ends up having an affair in the book. The affair leads to unfortunate endings and a twisted story line.Overall, the book was great. Not only was it a great read, it had a great plot and the way the book was organized was spectacular. Fitzgerald not only wrote a great story, but he created a book that got in depth with the American society and the way we chase after our dreams. Making us realize that sometimes, no matter where time brings us too we cannot turn back time and live in the past. All that you can do is move on and be who you are, accepting the future and taking grasp of it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I believe this novel would be good for everyone to read. From affairs to murders, The Great Gatsby has it all. At times it can get confussing with most of the characters either dating or cheating on their spouse. It also can be slow at times because Fitzgerald goes into alot of detail with his descriptions. This novel shows how people may think someone is so lucky to be great and well off, but in the end, they may not be geat afterall. This novel is very interesting and leaves the reader with the question,\\"What would I do in that situation?\\""},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This review relates to the first Scribner trade paperback edition, 2003, of the corrected text authorized by the estate of the author. It includes a preface and notes by Matthew J. Bruccoli, a publisher's afterward, a drawn map of the story site and a brief Fitzgerald biography.The green light in THE GREAT GATSBY is probably the most frequently cited example of \\"objective correlative\\" in fiction. T. S. Eliot coined the phrase objective correlative for the author's device of describing an object so that it reveals an emotional state, but without explicitly linking the object and the emotion in the narrative.Fitzgerald mentioned the green light three times in the novel. On page 26, when Nick is observing Gatsby gazing across the bay between East Egg and West Egg, Nick involuntarily glances seaward and distinguishes \\"nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.\\" On page 98, Gatsby says to Daisy, \\"You always have a green light that burns at the end of your dock.\\" Finally, on page 189, at the end of the story, Nick the narrator tells us \\"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic* future that year by year recedes before us.\\" By then, the reader understands that the green light correlates to Gatsby's distracted longing for Daisy.*In his afterword, Mr. Bruccoli claims that Fitzgerald purposely used \\"orgastic\\" instead of \\"orgiastic.\\" The Encarta dictionary accepts orgastic, but not the Microsoft Word spell checker or my WordWeb Thesaurus.For those interested in a timeline, do a Google search on: \\"last day of summer,\\" 1922, Gatsby. The results should be two hits, both good timelines. The one on geocities has at least one error, however; it has Cody dieing in 1910 instead of five years later.I found 113 proper names of persons, some only given names, some only surnames in the story. Of these, 74 are names of Gatsby's guests listed on pages 65 - 67. Fitzgerald mentions only two of those guests later in the story. He does not give \\"Owl Eyes\\" a proper name, but he figures as a significant character."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Quite simply, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is F. Scott Fitzgerald's tour de force.It ranks among the most literate works of the twentieth century.This story of the man who reinvents himself to win the woman he loves is multi-layered and laced with analogy upon analogy.It is more than just a love story. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is an indictment of the Jazz Age, new money and the shallow and selfish excesses that often accompany it.Jay Gatsby is a true mystery man.Even by novel's end he remains a shadowy figure lacking in substance or apparent texture.He is as much a mystery to the reader as he is to his associates and neighbours in the East Egg social set.Despite its numerous sub-texts, The Great Gatsby is ultimately a warning that, try as we may, we will never escape our pasts and that who we were is who we are."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is indeed a great book. Great books and authors are much like children, each one is both different and special, with different flaws and strenghs. To truly appreciate the unique beauty of Gatsby, you have to look in the right place.The tone of Gatsby is that of a man who is filled with a longing for a woman and a dream that he is driven to pursue. Gatsby is torn by his knowlege of the transparency of his illusive dream and his his obsessive need to conquer it.I do not admire chasing illusive dreams,I admire the courage to dream and the incredible drive it takes to chase the dream -- the power of his spirit and the courage that he shows when he holds nothing back in his quest, risking everything. It takes a brave hearted man to soar to remarkable heights only to crash to the ground, when the common man hugs the ground instead.

Fitzgerald's fantastic style and flair completely engulf the reader, and lets you fall in love with the characters.I'd like to point out one thing. i read this in an English 11 class, and while some high schoolers may fail to understand much of it, I took so much from this book. perhaps it is the way in which the teacher presented it and developed it in class (assigning each character to a student along with many perspectives on symbols in the book - colors, parties, etc) Everything in this book fascinated me - the characters, the parties, the colors, and so many other things - I was nearly overwhelmed. I recommend it to anyone who can look past the outer shell and see the symbolic meaning and theme of this novel.ALso, I'd like to question the review by Aaron Goldberg. He criticized Tom for being a racist. He's intended to appear that way, it's the way many people in the 1920's thought, and it remains today. I don't understand how calling Wolfshiem a &quot;small, flat-nosed Jew&quot; is racist, if it is merely the description of a character. he's got a flat nose - that's racist? And the fact that TGG and DB never get together? It';s tragic, it's supoposed to show that all the money and wealth in the world cannot ensure you happiness, and to not let missed opportunities of the past bog you down in the future. And as for a &quot;dated&quot; book? That's the purpose, it is set in the 1920s, Fitzgerald wrote it in near-pefrect sync with the era.Some people just confuse me when they cannot look deeper into a book and hrasp literary concepts such as setting, irony, and symbolism.Anyway, read this book! It's a great!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I just enetered the 9th grade and, as a requirement, i had to read 4 books over the summer. After a visit to the book store and a chat with a salesperson i decided on The Bean Trees, Of Mice and Men, Cold Sassy Tree, and, The Great Gatsby. As a teenager i am insulted at the thought that we(teenagers) can't fully appreciate this book and would simply pass it of as trash and refuse to read it. I LOVED IT!!! and I have at least 3 friends who agree with me. We were all able to understand and discuss the book and found no cause for complaint. I would read it again in an instant. Just because i'm a teenager doesn't make me any less literate than the next 20 something year old."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When I first read some of the reviews that stated that high school students could not appreciate the boor, or that they were not sophisticated readers I laughed. I remeber reading the book in high school and loving it, disecting it, reading critical studies and articles on Gatsby. But, after reading one of the reviews that discussed Tom's racism, anti-semitism, etc. and failure in chronology I am now inclined to agree that the book may go beyond some high school students, and in a their zeal to deconstruct a text before having any of the proper background, maturity or tools can not appreciate what is one of the finest American works ever written. The mistakes in chronology are minor and insignificant to the point and power of Fitzgerald's work. The racism is a crucial aspect in Tom's character. And rather than going on to explain why I suggest that any high schooler who misses this takes another reviewers suggestion and try again a few yeras later. No one has to like this book, but there is a reason that this may be the &quot;Great American Novel&quot; and if you don't understand that you may need to wait a few years."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It is Mr. Fitzgerlad's great misfortune to find that his acknowledgement as one of this young country's few authentic literary masters should be to have his work forced upon millions of the nation's TV reared, comic book-glutted High School students. Wholly unprepared to see the author's work in a cultural or artistic context (for to do that they would have had to read legitimate novels in the past), they doubtless rush for the Cliffs notes or else plagiarize reviews in abetting encyclopaedias for their sham book reports. This sacrilege is as nothing, though, when compared to the frustrating denunciations of &quot;right-thinking&quot; young people who, ignorant of changing historical and cultural trends, can't understand why Fitzgerald had his characters express themselves as people really spoke and NOT according to the politically correct scripts that are so common nowadays in the hangover after the nightmare illusion of Free Speech."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read these &quot;reviews&quot; of an American masterpiece where people are comparing the Great Gatsby to a soap opera when the story is so much more epic than the brainwashed masses who sit in front of TVs can recognize. First of all, it was written before soap operas so how could it be unoriginal. Second, its lyrical prose is among the best of any novels. Third, it is boring and pointless only to those idiots who want car chases, explosions, sex, and moronic dialogue about 70s pop culture. This book is amazing."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"At first I didn't want anything to do with this book. It was assigned as summer reading for my American Studies class. Before reading the book, I came online &amp; read some of the reviews it received. I saw that a lot people thought this book was excellent. Well I have to agree with them. Fitzgerald moves a little slow in the beginning, but this story is so romantic and it didn't bore me at all."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Another of the golden oldies.I found that this one was quite slow in places and also that the storyline to be pretty average.Worth a read on a rainy afternoon though if you have nothing else planned."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This was a quick read, akin to reading an Agatha Christy book only with fastest cars.

I highly recommend it as well."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Its easy to see why this is considered a classic of American literature. Historians see it as a mirror of those who lived during the Jazz Age. To me at a deeper level, it deals with the issue of what you want in life or out of life, and what you do when you find you can't get it, and you realize you can't. And, no amount of money or power or friends can get you there. To those peers living during the self-indulgent Jazz Age, the Great Gatsby speaks prophetically about the realiy of not finding satisfaction through indulging. The way to realization of goals is to be ethical and principled. The only one in the book who is that and is thus the hero turns out not to be Gatsby, not matter how great, but the narrator who is the &#34;least among these&#34;, telling the story and is a distant observer of those caught in the chase. Anyone contemplating setting out on life's journey to find fame and fortune ought to consult the Great Gatsby before going too far down the road."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Regardless of whether you like F.Scott Fitzgerald you'll find this period piece strangely contemporary. A must read American classic! The perfect gift for students!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"To me, one of the most depressing things about grad school was reading through great works of literature, finding one that I really loved, digging up criticism and scholarship about it so I could write my double-spaced ode to The Sound and the Fury or War and Peace or whatever... and discovering that the book was all used up.There was nothing I could possibly say about it that would be new. Every possible thought and conclusion had long since been had by dozens of other, more qualified people. Every minor character and allusion was already the subject of half a dozen moldering dissertations. Sure, I went ahead and wrote my little paper, but it didn't add anything to Timeless Academia's conversation on the subject.The Great Gatsby is one of those books. I can't say anything about it that hasn't been said hundreds of times before, and neither can you.But lately, I've been having the most fun with these old books when I can arrange to read them with relatively new people. It's kind of wonderful to read alongside someone who's not had \\"Great American novel\\" tattooed under their eyelids, who isn't swallowing bile at the thought of churning out a five-paragraph essay at the end of it all - who still has room for virginal surprise and wonder and disgust as they turn the pages.I'm finding this mix of old book, new reader especially satisfying with Gatsby. You get that sense from the city itself: in the summer of 1922, everything is so new and extravagant and full of spectacle that a person could forget just how old and worn-down the world really is.So there it is, my one halfway original thought: if it's been awhile since 11th-grade English and you'd like to try this book again, see if you can get a fresh companion to take you to one of Gatsby's parties. They are really quite something."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The first time i read this book iwas bored because i didnt fully understand how Fitzgerald conveyed the plot of the story. But now i have read it again with a more mature state of mind I really find it like a soap oprah... there was evidence of gossip that placed a &#34;umph&#34; to the supension I had when reading. The love story between Daisy and Gatsby, with Nick and Jordon, Tom and Myrtle, and Daisy too, interuptions not to mention their individual ives, and how FItzgerald cleverly used elements of prose and literary devices, to convey confusion and suspense highlights the fact that this story was well written and will remain one of the best years to come."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"An interesting story about that time in history when there was great wealth. A great nation of people that had much and were bored. Some with not so much trying to get ahead."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I decided to finally re-read The Great Gatsby since I only read the cliff notes edition back in high school :) Great story, really transplants you right in the thick of things - 1920's New York City glamor."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It was fun to re-read this book after so many years (won't get into how many years)! Our book group read it now since the newest version of the movie is due out in early 2013. Re-reading it now plus having recently seen the 1974 version (with Robert Redford as Gatsby) helped clarify so much of the book that I missed when I was younger. It makes it clear why it is considered an American classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald hit the nail on the head in this book when he makes a scathing comment on popularity. He portrays popularity as a fleeting status in this book. Gatsby is the center of attention in his life with huge parties and a grandios lifestyle, but when he passes on, only a few good freinds show up at his funeral. A great book from an author who was never fully appreciated in his time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It is very difficult for me to understand why the average rating given The Great Gatsby by reviewers isn't five stars. In my view this is one of the greatest novels ever written -- perhaps even THE great American novel. This book is so well written that it would be a pleasure to read even if it didn't have a plot. But it does have a plot -- one that is both well constructed and quintessentially American -- as well as characters so well-developed one feels that one knows them. If you haven't read the Great Gatsby yet, please do so -- and find out how good truly great writing can be."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This was an excellent book. It captured the readers attention from the start and kept you clinging to the fascinating storyline. It displayed true human character, without trying to sound impressive. A simple, yet understated work of fiction. One of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The American Dream--as it arose in the Colonial period and developed in the nineteenth century--was based on the assumption that each person, no matter what his origins, could succeed in life on the sole basis of his or her own skill and effort. The dream was embodied in the ideal of the self-made man, just as it was embodied in Fitzgerald's own family by his grandfather, P. F. McQuillan.The Great Gatsby is a novel about what happened to the American dream in the 1920s, a period when the old values that gave substance to the dream had been corrupted by the vulgar pursuit of wealth. The characters are Midwesterners who have come East in pursuit of this new dream of money, fame, success, glamour, and excitement. Tom and Daisy must have a huge house, a stable of polo ponies, and friends in Europe. Gatsby must have his enormous mansion before he can feel confident enough to try to win Daisy.What Fitzgerald seems to be criticizing in The Great Gatsby is not the American Dream itself but the corruption of the American Dream. What was once--for Ben Franklin, for example, or Thomas Jefferson--a belief in self-reliance and hard work has become what Nick Carraway calls \\"...the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty.\\" The energy that might have gone into the pursuit of noble goals has been channeled into the pursuit of power and pleasure, and a very showy, but fundamentally empty form of success."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The vitality, innocence and ambition of our heroes, the shallow pleasures of material success, the ennui of the rich, the tragedy of failed love, racism, the failure of the rule of law, the lack of respect for real virtue and sacrifice; this all sounds like America to me.Add drug dealing, the NFL, Vietnam and better electronics and the plot could easily make decades disappear. And we believe that we have a culture with &quot;constant change&quot;.This is as close to 'our story' as anything I have ever read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is, by my standards, the best novel written in tha States during the last century. It is a sad love story, but at the same time is a reflection of the inexistence of the second chance. The characters are rich and beatiful, but dark and condemed. Since I read The Great Gastby, I have never been able to see the past naively."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I really liked this. It's short and simple, beautifully descriptive and carries within it the weight of great devotion and tragedy. It's a book one would call a work of art. I would read this for a taste of the fabulous lifestyle of the rich, decadent and charming in New York at the height of the Roaring 20s. Also, for Gatsby's utter devotion to a lost dream, the depth and the consequence of such a devotion.If anything, I felt the characters of Nick Carraway (narrator) and Jordan Baker weren't built up enough. Fitzgerald's method of description wasn't too much to my taste either. It was rather amusing when at one point, within the same conversation, he uses &quot;inquired Jordan humorously ... said Jordan helpfully ... snorted Tom contemptuously ... demanded Jordan crossly&quot;."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"From what I understand, this book is considered by those in the know to be among the very greatest of American novels, and the most important American novel of the 20th Century. I don't really think it deserves such high praise. Although it is a penetrating look at 20's life- in all its excess- the book falls short on plot and substance. Sure there are greater meanings (don't forget that green light) but reading it is not the pleasure it could be for me. Perhaps I feel this way because I find that much of the writing, especially the dialogue, is still very much ingrained in 1920's culture. Thus, I find it hard to see how it is so timeless in the minds of so many people. So, I personally would give 3 stars but its &quot;greatness&quot; has got to be 5. I will settle with 4."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Mariangeles, why are you so upset?

It was only after I had finished the book and began to relect on what I had read that I understood why it has become such a classic. This book should be a requirement for anyone taking an English class. Gatsby is guilty of what we all are guilty of at one time or another. Idealism.

I pitied Gatsby, was annoyed with Daisy, aggravated with Tom, irritated about Jordan, and admired Nick.

A wonderful read - I recommend."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When asked what the 'Great American Novel' is, nine times out of ten you'll hear either Twain's Huck Finn or Fitzgerald's Gatsby (one out of ten times you'll hear Kerouac's On the Road). And if this isn't _THE_ Great American Novel, then it comes close to being so. It's a simple story of a love triange. But it is so much more than that. Fitzgerald captures the period of The Jazz Age, and is considered to a certain degree, a social historian, by himself if no one else. What strikes me most about this book is the voice Fitzgerald uses to tell the story. There are a handful of narrators in American fiction whose voice stands out as so good, that it lifts the story above being merely good. Examples are Huck Finn, Holden Caufield, and Nick Carroway."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I enjoyed this book. The descriptions were lovely and rich, and Fitzgerald really captured life and put it in this book. It is about a midwesterner named Nick who goes to New York and meets several characters including the rich nextdoor neighbor Jay Gatsby. It then shows the progression of all of these people's relationships until the climax of the book.My only gripe would be that the characters are quite unlikeable. You can't relate to them. You can't sympathize with them. It's not that they're thinly drawn. They're not flat and two dimensional. One simply has to dislike all of these characters, though! The book would be perfect if I could at least have one character to hang on to, so to speak. Maybe see myself in. Despite that I still have to say it was an exceptional book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I began The Great Gatsby with extremely high hopes of the great American novel. In truth, while well done, Gatsby is not as exceptional as many would have you believe. I think perhaps people have gotten to the point of lauding this book simply because it is the popular thing to do. I found it rather disjointed and mildly slow but the quote of the &quot;orgastic future&quot; and the &quot;mouth full of money&quot; are unforgettable and might be worth reading the book by themselves."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Book is filled with tons of symbolism but you may have to read it more than once to get it. You must take your time to really figure out the characters and their intentions."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The story was beautifully written but yet is so terribly tragic. Gatsby's desperate attempt to win Daisy's heart is so terribly vapid. Gatsby is a man with so little content, but yet so many complexities. Fitzgerald's writing style is so brilliant with the description of life on New York's Long Island. The shallowness and pure moral emptiness of the characters resonates throughout the novel. Gatsby dies for his own criminal sins, but also for the sins of the party goers. Fitzgerald voyeuristically brings the reader along on a joyride with Gatsby as his life spirals out of control. His murder stops the joyride not only for the party goers but for the readers as well. The lack of attendance at his funeral shows that he had no true friends, but that everybody, excluding the narrator, used Gatsby only for his money. The people of Long Island, including Daisy, are slaves to Mammon and this sickens Fitzgerald to the core. Fitzgerald through Gatsby questions American values, but American society in general. God in Long Island is replaced by advertising bill boards for eye doctors. The writing style is splendid and the story is captivating yet saddening. Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is the greatest novel of the 1920's, and top five all-time in American literature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Can't identify good literature when they see it. Fitzgerald masterfully pulls off second-person narration. He crafted each sentence to create one legendary masterpiece.

As a junior in high school, my class read this book which I thought was going to be the typical boring English book but it is truly a well-written work.I believed the book starts out pretty slow but as reader gets deeper and deeper into the book, they can find mystery, intrigue, romance, and other subplots. Readers can find the mystery which surrounds Gatsby. He only reveals bits and pieces about his past which leaves the reader to speculate some things about him. The intrigue and romance mingle into the odd love relationships of Tom, Daisy, Gatsby, and Myrtle. Did Daisy truly love Gatsby? Does Tom even care about his mistress Myrtle? All the confusion will make a head-on-collision toward the end of the book.So even if you do not get any of that symbolism or delve deeper into the novel, it's still worthwhile to read this American classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"if the book doesn't immediately grab you, it soon will.amazing. too bad that in his time, fitzgerald didn't get the credit he so richly deserved."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book was incredibly interesting.

Instead of coating every page with out of place symbols or stupid dialogue, it worked on the art of telling a good story and letting the reader learn his message from that.

There is some immaturity that comes through in the forced density of the metahpors, but they are like pale and faint freckles on the cheek of Aphrodite, if you will. Fitzgerald manages to keep the significance and literary integrity of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; intact, while setting it in one of the most intriguing, romantic, and dramatic stories in American literature. Most of the criticism of this book comes from people who don't look deeply enough into the symbolism of every excruciating detail -- nearly all of which were consciously refined to the point of near perfection in Fitzgerald's many drafts."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Attending Princeton, F. Scott Fitzgerald was one of the most gifted authors of the 20th century. The Great Gatsby is the American Bible. As the United States takes an even larger part in history, The Great Gatsby becomes more and more important. It is one of the finest pieces of fiction ever produced."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Gatsby is a great book because it captures a certain age -- youth in the Jazz Age -- so well. Even though it was written 80 years ago it seems fresh today. The only comtemporary novel that comes close is Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, which even includes a reference to the similarity between youth culture in the 20's and today. How much has really changed? Read these two great books and compare -- great writing that deserves the highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"By avoiding period references, Fitzgerald's brief fable of doomed love and the American psyche takes on a dream-like, ageless quality. His attention to details of characterization, rather than setting, avoid dating the book and help give Gatsby as much significance in our time as it had in the Roaring 20's.Reading this novel, one is struck by the references to disturbing trends in our own times: the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; and their desperate search for meaning in their lives, shady fortunes won and lost on the stock market overnight, andthe frenzied quest for personal satisfaction while ignoring the needs of those around us.Yet Gatsby is redeemed -- as we all are, as America has been for over 200 years -- by his belief in a better future, a perfect life that is always just around the corner. It is this quality which ultimately makes us understand and love Jay Gatsby. It is most certainly what draws me back to this slim, quiet book year after year,with so many other bigger, louder books clamoring to be read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I like to think of myself as an open-minded person, willing to embrace any good story that comes into my life, as long as there is some meaning behind it. Hell, there doesn't even have to be a profoundly deep meaning hidden within a novel for me to like it, just as long as there is some redeeming value to it all. The Great Gatsby has neither enjoyment nor meaning, despite what all the critics and analysts may think. Of course, that is only my opinion and I can't tell others what to think.When I began reading The Great Gatsby, my opinion of it was entirely neutral, (as it goes with every novel I read). I knew that it was considered a masterpiece. I saw that it was number two on the Modern Library's 100 greatest novels. Yet, I didn't roll into my reading with extremely high expectations; I just let the book speak for itself, as the pages unfolded in front of my eyes.The Great Gatsby is told from the point of view of Nick Callaway, a middle class man who moves back East into a wealthy neighborhood. The book opens with him at his cousin's house. A small get together is in progress, and we are introduced to some of the main characters. We meet Tom, an athletic, hot tempered, adulterous man. We meet Daisy, Tom's wife, a cheerful and rather innocent girl. Finally, we meet Jordan. Jordan is Daisy's good friend, a rather gossipy and dishonest woman. They drone on about nothing in particular and the first scene ends.In the scenes that follow we encounter Jay Gatsby, who is supposedly the hero of the story. He is the American Dream. He is the typical \\"rags to riches\\" story some of us might envy. He is a very mysterious man, and rumors fly in every which way about him. Rumors such as how he inquired his money and where he came from. He throws large parties and invites Nick to them, along with countless other shallow people whom Gatsby has no interest in.The reason Gatsby engages in all these parties and hoopla, is an attempt to win back the love of his past, Daisy, (Tom's wife). He has acquired all this money and attempts to take her from her husband Tom. Tom, meanwhile, has a mistress across town that he uses for sex and is quite abusive towards.Well, all the parties and conversations eventually lead up to the climax at the end of the novel. I won't reveal too much except for the fact that a lot of sparks fly between Tom, Daisy, Tom's mistress (Mrs. Wilson) and the mistress's husband, Mr. Wilson. If I were to say anything else it might ruin it for you. Although by that time, if you are like me, you won't really care. The narrator, Nick, meanwhile just fades into the background and tells us the story in an offhanded kind of manner.The Great Gatsby fails on so many levels. I don't know where to start. The novel is supposed to be highly symbolic. I have nothing against symbolic novels, I usually adore them, but in this case it was different. I read the Cliff Notes and it still did not change my opinion. What good are symbols when their meaning doesn't really add to the depth or meaning of the story?Another major failure is the dismal writing style. I couldn't stand it. To me, it seemed Fitzgerald just wanted to show off his vocabulary. I don't have a problem with that, but he mixes words together in a rather strange and incoherent fashion, which does not make a whole lot of sense or add any power whatsoever to the story. Another failure: The characters are extremely one dimensional. I didn't feel like I really knew any of them by the time the novel was complete, and I certainly did not care about them.That brings me to my final failure of the novel that I will mention: the ending. I have said this in other reviews I have written. How am I or why should I care when tragic events occur to characters that I don't even care about? It is impossible. I really didn't care about anyone in this book, because the author did not shape and mold them into the vivid, memorable characters we read about in so many other masterpieces. Endings like this always worsen the overall credibility of a novel when adequate preparation has not been put in place, as if the author is trying to manipulate us into thinking how grand of an ending it was. Tragedies are great, if they have been properly framed and constructed from the beginning of the novel.The Great Gatsby has been said to mean things varying from \\"Social Stratification\\" to \\"Religion\\", to the seven deadly sins, and so on. Rest assured that I don't rely on others to tell me whether or not a novel is great. I did not hate this book, but as a \\"classic\\", it fails miserably, and it was not enjoyable to read. In my eyes, it is a shame that a book so mediocre can place number two on any list, let alone be considered one of the greatest books of all times. If I had to some up The Great Gatsby in one word, it would be \\"empty.\\" If I could have one more word it would be \\"hollow.\\" You be the judge. The only thing more mysterious than Jay Gatsby, and his infamous title, is the fact that this tale could be considered great by anyone.Grade: C-"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Reading the negative reviews of this book depresses me. What is it about high school education that makes kids hate books? How can we stop this? &quot;In my younger and more vulnerable years...&quot;It's especially sad because The Great Gatsby is a wonderfully written tragedy. Gatsby and his doomed love for Daisy is cast against the deco backdrop of roaring 20's New York, which is vividly rendered by Fitzgerald. It is a period piece, and there are things that are definitely of that time, but there is much about it that is timeless.I want to encourage anyone who read this in high school and was made to hate it to pick it up. It's a very brief read, and is worth your time. Maybe the passage of a few years helps clear the high school myopia about great books like these.And if you were lucky enough not to read this in high school, pick it up now!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Although published seventy-five years ago, Fitzgerald's masterpiece remains as fresh as the day it appeared. It could have been written yesterday. It is as perfect a novel as one is likely to find in American literature; not a word is wrong or out of place. The choice of a second person narrator gives the reader wider and greater appreciation of the characters and events. At the center of it all, of course, is Jay Gatsby, bootlegger, liar, party-giver, doomed romantic. His love for Daisy Buchanan, his &quot;incorruptible dream&quot;, is the only genuine emotion felt by any of the characters (excepting narrator Nick Carroway, whose loyalty to Gatsby is touching), all of whose superficiality is buried beneath the glitter and gaiety of the Jazz Age, the endless parties, the extramarital affairs, the endless-flowing booze, the accumulation of wealth and things.This edition of the book features critical commentary and notes from Prof. Matthew Bruccoli, the world's foremost Fitzgerald scholar."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Don't get me wrong I have a tender spot in my heart for Gatsby, but I try not to kid myself that it is one of the greatest American novels of all time. No what it is is one of the most accessible serious American novels of this century. This said it must be acknowledged that serious flaws exist in this novel. The style and structure are self deluding in that they hark to established reader responses. Nick is a crutch for Fitzgerald in that he needed this neighbour character to make the distant yet close tone of the novel easy to write...this character device is old hat, check out any of the more noirish so called pulp novels of contemporaneous times. Indeed the whole cast are just finely worked cliches (and it is not just that they have become so due to TGG's popularity) and an excuse for Fitzgerald to address what he is really after the American dream. Oh well it is just this atmosphere that we're after as readers, we love it and can't get enough of it. The problem is that we then pat ourselves on the back and say we're reading a masterpiece. No a masterpiece causes us to question deeply our own held beliefs and offers insight, not as the GG does which is serve up ideas which are just ever so slightly below the surface in everyone...No it is just too easy, the ideas are never really represented on several intellectual fronts so that when we finish the gg we cannot help but have on some level an empty feeling. Maybe as a cynical/demanding reader I'm the outsider, but this book always leaves we looking for more. More than the trite Nick can hand me anyway."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As a non-American I am led to ask: so what's all the fuss about? A quick scan of a sample of reviews shows this to have been widely read by school children from the USA. Hence the focus perhaps on its meaning for greater Americana, that love of country through literature, pride and patriotism through a rendering of one of the grossest periods in the history of large decadent societies. I found it a very ordinary novel with thin shallow characters set in a context that countries like the Philippines or Bolivia would be made to wear with shame: corrupt, tarnished, cruel, trashy. Yet because it's the USA we are repeatedly told about the book's accurate depiction of a significant period of history (or words to that effect).Yes, I agree with other reviewers that he could write good descriptive prose. But who can't? (I mean, I hasten to add, among worthy recognised writers.) That alone, great literature does not make. But this thing has Americans seduced, especially their literati. There is no hint that Fitzgerald was an intellectual, or that he delved into very complex areas of personal psychology abutting an overpowering government, economy and social structure. He seems merely to have liked to live, with and without Zelda, the kind of life he almost extolls here.Not enough for me I'm afraid. I only bought the thing because at the fin de siecle it was rated in one of those lists of 20th century literature at #2. Mind you, the judges were all Anglo-Americans and almost all the 100 finalist novels - apart from an odd few like Marquez's 100 Years of Solitude, were from USA or UK.To me it is very ordinary. 3 begrudging stars."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It's not as though I haven't read The Great Gatsby before. Like so many others, I read it in high school and tolerated it, letting the experience of being forced into the book color the book itself. But as years have gone by, I've often thought the book deserved a fresh read. And now, whether it's because I'm older, I gave it more benefit of the doubt, or I'm just a wiser reader, I finally understand what an incredible work of fiction the novel truly is. A far more complex and nuanced book than I remembered it being, Gatsby is neither a love letter to the 1920's nor a pure screed against them, and that sense of ambiguity and complex feelings is part of what makes the book so moving. It's hard to find characters here to admire; from our narrator, whose claims of his own honesty and lack of judgment are quickly revealed to be less than accurate, to the apparently wonderful but ultimately shallow Daisy, and even to the well-intentioned but deeply flawed Gatsby, the characters all defy easy characterization, instead becoming symptoms of a moral laxness that permeated the times. And the prose - my god, the prose! The valley of ashes, the silent eyes of an abandoned billboard, the painful meeting of long-separated lovers - Fitzgerald does it all beautifully and simply, telling a massive tale in a surprisingly few pages. Singing the praises of The Great Gatsby hardly feels necessary - is there anyone who was waiting on my thoughts to change their mind? But it's the kind of book that demands such praise, leaving the reader in awe of its greatness after you finish its deceptively slim length."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"What goes on four legs in the morning, on two legs at noon, and on three legs in the evening?\\" the Sphinx asks Oedipus at the gates of Thebes. As the myth goes, no one provides the correct answer until the arrival of Oedipus, whose response of man reflects the stages of human life. The irony of a riddle is that its answer is crystal clear after its revelation. The answer is right in front of us, but often it takes a great work of art such as the story of Oedipus or in this case The Great Gatsby to help us understand our humanity.Many of my millennial students sigh or complain when they recount their first experience with The Great Gatsby. \\"It was forced upon us. My teacher kept saying how great this novel was, but she never explained why other than it depicted the Jazz Age.\\" Neither Oedipus nor prophet, I have provided some reasons as to why this novel deserves a second look from today's youth.As many have already mentioned, The Great Gatsby's narration is the voice of America. Post-modernist critics may object to that statement, considering that Nick Caraway, a young white Army veteran, comes from a well-to-do Midwestern family. While Nick differs both physically and geographically from most of my students, his voice speaks for Americans not so much for what he says but rather by what he doesn't. Nick listens. Confused yet excited by the \\"bright lights\\" of New York, he nonetheless is attractive to the main characters because of his honesty, integrity, and kindness, traits one would find in a counselor or a religious leader. Though confidential, the dramatic irony is that we receive a first-hand-account of the attitudes and actions of America's \\"gods and goddesses,\\" much in the same manner we encounter the tragic flaws of the keepers of Mt. Olympus. Shining a light on the closed world of the rich and famous is titillating to almost everyone.Another aspect of this novel that is overlooked is its length. Depending on the edition, the length does not exceed 235 pages (my edition is 182 pages), a major accomplishment considering its literary output. Published in 1925, Gatsby shines because Fitzgerald had learned from the failure of his play The Vegetable that Americans crave descriptive yet efficient writing that can be read in a day or two. Fitzgerald accomplished his goal, and like any great dramatic or cinematic feature, his audience--with some assistance--is able to digest the purpose or meaning of the story itself. The length of the text is appropriate for any student, but what is gleaned may depend on the stage of an American's life. Note, my previous statement is not contingent upon age; rather, it is my observation that Americans form deeper opinions about the American Dream based on their experiences in pursuit of the American Dream. This is the last idea I would like to explore in the next paragraph.The topic that is of central concern to this novel, and one in which makes this novel worthy of merit, I tend to believe, is Fitzgerald's criticism of the American Dream. This may be a generational shift, but many of Generation X males measured their worth based on their ability to become \\"self-made\\" millionaires through Ben Franklin's proverbial (yet ironic) schedule of hard work and dedication. The Dream (dream?) worked in stages: Young man falls in love with blonde goddess who comes from a renowned (wealthy) family; next, he begins his Arthurian quest to woo her by demonstrating his valor in battle. Returning, he whisks her off her feet, marrying, and then carrying her on a white horse to her castle. There, he consummates his marriage with his fertile wife, leading to their first-born son, who can carry the name for generations. The only catch is that the Dream takes money--lots of it.For my generation, this was the single greatest fear that men encountered: failing to achieve the Dream. There was no other option, and because of it, that is why Gatsby, a penniless veteran, perverts the means of achieving the Dream by entering the world of wolves known as the criminal economy. Like the narrator, we disagree with Gatsby's decision, but we can sympathize, especially for returning veterans who often struggle to find gainful employment. Nick understands this point better than anyone because he comes from a \\"connected\\" family similar to what Tom, Daisy, and Jordan have. Who today has a family who can fund one of their children for an entire year to find himself in New York? While no one likes to use the word \\"victim\\" to describe any group today, the fact remains that players such as Wolfsheim, Tom, Daisy, and the party goers exploit Gatsby's ambitions for their own personal illusions.Looking at the narration, the terseness yet beauty of the text, and the overarching theme of the American Dream, one cannot help but reexamine this literary pearl, as readers did of course after Fitzgerald's death. In the past, much of the discussion regarding this novel has focused on the following questions: Has the green, flickering light known as the American Dream passed? Have more Americans resorted to \\"questionable\\" practices in order to obtain the Dream? These are reasonable questions for my generation, but for a younger post-Socialist generation, their next question may not pertain to finances nor social status but rather personal identity. Before another generation reads Gatsby, maybe they should ask the following question: How do I define the American Dream? It might be too post-modern for my generation to swallow, but millennial Americans must now find happiness on their own terms in a world that we have not left better than our parents did for us. The old definition of the American Dream killed Gatsby; it would only be too prudent to steer a different path, for our children and for what remains of our time on Earth. Thankfully, it is not yet evening and I have not grown a third leg!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I had not read this novel for some 20 years, remembering it only as an excellent American novel. A recent rereading was a revelation--this is indeed one of the world's great novels, as close to perfection as the art of fiction comes. The minor character point of view gave the characters and the action the truth of objectivity. The characterization framed the characters, though not extensively developed, vividly within the parameters of the theme: Gatsby's and our nation's loss of innocence and the loss of our ideals in the pursuit of wealth. Though set in the 1920's, the novel's message is as relevant now as it was then, perhaps in the dedication to greed today even more so. There is an economy of action in this short novel that Fitzgerald distills into the very essence of what he needs to deliver his message: James Gatz of North Dakota is the embodiment of the American dream, callow, superficial, idealistic, noble and grand--the symbol of this nation's promise of the better life, and how it has become corrupted into a glorious and empty dream. Few novels, in their rapid progression from beginning to conclusion, cause the reader to become aware of the quality of the writing itself, the choice of words, the descriptive details, the to and fro of prose rhythms. \\"Gatsby\\" does on almost every page: \\"Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver,safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.\\" Daisy:\\"Her voice is full of money.....\\" That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it...high in a white palace the king's daughter,the golden girl...\\" Nick Carraway's;\\" I'm thirty,\\" I said. I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.\\" The last 3 paragraphs of the book are simply magnificent, an eloquent, powerful, gloriously appropriate conclusion to a great novel.

Daisy, in turn, married herself to Tom Buchanan for the sole purpose of continuing to lead a life of privilege. Tom is an egotistic, adulterer, whose latest mistress is none other than the mechanic's wife, Myrtle Wilson. The mechanic, George Wilson, is good friends with Tom, and is none the wiser about this affair. Jordan Baker, a golfer and Daisy's friend, is aware of everything that's happening, and brings in narrator, and neighbour of Gatsby, Nick Carraway into the picture.In a strange turn of events, Nick becomes a close friend and confidante of Gatsby. Gatsby is now a very wealthy man who lives in a mansion and holds daily parties that go on until the early hours of the morning, in the hopes that one day, Daisy would walk in through the doors. With Nick's help, Daisy and Jay meet again, and the romance is instantly rekindled. However, in The Great Gatsby, it isn't a matter of all's well that ends well.This story really makes me sad. A very charming man, Jay Gatsby wanted nothing more in this world than to be with Daisy. Daisy on the other hand is torn between wanting love, and wanting to remain with Tom and her comfortable existence. I wasn't very surprised with the ending, as I saw it coming. But I was surprised at the reaction of all the people that surrounded Gatsby, and angry at quite a few of them.Definitely a must-read.

Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" This short but poignant novel paints a beautiful but macabre portrait of a period dripping in character, scandal, and self-involvement. Entirely unforgiving, Fitzgerald is faithful to his ideas and opinions, and shows no fear in humanizing his subjects. This is a novel that I am sure I will return to again and again."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald had high hopes for \\"The Great Gatsby\\" when it was published in 1925 -that were dashed by a tepid reception. The novel didn't have much critical support until the 1940s. Perhaps, in its own age, it hit too close to home with too much venom. Perhaps the Roaring Twenties, when liquor and money flowed freely, are romanticized in retrospect, and the novel's prevalence of casual dialogue gets more respect now. H.L. Mencken called it a \\"glorified anecdote\\", and, indeed, that is how \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is presented. The narrator recalls an experience he had among friends a couple of years earlier. As a story, there isn't much to it. It is how characters perceive one another, how they wish to be perceived, and the simpler and indifferent reality that comment on an age, as well as on the immutable social nature of humans.Nick Carraway, a man of prominent family who came East to do something vague with bonds, narrates the tale. Nick took a modest house on Long Island, next door to a magnificent mansion owned by Jay Gatsby, a man whom no one knows anything about, except that he throws magnificent parties with all manner of glamorous people in attendance, constantly, which people like just fine. Across the bay, Nick's second cousin Daisy Buchanan lives with her husband Tom, and it is at their home that Nick meets a professional golfer named Jordan Baker, whom he doesn't respect much but takes up with all the same. It is through a series of social gatherings that we get to know this group of people and that Nick eventually becomes friendly with his mysterious neighbor, Mr. Gatsby, who has plans to reclaim his long-lost love: Daisy Buchanan.It struck me that the prose is not very literary for a pre-War novel. The story unfolds in scenes and through dialogue. But it has a merciful brevity that I associate with that era. The lack of extraneous detail and background earned my admiration. Fitzgerald focuses on the interactions of the characters and ignores what goes on in between. This is one slice of their lives, the bitter slice that Nick remembers. It's interesting that it is Gatsby who evokes the readers' sympathy, even though we know little about him and Nick disapproves, though holds a begrudging admiration, of him. Amid the hypocrisy, ambition, and shallowness of these Jazz Age bon vivants, Gatsby is confident is his ability to re-do the past. But when Nick concludes that \\"we beat on...borne back ceaselessly into the past\\", he speaks of himself as much as of Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Although it is widely regarded as a novel about the delusiveness of the American dream, 'the Great Gatsby' is relevant to any post-modern time and place. The concept is such: people's desires and aspirations are, more often than not, founded in nothing but their own head. As, in this novel, Jay Gatsby pursues his first love, Daisy. He works his way out of the lower-class and, through crooked business, becomes wildly wealthy. Gatsby buys a large mansion on Long Island, directly across the water from Daisy and her new husband's, and throws fabulous parties for the socialites of New York in order to garner Daisy's attention. Even after discovering Daisy to be married, he never questions whether she still loves him, and he begins to pursue her, inevitably starting an affair.Gatsby is not in love with the real Daisy, he is in love with the idea of Daisy. He believes in the American dream that he can accomplish anything and does in fact accomplish great feats. But his dream is inflexible and not open to discussion. He is in love with a figment of his imagination; the dream of the beautiful young girl he fell in love with as a child. He clings to the hopes and dreams of his childhood which leads to inevitable tragedy. Although Daisy does care about Gatsby, she is essentially an unfeeling narcissistic person who cares more about her image and social standing than anything Gatsby could ever offer. Hardly the angelic creature that Gatsby so idealized throughout his life. Even after having these facts shoved in his face, Gatsby refuses to believe:\\"Can't repeat the past?\\" he cried incredulously. \\"Why of course you can!\\"If you were to change a few specifics and locales, 'The Great Gatsby' could easily pass for a novel of our time. In fact, Fitzgerald is one of the first to so eloquently characterize a person like Gatsby; someone whose entire life is so completely a product of their society."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I didn't fully appreciate this in high school when it was required reading.

Daisy seemed hardly worth all the trouble Gatsby took, and for that matter, neither did entry into her world. She was a cipher. The use of a narrator to connect the various characters was interesting; how could the book have been written otherwise? But at times the plot felt contrived, as with the switching of cars and an accident, and the symbolism around the valley of ashes seemed heavy-handed. Other than the passive narrator, the people lacked even a small degree of self-awareness. The one who seemed the least conflicted and most sure of himself was the brutal, self-centered Tom.It was the lesser details in this novel that were enjoyed most. A montage at the end of the second chapter in which the drunken narrator moved from an elevator, to a bedroom, to Penn Station. How Gatsby's smile affected those who saw it. A mansion housing a library of books with their pages uncut. The vapidity of a man who tried to act out his limited idea of the good life but had little of interest to say and thought San Francisco was in the Middle West. Dogged efforts at self-improvement linked to shallow goals. A shady character eating with \\"ferocious delicacy.\\" The way Daisy conveyed her love for a character in just a few words said lightly in front of her husband. The class disdain someone like Tom felt for the main character -- he couldn't be an Oxford man because he wore a pink suit.

Sure, most of them are maybe one-dimensional, but that again plays with Gatsby being so complicated. Because this is the essence of the book as I see it: Gatsby might be a superficial man in his ways and his attitudes, still he feels there's something more deep and worthwhile in life and he thinks he found it in Daisy. And so he pursues his dream to grasp that deeper, most important of thing with what means he has. Which are shallow things, the things he has around him, which dwell in his world and people around him consider valuable.This is what I liked in this novel. Both Gatsby and Carraway feel there is more to life than what they see around them, but unfortunately our means to achieve that deepness - that happiness, if you will - are inadequate, most of the time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Jay Gatsby pursues the American Dream from his mansion in fashionable West Egg, New York as the Jazz Age unfolds and his dubious business deals follow the dizzy momentum of the Roaring Twenties.

The green light seems to mesmerize Gatsby with the promise of fulfilled love and legitimate class attainment as he stares at it nightly.The Dream is never realized though as Gatsby gets killed for the sins of one more powerful than he in a case of cruel irony played under the watchful optician in the ashen waste and ending in Gatsby's lonely friendless mansion. Gatsby ends in failed pomp much as the Jazz Age itself died under the dark realities of failed Great Depression capitalism.The film, CITIZEN KANE begins with a man's death and the emptiness of his possessions...a small empty crib tells us of the cryptic \\"Rosebud\\"...with GATSBY it ends with a small notebook and a grateful impoverished father who mourns his son's buried love."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Length:: 4:53 MinsIn this video review I give a plot synopsis, read a passage, and give my overall opinion of the book.

From the beginning I had a feeling that something is different about this book than any other book I have everread. So, it became the first book ever which I read first page to last page. I really liked that how the theme of American Dream is presented throughout the novel. Ireally admired the main character Gatsby since he gives up everything for his love, but in return he has to lose his life. The reason why I loved this book so muchwas that the dedication of Gatsby for the goal of his lifetime and the hard work he did for that. This book is really inspirational. It also talks about the AmericanDream of people. Additionally, it also mentions the changes in the values in the 1920s. I would definitely, recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a reallygood book to enjoy and also to learn.Sorry for ruining the story for you."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is a beautiful masterpiece. Fitzgerald gleefully dances the line between prose and poetry in an intriguing and delightful manner. He creates a collage of the human condition: love, romance, hatred, kindness, evil, deceit, loneliness, emptiness. The book also has great humor, unforgettable characters and an interesting plot. It's real miracle though is Fitzgerald's unassailable command of the English language. If you buy it in kindle form don't buy the cheaper version. It's words are broken up and all over the page. It will drive you crazy trying to read it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It is a short book, less than 200 pages, and the writing is fluid, so you can easily finish it in a couple of hours. On the surface it is about rich people's folly -- Gatsby's failed attempt to resurrect the past with money. But it is more than that; it cuts deep into the pitfalls of the Jazz Age: that easily gotten money is easily parted with, that money can buy everything. It is interesting to know that Fitzgerald wrote this book in the middle and at the height of the roaring 20s, portentous of the house of cards that was about to crumble in the next decade. The writing in this book has a liquid, even luminous quality to it, and it is quite remarkable that after more than 80 years it still has a degree of modernity and it does not feel antiquated at all."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"At the risk of sounding as one steeped in vanity and geek-ness, I shall relate the brief story of how I discovered this book. I wanted to record my voice, on the computer, for the purpose of sending to my friends online whom I've never met or talked to on the phone, and have thusly never heard my voice. Not being one blessed with the ability to produce stirring speech on command, I decided I would record myself reading from a novel.The first novel I selected from my parents' rather diverse library was &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot; I'd never read it before, but I deemed the first few paragraphs worthy of representing my voice to my online friends. So I recorded myself reading them out loud. The book enchanted me. The sound of the language alone prompted me to record nearly three pages before I retired to my room to devour the complete novel. It's now 5:51 AM, and I, having just finished reading this wonderful work, am confident that F. Scott Fitzgerald will join the growing pantheon of my personal favorites. His fascinating ability to make viewpoint and character shine as much as plot -- and his vibrant prose -- sets him among those I consider the greats of literature, such as Vonnegut and Salinger.

Scott. Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby is a most stirring novel. Every time after reading this book, I become lost in a trance, and only after navigating out of the Fitzgerald created haze, can I begin to examine his intent. There is nothing complex about this book, indeed his comment on the American Dream is straight-forward and easy to identify. Though this acknowledgement, for me, can only be truly realised on the completion and reflection of the work. Largely because Fitzgerald intices the reader to meet his characters, to feel the suffering and alienation of Gatsby, the ordinariness of Nick, and to be pushed slowly and gently by the rich current and bueaty of flow of his words.A most moving book, that despite it's obviousness transcends to something more sublime."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Gatsby is a wonderful book because of the layers and layers found within it.

I have very different recollection of the story from the view of a teenager vs a grown adult.Still a classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Reviewing \\"The Great Gatsby\\" feels a bit presumptuous and for sure somehow redundant. What can one say that has not been said already about this seminal story?To avoid being totally repetitive I will start with some personal perspective. I read this book the first time as a teenager in my native Bucharest, at a time when I knew little about life in general and almost nothing about New York or United States. When I finished reading, I was left with the impression that this was about some people quarreling after a car accident. What a difference 40 years make. Reading it now, I felt great empathy for the plight of the characters and I believe I recognized at least some of the universal themes pursued by the author. It seems to me that Fitzgerald advances here a very pessimistic premise about people's behavior and what they can expect from life, namely that those who are self-absorbed or just selfish will always end up better off than those who, in pursuit of valid or absurd dreams, insist on fighting the reality on behalf of their dreams.As we follow the story, Gatsby's dream of recapturing the lost love of his youth, Myrtle's dream of becoming a respectable bourgeois matron, Wilson's dream of being a successful business owner, all become vehicles for the ultimate destruction of those who dream them. In the meantime the monumentally insensitive Tom and the cowardly shallow Daisy continue to prosper in the big city, not perturbed in the least by their heavy responsibility for what has just happened. Learning his lesson, the narrator, Nick , gives up on his dream of becoming a well-adjusted East Coast money man and decides to go back home to Mid-West.Some people will see here a class contrast element. After all, Tom and Daisy are rich while their unintended victims are low or lower class. I believe that the essence of the story transcends class. In my experience, people like Tom and Daisy can be found in all strata of society, irrespective of income or status.The pleasure of reading this book is enhanced by Scott Fitzgerald wonderful gift for using little details like a gesture, a word, a simple noise or a clever comment by the narrator in order to bring depth to his characters and advance the story. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" effortlessly transports us to the \\"roaring twenties\\" in New York City, a time and place of great optimism and sudden prosperity for many. The author viewpoint is less rosy. He spots human frailty and suffering even in the middle of the most lavish settings. In a symbolic way, Daisy's car crash portends historical events still to come. Ability to prophesize aside, Fitzgerald remains himself a product of the era. Within the story, he casually stereotypes Jews as shadowy money grubbing characters with hairs coming out of their noses and he is not above using variations of the \\"n\\" word when he thinks necessary. No matter; this is a remarkable novel, one of those ten or twenty essential books that everyone should read before claiming they know anything about human nature. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is one of the most lively short stories I've picked up.

Great book every time you read it, just read it again after a couple of years and it was even better than the first time"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Written by F. Scott Fitgerald in the 1920's, The Great Gatsby never ceases to depict the fallibility of the typical wealthy American. It is also a fine representation of the American dream and the price that comes along with it. The theme that I was imbued most by was the inability to grasp time: past and present. Gatsby is the typical wealthy American in the 1920's who lives the life wanted by all Americans. His involvement in bootleg alcohol tends to make him a shady character; however, he is in a way the fallible hero. His undying love for Daisy was what brought him to the life of organized crime and illegal activities. Along with the theme are symbols used to further substantiate the theme of wealth and time. For example, the clock that Gatsby tips over and catches shows how he is desperate to take control of time and bring what he wants: a chance with Daisy. His courage and motivation to win the woman of his dreams nevertheless proves that wealth cannot bring back what was past and over. Fitzgerald's use of symbols is what represents most the books' themes. It also serves as a lesson that what is past is past and that there is only a chance at moving on, not staying in the past."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Written in the 1920's, F. Scott Fitzgerald's 240 page novel, \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" tells of a love story gone wrong caused by the desire for material objects. The story describes Mr. Gatsby's life as he tries to regain his past love, Daisy, who left him because he was not wealthy enough. She, as well as many of the characters in the book, was only concerned with wealth, so she married another man for his riches. Mr. Gatsby tries to do everything to regain her love. He spends his whole life becoming wealthy so that he may sweep her off of her feet and get the past back. Mr. Gatsby is a foolish man trying to repeat the past, who does not realize how superficial and shallow Daisy is. He is only concerned with her beauty. The storyline of this book is shaped similar to a believable soap opera because of all the lying and cheating that is going on between many of the characters. This book is full if symbolism, which cleverly reveals many different aspects of the story and characters. Several of the examples of symbolism are so subtle that they require a second or third reading to even notice them. This great love tragedy is smoothly written with a storyline that leaves you desiring to read further. This story is thought provoking and simply amazing. This is a brilliant novel and I recommend it to everyone. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a timeless classic written by an incredible writer."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I apologize for many of the close-minded high school students who decided to vent the fact that they hate everything they read in school on this website.I am sorry to say that I am a high school student, who had the pleasure to read this book last year. It is truely amazing how one book can get a kid my age so engulfed in the concept of reading. Everything about this book is wonderful to me. The symbolism throughout the whole book just adds to the tragic story of Jay Gatsby and his inability to let go of a past life that has haunted him for years.In short, this book deconstructs the basic American dream and reveals it as a desperate attempt to cling to memories of a love that is, and always had been out of Gatsby's league. The superficiality of his new social status is made extremely lucid by symbolism as simple of Gatsby's pool. The pool had never been used by gatsby himself, it just sat in it's place to be used for nothing other than show, much like Gatbsy himself. The money he acquired(through illegal ventures) had never been about himself, but only about the hope that somehow he could prove to Daisy that he had become an upscale man. The hope that somehow the past would could be not forgotten, but re-lived ultimately led to Gatbsy's destruction, as he failed to realize his own desperate and hopeless quest for wealth soon enough to save his soul. The way Gatsby is depicted paints two portraits of one man, a man who has everything; a fabulous mansion, money, cars and all of the other worldly possessions one can hope for, and the other; a man who has everything but what he desires most, the love he would give everything up for. In the end, Daisy and friends are revealed as nothing more than snobbish drunks, and Gatsby remains the shattered man who always strived to do better for the ones he cared about, the ones he loved.How any person who reads this book and does not appreciate it for the wonderful story it tells is beyond me. Kids these days seem to automatically hate any book they are forced to read in a school environment, and it is a shame. Perhaps if high schoolers could look past their own superficialities and accept a book for what it is, than many would be better off."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I love this book. Initially, it can be somewhat hard to follow because of the narration, but Fitzgerald is such a master storyteller that it doesn't matter; you just can't put the book down. I love this story not only for the brilliant pictures that it paints in my head, and the compelling storyline, but the language . . . My god, the language is so beautiful. To the unsure buyer, &quot;If you have ever gone out of your way to impress someone only to have them treat you like dirt, this book is for you.&quot; READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I am shocked by the negative reviews of this claasic of American fiction. Before you embarrass yourself by knocking this book, please keep in mind that it was #2 on the 20th century fiction list For those of you with your nose too deep in the Grisham and King to see for yourself, let me point out a few things that make this such a great book.First please note the economy of the words of the storytelling and the lyrical language used by Fitzgerald. It is a novel that tells a remarkable story without a single excess word. (S. King take note---a book does not have to be 1000 pages---get an editor, Big Guy) Also note the the cleverness of having the narration from Nick's point of view, which adds a lot to the book because of the interplay between Nick and Gatsby. Notice also how Fitzgerald handles the timeless themes of money, power and class, while telling a great story. Even if you don't have time to read the whole book, just read the last page. It's as good as anything that has ever been written.Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a strange book because it seems that every American is forced to read it in high school, and yet its lessons are most meaningful and appropriate for people who are much, much older. Fitzgerald's main message seems to be that those individuals who think big and dream big will eventually be crushed by their headstrong romantic ambitions, and that golden memories from the past--no matter how achingly seductive and promising in retrospect--can never be recaptured.How depressing! What high schooler wants to be exposed to these dreadful (if true) life lessons, especially so early in life?Therein lies the rub. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a benchmark work of American literature that is primarily read by youngsters who are too young to appreciate it, and it is ignored by oldsters who might truly connect with it because they, in their old age, dismiss the novel as some sort of stale required reading for adolescents.But let's now look at what the two groups might like, and then dislike, about this fascinating 1925 novel.LIKES OF THE HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA CROWD:1.) It's a short read.2.) It's a famous work written by a famous author.3.) It's a clear, clean, tidy read.4.) It offers little complexity or contradiction (at least on a superficial level).5.) Nick Carroway is cool, and Jay Gatsby is REALLY cool.6.) Fitzgerald's gifts of description are amazing, especially those of the Gatsby mansion and its parties.6.) The book's mini-lessons are tidy, potted plants: (a.) money is bad; (b.) it sucks being the outsider; (c.) pay attention while driving, lest you mow down a mistress; (d.) don't bother Googling your ex-girlfriend and buying a big house across the bay from her big house.DISLIKES OF THE HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA CROWD:1.) Nick Carroway's narration is a little too suav&eacute; and complex for its own good.2.) The last quarter of the text, sort of a crime novel spelled out, doesn't match the epic grandeur of the first three-quarters of the book.3.) Except for a few parties, one DUI, and one murder/suicide, nothing happens over nearly 200 pages of text.LIKES OF THE RETIREMENT-COMMUNITY CAFETERIA CROWD:1.) It's a short read.2.) Nick Carroway's narration is agreeably suav&eacute; and complex.3.) Scores and scores of textual passages in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" are arrestingly beautiful in their imagery, simplicity, and lyricism.4.) The oldsters know good-hearted, hard-charging successful people who eventually crashed and burned, just like Gatsby did.5.) The oldsters like looking back gauzily and wistfully on the splendor and health of their youth, no matter how things actually turned out.6.) The bastards win out at the end of \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" just like in real life.DISLIKES OF THE RETIREMENT-COMMUNITY CAFETERIA CROWD:1.) The last quarter of the text, sort of a crime novel spelled out, doesn't match the epic grandeur of the first three-quarters of the book.2.) The pivotal automobile accident is just a tiny bit forced and convenient. (See for example p. 151 of the 1995 Scribner paperback edition--how can Daisy swerve to pass an ONCOMING car on a two-lane street? If the approaching car is ONCOMING, there is no need to swerve--just to keep driving straight.)3.) Why did Gatsby let himself be killed by the raving George Wilson? Wouldn't Gatsby, who purposely ordered his car with the damaged fender to be entombed in his estate's garage, get the hell out of Dodge? (Tom and Daisy did.) Are we meant to believe he gave up on life because, after one bad afternoon and a car accident caused by Daisy, he would give up on five years' worth of empire-building and let himself be assassinated?4.) Overall, the book doesn't quite fit together seamlessly. It fails to be perfectly harmonious, internally and thematically.In sum, this is a masterpiece stuck uncomfortably between two places: the hearts and minds of the young, who have not yet lived long enough to endorse the timeless truths of the novel's grim central message, and the hearts and minds of the old, who might indeed recognize the value of its teachings, but skip over the text because they consider it to be fodder for juvenile minds.The text's tragic inability to succeed in one or the other camp reminds us of two similar and heartbreaking failures: of Jay Gatsby, who had all the material goods and all the street cred, but still died young, broken, and alone; and of F. Scott Fitzgerald, who was perhaps the most naturally gifted author America ever produced, but still died young, broken, and alone."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Quite simply, the best American novel of the 20th Century.Fitzgerald was a genuis and this is his masterpiece, his gift to American literature. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is an awesome yet deceptively simple story that explores the frustrations and passions of an entire generation through the words, deeds, and thoughts of a few complex characters. There is so much just below the surface of this book, you can easily read through it and miss the depth. But it is there, to be discovered under Nick's watchful gaze. You have Gatsby's fabricated fabulousness, a persona he's created with his own self-serving mythology. But there is so much he hides, so much he wills Nick to discover.You have Daisy's flightiness and selfishness also hiding her true self because that's how it is for women in her world--fake, flighty, frothy, lacking in substance. She knows the rules and she plays by them. Jordan, Nick and others--their truth is more obvious to us (i.e., Jordan is a cheat). But everything is tragic here, it is a fasade built on Eliot's famed &quot;wasteland.&quot;I can't stres this enough--this is a book that must be read, reread, and analyzed countless times in order to understand what an extraordinary achievement it is. It is poetry."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Although F. Scott Fitzgerald's book &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; may seem a tad superficial upon the first reading, it really is quite a gem when examined closer. There are many important and significant symbols that are so intricately and subtly woven into the story, that only a careful reader would be able to catch them all. Fitzgerald makes excellent use of colour symbolism in things such as Gatsby's clothing and car, and the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, place symbolism, in regards to East Egg, West Egg, and the Valley of Ashes, and time symbolism, which can be caught when one looks at the timeline that the book follows. Fitzgerald's seemingly shallow depiction of five characters in the roaring twenties is really a symbolic masterpiece and a classic novel of the twentieth century. A must-read for any deep reader, or anyone who wants to become one."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I am an English teacher, and I bought this to aid in my classroom discussion of the novel. After receiving this version of Gatsby, I discovered that our school library had a copy read by a different narrator.

I highly recommend Scourby's reading of \\"The Great Gatsby.\\""},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It should come as no surprise that F. Scott Fitzgerald is a Midwesterner who came to New York City to try his luck. Many great New Yorkers came from outside the City (PT Barnum, Robert Fulton, Alexander Hamilton, etc.). However, their fresh perspectives of Gotham--something a native might overlook--allowed them to see things in a different way. Nick, the narrator of THE GREAT GATSBY, is also a Midwestern boy who comes to New York. In Jay Gatsby, Nick sees someone alluring, mysterious, dazzling, intimidating, aloof, and shady--all those qualities associated with Jazz Age New York. And the population of Gatsby's parties, like the population of Roaring 20s New York, are money-, power- and sex-hungry, yearning for celebrity, and, in many cases, hollow people who drink too much.For all the drinking, Nick's view (and therefore Fitzgerald's) is incredibly sobering and clear-eyed. Caught up as he is in the excitement, he is often repelled by some of it. THE GREAT GATSBY, in my book, contains some of Fitzgerald's most lyrical writing. In form, character development, and plot, this book stands out as just an important book of early 20th century American literature as anything by Steinbeck, Dos Passos, or Dreiser."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I didn't find this book to be as great as everyone says.

It may be hard to interpret, but once you understand it, it is one of the greatest American novels every written. Make sure you have time to read the book several times before you decide to embark on the adventure.Zachary B.

Now that I am a little older and wiser, I understand what Fitzgerald was getting at. Many American's have their own green light, their \\"American Dream\\" that they are always reaching for, but may never attain or may attain only to be left wondering, like Jay Gatsby, was it worth it? This is a great reflection on the American Dream, as all the great works of American literature are. The tragedy of Gatsby's life and longing are only enhanced because of the fact that every American has their own dream. And Fitzgerald's reflections on the moral wasteland that made up the wealthy's lifestyle in the 1920s has as much resonance today, post-2008 stock market crash, as it did 90 years ago. And while I wouldn't go so far as to call this book \\"The Great American Novel\\" as others have, I do believe that a new generation of Americans, traumatized by the Wall Street bailout and the economic disparity between the rich and the poor in this country, will find new meaning in this classic work."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I loved the book.

Twice because after reading criticisms of the work I thought I must have missed something the first time. Still, the impression that I have is that of a book with a limited artistic range. Yes he used his colors well, but to me they're tepid and there's not enough of them. I think I ended throwing a few of my own in, projecting into the characters a frustration with themselves having to operate on such a shallow level. Gatsby himself - the most complex depiction - even he couldn't convince me that his desires, drives, motives, emotions, were inspiring enough to merit a book of his own."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Follow my sarcasm. The author may have intended the same. The Great Gatsby - regarded as \\"great,\\" but to whom? Not the novel, but rather the subject of the novel - Jay Gatsby - who is the character central to the narrator's story. Through the eyes of the moral and perceptive Nick Carraway, we see Jay Gatsby from the narrator's point-of-view. But we also get glimpses of how he affects other characters. Is he the great party-goer that everyone wonders and gossips about? Is he a true, self-made millionaire we all strive to be? Is he a romatic at heart? Or is he nothing more than a phony and shallow swindler and roadside magician?Considered a compliment to Eliot's \\"The Waste Land\\" - one can see that the narrator delivers a little ethical punch as to why such opulent and destructive wealth can ruin a man. Perspectives of what makes a man great become the game of the novel. No one really knows the real Gatsby - no one, except for Nick.Having read it in high school and now again some twenty years later, I can see what makes it inaccesible for adolescence yet endearing and profound for adults; it is the rift between the opposites that a mature and experienced audience can all relate to. For Nick, it's about distinguishing truth from falsehoods; the deeply genuine from the superficial. For the rest, it's the pendulum swing of getting rich and disregarding the poor, the city and its \\"valley of ashes\\" over its affluent suburbs. Then for other charatcers - like Tom, Daisy, and Myrtle - there is the sometimes violent gap between love and lust. The themes of this novel are timeless and multi-layered; and it seems Fitzgerald made no attempts to disguise them. It's an easy read to get through in a day, but you could spend several weeks analyzing it.As for his style, Fitzgerald clearly attempted to write a simple novel with descriptions that are sometimes weaved with a demanding and moralizing inner voice. His dialogue runs deep with meaning, in that it's about what they don't say. While reading it, you have to remind yourself that the dialogue and descritption that is absent reflects what the author is not telling us - the characters themselves are absent from reality and what they are unable or unwilling to face.It's a step above realism, in that we have implicit opinions about culture and society through the eyes of his narrator which are balanced evenly among the aforementioned plot details and character actions. But even this lends itself to a good literary discussion. Can the narrator be trusted? Is the narrator in search of something greater? Is he fair? Is he leaving anything out? Gatsby, afterall, \\"represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn,\\" as he states on the second page. The foreshadowing lures you into wondering why. What has he done to anger the narrator? And yet what makes him \\"great\\"?As a period piece, it's undeniably an essential read to the Jazz Age canon. Otherwise, the recurring themes make it highly relevant to today's issues of greed, shallowness, and loss of faith. Decide for yourself whether the destructive avarice still rings true for Long Island, New York, for society in general."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel typefies everything one would expect from a great novel. It's got romance, suspense, wit, humor, and of course, the story's not over until someone dies fighting for love. The Great Gatsby really is a page turner. In fact, I became so absorbed into the book that I would not realize that an hour has gone by before my eyes. yes, it's THAT good.The story is simple, really. A man from humble beginnings, Gatsby, meets his wealthy mentor, and when he dies, Gatsby inherits his fortune. He then goes south and meets a southern debutante, Daisy, from a prominent southern family, and they fall in love. Gatsby is then called off to war, during which time Daisy goes off and marries Tom. That's all the background you need to know, since revealing any more would spoil the delightfully disturbing ending for you.This novel truly personifies one man's quest for the American Dream, even if it is a bit obsessive complusive. Hats off to Fitzgerald for doing such a thorough job of exploring the depths of each character and making them all relate in the end. His unique writing style, including numerous repetitions of symbols, is what adds to his flare. For those of us who are a bit impatient, don't worry, this is perfect for you. Fitzgerald explores all the aspects of a major storyline with as few words as possible, allowing the characters to speak for themselves. As you read this, you can almost picture the motion picture that it would make, thus making the book simply that much better to read.i would recommend this book to anyone who is literate."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is a nice read, although not particularly enthralling. Hence, the non-commital length makes this book worth the time. Fitzgerald does offer an interesting glimpse into a cross-section of 1920's life in New York. Perhaps his perspective seems subtle because of it's relevance to today's society. It reads like an Hollywood movie, and may be more useful to the foreign reader in understanding part of American society."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Timeless writing, lost like the quality of dream. The searching spirits, striving for what they may never, spiritually, attain in this world, where self-delusion motivates, social tendencies can seem shallow. Friendships; empathy amid the cold but natural human tendencies. Incorruptible dreams amid corruption. The quality of character questioned. Observant, non-participatory narration, depicts the beauty, the waste, the prejudices and insecurity, fragility; time passing.It's indeed a deep book; many shades. Honest, romantic, beautiful, sorrowful. Emptiness found in the richest vistas. It has a resigned tone, but with affection for the failing of Gatsby, confronting the dream that has died, and is always dying. It's a Greek Tragedy really.I can't get the actor Robert Redford out of my head for Gatsby, because he was just the perfect casting for this bygone age. If u like this classic, u'll like the slower Brideshead Revisited by Eveleyn Waugh, and Donna Tartt's more recent, student classic The Secret History."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I had first read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" while still in grade school, and although I was left with a general climate of decadence and admiration for Jay Gatsby, I did not understand the depth of this short, but perfect novel. Then I read it again many years later (when I came to live on Long Island) and only then fully appreciated.It is pointless to try to re-tell the plot here, because the complicated character of Gatsby (a truly American self-made man who never forgot his love, but with a secret in his past) and the simplicity and shallowness of Daisy and Tom are revealed in a sequence of events that has to be uncovered step by step.And still I feel that Fitzgerald caught without any mistake or hesitation the atmosphere of that time in America between wars, the people who could be either fully aware or careless and childish.

(There's even an early draft of one of the main passages in the book -- the confrontation between Gastby and Tom at the Plaza Hotel.)The result will be even better if you also read another volume in the Cambridge edition: \\"Trimalchio\\", which is an early version of Gastby.

F. Scott Fitzgerald has given us a timeless treasure to read and enjoy time and time again. The illusion of grandeur &amp; the disillusion of marriage coupled with the search for love, happiness, The American Dream, as well as the imperceptibly foreboding desire to rekindle the past all make The Great Gatsby an incredibly entertaining, yet highly enigmatic, masterpiece of a novel.No one can deny the greatness of F. Scott Fitzgerald. No author since has had the unique gift of such masterful and captivating use of the English language - combined with unparalleled social insight into his age and time. The excessively lavish and glitzy, yet highly impersonal, fetes of Gatsby, make one feel as if one is in attendance partaking in the debauchery - thanks to the effortless and fluid prose of Fitzgerald. The classic American tragic figure, Gatsby symbolizes all that we want to be, and not be, at the same time. Exemplary masterpiece.&quot;And I like large parties. They're so intimate.

The tales of extravagant parties at the great mansion of Jay Gatsby is told with awe by the narrator as he himself becomes involved in the high life style of Mr. Gatsby.Nick Carraway, we find out is a bond salesman working in New York City and living in a small house close by to Gatsby's mansion who comes from the Midwest. The Midwest is also the home of our hero Mr. Gatsby. However as the story unfolds no one seems to really know Gatsby. In fact of his main party extravagances, there seems to be many guests who arrive without invitation and in fact have never seen or associated with the gracious guest.Nick's second cousin also lives in the niche of Long Island which is fictitiously called East Egg. It becomes apparent that Daisy Buchanan is an old heart throb of Jay Gatsby whom she met prior to Gatsby going off to war. The story revolves around Nick and Jay gallivanting around Long Island and New York City where Nick becomes involved with a girlfriend Jordan Baker and Gatsby becomes ruinously involved with Daisy's husband Thomas Buchanan.Along with this continuous scenario we never find out the source of Gatsby's wealth and we find out that the his entr&eacute;e of servants have been replaced by rather dubious characters at the time that Gatsby is in full battle with the Daisy's husband as the summer season on Long Island is fading into early Autumn.Not only is the season fading by Gatsby's hold on his old heart throb is slipping tenuously by a thread with an automobile accident in nearby Queens. The strange enigma of a man who no one seems to know heads straight for a tragedy on Long Island, and in the end it seems if all that had happened never really happened at all. It was as if it was all a Long Island's rich man's dream played out by Midwesterners one and all into an American Tragedy."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I remember being force fed this as a h.s. student, and it went soaring overhead, for the most part.

I would recommend Gatsby for all ages. It's full of life, love, and mystery."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Recently I reread The Great Gatsby because I had some free time and it's been a few years since I read it back in high school. When I originally read The Great Gatsby I wasn't overly impressed by it, but I thought maybe it was because I was in high school. However, to my surprise, my opinion hasn't changed much. I wanted to like it, but the end result was just ok.The \\"main\\" character of the novel is a man named Nick Carraway. I put main in quotes because up until the end of the book his role, in my opinion, is pretty insignificant. Sure, he narrates the book and he arranges the tea meeting with Gatsby and Daisy, his cousin, but the character honestly feels like an empty vessel. One that you want to like because he's supposed to be the main character, but someone who feels genuinely unimportant. The same can be said about pretty much all the characters in the book. Gatsby, for instance, is probably the most likable. Everything he does he does because of his love for Daisy. Essentially the entire story is about Gatsby, but Fitzgerald doesn't take the time to properly flesh out his character, or any of the other characters for that matter. I think most of my distaste for the novel came from Fitzgerald's approach to writing.The novel is most enjoyable when we are going through the main story, but Fitzgerald constantly ruins the flow by having flashbacks right in the middle of the action. Towards the end of the book he starts switching back and forth so much that I found it difficult to follow along at first. Now these flashbacks are technically important because they give the reader some more insight into the characters, but they all seemed to be placed at the most inopportune time. Plus, Fitzgerald's style of writing during these sections changes dramatically from engaging to extremely dull.My biggest complaint has to be the way Fitzgerald structures his sentences. Maybe this was the way to write back then, but in today's world it's extremely uncomfortable. It isn't smooth and it isn't easy on the eyes. Instead of saying, \\"My favorite colors are blue, yellow, green, and red.\\" Fitzgerald would put, \\"My favorite colors are blue and yellow and green and red.\\" In case you don't believe me here's an excerpt from page 40: \\"By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums.\\" It's like the man never learned how to properly use a comma. Couple that with his insistent need to hyphenate everything, \\"to-night, to-morrow, good-by\\", and you're bound to leave a chapter with a headache or two. Lastly, Fitzgerald found it necessary to include an overabundance of similes and metaphors that felt both forced and unnatural. It's not a huge gripe like the commas or the hyphenations, but it's still there.The Great Gatsby is relatively short, only 180 pages long, and you could probably finish it in one sitting if you don't have any other obligations to attend to. However, I think this is what ultimately ruins the experience. Some books can pull off a short page count, but others, like this one, cannot. Had Fitzgerald stuck in the present and not gone off on tangents of the past it would have been fine, but ultimately these flashbacks ruin any chance of fleshing out the characters or properly building up the story so that you actually feel something at the story's climax.Overall Score: 7/10 - I know this is considered a literary classic, and for its time I'm sure it was groundbreaking, but in today's world it's simply mediocre. Nothing about the novel is necessarily terrible, and I never felt the need to close it, but I just feel like the story wasn't given the time it deserved to fully develop into something amazing."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I wanted to read this book before setting the new movie coming out this summer.

I happen to believe that you are older than me and yet, I understood the book better than you. Why don't you read it a little more carefully next time? There aren't any unanswered questions. Gatsby's work is subtely mentioned in the book after Gatsby's death when Nick picks up a phone call that was meant for Gatsby. On page 174, Nick is confused by what the man on the other line wants from Gatsby. &quot;'Young Parke's in trouble,' he said rapidly. 'They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter.'&quot; It goes on to tell how it actually happened. If one read closely enough, it is obvious that Gatsby was not a bootlegger, as believed by Tom, but a white collar criminal who created counterfeit bonds.I also do not enjoy seeing comments like &quot;teenagers don't appreciate books, read it when you grow up,&quot; because I really liked the book and am sure that many other teenagers appreciate it too."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is a glimpse into the jazz age and the glamourous parties of that time.

It was a very intriguining novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Though at times I found it somewhat difficult to follow, and found myself re-reading paragraphs to better understand it. At first I believed the theme to be that of a love story, but further reading brought me to find the main theme, which was the American dream in the 1920's. The dream was to become wealthy and socially excepted by a higher class, even if it meant going against your morals. I think I like this novel because I can relate the dream of the 1920's to be very similar to that of today. This connection helped me to stay interested and better understand what the theme was about.My favorite character was Nick Carraway even though he had no desire to achieve this dream. He possessed a very strong character and did not give in to the immoral things his neighbors did, which separated him from the rest. Nick was the middle man and it was interesting to see how he learned of everyone's affairs, even his cousin's, which he had a hand in setting up. He was also the narrator, so his ideas and views influenced the reader's feelings about the story, as we saw the account from his point of view. This is the first novel that I have ever read where the main character was not in the beginning or end of the story. Nick was the person who was important in the beginning and end of the book, though he was not the main character. This approach was very appealing and pretty amazing. Jay Gatsby was another character that I found interesting. He was the main character of the story and was who the novel revolved around. He was a young man who made his millions illegally and only did it to win his long-life love back. And that is why at first I believed the theme to be about love.The ending of the novel was very attention grabbing. I would have never guessed it to end that way. I think the ending was the best part. It really showed the American dream and how immoral people can be to one another. The ending really made me think about my dreams and how I should be careful in all things I do and that I should always stick to my morals."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, The Great Gatsby is the story of Jay Gatsby's doomed obsession with Daisy Buchanan, a wealthy, married woman who had been his lover before the war.I rather liked the details that made the Jazz Age really come alive in this book.

But I did enjoy it and was impressed that such a charismatic story could be told in just over a hundred pages. Nick Carraway alone is enough to make me want to reread this book; I just loved his personality and his perceptiveness.Plus, the ending came as a surprise to me.

I would give it 10 if I could."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is one of the best books I have every read! Right now it is my favorite book! I personally think that this is F. Scott Fitzgerald&#65533;s greatest novel. The novel has been revised and some corrections have been made, because the first had some errors. If you have any of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#65533;s novels but not the &#65533;The Great Gatsby&#65533; then you are missing out!

I couldn't put it down from the second I started reading it. The characters are finely crafted and the storyline a hit as you meet Nick and Gatsby and the different lives they lead until one day they are both wonderfully and tragically intertwined. I found myself saddened to both the book ending and the outcome of the story but I have a greater respect for both F. Scott Fitzgerald and the 1920's because of reading it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel is a complex drama filled with passion and tragedy. Greed and the lust of power are very dangerous. A reflection of a darkening America, the book is more relevant today than it was in 1925."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"At only 182 pages in the paperback edition, The Great Gatsby looms far larger in the life of American fiction than its slim dimensions. Unlike many novels with a great deal of hype latched to them, Gatsby lives up to its reputation in every blessed way. Perhaps part of the staying power and widespread appeal of this work is that it and its author were nearly forgotten. This powerful work was hardly read for more than 25 years, and now it is widely assumed to be one of the greatest works of American fiction in the 20th century. It earned its kingdom through dark years. From amnesia to aggrandizement shows that behind the swirl of its reputation is a powerfully complete artistic vision. Like all great work, Gatsby can be read on many levels: as a critique of the shifting American psyche, as a critique of the pitfalls of capitalism, as a time capsule of the roaring 20's... each reading brings new surprises. Perhaps the most refreshing reading is the uniqueness of the language. Fitzgerald here created prose masterpiece. Every sentence is finely wrought and cleverly designed, like jewels in an exquisite setting. He created, as he stated, a consciously artistic achievement."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is not your typical fictional novel. In this book you will find mystery, excitement, rule-breaking, parties, and shady characters that surprise you with every turn- all of which I was not expecting when I began this book. F. Scott Fitzgerald added these elements in a 1920's setting- an era in which there were many social changes. The main theme presented in this book- you can't relive the past- is relevent even today. We all live in the here-and-now- what's in the past is in the past for a reason, and trying to alter that will cause problems for many people- as you will find in The Great Gatsby. We can all get something out of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, no matter your age!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is not a perfect novel. The characters are underdeveloped. It is difficult to care about some of them either way. The story line is melodramatic, and it does not break any new ground.However, the real joy of the book it the language it is written in. Try reading it aloud. You will appreciate the rhythm and the cadenza of how each paragraph is constructed. You will not find a book that evokes its settings more vividly than this one. This is a short book, but it is to be read slowly. Savor every moment. You will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read this book after having known the plot and ending, through another novel, The Double Bind by Chris Bohjalian. I figured it sounded interesting and thought I would read it for myself. Having known the ending didn't make for the most exciting read, but it was good. More than that, it was more about what the novel represented and did not say.I won't go through the plot. The 1920's were a fascenating time and this novel helped capture that. While it was also written during this period, it had very much a sound and tone of an older novel which did take a little getting used to. Overall, I'd describe it as a little more bland or plain spoken that what you might read today. The character development was done with finess and the story was brought along to the conclusion masterfully. Towards the end you just wanted to skip through to see how it would end.Overall it's a tragic tale. There's a lot of tragedy in the book, however it's interesting how the author choses to present this to us, in a matter of fact way. What really resonates with me is the topic of the past and how some of us are prisoners of it. And how often a first love, may be your only true love. The notion that maybe you can recapture this one day, is something I think many can relate to. Great novel, I'm glad I decided to finally get around to reading this classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald captured one of the great truths of American life: that a person can \\"reinvent\\" themselves. We are not bound by our accidents of birth. He also captured one of the sad truths: too many people spend their lives chasing an illusion. In Gatsby's case, it was the illuions of the happiness that comes from being in the \\"moneyed\\" class. If Fitzgerald were writing today, I would bet that Gatsby would be chasing celebrity culture, equally pointless and equally seductive to so many. The developing friendship between Nick and Gatsby is interesting to watch, as Gatsby at first tries to ingratiate himself with his money, and then realizes he doesn't have to and finally opens up to have a real friend. When Nick informs Gatsby that he is worth the lot of the rich put together, it is a culmination of something real, not the illusion. The book captuers the roaring 20's well, but can also translate easily into our time. It is justifiably considered a classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Did you ever want to go back? Back to those great times? That's what Gatsby wanted to do but he additionally wanted to CHANGE THE RULES too!This work is told from the perspective of a third party about a determined man, Gatsby, who fails to secure an early love, a vain immature gal, Daisy, and now that he's hit the big time and has become a high-roller, he wants his Daisy back (even though he never had her to begin with) -- and he's willing to go to any extreme to OWN her.The setting is the 20s, a period of excess and near social insanity in New York City in particular. Gatsby puts his plan into place and things go fine for awhile in that Daisy responds quickly to his overtures. But what Gatsby never figured on is that Daisy is a mile wide and an inch thick. She RE-responds to her husband's overtures to come back, albeit this act is spurred on by a personal tragedy and the death of a near-innocent.Gatsby, in the meantime, has inadvertently set into motion a chain of events over which he no longer exerts control and, ultimately, it leads to his demise.This book is arguably Fitzgerald's best work and it's bulging with symbolism and metaphor. It's a book that is set apart from most others of the period and now is thus referred to as \\"literature\\" -- quite the professionally written novel.It's not for everybody but if you're up for reading some great prose, you love scandal, and don't mind all the subtle ethical lessons that accompany the work, then this one is probably for you.Tom Wolf wrote a very similar work which was all about having rotten friends and the parallel excesses of a much more contemporary period, if you're interested:The Bonfire of the Vanities"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel may have a bit of a negative association for many past and present American high schoolers, myself included (two decades ago), who were forced to read it. And it is a touch boring. But other than that it's a great book, especially considering that the author was only 29 years old when it was published. It flawlessly captures the excesses of the roaring 1920s in the Hamptons of Long Island, through a group of characters who are each distinct and not easy to forget. The description of the wasteland surrounding the shop of the mechanic, George Wilson, is a very interesting way to contrast the lavishness of the Hamptons. And there actually is a fair amount of action in the plot that intensifies the psychological aspects of the story.

Gatsby who lives in a large mansion would throw tremendous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the insational love of the married Daisy Buchanan. During this story Gatsby follows his dream of getting Daisy back at any cost......even death of other people or himself as well. Fitzgerald's strong values and beliefs were clearly presented which is a very entertaining style to read. One thing I would criticise about this book is that the action of the story does not start until the fourth chapter, which discouraged my interest greatly."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Considered by many to be one of the greatest novels of our century, this book presents a vivid chronicle of the Jazz Age and is a tightly constructed work of literary genius. In the novel, Nick Carraway tells the story of his neighbor Jay Gatsby, a handsome bachelor who has amassed a fortune as a racketeer in order to build a Long Island mansion and give fabulous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the love of the married Daisy Buchanan.This book is a story of the American dream and Fitzgerald's basic belief that the dream has been degraded and corrupted until it almost seems to be foolish to aspire to that dream because it would just make one morally derelict. The lower orders that aspire to infinite and instant wealth are trying to adopt the values and standards of the established rich class, which are already corrupt. Fitzgerald felt that American idealism had been corrupted by embracing materialism as its means. Fitzgerald believed that we are in a vicious circle, that the established wealth is corrupt but the new rich adopt to the same ideals as the old rich and they become corrupt and join the established wealth and then the new group aspires to the established rich values and so on.A strong statement of the author's personal values and beliefs, it is also a highly entertaining read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is not a book soon forgotten. I read this book for a class of mine and totally fell in love with Fitzgerald's writing style. It is one that you can identify with so easily, as if you know exactly what he is talking about. The love story is somewhat common, that of a tragic nature, yet one truly feels completely saddened for young Gatsby at the end. Fitzgerald not only makes the reader eager to read, but you will find yourself eagerly grabbing for his other novels, all of which are equally superb."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald once wrote that a truly great writer should write &quot;for the youth of his own generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolteachers ever afterward.&quot; How prophetic! Although I wasn't born until 40 years after Fitzgerald's death, the messages he speaks are as clear to me as if he were speaking in my ear. this american literary masterpiece, with its rich themes of time, devotion and the american dream is well worth its praise. Fitz knew it was his best work, and it's a damn shame he couldn't live to see it gain the respect of the world. i reccomend that anyone who enjoyed this book read more on Fitzgerald's life and you'll want to check out the short story &quot;winter dreams&quot; which resembles gatsby in several ways.

It is a great read and moves very quickly.I read the book over 2 days during my recent vacation and thoroughly enjoyed it. The book brings alive characters that are often so present in our society and intertwines them in a great story. Fitzgerald has a great way with words. He describes things in such a way that you truly feel like you can see the person or object he describes.I could say more, however, I will leave you with this - - Just read the book. It is less than 200 pages and is definitely in my Top 10 of books."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"We listened to this while driving through Long Island reviewing wineries for About.Com, and it was the perfect accompanyment in so many ways. Fitzgerald's writing style is incredibly evocative - stirring vivid images in your mind of the mansions of East Egg, of the complex individuals that lived there and how they interacted. Each person presents one face to the world, while hiding a wealth of fears and desires. The scene where a car looses a wheel is one of my favorites - the witty way Fitzgerald turns words and plays with the individuals is just fantastic.This is definitely not a book to read 'on assignment', forced to hunt for meaning. It's a book to read in your 20s or beyond, when you see the way old loves can still call to you, when temptation strikes sometime to try to turn back the clock. But of course, you can't, as Fitzgerald demonstrates with such a wonderful style. There were so many scenes in this book that stood out as stellar, that sparkled in our minds.I think it's hard for a younger person to identify with some of the themes in here, just as it's probably hard for an older person to truly remember what it's like to be a teenager. It's the kind of book that, if you've lived through love and loss, battled years to achieve something you realize later wasn't worth it, you finish a passage and say ... &quot;Yes.

Let me tell you what I think.I guess that this novel come into the hands of today's readers mostly due to the fact that it has been designated as one of the U.S. literary icons of the XX Century. Undoubtedly, the precision to detail and the smoothness used by the writer to convey its ideas is fantastic. My problem with it, is that the drama in which the love story is build seems rather silly. We have a character like Gatsby who is a young fellow who decided to become rich the fast way (smuggling and other unidentified dirty business) to gain social recognition for the sole purpose of being worthy of a rich girl of whom he had fallen in love. Nevertheless, the author never takes the effort to outline why in ruthless 20's, when wild capitalism was on the rise and pragmatism was the only name of the game, a person like Gatsby, who is the living symbol of those forces, who have laid more women that he can remember and who have \\"known the world\\" from every possible angle, decides to waist his life in pursuit of a romantic love and challenge the husband of her beloved with the tact and style of a 14th year old. Such situation just takes away all credibility to the drama. I guess the novel became important for the reasons so many of the other reviewers have expressed.

Scott Fitzgerald, is a well written novel that explores the everyday life of a town through the eyes of an outsider. This onlooker sees not only the town, but every detail that paints a picture, for the reader, of the town and its people. The authors use of imagery is very good, because he uses great detail to from the smallest item to the largest disaster. He describes, in one part, a simple billboard for T.J. Eckelburg's, who is an eye doctor. Fitzgerald describes the billboard which has a great big pair of glasses with two eyes starring through, yet this is not only a good ad, but it also describes the town by a simple picture. These eyes describe, that everybody is watching everybody, and all is seen sooner or later. Through his use of imagery, a metaphor is produced, and the glasses and eyes are those of mainly Nick who sees all, but also of the townspeople, who sooner or later see all that has happened. This imagery also is used at the end of the book when the town is described as the fire is burning it down. This helps paint a mental picture of the destruction the fire did to all the buildings and the few people still alive in the town. All in all this book was a very good book because of its use of imagery which placed the reader with in the story making that much more exciting."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald proves why he is one of the biggest names of the Roaring '20's. He perfectly captures the elegance and hedonism of the period between World War I and the Great Depression.

This would make an excellent resource for anyone wishing to get a better grip on the 1920's."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I consider myslelf well read. I bought this book knowing it was a classic (I love classics). I expected it to be more entertaining. For one thing it's very dated. I had trouble understanding what was going on most of the time. Another thing were it's racial undertones. The way mister Wolfheim was portrayed (a shady selfish businessmen) is an obvious anti-semantic stereotype. I couldn't get myself into the story because the characters were unlikable. I found myself checking the clock more than reading the story.

Like Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises, both drew world-wide acclaim, but for me neither went anywhere. That is to say there was an absence of substance. Another tale by a sad author about pathetic rich folk in the 1920's. I suppose the story is worth reading just to lay claim to that fact, for boasting purposes. It is short and from time to time there is a smidgeon, contrary to what I said earlier, of depth.Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin.

I found it interesting how closly Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil imitates this book. They both go over the interesting characters that at some point merge to become a conflicting story of right and wrong. Wait, isn't that the main storyline for almost all books. I guess they seemed more alike since I read them back to back. Well, The Great Gatsby did seem to be on the verge of all of the modern convienences of the 1920's. I wonder if changing cultures brings about different thoughts on the definition of a classic book. This book was a so-so read and wasn't real captivating.

Scott Fitzgerald expresses his idea of being great as Nick Carraway arrives to the West Egg to experience the new life in the city. After adapting to this new world, Nick is acquainted with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan; his cousin's husband, Tom Buchanan and his cousin's friend, Jordan Baker. Nick quickly realizes that his new acquaintances have been negatively influenced by wealth. Then Nick is introduced to the extremely wealthy, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby had already shown signs of generosity as he gladly accepted anyone to his elaborate parties. Gatsby was a mysterious, yet composed man which appealed to Nick. Nick felt safe around Gatsby and grows close to him, only to be caught in between a love conflict characterized with dishonesty, disloyalty, and overall debauchery. The events that follow all lead downhill as it eventually results to violence. The reader witnesses the human corruption in The Great Gatsby as Fitzgerald effectively warns the reader of the doomed outcome that results to those who rapaciously seek money. The characteristics between the country life and city life are distinguished by Fitzgerald as Nick journeys from the comfortable country to the rapid pace city life and eventually illustrates that to be considered \\"Great\\" is to focus on a certain goal rather than being distracted by greed of wealth. During Nick's time living the fast life of the city, Fitzgerald not only warns the readers, but the readers are also able to observe the attributes that make a \\"Great\\" man."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book The Great Gatsby by F.

However, did this \\"fallen angel\\" have the right to pursue happiness? Was his pursuit of true love fortunate or unfortunate? The content or plot of the story would tell us that love was the greatest link.As for Gatsby's real profession, the people despised and looked down on him. In spite of this, this was the one area in which we admired him for. When the people who lived in America during the 1920s were carried away and charmed into vanity, Gatsby did not lose his inner self - his na?vet? and his high or lofty ideals. He was still a person of principle and was still punctilious about his dreams. Even if he would lose every thing for the love of his life, he would have no regrets at all.What was the drive or impulse that led a person to be so dedicated or devoted? What could possibly be the cause that led a person to be so persistent with his or her faith? It is very hard for us to love others as we love ourselves. At certain times, we feel that it's not worthwhile to pay our love and affection. For that reason, I admire and sympathize with Gatsby even more. Throughout his whole life, love had always been both a burden and a reward (for him.) Love is an ongoing lesson in life in which all of us are obliged to learn.Though this story did not contain positive and inspirational characters, the content of this book may direct the readers towards a deeper understanding of the main character's na?vet? and purity, and then guide or bring out the love within the readers' hearts."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of thse books that seem so confusing in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, you learn to enjoy, and eventually, love.Almost everything that happens in the book is completely ironic because in the end, everything is just the opposite of what the author leads you to expect. Even the way the story is written is ironic because although the author uses all kinds of deep and meaningful descriptions about everything, the things he is writing about are the extreme shallowness and pretentiousness of the people who live in that time. In a way, the story is a satire through and through.The whole story is a whirlwind of emotions and it practically turns everything from the mood to the environment to the people inside out, and all of it is told from a single person's point of view, which makes it all the easier to imagine that you are actually the one thinking those thoughts.Also, it becomes very easy to relate to the story when you realize that even if the story takes place in a time long before, every kind of flaw in man is still present today, and a lot of them are featured in the very colorful characters from The Great Gatsby. Traits like immaturity, lovesickness, carelessness, snobbery, etc, were present then and are still present now, and once you realize that you will be able to enjoy the pure humor in the book that the author is probably trying to present to us.The Great Gatsby is one of the most obscure books that I have ever read, and yet after I read it, a lightbulb appeared in my head and now that I understand it's message, I know that I really enjoyed it and the challenge was wortht the read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It's a small paper back book, but a classic non-the-less.

My comments assume the reader is familiar with the book; if you don't want to know how it turns out, etc., don't read any further...I read it with my son; this year's High School English theme - aside from the trite \\"tolerance\\" theme that has plagued English Lit courses for years now - is apparantly \\"obsessive love,\\" because the previous title he was assigned was \\"Snow Falling on Cedars.\\" In that work, a character named Ishmael spends years obsessing over a lost love, as Jay Gatsby does over Daisy. Well, my review of that book points out that the object of Ishmael's love, Hatsue, was no great prize... but let me tell you, Hatsue is a Living Saint compared to Daisy!Talk about a cold, unfeeling bitch: Daisy uses Gatsby for the sole purpose of making her unfaithful husband Tom jealous. She knows the full measure of Gatsby's obsessive love for her, but doesn't even bother to drop him a line after deciding to stay with Tom after all (despite having announced just the opposite a few hours earlier to everyone!). Hell, she doesn't even go to Gatsby's funeral mere days later.The circumstances of that decision - Daisy accidentally runs over Tom's mistress (I had to laugh out loud at that - figures that of all the people in the world she could hit, it would be the mistress!) while in a car alone with Gatsby - and its aftermath underscore just what a really despicable person she was. Nick Carraway (the narrator) catches a glimpse of Tom and Daisy together the evening of the accident, when Gatsby is waiting outside their house to make sure Tom isn't abusive to Daisy after her announcement that she would leave him. And what does Nick see? Why, Tom and Daisy are apparantly \\"not happy, but not unhappy.\\" Well, EXCUSE ME? Not unhappy?? Daisy just killed somebody... somebody that just happens to be Tom's lover... and, Daisy a mere few hours earlier told Tom she was leaving him for Gatby. But they've NOT \\"unhappy?!!\\"What a couple of cynical, unfeeling, uncaring, cold blooded creeps. And the mistress is not the only person they kill: as it so happens, the mistress's husband wants revenge, and Tom sics him on Gatsby (omitting the small point that it was Daisy that was driving). The book doesn't say so explicitly, but I have to wonder if Daisy wasn't aware that Tom had just sent the husband after Gatsby... and doesn't even bother to warn him - just like she doesn't even bother to show up for his funeral after said husband shoots him dead. Truly, a mind numbing, nauseating omission on her part.Truly, Gatsby spent that night \\"watching over nothing,\\" as Nick puts it.(Nick narrates that when he watched them, it appeared as though they were \\"conspiring.\\" About what? Putting blame for the accident on Gatsby? Sending the widowed husband his way? After the glimpse into the the sort of people they are, one wonders...)Nick is quite right when he narrates that Daisy and Tom were careless people that hurt others and then retreated \\"into their wealth\\" or \\"whatever it was that kept them together.\\" What a couple of miserable losers, even if they were rich.Oh, and let me add... one of the other reviewers stated that the book \\"shows signs of Fitzgerald's racism.\\"I have no idea what this reviewer means by that. In point of fact, Fitzgerald takes pains to create anti-stereotypes: A Jewish gangster - and indeed, there were WERE Jewish gangsters during the Prohibition Era - turns out to be one of the few decent people in the book. Rich black people chauffered by a white driver - what an image, for the 1920's! - make an appearance in New York City. Tom Buchanan, rich scion of a WASP patrician family turns out to be brutal, boorish, dishonest... and a racist fretting over too many non-white people. The narrator even specifically calls his racial ideas \\"stale.\\"Sorry, calling Fitzgerald racist is slanderous.This is a great book, astonishingly well written and plotted.

As it turns out, it is a legitimate classic, and I consider it to be one of the best books I've ever read.I won't dispute the fact that Fitzgerald's racism sneaks into the novel, but we have to accept that the pseudoscientific basis for that racism was a part of the times (and an aristocratic trend to boot). Beneath that trivial detail there is a sea of worth to be gleaned from The Great Gatsby. It addresses a very human (and perennially American) desire to return to better and happier times of the past, and a feeling that very much embodies the 20s.The modern reader should have little trouble discerning the distasteful qualities (which appropriately only appear in Tom); racism certainly isn't condoned with any validity here.

It was also weird how he could keep his love for Daisy over all the years. Daisy was a very emotional character and I didn't like her very much for that. She was always unhappy about something during the book. When everything seemed alright and when she seemed happy something would upset her. I found this sort of annoying and that is why I didn't like Daisy as a character. Nick was a fairly shy character and he was my second favorite. He always went along with what was happening and never caused too many problems. He was very down to earth and I like that about him.The setting seemed very old fashioned to me. Gatsby's Mansion seemed to be very cool though, almost like a castle. I liked his mansion and the basic setting of the book.The plot was my favorite out of all. I was very bored throughout the book until the end. This is where it went 180 degrees and everything fell apart. I loved when Gatsby and Tom got into a fight because it staged the killing of Myrtle. This put some spice into the book and I was suddenly interested. George then thought that Gatsby had hit and killed his wife. When George came down to Gatsby's house it was very suspenseful. I liked when George shot Gatsby and then committed suicide.Overall I liked this book a lot. I would recommend it to anyone interested in reading it. It was also one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I thought this book was overall a pretty good book to read, for teenagers my age. They had alot of interesting things going on in the book, such as, Tom and Daisy's affairs, Gatsby falling in love with Daisy,and Myrtle being hit by a car, and random parties at the gatsby's mansion.. As teenagers you can relate to wanting to be rich and famous, like Gatsby dreamed, and also going to parties and falling in love."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Although F. Scott Fitzgerald claimed that his 1925 novel in titled The Great Gatsby was to be his \\"greatest masterpiece\\", in the opinion of at least one reader the book fell disappointingly short of his highly optimistic, and probably unrealistic, expectations. The Great Gatsby is often heralded as one of the \\"great\\" and \\"exemplary\\" literary works in American history, but in my opinion as a reader it is simply flawed and uninteresting. And even though my opinion may not fall into the category of mainstream sentiment towards the novel, take it as a viewpoint less explored, yet still like any other, valid nonetheless.I had no prior knowledge regarding The Great Gatsby prior to its introduction into my American Literature II class, but after seeing that it had received a vast amount of rave reviews as well as learning about its author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, I must admit I was intrigued by the prospect of a novel with lust, romance, friendships, lies among many other interesting occurrences. Fitzgerald commences his \\"masterpiece\\" in a very descriptive manner, at times overwhelmingly descriptive, by introducing to the reader his narrator Nick Carraway. Nick seems to be an honest and trustworthy narrator throughout the course novel, but in my opinion he refuses to speak of the harsh realities of life to Jay Gatsby, a person who he considers his friend. Nick is very observant and descriptive, qualities essential to any successful narrator of a novel, but at times, Fitzgerald goes over board allowing Nick to ramble on about scenery and how he feels towards certain character's actions and feelings. Some readers may enjoy detail, but excess detail, from my vantage point, makes the story needlessly long and a strenuous read. I in particular do not appreciate it when an author forces me to continue reading a story that seems to take forever to develop.Another aspect aside for the excess detail used by Fitzgerald, is his weak and clich&eacute; storyline. Its been done, honestly, William Shakespeare wrote this same type of story a while back, Fitzgerald simply chose to give it a twist by moving the setting to the roaring twenties, but unfortunately that added little excitement to a boring and unoriginal story. I will try not to give away any of the major portions of the storyline, but still explain why I feel this way towards The Great Gatsby, and the way it was written. First off the characters are all, in the words Holden Caufield in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in The Rye, \\"phonies\\", prototypical aristocrats of the 1920's, much like F. Scott Fitzgerald himself. That includes the narrator Nick, who leaves the rural mid-west for a life of glamour in the \\"capital of the world\\" NYC. I personally had a difficult time relating to their personalities and their various \\"issues\\". Another aspect that makes the story dull and repetitive is its \\"classical\\" love hook. This is a feeble attempt by Fitzgerald to add spice to an otherwise tasteless novel. Its unoriginal, and not what I expected from one of the best authors in American literature.Now I will not tear the novel to shreds or call it a waste of time, but I rather watch grass grow than reread The Great Gatsby. If you as a reader are able to overlook the excess descriptions given by Nick throughout the novel, the predictable storyline, and the abrupt and disappointing ending, then you will love this book, maybe even consider it as one of your all-time favorites. But I for one would like to forget I ever read it. If The Great Gatsby is F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"greatest masterpiece\\" maybe we should reconsider his status as one of the best writers in American Literature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a piece of literature that shows that man has a chance at success and fortune and/or a chance at a solid relationship. Money and success in a goal for the ambitious, and F. Scott Fitzgerald hit this hard. However, the 3 out of 5, is because this book is lacking in excitement and adventure. This book is for the people that enjoy detailed parties and a man looking for a future. But, I had to give credit where credit is due. Fitzgerald is a brilliant writer, although he writes with a style that; leaves you to organize the event.These events will determine if you will trust the character Jay Gatsby in the end. I hope you will enjoy this book more then I did."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Bottom Line is THIS: Twentieth Century Masterpiece, NO; 2 days of incrediably wasteful reading i will never get back, YES!!! Lets just say that I created my own &quot;Valley of Ashes&quot;, its called a burnt up copy of The Great Gatzby in my dumpster outside my house. Upon finishing the novel found myself contemplating who was driving whose car, who was kissing who, and who shot who. Then an incredible idea dawned on me:I couldn't give two $#!ts. The book is a confusing roller coaster ride of creepy behind the scenes love affairs, convoluted past relationships, and the inconsequential and oddly enough santimonious attractions to mysterious green lights,wealth, and a never ending desire for the ultimate twentieth century American ideal: A big house, a big wallet, and a big Rolls Royce in the driveway. Twenty pages from the end when I discovered that the old windbag Gatzby had been murdered (YES!!! I do take pleasure in ruining the ending to millions of eager readers out there), I closed the book and ended the worhtless drivel once and for all. All in all, I have to say that I don't take any shame in saying that the only satifaction I got from reading the book was when i found out that Gatzby is dead. I guess I'll just make up the two days i wasted reading Fitzgerald's book by writing condolence letters to Fitzgeral'd unfortunate relatives.

But it is submerged in such a wordy, tedious, self-absorbed monotone that the reader can only appreciate it in retrospect, when they have dragged it out of the muck, shaken it free of detritus and seen its bare form.Prose, be damned.

The language is vulgar and archaic, with words such as &#34;gay&#34; and &#34;excitement&#34; used completely erroneously. Fitzgerald could not even be bothered to spell gaiety correctly, though I suppose that is as much his editors' and publishers' fault as his own. This book was unpopular when it was written and is unpopular now, so why do we teach it in our schools? Do we really want our children to emulate ANY of the characters or &#34;virtues&#34; conveyed by this book? First, we have the main character, Nick Calloway, who is so spineless and passive that he doesn't speak up even when it would have saved Gatby's life. Next, we have Tom and Daisy Buchanan who are so out of touch with reality that they can't even realize how pathetic their marriage actually is. Last, but certainly not least, comes Jay Gatsby, also known as James Gats. Gatsby is living a seventeen-year-old's dream whichwould be fine, if he were seventeen rather than thirty, but is total folly at his age. Besides these few specific characters, the cast as a whole demonstrates a blatant disregard for laws big and small, from abolition to murder."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I hated this book with a passion. I am a sophmore in high school and was made to read this book for class and I despised every minute of it. Maybe it's a book for an older crowd, I don't know, but it was a complete waste of my time. The love story was predictable and the characters were obnoxious. I like books when I can fall in love with at least one character. That was not the case with this book. My advice- don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"They say a book can never get old, and with age they become classics. The Great Gatsby is a prime counterexample of this.In my opinion, a book that is entertaining and exciting needs to stretch the mind. It needs to use great imagination. Imagination makes mystery and murder novels scary and thrilling. Imagination makes a sci-fi interesting. What is there to imagine about The Great Gatsby? There are murders, but not very unique ones. If I wanted to read a good murder mystery, I would go to Thomas Harris. As for the love story The Great Gastby is placed around, I see this as the only conflict in the book. Every event in the entire book was based on this unrealistic relationship between Daisy, Tom, and Jay.To conclude, I would expect this story in a 1920's newspaper rather than being a mass produced as a \\"classic\\" novel. The only use I have for this book is a sleeping-pill substitute."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Okay.

Some, on the other hand, may feel the need to be grounded in literature so rich and provocative that upon returning to contemporary fiction, they then have a yardstick with which to compare. Others, still, may derive and extract lost emotions that only the classics can emote.Whatever vehicle drives one back to consider \\"Gatsby\\", the outcome can only lead to some interesting and, perhaps, novel conclusions. This reader's motivation, for example, was a recent reading of Dan Okrent's marvelous account of the bootlegging \`20's in \\"Last Call\\" a history of prohibition wherein Okrent describes disparate characters very much similar to Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby and the socio-culture of the \\"jazz-age\\" that is depicted so eloquently in \\"Gatsby\\". Whatever the engine, returning to this prodigious work by Fitzgerald, the reader is again struck by the grandiloquence of the wording, the grandeur of the scene setting, the power of the plot and the gut-wrenching and heartfelt sensibilities of the narrator as he and thus the reader are dragged along in a story so strong and powerful, we immediately recognize the brilliance of Fitzgerald as an archetype fiction writer and also, then, the work of \\"Gatsby\\" as his literary masterpiece.True, there are criticisms that have abounded for decades...the character development especially for Daisy and Tom Buchanan are almost deplorably one dimensional. Some of the criticisms of Gatsby follow this same line...he appears to be horribly shallow and unfeeling; immature in an unsettling way as to drive the reader to wonder what Daisy (no mature stalwart herself by any standard) ever saw in him. Also, the tragic Wilson's are almost laughable in their lack of earnestness and believability...Fitzgerald provides an antagonist that is almost too downcast, too disconsolate to be believable.And yet it all works. The overall drive for this work and, undoubtedly, the reason it has reached mythic proportions as a literary classic, is the nuanced and almost transcendent interventions of the narrator Nick Carraway. His profound and reasoned observations seemingly tie everything together. He is what makes this book work. Fitzgerald, after further consideration, probably had this in mind all along...if that was his intent, he truly was a genius.So whatever your compulsion, go back to West Egg, Long Island; enjoy an evening at the Gatsby mansion and immerse yourself in the early \`20's jazz age once again while experiencing expert literary storytelling. You'll undoubtedly find yourself marveling at the genius of F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work along with all the rest of us."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I often feel you can judge a book by the first and last lines.

It is relatively short for a novel yet it is an epic in ideas and idealism centering around the American Dream.

Scott Fitzgerald: The Great Gatsby, a critical guide from Columbia University Press. Though it's unsourced, it sounds legitimate - which is why I doubt I can say much about Fitzgerald's work that hasn't already been said. However, except for briefly commenting on the novel's classic status, the reason I've written this review is to assist those who, like me, may have avoided 'Gatsby' for years, and to help them decide whether to keep on doing so.I sidestepped 'The Great Gatsby' because I believed that this book, universally acknowledged as a classic, had to make its appeal for that standing to the broadest possible base of readers - an American Literature primer, so to speak. High-handed, maybe, but I've basically the same opinion since finishing the book as before. That doesn't mean 'Gatsby' isn't an excellent construction, full of interesting themes and motifs, and above all an insightful opinion on the American Dream - which I expected - but as an introduction to literature, I wonder what resonance 'Gatsby' carries for young readers confronted with the book today.Jay Gatsby, the self-made man, built out of nothing but now able to buy anything except the one thing he wants - Daisy Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the voice of reason, narrates the events - how Gatsby and Daisy, lovers before the war, are reunited; but despite all of Gatsby's attempts, he fails to lure her away from her philandering husband. Nick, disgusted with the excesses and unseemliness of both Gatsby's party crowd and Daisy's old money blue bloods, eventually decamps westward, returning symbolically to the common sense of America's heartland.It's not surprising that 'The Great Gatsby' wasn't successful in Fitzgerald's lifetime. After all, he chastised the people most likely to read his book for being part of the anything goes culture. Nor is it remarkable that there was a rediscovery of 'Gatsby' after World War II. In the Twenties, Nick Carraway was a perceptive man, and Gatsby a nave and complicit victim of the American Dream. In the years since, Nick looks like an altruistic fool, and, in the ultimate irony, Gatsby, who was facetiously called 'Great' by Fitzgerald, has grown into his title. Viewing his life now, it's difficult not to say that he conquered the Dream as he acquired a vast wealth, and his willingness to sacrifice everything for Daisy becomes a tragic flaw - instead of one last symbol in a poorly directed life.Fitzgerald warned that the pursuit of wealth wasn't enough, that it couldn't buy dreams - now the dream *is* the pursuit of wealth. Those tasked with presenting 'Gatsby' to succeeding generations must face a wall of misunderstanding - how to convince people that the wealthy Gatsby's inability to buy back his past amounts to failure? Or more importantly, why he even wanted to with all he already had. I'm glad that's not my job.In the end, though, I find a distinct lack of emotion in Fitzgerald's examination of the American Dream - it is instead an almost clinical post-mortem. No matter what the tragic circumstances surrounding the end of Gatsby are, I just can't muster up enough interest to care one way or the other. As a literature primer, it works because of Fitzgerald's skill as a wordsmith - as an effective or affecting work, instead of great, it is sufficient.This edition, with a preface and endnotes by Fitzgerald biographer Matthew Bruccoli, promises to be the \\"Authorized Text\\", a reprint of the Cambridge University Press 1991 edition. In a brief note, Mr. Bruccoli gives a few examples of some of the corrected textual errors, but I couldn't see much difference. Bruccoli's preface and the publisher's afterward were both interesting without becoming tiresome, though the endnotes seemed geared toward an inexperienced and ill-read student. Thankfully, the text wasn't dotted with superscript notation indicating entries in the endnotes, which I find very distracting. Overall, I doubt there's enough to distinguish this edition from a mass-market publication, except that it's in the trade paperback format, which I prefer if I plan to keep a book, and which is easier on the eyes the older I get."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I used this with my class of special education students (high school).

Scott Fitzgerald claimed to despise. He is both the quintessential Jazz-Age writer and probably his era's harshest critic. Complex and timeless. Who could ask for more?My favorite passage -\\"Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\\""},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I first read this one years ago, in high school I believe, and I liked it well enough then. But it was soon eclipsed in my mind by Joyce's works. And Hemingway's. Against the works of these latter authors, Fitzgerald's GATSBY seemed to me to be rather ordinary, old fashioned if you will . . . albeit a nicely honed piece of prose.There is, indeed, a certain artifice to the Gatsby story which smacks of the writer's intentions, an intrusive \\"plottiness\\" reflecting coincidences which are not at all the way things really work in life. And yet for all that, the story is strongly told, moving and lyrical, and the characterizations, as I found on re-reading the novel at my wife's urging, far more subtle than I recalled from my high school days. GATSBY is the story of a mystery man who dreams of a wealthy debutante he met years before, when he was an impoverished young soldier, and whose entire life since has been dedicated to winning her. To do this he has earned millions of dollars in the heyday of racketeering and prohibition (how is never quite made clear) and, at the time the novel is set, is engaged in creating an upper class persona for himself, in order to be worthy of the woman he loves.Of course, as Fitzgerald, through his narrator, the Midwestern transplant and aspiring bond salesman, Nick Carraway, shows, it is not Gatsby who needs to be made worthy at all. There is a certain melodrama to the tale which kind of blunted the edge for me but, on balance, the overwrought tragic overtones in the careless hit and run accident that brings all to a head are more than balanced out by the insight vouchsafed to us by Nick when he tells Gatsby, near the end, that the whole lot of them are not worth Gatsby alone. Gatsby wanders off distractedly to meet his undeserved destiny, thereafter, and Nick remains to pick up the pieces, packing up and returning home to the Midwest in disgust, and something akin to despair, at the human condition when, at last, the full import of what has occurred comes home to him.Fitzgerald had set out to craft a gem with this novel and he succeeded. Though it has flaws, the powerful insight and the polished, lyrical prose more than make up for them, setting this book firmly in the constellation of great American novels.SWM"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is a literary classic.

Overall, it was an easy read, and for the most part, a light-hearted, entertaining story. It had an interesting plot with remarkable characters to support it. Even though it was written almost a century ago, it is still easy to appreciate Fitzgerald's ideas and style of writing.The book was very well written for many reasons. I liked the fact that it was a first person narrative. I personally enjoy first person novel because I think that the insight of the narrator makes the reader relate to the story more, as opposed to the neutral position of a third person story. The narrative offered details vivid enough to easily imagine the setting. I was not familiar with the setting in New York, but the descriptiveness was clear enough for me to picture the scenes. Also, the writing style was excellent at using setting as a device to convey emotion, and in a few instances, foreshadowing. The plot is fast moving and I really enjoyed the unexpected plot twist towards the end. The small side plots that arose between the supporting characters sustained my interest also. The story was very much to the point, and did not at any time drag on.The strongest part of the writing was the development, connections, and introduction of the characters. Nick Cattaway fits the role of the narrator perfectly and provides a central connection among all the other characters. It allowed me to feel more sympathetic towards the characters because of Nick's sympathy for his friends. The order in which he introduces the characters and then slowly revealed how their lives were intertwined made for a very interesting story. My favorite of the introductions was the surprisingly low key intro to Gatsby. However, this character was the only one that I wasn't satisfied with, and proved to be the only flaw I found with the book.The lack of development of the character of Gatsby was very disappointing for me. After such a unique entrance, in addition to the title, I expected much more than the book offered. Although more is revealed about Gatsby as the story progresses, I still didn't feel a connection to the character. Since Gatsby was intended to be a mysterious character, that may be the reason the lack of information about him. However, there seemed to be a true depth missing that was hinted at, but was never fully communicated. This was especially true in the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy. The intensity of Gatsby's feelings seemed to be glanced over.Besides that minor negative point, the book was very good, and as a said before I recommend it to anyone looking for a short but enjoyable book to read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This was a book that stayed with me long after hearing it read. I found Gatsby to be a very intriguing character because of his singleminded passion. I enjoyed understanding the thoughts and ideas of Carraway.

The answer is more than just Fitzgerald's wonderful prose or his use of imagery to convey messages. The answer lies in the way the characters in this novel teach us to look more closely at ourselves and our lives and notice things we might otherwise have missed.The novel's narrator, Nick, opens by telling us that he \\"tends to reserve all judgements\\" of people until he has gotten to know them. From this introduction, we come to see the flaw in Nick's reasoning. For he does judge people, though he chooses to remain silent about it, and we see his judgements as he introduces us to the people in his life. It seems that everyone around Nick is obsessed with money, particularly his second cousin Daisy and her husband Tom. Nick introduces Tom and Daisy by telling us that they \\"drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together.\\" This excellent sentence tells us pretty much everything we need to know about Tom and Daisy, and the events that follow do little to change this perception. And then there's Gatsby. Wealthy, popular, mysterious Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties at his mansion and seems to be totally in control of his life. And yet he longs for something more: to be with Daisy, the woman he loves. But is he really in love with Daisy, or is he only in love with the person he thinks she is? This question plagues us as we read, watching Gatsby's facade crumble as he pursues Daisy throughout the novel. We know that something terrible is going to happen, we just don't know what it is. Yet we know that the relationship is doomed; Daisy doesn't love Gatsby, she is in love with his image. And through Nick's eyes, her true character is revealed. We see that although Daisy is beautiful, she is also cold, caring only for herself and her own happiness. Her true love is money, and she's married to a man who can provide her with what she truly loves. She cares little for the consequences of her actions. Nick's final assesment reads, \\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-they smashed up things and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...\\"The lesson is powerful and important: things aren't always what they seem. The bible says that the love of money is the root of all evil, and we see this played out in the lives of these characters. In the end, Nick realizes that some things are more important, and so he has resolved to go on with his life and learn from Gatsby's mistakes. We, the readers, are touched and changed. That is why this book is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I had to read this book in high school as a Junior and I didn't really get into it. In fact I really coasted through the book without really following it too closely. I decided to reread it and I was much surprised by how much I liked this novel.Fitzgerald has created a great portrait of a tainted American Dream. Through his character Jay Gatsby we see how the ideals of society have been corrupted. Gatsby made his fortune by dubious means, and pursues irrationally Daisy Buchannan, a very vapid individual who comes to tears over shirts. This is also symbolic of his the futile pursuit of happiness.Though this novel was written in the 20's, the message is still timeless. Anyone who thinks this is dated has not looked at the society we live in. We are practically in another me generation. People today don't have a care in the world. Having recently finished high school and being currently in college I have witnessed the sort of carefree vapid sense that most young people have. They don't have a collective thought in their heads other than drinking and partying. They also don't seem to care who they hurt in the process, sort of like Daisy and Gatsby in the car.The only drawback I can possibly see with this wonderful novel is the technical skills. They aren't great but they don't detract from the story. Fitzgerald does use a limited perspective and he does follow a cohesive plot, so the technical writing isn't too terrible.Overall this is one of the top 10 books I have ever read, and I have read quite extensively. So don't listen to the negative reviews, read this novel and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald is mainly known as a jazz age writer, as an observer of the flappers and his work is considered to be stuck in the past. Nothing could be further from the truth. This novel captures the American spirit in all its confused idealism, its expansive dreaming and scheming, the corruption in its childlike innocence and its penchant for pressing into the future without examining the past. The old money and its callous cop-out policies are still practised by the ones who can buy second chances as symbolized by the established Buchanans while neurotic upstart Gatsby is the forerunner of every motivated small town boy who makes it against the odds and finds out that although everything is for sale, including a brand new identity , all the power and all the glitz can't buy back the wasted youth or the heart of the ones who had their finger on the pulse of opportunity and rationale. The closer Gatsby gets to his dream the more remote its core becomes;not unlike an emotional fata morgana. Nick Carraway is the chronicler of this tragedy of illusion and leaves the wiser for having the veil lifted and seeing nothing more than a poor boy's broken heart in the swimmingpool of vodka and blood. The Wilsons from the wrong side of the track are a brilliant signifier of how the priviledged amuse themselves with the hardscabble folks for diversion but can effort to cut them at a moment's notice. Having means won't buy you love or real friends but it will buy you a clean slate again and again until you run out of real estate. Gatsby's real estate is his heart's yearning so he dies desolate because he bought the motivational speech and was never told that the new continent and all its attentant promises might make room for a new brand of hero but it can't change the human heart.A classic in the best sense of the word. A Greek myth remade to fit the size of the new world."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Most reviews of this book talk of nothing but the love affair of Daisy and Jay Gatsby. They never speak of the off balance, really modern relationship of Nick Carraway and Jordan Baker. Carraway is by far the character to watch, and the one that makes this book interesting. His constantly changing relationship to Gatsby is strictly human. Reading this book from the twenties is like reading a book from the nineties. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was far ahead of its time, and so was Nick Carraway and the relationships flooded throughout the book.The gossip aspect is very modern as well. Everyone at Gatsby's parties follow him around because of mystery. And that's what Jay Gatsby is about. Mystery. Even when the book is over, you never fully understand him.Overall, a great book, but not the best ever."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's third and best-known novel, \\"Gatsby\\" is remarkable both for the degree of skill already evidenced by the 28-year-old writer and for the unmistakable turn of phrases, a hallmark of Fitzgerald's writing. My favorite aspect of Fitzgerald's prose is the way he was able to convey such precise shades of meaning, fearlessly crafting sentences that though wordy perfectly capture a character's emotions or a memory's effect.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is, essentially, a tragic story of love gone wrong. Is a lie told out of love less censurable than those told for lower reasons? Gatsby spins a cocoon of lies around himself, a cocoon from which he hopes to emerge as a new man worthy of Daisy's love. He emerges instead into a world of liars, and though on the face of things he is the biggest grifter of them all, Gatsby alone elicits sympathy: there is a degree of absolution due the creator of such a colossal deception. It is almost as if one is begging to be found out. Neither Tom nor Daisy nor Jordan nor even the unhappily married Wilsons have any such claim on our understanding. In the course of this story everyone lies to everyone else: only Gatsby pays the price. The truly creative liar is punished, the everyday tellers of banal lies go unchecked.I personally preferred \\"Tender is the Night\\", perhaps only because its longer and more complex nature allowed Fitzgerald more room to perform, to draw on all the powers at his command. But \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is definitely a worthwhile read, a relatively short tale told with the ease of a colorful memory."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I am a 17 year old high school student and I just read the Great Gatsby this year for my English class.

This is nothing more than a romantic tale of Fitzgerals's longing to be one of the moneyed aristocracy, some of those people who had been around for a while. Was he happy to have talent and wealth? No, he wanted to be up there on the hill with the rich. What a cop out.Scott Fitzgeralds said to Ernest Hemingway \\"the rich, you know they are different to you and I\\" Ernie replied \\"yes they've got more money\\" and I reckon just for once that old braggart Ernie had hit the nail on the head.So what does Fiztgerald do, he has his hero Gatsby mysteriously get some money but no that is not enough because he is not part of society and he can only look at his long lost loves window over the water. It's the dilemma of the untouchable in India the Commoner in England buts its nonsense. Its not American its just because Scott was a whoos.

I am an educated woman and was an English major in college, so I don't think this book was \\"over my head.\\" I would gladly read Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Steinbeck, etc. over and over again, but I don't think I'll read Fitzgerald ever again!

Scott Fitzgerald is a fiction novel that took the world by storm. Nick, Jay Gatsby, Tom and Daisy Buchanan, Jordan a tangled mess of social relationships, some intended for love, some for friendships, others stemmed from old running love. Nick lives on West Egg, near the Gatsby mansion, Gatsby a man whom Nick comes to know well, as well as possible.Gatsby throws huge social gatherings that people come to even if not familiar with the man Gatsby himself. Nick goes to these gatherings and soon meets Gatsby and becomes friends of leisure. When reading of these lavish parties of Gatsby's F. Scott Fitzgerald makes you feel as though you have been there and wish to stay one second and leave the next by feelings of discomfort. But yet you will want to continue to read to see what is in store next.Gatsby throws these gatherings in hopes of meeting Daisy once again, for in the past they were lovers. Tom, who is Daisy's husband, is also Nick's old college buddy, is clueless of Gatsby's intentions with Daisy. Which Tom himself is not so faithful to Daisy. Nick agrees, not so whole heartedly, to help Gatsby and Daisy meet. As all of this falls into place Tom continues to see a mistress by the name of Mrs. Wilson, a woman who is married to a mechanic living in a dreary place. Meanwhile Nick starts to fall for a flirtatious and wildly mannered Ms. Jordan Baker. The parties continue to exist, and the company continues to fall into a social web of deceit and denial. As this all takes place you feel for Gatsby because of his longing for Daisy, but are struck by a weak appalling feeling for the way he seems to go about his business.As the story continues to fall into place some find true love, some find old love, while others find the truth. The plot thickens as a death occurs causing an uproar of suspension of motive and a scandalous cover up causing suspension and tension among the old acquaintances.F. Scott Fitzgerald throws twist and turns at you in this novel just when you think nothing else could happen. He has quite the talent for hooking a read and slowly reeling them in to feel every slight bump and jerk before reaching the shore, or the end. Which leads to another misfortunate death in the novel that was a great mistake, but yet made a great ending to a great novel that will have you intrigued from the first page to the last."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I fail to see why this book is such a literary rave.

It was a little bit too political for my taste. It seemed to take a long time forthings to happen. The book is very descriptive when it comes to setting. Every little detail is described, along with thoughts and feelings. I had a hard time keeping my attention focused. There was a lot of confusion as to what was going on with who, and where. Many parts of the book I had to go back and re-read to get a full understanding of it. The plot was decent, aimed more towards romantics than others. At times it seemed like one big soap. Overall if you have to read it, it is readable, if you are interested in life and the times, you'll like it, if your more into action and adventure, you won't find it here, however it's not a total waiste of time to read. The Great Gatsby is a very drematic book, and it holds a lot of truth.

Scott Fitzgerald is not by any means as talented as truly excellent writers like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells or Tolkien, but he manages a writing style which, if not involving, is at least amusing at times, even when he's not trying to be.The Great Gatsby starts out in two massive egg-like structures made for luxury on Long Island, in a futuristic setting almost reminiscent of an anime, and like an anime, starts with characters discussing things that promise great things from the story.Of all the characters found in the novel, only the narrator; a man known as Nick, is morally-upright to any noticable degree. This itself isn't so bad. I often like stories with a lot of evil characters. The problem is that very often in novels worth reading, evil characters either confront their evil tendencies leading to internal conflict, and/or are overcome by them, and it makes them interesting as a result.Really, that's my problem with this story.When dealing with Nemo or Griffin or Dorian Grey in truly excellent novels, we face characters who have been tainted by evil impulses, and as a result, their characters are interesting to watch as their evil impulses are in direct contrast to the parts of themselves that deep down, still desire to be good. These contrasts paint truly impressive pictures, especially since the characters themselves always manage to use their good and evil sides to bring something truly amazing to the story.Gatsby, Tom, Wilson and Daisy don't do that. The story plops the characters down in the middle of a city with what look to be the makings of an interesting picture, but it is missing the most important brush strokes. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; promises a truly phenomenal occurance that could shock and amaze, but, and this is entirely the fault of the author, it never really follows through on that. I was left feeling like &quot;what? Where's the 'Kaboom?'&quot; This book neither contained the depth to involve me emotionally, nor the thrill to get me excited, and I was disappointed with that. As I've said, Fitzgerald is, at times, unintentionally-humorous, but on the whole, this is a tedious read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I though it was a really bad book, and most of the other people that read it in school for L.A. with me also did not enjoy it. It could have left out many of the chapters in my opinion, most of them had no point. I read some of the other reviews, they said they couldn't put it down, but I dreaded the days we had to read from it for homework. I also didn't like his style of writing, the symolism was okay, but too deep for some people. I would not recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald did not create a masterpiece with this horrifying wonder of modern literature. In the story his over use of meaningless description and verbosity indicates to the reader that he was trying too hard, and it would be unrealistic to believe that this is a natural voice. As an example of writing style, I would expect it from someone in grade 6, with a dictionary. The sentences are basic and blunt, and interspersed with horrendously redundant words that were probably put there to make the author look smart, since they were more than 5 letters long of course!. If the author was alive, I would suggest he re-write the story without the blatant attempt at Dickens verbosity and write it in an actual voice that is readable and consistent."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"People rave about the brilliance of Fitzgerald. I was under the impression that the purpose of a novel was to entertain. I argue that a book that is painful to read, however perfect the style or structure, can never be 'brilliant.'It failed to entertain me and it failed to convey its fundamental mesage of social criticism. It is a waste of precious time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I really tried to get into this book. Sorry, I could not get past the shallow, dislikeable people and situations. Prose and symbolism are nothing if accompanied by a boring, unreadable plot. Maybe that is the point, but there are plenty of classic books that have it all: prose, symbolism, good plot, good characterizations, action, social commentary etc. It seemed like this book was an outline of a novel where the author sketched the main points, threw in some symbolism, then decided not to fill in the outline and create any depth to the story. Maybe that was the point, but it made the book really lacking. It does not require a thin, shallow book to portray thin, shallow people or times."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I fail to see why this book is such a literary rave.

I do not know why. I wasted much time reading critical appraisals, but they are all junk. So is this book. I don't care what anybody says there are *SEVERAL* parts that *DO* seem to be &quot;scribbled drunk&quot; and are nearly unintelligible. The book is filled with all kinds of errors, particuliarly chronological. There is also plenty of *PREJUDICE* and *RACISM* in this book. Wolfsheim is singled out as &quot;a small, flat nosed Jew&quot; despite the fact that he never mentions this. Nick also constantly refers to his &quot;tragic nose&quot;. What garbage. Also when Tom talks about the &quot;Superior Nordic Race nobody seems to care *IN THE LEAST* about the horrible things he is saying. Nick's maid is refered to as &quot;my Finn&quot;, which is so racist as to be almost unintelligible. Daisy and Gatsby are proposterous characters. The idea that they can never get together *MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHATSOEVER*. I don't care about society standards that is completely ridiculous. That Daisy would even think of staying with Tom dates this book *HORRIBLY* at the very least and more realitically turns into *A VIRTUAL CARTOON*. How and why Gatsby would do what he did is not believably in the least. Gatsby would never have gone to Oxford if he had truly cared about Daisy. The Confrontation makes absolutely no sense.

That is *THE WEAKEST WRITING I HAVE EVER SEEN.* Don't bother to read this book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This despairing novel set in New York in the 1920s addresses the hopelessness of the American Dream. The novel is centered around Jay Gatsby, a man who dreams of bringing back the past with the woman he loves.

Fitzgerald (1896-1940). Fitzgerald's original purpose for writing was to become wealthy and to impress his new wife, Zelda Sayre. Soon after his first book was published, he realized that he liked writing so much, he would make it his life-long profession.The Great Gatsby is a book that tells us the way of life and love during the twenties. The book's main character, Nick Carraway tells of life, from his 30 year old male's perspective. Nick, living in the lower middle class, moved east to New York in search of riches, but what he finds, is an unexpected wealth that will change his view of life forever.Fitzgerald wrote this book to present the Roaring Twenties or the Jazz Age. The twenties marked the decade where the American economy, and status levels, peaked. The rich were very rich, and the poor, very poor. Fitzgerald compared and contrasted these two groups very well. I believe what enabled him to do this was that during his life-time, he experienced both being rich, and being poor. Throughout the book, Fitzgerald contrasts the rich and the poor's status level. Through Nick, he talks about how the rich were looked up to and the poor were looked down on, with the exception of Nick's very wealthy next door neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Nick admire's Mr. Gatsby, he tells us this by writing about him, &quot;He has an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.&quot; In the same way, Mr. Gatsby treats Nick like he treats everyone. He is able to see past status and money, and look straight into the heart. As the story continues, Nick becomes Mr. Gatsby's best, and only true friend.This book also illustrates the racism and rivalry between blacks and whites during this period. Nick tells us about this as he is driving in Mr. Gatsby's Rolls Royce. &quot;As we crossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chachauffuer, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.&quot; Fitzgerald emphasized the race struggle many times during the book. One time, near the end, a fight breaks out over love. Jordan, exasperated at the immaturity of the two men, intently said, &quot;Come on, we're all white here!&quot;After Mr. Gatsby's death, Nick Carraway decided to travel back to his homeland in the west. As he was reflecting on the past few years, he suddenly realized that Mr. Gatsby had not only been a good freind, but also an excellent mentor. Mr. Gatsby had been trying to teach him by his example that money has little or nothing to do with wealth. Wealth comes from your heart, not your pocket.Though I thoroughly enjoyed the book, Fitzgerald's writing was very new to me. At times, it was confusing or did not seem complete. I must say however, Fitzgerald did an excellent job at answering all of the many questions that were brought up during this story. I now understand why his books were chosen to &quot;Speak for the 20's!&quot;"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I just dont get all the praise heaped on this book. There are some good passages, but in the end it left me sorely disappointed. Compared to Garcia Marquez or Proust just doesn't have a way with words. And shallow characters are given better treatment in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Despite its brilliant description of the American Jazz Age and its equally skilful characterisation, The Great Gatsby is primarily a novel of ideas. Underneath its simplistic overtones, lies a novel rich with both physical and symbolic action. Gatsby, the main character of the novel, is possessed by a magical fascination of wealth -- the substitution of attractive but false goals. In other words, he believes that youth (represented by his object of affection, Daisy) can be perpetually recaptured if one can merely make enough money. In this sense, Gatsby's vision is like the American dream itself. However, Nick, the narrator of the novel, is able to perceive and objectify Gatsby's idealism. He is capable of seeing clearly into the self-destructible nature of Gatsby's fascination. The novel's success is partially due to these two opposing sets of values and their clear, unambiguous nature. To fully appreciate this novel, I'd recommend reading scholarly critiques for a better understanding. You'd be surprised at how much this novel entails."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's prose style and tone are magnificent. He is a brilliant, unique writer in his use of language. If I were judging him on his use of language, it would be 5 stars, easy. His use of the language to me is as unique as Shakespeare, his narration as beautiful as Hemingway. But for plot development, oh the tragedy! His book begins slow (not too slow for those who like detail, though) and just as it builds to a climax--it ENDS! &quot;Great Gatsby&quot; has one of the most anticlimatic endings I've ever seen. Some books essentially have &quot;no ending,&quot; that is, no neat,tidy happily-ever-after ending. Those books don't bother me; their endings add to the emotional punch by leaving a sort of emptiness. But THIS book's ending was just hollow. It seemed that just as the book got exciting, it ended on a flat note. Here's my advice: for brilliant prose and truly original writing, in style and content, read Fitzgerald's &quot;This Side of Paradise.&quot; It has all of Fitzgerald's writing genius, but a fully developed storyline."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I was forced to read this book for my high school English class. It was an easy read--the book's not long and the language is not too difficult. I'd like to say that the concept's are not too difficult either, but I just don't know what those concepts were supposed to have been. I tried to read into it, but I just didn't get very far. I take that to mean that there wasn't too terribly much there.There was an added difficulty in the fact that I didn't like any of the characters. If you can't stand any of the people in a story, then you don't really care about what happens to them, and you start to skip large sections of stories that involve them....Anyway, I'll say this: It was OK.

Upon close scrutiny of Gatsby's actions it would appear that they all are leading up to how he could meet Daisy again. The main theme of the story."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby, a fiction novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a book about romance and the struggle to attain it. The main character and narrator Nick Carraway looks back on the romantic heartaches of Jay Gatsby. Gastby is a wealthy, white man in New York City who longs for the love he once had with Daisy. However, Daisy is married to another man, Tom Buchanan. The book centers around this love triangle and the materialistic society that wants to bask in Gastby's fortune. The mood of the book is very dark, pessimistic, and vapid as set by the purposelessness and carelessness of the wealthy and its tragic ending of both Myrtle and Gatsby. Only Nick Carraway's honest view of life breathes hope into the book's sense of tragedy.Personally, I found the book to be rather sad and depressing. Overall it was entertaining but you couldn't help feeling sorry for the character of Gatsby towards the end of the story. I disagree with how Tom and Daisy seemed to make a mess of people's lives, theirs included, to only leave and let other unfortunate people deal with the repurcussions of their mistakes. Daisy was a woman drawn to money and sophistication. And during the book states that she hopes her daughter grows up to be a beautiful fool, when in reality, Daisy was a fool herself. She constantly let men and their powers by money influence her love and because of this I came to resent her the most of all the characters. It didn't seem fair to me how she killed Myrtle and proceeded to live her life with Tom as if nothing had changed. And it astounded me how Tom could then lead Myrtle's husband, Wilson, to believe that it was Gatsby himself who had killed him. This book only taught me that the great love of money, power, and respect can influence people to do horrible things. This is something you tend to see more and more in society whether you're in the year 1920 or 2005."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a dramatic novel that deals with the aspirations and dreams of some people and the way they affect relationships with others. The book's theme is complex yet one that most people can relate to; hope, the passing of time, undying love. The novel takes place in early 1920's New York; normally looked at as a decadent period, where money and partying were ways of life for a generation of young people who knew no other way. Among this crowd stands a group of people (our main characters) who, despite not being susceptible to this way of life, are very much a part of it, and, in some cases, are trapped in by it.The novel is narrated by a young man named Nick Carraway. Long a Midwesterner, he travels to New York in his late 20's to become a bonds dealer. He settles in the \\"West Egg\\" district of Long Island, which, in the fictional geography of the novel, is divided into two boroughs - West and East Egg. He is quickly drawn into the circles of anonymous parties thrown by faceless rich people. His only real contacts are his distant cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her racist, sexist husband, Tom Buchanan. He soon befriends his very mysterious \\"Trimalchio\\" (party host) neighbor, Jay Gatsby, and slowly but surely is caught in the middle of a drama fueled by broken dreams and sincere hope.Once used to the language and literary style of the book (which is very different from more modern writing) this book is very addictive. The imagery is beautiful; often, the very human characters say or do very memorable things, and the storyline is perfectly paced. And many of the issues the author mentions (but does not try to present explanations or solutions for) are still relevant today; class differences, lost love, alienation. And the fact that 80 years have passed since this period does not take you out of the story or dialogue; often, the situations in the book could just easily have happened today.Overall, The Great Gatsby is an excellent book, easily worth reading by anybody. It tells you a lot about the period it was written in, and even tells you more than the generalities often associated with this period; it probes that not everyone in the Roaring 20's were so willing to throw money out of their car windows and hop speakeasys; the characters in this book are struggling with problems in society many people are still struggling with today. I definitely recommend The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I especially enjoyed Fitzgerald's intricate portrayal of Jay Gatsby as the American hero, a self-made man who accomplishes the American dream of rising from \\"rags to riches,\\" but who is ultimately incomplete because the one thing for which he desires, Daisy, is unobtainable. Daisy is restricted by social conventions, duty towards her husband, and also by the death of Gatsby, and therefore can only remain elusive as a dream. The irony of expectations is not only reflected in Gatsby's story but also in the \\"boom and bust\\" consumerism and mass production of the Roaring Twenties. On the outside, the Roaring Twenties seemed like an endless age of consumption, wealth, and happiness characterized with an easy-going \\"get-rich-fast\\" mentality. However, corruption also flourished during this era. Prohibition heightened organized crime and introduced bootleggers and \\"speakeasies.\\" Anti-foreign sentiment ignited a new Ku Klux Klan. Union workers and farmers fell into poverty as the result of rising prices. On the outside, Gatsby seems to have it all: extravagant riches, elegant parties and friends, and happiness. However, on the inside, he is incomplete without the one whom he loves so dearly, Daisy. He searches in vain to obtain her as his own but she is ultimately outside his grasp. Fitzgerald weaves his own cynical views into the novel and gives a thorough examination into life in the 1920s, providing a realistic outlook for the reader. His intricate portrayal allowed me to experience the positive and negative effects of the 1920s without actually being there. I can easily see why The Great Gatsby has often been revered as the \\"classic American novel.\\""},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I've never been a fan of books that most people tend to overlook as classic, yet this one is an exception. What's wonderous and sad about this book is that Gatsby is a human being. How can anyone compare Gatsby to a human being? He is a robot isn't he. After all, no human would exploit himself to the degree that Gatsby would. Yet it's part of the American culture and tradition to be a shameful exploiter in the first place. Think about all of the \\"me-tooers\\" that you've known in your life. It would be most disingenuous to \\"not\\" recognize anyone that exploits himself for profit. Yet Gatsby is the biggest exploiter of them all. He is the epitome of that \\"American Dream\\" He is that big fish in the school of fish. Fitzgerld writes so eloquently yet so tragically the life of one such \\"big fish\\" in this book. It is a part of capitalism to \\"at least\\" take notice to what the big fish are doing. Who in your lives represent the big fish. Is it the mass media? Is it Rush Limbaugh?All in all, when we end up reading the Great Gatsby we end up relating to some of the characters in the book. Maybe you're the \\"conservative\\" Tom Buchanan. Maybe you had a past affair with someone and would do \\"everything\\" to win her heart. Maybe you try to be like Nick. Although I'm not WASP, I end up relating to some of the characters in the book. I actually almost cried when Gatsby's father wrote the letter to Nick at the end explaining the dillemma his son was in. I felt Fitzgerald was doing a great public service by exploiting the true misery that wealth brings and how it corrupts the soul. In closing, this book has helped me adjust to American life and warrants me to read mor Fitzgerald books.P.S. If this book is too complicated, read the cliff notes."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"There is some of the BEST writing that I've ever come across in this classic American novel.

Scott Fitzgerald's estate could get paid a penny for every writing student who has read excepts of The Great Gadsby in books about writing, his estate would be worth a trillion dollars with accrued interest. There are several pennies that I added, but I didn't know where to send them."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a book told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a humble character from the Midwest who finds himself surrounded by a wealthy crowd of people. Nick lives across Jay Gatsby, a mysterious figure who surrounds himself with extravagancies and people he considers extravagant. Gatsby's idea is to rekindle his romantic relationship with Daisy Buchanan, who's since married Tom Buchanan. Nick reintroduces Daisy to Gatsby. Gatsby's relationship with Daisy is based off of a lie and they never get back together. Daisy stays with Tom. Gatsby's killed in the end by a delusional widower.What \\"The Great Gatsby\\" does best is captures the fickleness of upper-class society. Gatsby who was not born into money adores Daisy for her popularity and money. Gatsby lies to Daisy and tells her he's rich. Not content with himself, Gatsby's idea is to become rich so that Daisy will continue to love him when they're reunited. Fitzgerald succeeds in telling the story from Nick's point of view. Nick is intrigued by the glamor that surrounds him in New York, but never submits to the notion that money will provide him with happiness. Nicks quiet demeanor allows for Gatsby to go about his wasteful spending uninterrupted. When Nick finds Gatsby hiding in a bush outside of Daisy mansion, the hollowness of the upper-class is put subtly into perspective. Together, Tom, Daisy, and Gatsby create a very comedic dynamic. The three are all so rich that they're bored and their meaningless pursuits lead them ironically into some of the most primitive confrontations.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is simple to read and this style compliments the characters the book is written about intelligently. There is nothing solid behind the glitter that cloaks Gatsby's life. By the time Gatsby dies, it feels about right, because by the end of the book, it's clear he's nothing \\"great\\". Fitzgerald does an excellent job of keeping the novel moderately paced, as the story feels that it does all characters involved justice."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's masterpiece stands the test of time. The decadence and callousness of the characters make them hard to like, but riveting as well. The lyricism of the language is not to be found in many authors today. Gatsby, for all his failings, still may be the most likable of the cast of characters because he does realize there is a world outside himself. A tragic tale beautifully told. It will be a challenging read for most contemporary readers, but it is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The first time I read The Great Gatsby was for school and at first I was apprehensive about it. After completing a few chapters my worries were swayed and I realized that this book would become one of my favorites. The story follows Nick Carraway around New York and his interactions with the citizens of this pretentious society mainly Tom, Daisy, and Jay Gatsby. One aspect of what makes The Great Gatsby such an excellent and timeless novel is the character development. Gatsby's character is mainly developed through interactions with Nick and Nick's descriptions and opinions of him. Also, Fitzgerald's prose and syntax come off naturally and help the flow of the novel and the accessibility of it as a whole. The tale of unrequited love and the yearning to live in the past was very identifiable to me which in return made the novel overall more appealing. Upon rereading The Great Gatsby, this time purely for pleasure, the story and the characters overall felt more real and deeper. It seems that this is one of those novels that every time you read it again it gets better and better. I have now read The Great Gatsby about four or five times and it never loses its appeal or meaning through re-readings. Isn't that what a timeless novel should do? If that's the case, then The Great Gatsby is definitely a classic novel not only because it fits the formula, but also because it's full of superb writing and characters. It's the perfect novel for someone who is unhappy with their present state or someone who loves a person but they do not feel the same way, or if you just want a well developed story that will change the way you look at things. Overall it's an excellent story that everyone should read at some point because we all of the tendency to want to relive the past and can learn the pitfall of this from none other than Jay Gatsby himself."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I chose The Great Gatsby as an outside reading for my advanced placement English class. I'm not a fan of fiction, but the synopsis of the novel caught my attention. Who doesn't have an American dream? As I read the novel, I found myself pitying Gatsby and loathing Daisy. But Gatsby kept tearing at my heart. Morally, he had some issues, but I do admire his honesty to himself. I do recommend the novel to anyone who enjoys the era of the twenties and a character who fails to see the flaws in the one he thinks he loves."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a brilliant piece of literary fiction by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story takes place in the 1920's and centers itself around the American Dream. With the Jazz Age as the backdrop to the story, the characters act vividly within a world of glitz and jealousy and rage. It might be the best written literary work I have read. It would be an understatement to say that this is a must read. Five Stars."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book took me by surprise. The first two chapters didn't really get me into the book, and I found myself feeling awkward as I followed a seemingly pointless beginning. But, trust me, it's worth it. The book took off and left me gasping for air. The Great Gatsby is truly a modern day tragedy, and a very well written one at that. As the story progresses, you get drawn into the conflicts and the characters. You feel bad for some characters, feel angry at others, and become all the more attached to the words that Fitzgerald has written. This is a book that, once it takes off, you cannot put down. Not that it's intense, but that it's involving. It's depressing, but amazing at the same time. Truly a masterpiece of literature that everyone should read at least once!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Hands down - the greatest piece of fiction I have ever read (and I am not a big reader of fiction).

There are some who call it \\"boring\\", \\"pretentious\\", \\"pointless\\" and most of all, \\"confusing\\". However, the beauty in this masterpiece is Fitzgerald's weaving of what (we can conclude) he may have witnessed in his own life of wealth, carelessness and debauchery. He had a way of seeing through people's facades and getting to the truth of a person's heart, and then revealing these truths in deceptively simple ways. There was his genius.Jay Gatsby is one of the great tragic heroes of any time. He has amassed a great deal of wealth, but doesn't know what to do with it. He uses it to throw parties for people who don't know him, and who don't care that they don't. His myth is bigger than he is, and so he doesn't set them straight. He is a pathetic, lonely creature who comes alive again after he reunites with Daisy, his lifelong love. But this happiness, too, is elusive and fleeting. And it is his undoing.My favorite parts of the work are the descriptions of the times, the people, the places. When reading this book we are afforded the opportunity to cut through the glitzy, glamorous depictions of \\"the roaring twenties\\", and instead see the darkness, emptiness and loneliness all that glitz was supposed to be covering up."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"With a singular obsession, Jay Gatsby manoeuvers every dollar of his vast fortune to cradle a woman he thinks he loves. Throwing elaborate parties with a guest list that includes anyone who wants to show up, Gatsby builds a mansion just across the way from Daisy, the object of his obsession.Circumstance thwarts all of his goals, the futility of his quest never completely realized. Gatsby is as tragic a character as the inevitability of his failure. Gatsby, \\"pa[ys] a high price for living too long with a single dream.\\"The story is told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a somewhat solemn and restrained fellow who never really expresses what he wants to say. His virtue, however, is his silence and profound honesty. He says so himself: \\"Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\\"The Great Gatsby is a stunning tale of remarkable poise and literary quality. Fitzgerald is the epitome of the highschool English teachers dream--he appreciates the English language, and takes the standard approach to literature very seriously. The book is a tour de force of depth and contrast, and an exploration of the King's English. The author has taken pains to diversify his word choice, and the texture and depth of his language.Here's a passage that demonstrates Fitzgerald's quality as a writer: \\"There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward teh drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated teh surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.\\"Yikes. Enough to give you goosebumps, isn't it?Highly recommended, and worth the praise."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In college, when I asked my literature professor to name the greatest novel of all time, without hesitation, he mentioned Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. I then asked what he thought was the tantamount novel by an American. He offered three, Moby Dick, Huckleberry Finn, and The Great Gatsby. I had already read Moby Dick and Huckleberry Finn while I attended high school. However, my high school failed to include The Great Gatsby in its curriculum. I vowed that summer (1993) to read Gatsby. Since then I have read it two more times and savored each subsequent reading. I now understand why The Great Gatsby has received such an exalted position in the literary stratosphere.After his first two novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and the Damned, F. Scott Fitzgerald said he wanted to try something \\"exciting and new.\\" His creation became The Great Gatsby, published in 1925 to modest success. It wasn't until later that Gastby became regarded as Fitzgerald's masterpiece.The Great Gatsby is a short novel and can be completed in a day or two. The ease of reading The Great Gatsby belies its intricate plot and evocative prose. Gatsby perfectly captures the prosperous, carefree era of the 1920's. The novel appealed to me because of its Long Island setting. East and West Egg are Manhassat and Great Neck. Jay Gatsby, the novel's protagonist, had a love affair with Daisy Buchanan that ended when Gatsby went to fight in World War I. Gatsby lost his fortune thereafter. Daisy married Tom Buchanan while Gatsby was away. To regain Daisy's affections, Gatsby uses unscrupulous means to garner money. Tom Buchanan refers to Gatsby's bootlegging. Gatsby throws lavish parties at his home thinking Daisy might attend. Daisy won't leave her husband, even though she knows he is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson, thus creating tension between Gatsby and Tom.The American dream does not become a reality for everybody. Although Gatsby's wealth can afford him a luxurious house overlooking the Long Island Sound, it's the wrong currency for recapturing Daisy's love. Daisy and Myrtle are both materialistic characters and money clouds their perceptions. Daisy ignores her husband's affair with Myrtle due to Tom's wealth. Although Tom treats her terribly, Myrtle is shallow and only sees Tom's affluence.The Great Gatsby also vividly displays Fitzgerald's adept utilization of foreshadowing and symbolism. The car accident in Gatsby's driveway at the beginning of the novel provides a case in point. When one reaches the end of the novel, this scene will become more poignant.The late comedian Andy Kaufman, to the consternation of his audience, incorporated a reading of The Great Gatsby into his stand up routine. This is a testament to the stature the novel has attained in the last sixty years. Gatsby is the epitome of the perfect novel. The Great Gatsby has become my favorite novel of all time, with Anna Karenina being a close second. I would recommend everyone read the book before seeing the mediocre Robert Reford film. I like Redford, but I thought he was dreadfully miscast as Jay Gatsby. I hope my high school English teachers now provide The Great Gatsby to their students. They will be treated to a genuine literary masterwork."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When I learned that the Modern Library Board had selected the Great Gatsby as the second most important novel to be written in the English language in the twentieth century, my first reaction was &quot;Uh-oh. What did I miss.&quot; So, after twenty-five years, I picked up the novel again. After reading the novel for a second time, even with the Board's lofty ranking always in my mind, my original opinion remained unchanged.Although I have always been astounded by the beauty of some of Fitzgerald's prose, I considered his story of ambition, the &quot;American Dream,&quot; and lost love as somewhat trite and predictable. That opinion did not change with this reading. I still saw the plot as being too contrived, the characters too thinly drawn, and his theme of the corruption of the &quot;American Dream&quot; better handled by Dos Passos, Dreiser or even Nabokov. So why did the Modern Library give this novel such a high ranking? I am still unsure. And I might be so presumptuous as to suggest that even Fitzgerald would be surprised; after all, during his lifetime the book nearly went out of print. I guess that many critics, following the lead of Lionel Trilling, see the character of Jay Gatsby as standing for America itself, and the novel as the most American of American novels.Even though my opinion of the novel remained the same after two readings, my overall impression of the author grew. I have always associated Fitzgerald with wealth, as an author with whom I could have no connection. This prejudice affected my reading of Tender is the Night, and has remained for twenty-five years. Now I see Fitzgerald in a more human light, a man haunted by the same desires that drove Gatsby, and like his chief character, a man who could not give up his dreams, or his &quot;old warm world.&quot; Both Gatsby and the author lived lives of silent desperation, moving slowly toward thier dreams, passing through the ash heaps of American society under the sightless eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a beautifully written story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is narrated by the simple Nick Carraway and tells of the intricate lives of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. Fitzgerald creates a perfect mix of love, happiness, wealth, betrayal, and suspense. Through the use of the characters and their love, the reader can picture the times of the roaring twenties. From astonishingly gorgeous parties of the wealthy Jay Gatsby, to the simple beauty and innocence of Daisy, Fitzgerald convinces the reader to truly believe his writing. He writes with a style that creates beautiful and sometimes frustrating images for the reader. His descriptions utilize precise detail. As one reads Fitzgerald's words slipping across the page, one can witness exactly what is being described. Fitzgerald's techniques of using descriptions and detail prove helpful. Moving beyond style, the book pushes past the basic storyline and becomes very symbolic. The characters, setting, and events that take place are all telling of the American dream in the twenties. It depicts people who let wealth determine their lives. It emphasizes how money and people's desire for money can stand in the way of true happiness. The Great Gatsby is a well-written novel that creates a telling depiction of life in America in the 1920's."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is an important book, make no mistake. It is also the finest novel of a very fine novelist. At a time when America was just beginning to realise that it was as susceptible to corruption, greed and self-delusion as every other country on the planet, Fitzgerald wrote a book that really does capture the moment a nation founded on ideals realises that ideals are hard to live by.Gatsby, the central anti-character, is a mere shadow, a man who reinvents himself to win the heart of the girl he think he loves. The foundations of this infatuation and subsequent reinvention are rotten and the result must be rotten too. Fitzgerald writes beautifully, his words tinged with the sadness and quiet desperation that flavours the whole novel, and his characters all seem to sense that their lives are built on precarious ideas about success, happiness and love.The Great Gatsby is a very honest and acute portrayal of a nation built on the misbegotten assumption that you can be whoever you want to be, and the consequences that that belief holds. More importantly it is a brilliant and moving novel."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book was initally forced onto me as a high school junior, and, like all the other students, I first groaned and braced myself for the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I decided to read his book, The Great Gatsby to find that it was a mistake. I usually enjoy reading challenging books, however, this book was far from challenging. I moaned and whined when it was time to read it, yet I kept reading to see if it got better. Reading The Great Gatsby was a great waste of my time.This novel has a handful of very complex characters. Many who disguise themselves until the very end. Tom and Daisy Buchanan are mainly a spoiled rich couple who need nothing but money to live. They ruin lives and do not think of the consequences of their actions because of their social status of where they live. Nick who is the narrator and that is hard to see until 40 or so pages into the book is good at contradicting himself. He makes several remarks that he is the most honest man he has ever known yet, he lies about a web of rumors about an engagement to everyone except Jordan Baker. The \\"great\\" Gatsby turns out to be a great let down. The readers find out that Gatsby and Daisy had a relationship going until the war calls Gatsby out. Daisy then finds \\"untrue\\" love with Tom, this makes Gatsby's life miserable even though he is rich and powerful. His power leads to the unbelievable ending of this book. The book has a basic plot which the world lives on and society thrives on everyday. It puts the status versus happiness clich&eacute; into a realistic perspective. The affair between Tom and Myrtle also is realistic in the main events between those two characters also. Even though Myrtle plays a minor role in this book she is the main reason for the ending.I did not enjoy this book very much, however, people who like to compare social status and power should enjoy this book a great deal. I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks money, power and fame is everything."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"First let me start out by saying that I am a high school student who was forced to read this book during summer, which is the first downfall. The Great Gatsby is a story of a man, Jay Gatsby, who wastes his life away throwing parties, hoping his first love, Daisy, would maybe attend one of these parties. The narrator, Nick, finally meets Gatsby at a party and since Nick is Daisy's cousin, Nick is pulled into a plot that ends in a very tragic way. I was more interested in Nick than Gatsby or any of the other characters. Gatsby is a character that really isn't defined besides the fact that he loves Daisy. Also, along the way readers are introduced to characters at parties that have no signifigant role in the book. Another problem with The Great Gatsby was that it seemed to progress so slow. The plot didn't keep my attention like it should have. The ending is a little surprising but not enough that could redeem the rest of the book. Although this is a highly acclaimed book, I found out it's not a book for everyone."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Yeah right.I know this is a &quot;classic&quot; and a required read for any person not spending their life under a rock but quite frankly, its terribly overrated.This tale of the &quot;American Dream&quot; is really nothing more than people who will do anything they can to get rich.It's a tale of snobby people during the jazz age and all their affairs and problems.Just because a book is consideed a classic doesn't make it good.I'm very sorry if I have offeneded anyone who read and enjoyed this book but I don't see what the big deal is.A waste of time and money, please don't read this unless your one of those old people who never smile and drink little cups of tea with their pinky sticking out.In the words of the mighty Dennis Miller &quot;That's just my opinion, I could be wrong...&quot; But I'm not."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott FitzgeraldFor my report I really didn't know what book to read, I asked around and one answer I got was to read the Great Gatsby. The person I asked had said they had never read the book but it was a really good movie. Since I have heard of this book before because it was a classic I decided to read it and I have to say I was not at all impressed. I decided that maybe the movie would improve on things, but I soon realized that this also was not all it was cracked up to be.I thought that the book's basic plot was really good and interesting, but the problem with the book was that it didn't always follow the basic plot. This book was about a past love between Jay Gatsby and Daisy Duchanan trying to rekindle itself many years later, but there is only one problem, Daisy is already married to a man who is cheating on her with a girl from New York. Yes this sounds very intriguing, and it is, but this was only the story for a little more that half the book. The other half was the cousin of Daisy, Nick Carraway (teller of the story) telling about a party he went to, or what his backyard looked like, or the weather that day. What I am saying is that the tangents Nick went off on took away from the attention of what was really going on in the story.The fact that it was told by Nick was a weird point of view to lay the story out at. It is difficult to tell a love story from the point of view from neither of the lovers. You can never really tell what they're thinking, which either adds to the suspense of the story or, takes away a lot of detail.The book also left so many unanswered questions, one in particular being: where did Gatsby get all his money? He said that it was inherited from a man he was with at sea who died, but later tells us that most of it was wasted in the panic of the war. All we can infer is that he was gaining all this money through something illegal; drugs maybe, but never really know exactly what he was doing. This is not to say this is a bad book completely, just a very slow paced book in which most action takes place the last 70 pages about. This book is more for people who are into quiet romance novels and are very patient in their reading, in other words, for people who aren't me. Even though it seems like I spent the last paragraph trashing the book I would like to make it clear that I didn't hate it, I just didn't really like it either. It did have its moments though, just not as many as I would have liked.The movie didn't improve on things. It mirrored the book exactly, scene by scene. I can honestly say I don't think they had a sentence out of place. It is like, if you saw the movie, you practically read the book. Not like in other movies such as \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" where once you've seen it, you still don't know what the books about. This really surprised me because for such a short book (189 pages) it was a long movie (2 hours and so). This was mainly because of how much they stuck to the book, which I think wasn't the smartest thing to do. I think some of the scenes they included where a little stretched out rather than just getting to the point. Like the scene where Daisy and Gatsby meet again for the first time in many years. They just sat there for a while, then walked around a bit and talked in a very drone voice.This brings me to another case about the movie, the acting. The parts of Daisy and Jordan (a good friend of Daisy and Nick) were very either over dramatized or under dramatized. Daisy is supposed to be calm, with a soothing voice. Instead they made her constantly shaking and her voice always in a quiver. The part of Jordan, who was supposed to be jaunty and full of life, walked slowly and spoke with a monotone voice. The movie did however clear up a few parts in the book that were confusing to me. When I read a certain part I didn't really understand what had just happened but the movie is able to show you rather than just describing it.In conclusion for those of you who enjoy faster paced books, this isn't for you. I would recommend this to romance readers who are very patient with their reading. This book is obviously not for everybody but I have asked more people and got good responses about this book so all I can say now is read at your own risk."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I know many people consider this book to be a great literary classic. Honestly, I admit that Fitzgerald utilized figurative language and symbolism quite successfully. I truly enjoyed some of his satire and hidden meanings. You could analyze this book for years if you wanted to.The problem is that there are no truly noble characters to encourage a reader. All the characters seem to be involved in shady activities. The absence of a role model disturbs me and makes me wonder why the book is required reading at so many schools. (Some people have suggested that Nick is the sole moral person in the book; however, his willingness to aid in other's schemes seems to prove otherwise.)Here's my advice: To those who have to read it - read it, keep a good attitude, and take lots of notes. To those who want to read it- only read it if you don't mind reading about crazy lifestyles and love affairs.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Very disappointed in this book, which is supposed to be a classic. Did not even finish the book. This will be my first and last experience with F. Scott FitzgeraldThe Great Gatsby"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book that I ordered was The Great Gatsby. In the picture it shows the book with the traditional cover of this book, so that's what I was expecting. The cover of the book that I got was completely different. The cover is of a girl and with the title and the authors name. I have had this happen before, but this time I made sure that that was the only picture it was showing. But I still got the wrong cover."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Consumerism is the New Food for America The necessities in life at one period in our world were merely just anacre of land and tools to build a shelter and feed the empty stomachs. As technology increased in parts of the world, people's necessities began to adapt and change. In America, the basic necessities of food and water are available on every block of the street and are taken for granted; therefore our necessity in an American life became money. Although the concept is hard to believe that money is anywhere close to being as important as food or water, it has to be understood to know the role of consumerism. Back in the mid 1700s, people in North America focused on their crops because their goal was to feed themselves and a family if they had one. In the twenty- first century, America has satisfied hunger at a very cheap rate and has encouraged Americans with a new goal. Since most Americans do not struggle for food, we are not trying to satisfy our physical living life, but our spiritual life. The spiritual life is our mindset on happiness, our wants and what makes us feel \\"good\\". Therefore, with the excess money people have after rent or payment on homes and food, most people invests it on materials, either to decorate their home, the equipments needed in their hobby, or a car for transportation. Again, because America is more advanced than other countries, it is necessary for us to possess excess materials not needed for the physical life, but for the spiritual life of desire, and happiness.Even if consumerism is unneeded to a person, it is unavoidable. Grocery stores not only have foods and snacks, but clothes, flowers and office supplies. Also, the idea of a new school year means new clothes and looks. Another example is marriage, buying dresses, tuxedos, service, a ring and a legal contract. Commercialism also plays a big role for expanding consumerism, such as ads on the back of store receipts and search engines on the internet. Another reason why consumption in material is still here, although some people believe it is the key to corruption is because majority wants or desires it. Each material is designed to be produce because people have been demanding it. Some will still disagree, but when there are enough people taking interest in a certain material, some company will produce it to make a profit on their own.Back in history, the thirteen colonies were not happy with the king interrupting in individual businesses, and still after two hundred and fifty years the United States of America are not happy with the effects of capitalism. There are reasons to have a bad impression on it, such as the production of trash, greed, and class distinctions, but as a whole America is a successful country to be named the land of opportunities. Our needs and wants have created diversity of positions in the educational, medical, business and science field.Another favorite author is Fitzgerald, who depicts money and materials as faults of corruption in Americans. Gatsby is the only gentlemen who is wealthy that proves some dignity and respect of the true feelings of love. He had depended on materialism on his whole life, seeking his desire for daisy. Wealthy, brutal, and powerful; Tom abuses his power of status to deceive a poor mechanic Mr. Wilson to get to his wife, Myrtle. He also depends on consumerism to be at the status he is.One of the important materials in this novel is cars. Myrtle represented the corrupted people who obsessed over materials and wealth, which ironically ended her life. This is all too true in our nation, when people just become in debt, because they could not control their desire in useless materials.It is ironic how our very desirable consumerism in American life, will one day drive our society crashing to the ground. Whether it be a nuclear war over the last gallons of gasoline, or the pollution created from the excess trash of products, consumerism will run the American country to the peak until it will fill up all the wants and desires from the spiritual life."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"After reading this book, I wondered why Fitzgerald chose to tell the story from Nick's perspective. But I realized it was because he is the only character worth cheering for in this book. I hoped Fitzgerald would give more information about Mr. Wilson, and Gatsby, so their characters would be more developed. I was disappointed. It was a very chilling conclusion to the book, and written well, but I hoped the characters would be developed more and discussed in greater detail."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In our English class, we have to do literature circles. Each student gets to choose his/her own book from four choices. After hearing the basic story plot, I chose \\"The Great Gatsby\\". I was curious and wanted to find out more about \\"the man who worked so hard that he bought a house across the lake facing the girl's house just to make her fall in love with him\\". Now I have finished the book, although it's is a little short, the plot and themes are not being affected at all. In the beginning of the book, it's not so interesting and the readers will be feeling weird about everything. Gatsby, the title of the book, is the crazy man. Although the main character is Nick, he's telling the audience about Gatsby. Gatsby hold grand parties at his mansion with people who he didn't even know, and he often isolate himself from the crowd as people were having fun. His purpose of having parties is not to have fun; but to show off and impress the girl.As the readers goes on, they will start to notice everything that's been happening and start to fall into the book. The author, Scott Fitzgerald, referred himself to the main character Nick in the book. The novel was written in 1920's, the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald thinks that the moral part of people is almost gone under the success and prosperity of the Jazz Age, so he is trying to include some moral ingredients in the story. In this book, he reflected his feelings towards the 20's and expressed himself through the novel.This book mainly talked about relationships, and it also showed all kinds of people's character and personality. Overall, I think this is a nice book, and it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Yes, Dear Readers, it is I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, Professor Emeritus of American History.

I'd give it negative infinity stars if i could.This era is not boring, but this author is! There is no possibility off me ever caring about the characters, the reliance on symbolism and the intense feeling of \\"I'm writing something important! Pay attention damn you, and how dare you not like my work!\\" In the place of true character and plot development makes this book so dull that I feel the only thing it's good for is inspiring the sandman.The prose is mediocre at best, contrary to popular opinion of 5 star reviewers, one can be smart and still hate this book. No, I don't read goosebumps, never could get into them.If anything, this book is twilight without the vampires, which by the way is an equally horrendous affront to intelligent readers.My favorite books tend to be fantasy or sci-fi, though I did like Huckleberry Finn, Tuesdays with Morrie, and found deadline by Chris Crutcher insightful, and enjoyable.I don't need a book about the treachery of stupid rich people who are only friends because of money, back stabbing at the slightest perceived insult, masked by story of foolish lust which resulted in a mediocre affair, it's beyond dull, it's an insult to writing. And I already know that humans freed from pursuit of basic needs, and without some balance or check, devolve into petty, egotistical, self-absorbed jerks.If this book is a classic because it's a story about choosing ones friends wisely then fails miserably, if it's about the stupidity of lust and affairs and their danger, then again, it fails to adequately convey the point to young adults who are required to read this and draw such conclusions without the necessary insight or life experience to read between the lines and dullness of the fictional tale of foolishness woven here.There are authors who have managed to convey such points much more eloquently, clearly, and in far more interesting ways. At this point history itself would be able to convey such points in a superior fashion and with greater frequency. Hah, stories in the old-testament bible about Saul, David, and Solomon would convey the point better.If you read James Cleavland's review of this crime against the united states and humanity in general i think he may have hit a few reason why i dislike this book so much. http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C16SDV4PXLR4/"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read The Great Gatsby for school in my American Lit. class, and I never wanted to come home and read it.

Also, the fact that anyone would rank this book next to Faulkner, Woolf, Joyce, etc. offends me deeply. But that is your opinion, and you have every right to it.As many have said, this book is immature. It takes a fairly basic outline (long-lost love, people cheating on spouses, an \\"outsider\\" comes in and has no true responsibilities) and throws in some symbolism that any high school student could conjure and then acts pretentious (which is probably why so many people like it, because they think it makes them look good). And that is all. I know that many people claim that was how it was in the 1920s, but please, no other piece of \\"literature\\" I have ever read has come off so shallow.But back to those who act like not appreciating it means that you do not know much about reading. That is just inconsiderate. I truly hate this book, but if you like it, fine, I'll argue with you about it (and the fact that I've had to read three times now for school as an English major means I know quite a bit about it) until I faint. However, this does not mean that I will write you off and not listen to any of your other opinions. Because once someone did this to me when I told them I truly disliked \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and then they sarcastically asked what my favorite book was, expecting me to say something in popular fiction like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".

The Great Gatsby, however, is probably one of the only books I've read that I hate.It is the story of a man who, basically, talks about nothing. The plot is nonexistent, just the ramblings of a man who's confused about society. The characters are either boring or not developed enough. The worst part about the book is that you get the feeling that F. Scott Fitzgerald is going to hit you with a great, dramatic, thought-provoking ending, and nothing happens at the end. When I finished, I was left with the feeling of &quot;Okay, what was that all about?&quot; I can understand that it is a reflection of the 1920s, but certainly not a very good reflection.This is a book you should read when there is absolutely nothing else to read.

This isn't so much a story as it feels like an outline for a story. The book is SLOW and Fitzgerald's writing style is SO over-wrought and flowery that it really, really gets in the way of moving the plot (wait, was there a plot?) along. None of the characters are likeable. There was NO ONE to root for, therefore there was no emotional investment in this story. In the end, it's a VERY thin love triangle between rich, superficial people. That's it.It's also told through Nick's character, who is completely irrelevant to the story. He's only there to narrate it. Why do we need him? It's more effective to SHOW us what's going on rather than have Nick feed us all the details AFTER the fact. That device provides NO drama, suspense or anything else. In fact, you could remove Nick's whole character from the book and it would lose nothing. That's how inconsequential his character is. It only serves to separate us further from the characters and a story that are already pretty thin and distant.Wow. This book is a D+ at best.

That was well over ten years ago. This book was like many of the other so called classics we had to read, depressing and dull. For a young man coming of age who already broods over life, such books were not inspiring and did not instill a sense of adventure. I was well read at a young age and enjoyed other great classics, but too often those greats were not part of the high school curriculum.As a more mature individual, I decided to give the book and the movie a second chance. My wife and I are reading American classics as we are both writers.Again, I was utterly bored with the characters and the premise. Yes, I sympathized with Gatsby, but as brilliant and hard working as we are to believe he was--he was actually a complete fool, blinded by love for a materialist bitch, which lead to his destruction. Ok, I get the plot. I understand the nuances in the book.However, the book, to me, just describes one party after another after another. And I don't just mean the Gatsby parties, I also mean the tea parties and all the conversations among multiple people who actually do not have anything to do with the plot. I forced myself to read the book. It was not a page turner. The characters were not interesting. And the entirety of the plot can be summed up in a couple of sentences.When I watched the Redford movie, I found Jordan interesting, as she was in the book, but the emphasis was on the annoying, utterly unlovable Daisy, whom, for some incomprehensible reason, Gatsby sacrifices everything.

I found that one boring and rather uninteresting at times. I expected the same from GATSBY. I am happy to say I was wrong to think this book was no good. It doesn't seem like anything special. It has a simple story about a wealthy man who falls in love with a woman he can't have, told from the point of view of another character who is friends of them both.Seems boring, eh? Well, I don't know how Fitzgereld did it, but he wrote the book in such a way that it was both easy to read and fun. Normally even good books like the HOBBIT and 1984 have moments that you wish could end so you could continue with the book. Not this one. Fitzgereld writes only what we, the reader, need to know. Everything seems important and everything makes you want to continue on.My only complaint would be that very rarely does anything truly spectacualr happens, which one would normally expect from a classic.

I suppose it was the way I was feeling but right afterwards i wrote a very negative review for this book which I would now like to take back. A few days ago i decided to read the book once again because I was wondering why I had been so bored and depressed by that second reading. I read it again and was soon discovering my original enjoyment of the story. I suppose it was just typical teenage moodiness. It is a great story, and I especially like the descriptive bits, like where it describes Daisy and the tennis player(I cant remember her name at this second) as floating in white dresses on the coach. Gatsbys parties and the drunken party at Toms mistress's house are wonderful. The characters are very true to life and I loved the mysteriousness of Gatsby. This is a very sad but good book and I fully recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"i read the great gatsby and i was impressed. i don't really know what to say about it. it was an excellent book. it is definately required reading"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"What a joy it has been to return to a book such as \\"The Great Gatsby\\" after an absence of thirty years. I last read this book as a teenager and, although I enjoyed it then, it is a real delight to an adult.In essence, the book outlines the life and lifestyle of Jay Gatsby who lived on Long Island near New York City in the 1920s. His background is shrouded in some mystery with various reports that he has been a killer, a bootlegger and a fixer of baseball's 1919 World Series. However, the key to his background is unrequited love for Daisy Buchanan who he knew at the time of the First World War and before he was sent away to France. Unfortunately, during his wartime absence, Daisy has married someone else and Gatsby is left yearning for her company. He throws vast and extravagant parties in the hope that Daisy might drop by and their love can be rekindled. His love rules his life as, across the water from his house, he can see the distant green light at the end of the pier at Daisy's home. This distant light epitomises his love for Daisy; it is far away yet still burning.Without wrecking the plot for those readers who may not be so familiar with the book, Gatsby's life ends with pain and misery and no renewal of love. In this sense, the book takes on the character of a Shakespearean tragedy.I can recommend this book to all readers of great fiction. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" has a timeless quality. It has endured for decades so far and will endure for many more to come."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book is an American Classic, although my title most likely is not. I haven't even read any of the other reviews, but I would wager a large sum of money that at least one, if not serveral, contains the words American and classic.I have struggled long and hard and write a review for my all-time favorite book. I just never felt that I could do it justice. I doubt anyone really can. Part of the reason why I feel that this book is the American Classic is because it elevates American Literature to a level that few other novels can bring it.Just read the book and avoid the movie."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Some works of art are so engrained in our popular consciousness that it's almost impossible to judge them without the interference of all our collective baggage we bring as we approach them. Gatsby is a classic example. Having read the novel ten times over the last twenty years, I have enjoyed a certain distance and just as importantly the opportunity to compare different impressions at different stages of my life. The result is that I am even more impressed with the novel than all the annoying hype and commotion that continues to follow the novel would allow me to have. Without boring you about all the themes that have been hashed over and over, I would like to point out that there is a great question the novel asks us: Why does the narrator Nick have sympathy for Gatsby while loathing all the other chasers of the American Dream? It seems that Gatsby is a contradictory fellow, part ruthless dreamer zealously selling his soul to afford himself the trappings of fame, popularity, and glory. However, Gatsby, unlike the other ambitious characters in this novel, has a certain innocence and vulnerbility. Also, he is a true believer in his own delusion that if he can live a life a wealth and afford parties, he will overcome his childhood limitations and win the love of others. It's his craving of others' love that makes him sympathetic. In a way, he's a spiritual cousin of Citizen Kane who, for all his gaudy possessions, simply wanted the unconditional love represented by &quot;Rosebud&quot; on his sled, the embodiment of childhood belonging. Nick the narrator has the sensitivity to see this wounded child in Gatsby and reserves judgment against him.Gatsby's pathological hunger for attention and popularity reminds me of all the people who go on Reality TV shows, hoping to promote themselves and be seen by all, grabbing their fifteen minutes of fame even as they debase themselves in various types of tomfoolery that showcase America's blind ambition and back-stabbing competition. Many years earlier, Fitzgerald saw how dangerous it was to blindly embrace American images of success without self-knowledge and without a moral code to keep us sane and he wrote about this theme so elegantly in Gatsby, a masterpiece that transcends all our limiting preconceptions we bring to it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is quite possibly my favorite book in the world. However, I've not finished Tender Is The Night, yet. I've read Gatsby maybe three times, and am now working on my fourth. Each time I fall in love with a different character with thier faults. The book is simply gorgeous. Fitzgerald was a master, despite all his personal faults. I would recommend this to anyone who actually enjoys books. If you're going to read anything ever. First read the Bible, and then I recommend Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is the best American book of the 20th century, yet its average review on Amazon is only 4 out 5, and many mysteries get 4.5? What an injustice!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby was one of the best books I have ever read. Its takes place in Long island, New york in the summer of 1922. I really like New York since I have been there many times. This made the book better for me because i can relate to it more. The main character is named Nick Carraway. Nick is a young guy who has moved from minnesota to a district of Long Island called West Egg. West Egg is a very wealthy district. Nicks neighbor is a man named Jay Gatsby. Jay lives in a huge house and has parties ever saturday night. Fitzgerald does a good job of describing East and West Egg. He gives you a clear immage of what is going on and the various types of views. Throughout the book, there is a lot of chaos going on between the diferent couples which makes the story very interesting. I like how Fitzgerald describes Gatsby's house to be very gothic and prodiguous. Throughout the book you learn not only about Gatsby's past, but all the characters secrects.Almost all the characters in this book have or are cheating on the ones that they love.It was tricky to understand completely what was going on durring the book. Nick learns a lot about the people he meets in Long Island. Although most of the things he learns are not good things. Overall i thought this story was exiting and fun to read. Although I found it to be quite confusing at times. I would still recomend this book to all."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I recently read the book &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. The book is the all-american novel for everyone. The Great Gatsby should not sit on a book shelf. The book is the most esquisit book I have read to date. The book deals with all aspects of love and the trials of life. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; Is a text that a person can read a chapter and then leave it laying there for more than a day. Since the author is so descriptive, it made me feel like I was in the story. I felt like I was a part of thier lifes.I could refer back to the text and compare my life with thier life. This book is inspirational to all people including young new writers. The book has to be one of the best books out there. I reconmend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I had to read The Great Gatsby for my 11th grade English class. Now I have read the book four times, and I have yet to understand what makes this novel receive all the praise it does. The plot is like a Beverly Hills 90210 episode in the 1920s. The plot is that Gatsby loved a beautiful socialite Daisy way back when. Then Gatsby had to leave for the war, though Daisy promised to wait for him. Unfortunately, Daisy didn't wait and married the overtly rich Tom Buchanan instead. So Gatsby accumulated all this wealth and stature in hopes of winning back Daisy. There are two problems here though. One, Gatsby doesn't love Daisy, he loves what she stands for, money, power and social standing. Two, Daisy doesn't love Gatsby, she is too vapid and shallow and only loves men with money (and when she first met Gatsby he told her he was wealthy, which at the time was a lie) which is why she married Tom instead of waiting for Gatsby. I also had a problem with Nick as the narrator. If this was supposed to be a story of Gatsby and Daisy why on earth do we care about who he is having lunch with or what the weathers like? Also, when things happened, like Tom breaking Myrtle's nose, Nick didn't seem to care he just told the reader about it and them went on to something else (\\"The sky was shining blue as bright as a diamond\\"..blah blah blah) Upon reading the reviews here I noticed that many kids like me also had to read this book and most them didn't like it. I don't hate this book and I'm not going off on one of those \\"This was so boring!\\" tangents. My problem was with the characters. Daisy was a vapid, shallow money loving gold digger. I couldn't understand why any man would love her. Gatsby spent so much time trying to live up to the measures of a women who would never really love him unless he was made out of gold. Tom was a hypocritical, racist, sexist punk. Jordan was a lying, cheating loser. If they are examples of being wealthy, of fulfilling the American dream (in this book is to do what? Become a bored snob?) then I don't think its really worth it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Tim Robbins' smooth rendition brings this excellent classic to life under audio format, pairing an unabridged presentation with letters narrated by Robert Sean Leonard covering Fitzgerald's writings to his editor and his agents and friends. The pairing of the literary classic in audio with this background set of insights makes for an involving listen."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is about a man named Nick Carraway who moves to New York. He ends up renting a small cottage next to a mansion, which is occupied by the man who gives his name to the book, Jay Gatsby. This story takes place during what was known as the \\"roaring twenties\\" when everyone seemed to get rich quick. People who weren't there to experience it first hand seem to see it as a time when everyone got rich, went to speakeasies and consumed alcohol illegally. F. Scott Fitzgerald seems to think that the twenties were an era of possibility, aspiration and achievement. Gatsby is a deep, mysterious character that has secretly loved Nick's second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, since they used to date five years before the story takes place. In the present, Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, and they have a young daughter. Tom has a mistress, who is also married, and Gatsby takes the opportunity to win back Daisy's heart.Like Gatsby, I've made the mistake of thinking I wasn't good enough for someone and that they wouldn't accept me just the way I was. Jay Gatsby took it to a higher level than I when he lied about his upbringing and basically \\"wrote his own story.\\" It is heartbreaking to think that someone won't accept you for who you really are. It hurts when people see your flaws and imperfections as what makes them better than you instead of viewing those flaws as what makes you human. This book, narrated by Nick, who said, \\"I am one of the few honest people I have ever known,\\" brought me to the realization that people should not be ashamed of their past and the details of their less than perfect lives and instead learn to love them because it is what makes us who we are.The Great Gatsby accentuates the idea that ambition is a strong virtue. It reminds us that when you strive to become the best and you want it bad enough, you'll get it. Our lives should be about turning ambition into success instead of material things and status. We need to achieve happiness in our own lives before we try and be happy with someone else. This book is a good choice for a romantic and someone who needs motivation, like I did, to be proud of their flaws and their uniqueness.I would recommend this book to other people with hope that they get a message from it. A visual mind will see the story as a result of the description used. I would also recommend this book to someone who needs a reminder that success is achieved by ambition and hard work, and that all people, as perfect as they may seem, have details in their lives that they find faulty."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In general, I was pretty impressed with the movie version of The Great Gatsby (with Mira Sovergno-- sorry, don't know the spelling of that). There were, however a few moments within this picture that I was vaguely disappointed in.For one, a large portion of the acting was over the top and very unbelieveable. The man who played Gatsby is perfect in terms of appearance, but it is obvious that he has either never read the book, or that he had a misinterpretation of what Gatsby is like. He played him too cocky, and even when he tried to act unsure of himself, it still came off to arrogant. However, Gatsby wasn't the only character that I found myself displeased with. Jordan's appearance wasn't at all what I expected. I had personally pictured her as a longer haired blonde woman, and looking more sporty as well. In contrast, I believe that the people who played Nick and Tom were absolutely perfect. I was especially please with Nick-- he did a wonderful job of capturing the essence of the character, and seemed to fit very well into a surprisingly nonchalant character. However, there were a few parts of this movie that was very impressed with.A major portion of the movie rendition of the Great Gatsby I was happy with was how true it stayed to the book. I found myself questioning if anything was changed at all, and I don't think that I found one single part, other than the fact that it had to be cut down in order to make into a movie. I know that this is a very hard task to accomplish, especially since so much happens in the book, and I was extremely pleased.In general, the combination of a good script and so-so acting made me have an overall neutral feeling for this movie. It was entertaining, but I obviousley enjoyed the book much more.Thank you, Mr. Mr, for making me read this book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Mr.M:The movie, The Great Gatsby was about a love...square was it? A man who has been given the name, Jay Gatsby, lives in East Egg, New York. He is obsessed with money, and so are all his neighbors. Five years before the story takes place in the 1920s, Gatsby met a lady by the name of Daisy. They fell in love, but Gatsby had to got to war. Daisy couldn't wait for him, so she married Tom, a wealthy man, yet has been cheating on her with Myrtle. She is a lower class, rather fanatical women who is married to Wilson. This whole story about how money corrupts people and their loves, is told by the perspective of Nick, who becomes Gatsby's closest friend.The movie was very closely related to the book, even using some of the same dialogue in parts. Yet the book seems to have more foreshadowing than the movie. Events such as when the car crashes in front of Gatsby's house after a party of his is not included. The casting has its ups and downs as well. Characters such as Daisy and Gatsby shined in their performance. Daisy had a flowing, yet somewhat ditzy attribute about her that made her perfect for the role. Toby Stephens has a tricky role to play being Gatsby, yet he pulled off the ambitious, prosperous character. One character that was not cast correctly was Tom. In the book he is described as a huge, muscular man who is forceful and rough. Martin Donovan was not much larger than Gatsby, and did not have the stature of a football player.The director, Robert Markowitz, must have done his research on the 1920s, because even the music had its place. The jazz background music brought to life the scenes, which were all very colorful. Gatsby's house had rich colors, such as gold and red, to portray all the money he had. The dressed that the women wore were just right. Myrtle did not wear the type of dress that Daisy would have. This was right on because Myrtle was part of the lower working class, and Daisy was an upscale woman.All together, I was very impressed with the movie. It was closely related to the book, which would make it easy for one to understand, even if they hadn't read the book...yet. The movie kept my attention throughout the entire time I was watching it, it never became boring or repetitive. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has every had interests in well directed, suspenseful dramas with a bit of action."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Mr M's Movie Review: The Great GatsbyThe movie opens with the death of Gatsby and the falling of the precious cufflinks to the bottom of the swimming pool. About five years ago Gatsby loved and wanted to marry Daisy, but couldn't because he was too poor. Finally he has earned enough money, but Daisy is already married. The Great Gatsby is the story of upper-class society in the 1920s and the interactions between a group of people.Nick, played by Paul Rudd, was what I expected Nick to be like when I read the book. He was short which I think was supposed to show his unassertiveness and also he just looked controlled and exactly like the character I had read about before. Gatsby was played by Toby Stephens, who did a good job. The only thing I didn't like about his performance was that he reminded me of a really sleazy guy. When his smile turned to the side, he looked like he was trying to sell you a car or something. Overall I thought the cast was well chosen except for Gatsby because he seemed like a jerk.The movie seemed very accurate to book (themes, characters, symbolism, plot). It was really neat that when the two cars reached the setting of Myrtle's house that it was all dark and gray and colorless. This was a change from the bright colors the rich and symbolized the difference between the two classes. Another similarity involved the mood of the scenes. Most of them seemed to fit very well, like when Daisy cried over the shirts and was like a little kid touching all of Gatsby's possessions. This scene is supposed to give a feeling of materialism, and it's done very well. A major difference between the book and this movie is that at the begging of the movie it shows Gatsby being shot in his pool. I think the purpose of this was to get the movie of to a faster start before the introduction of the characters.One major problem with the movie was that it switched narrators about half way through. Instead of being from the perspective of Nick, it switched to Gatsby and Daisy's perspective during their affair. This is a little confusing because in the book Nick is informed about their relationship from other people, and that information is changed depending on who's telling it. By changing this part in the movie, it takes away a certain character development that is given through the way they talk to others.An aspect of the movie that really impressed me was the camera movement towards the end. Although seemingly insignificant, this detail can create different feelings depending on the quickness of the movement or how much waiting time is allowed. After Gatsby is shot the camera goes from his body to his killer, Wilson, to the police officer, to Nick, and finally to the sky. This sweeping movement gives the viewer a new piece of information every time it moves. Also, the scene was relatively calm and relaxed, as the event was an inevitable conclusion. I really liked the music of this movie. It seemed to enhance each scene by making some of them more dramatic or warning the viewer when something bad is about to happen. That's a quality that a movie can have that a book can't, it can use sound and visuals to bring the plot to a different level.Overall the Great Gatsby was a well-adapted movie of a book and used the extra senses to create feelings that weren't apparent before. The director's knowledge of the themes, moods and characters was obvious through the careful presentation and flowing scenes. One area in which this movie could have been better was some of the details like nick's perspective seemed a little different or untrue to the book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby was a very good book that I'd heard quite a bit about,but I never had the chance to read it for whatever reason. Now that I've read it, I'm glad I did. The book did disappoint me a little; I wanted to know more about Mr. Gatsby. It was explained a little about how he got his money, but I wanted to know exactly how he got it. I guess it really doesn't matter, I was just curious.I found the beginning of the book a little slow, and I had a hard time staying interested. Once Mr. Gatsby was introduced I couldn't wait to continue reading. I don't really know why; I guess it\`s because he's the title character. He brought an excitement to the book that wasn't there before.I didn't really care for Daisy and Tom. They made me fairly angry, especially Daisy. It's like she doesn't care about anyone but herself, I can't stand that. Tom, on the other hand, is just a bully. He does what he wants to and doesn't care about the consequences or who is effected by his actions.I would have to say my favorite character is Mr. Wilson. I kind of feel sorry for him. His wife doesn't respect him and he loves her anyway. He shouldn't, and he probably wouldn't, love her if he knew everything about her. I like Mr. Wilson because he just does his thing at the station, and he lives his simple life. Meanwhile, his wife is out living like they're millionaires, which they are not.Overall, I really enjoyed the book quite a bit. It wasn't extremely exciting, but at the same time I couldn't put it down. I guess I just enjoyed the story even though I would have liked it to go more in depth in certain areas. I would definitely recommend it to someone else."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is an interesting novel which brings the \\"Roaring Twenties\\" to life. The author of this book certainly knows how to maintain the reader's interest. The main scheme consists of a cast of colorful characters seemingly stuck in what modern day society would call \\"a mild soap opera type of lifestyle.\\" At least each and every one of these characters that the writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald has come up with; either has already or attempts to commit at least one or more of the seven deadly sins. These sins include pride, envy, greed, anger, lust as the main occurrences, with, sloth and gluttony ranking more at the lower end of the events that take place throughout the book.The narrator, Nick Carraway, irreverently states his thoughts and opinions about nearly each and every one of the vibrant characters more than once as the story goes on. Should we as reader's value Nick's opinion is something that you will have to find out for yourself. Nick says, \\"Gatsby turns out alright in the end.\\" I beg to differ with that statement but again, once the reader gets into the story he or she will realize this is a suspenseful plot which leads up to the main idea of who Jay Gatsby really was and what his intentions were as he shared the same social circle as Nick's cousin, Daisy. The \\"cast\\" includes the infamous Jay Gatsby, who the book revolves around and his former lover, Daisy Buchannan, who decided to marry Tom, who was richer and readily available while Gatsby was away at war. Also worthy of mention is Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson who will eventually share the same fate as Jay Gatsby as the story evolves closer to the end of the tremendous fiction.The bottom line being that The Great Gatsby is a great catch and a worthwhile read for any of us. We as readers should and could benefit from the literature and historical aspects in which F. Scott Fitzgerald has so terrifically written."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book was one of the most adorable books ever. It amazed me that Fitzgerald made so many references to transient yet important moments in life which we usually take for granted in life. It evoked feelings in me that made me think of the emotions behind a first kiss or the ones evoked when watching a couple bloom and fall apart. Simply Amazing."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I absolutely loved the Great Gatsby. This may be due in part to the fact that the 20's is my favorite time period, but I think its mainly because I love the way Fitzgerald writes. His work is full of gems and wonderfully sad quotes. He successfully reflects the essence of the 'Lost Generation' more than any other author I have read, that 'party-hard' attitude punctuated by melancholy.His characters are rich and successful, but unable to escape the weight of their pasts. They subsist on the American Dream gone wrong, finding happiness only in their fantasy versions of others. The main character, Jay Gatsby, lives for the hope of a relationship with his lost love, Daisy Buchanan, but he finds out that the real person can never live up to the ideal he has set for her.In essence, this novel conveys the melancholy and loss of missed opportunities. Gatsby is unable to accept that he cannot live his life with Daisy the way he once envisioned, so he retreats to a fantasy in which he convinces himself that if he just tries hard enough, he can win Daisy back and make everything right again. But he can't. He is living in a dream world, and when it is shattered, he is unable to really come back to reality again. Basically, the whole book can be summed up by Fitzgerald touching last line, \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\""},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The first time I read &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; I found it superficial and trite. It took a much more careful read to realize what a masterpiece this book is. Fitgerald uses the quick and flowing style of writing born in the Jazz Age, making this an easy read as well as a very satisfying one. I'm tempted to say that the basic storyline of Gatsby, a self-made millionaire, who pursues his fickle sweetheart to a tragic end, is outweighed by the synesthetic descriptions and intimate character studies. Fitzgerald has a skill for highlighting the dark, tragic moments in the book by contrasting them with beautiful and carefree lifestyle of its characters. This can make the book seem too light and at times arrogant; however, look deeper at the dialogue and actions of the character to find the disquieting sense of melancholy that make this book so sadly lovely."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Nick Carraway having graduated from Yale and fought in World War I has returned home to find a job. Being unsettled, he decided to move to New York to learn the bond business. The novel opens early in the summer of 1922 in West Egg, Long Island, where Nick has rented a house and seems to be unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg. Next to his place, is the Gatsby's mansion. Shortly after his arrival, Nick travels across the Sound to the more fashionable East Egg to visit his cousin Daisy Buchannan and her husband, Tom, a hulking, imposing man whom Nick had known in college. While Nick is there, he meets a young woman golfer named Jordan Baker, whom Daisy wants Nick to be interested in. During dinner, the telephone rings, and when Tom and Daisy leave the room, Jordan informs Nick that the caller is Tom's woman from New York. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom's marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.As the summer continues, Nick turns his attention to his mysterious neighbor, who hosts weekly parties for the rich and fashionable. Upon Gatsby's invitation, Nick attends one of the extravagant gatherings. There, he bumps into Jordan Baker, as well as Gatsby himself. Gatsby, a gracious host, remains apart from his guest; more of an observer more than a participant. As the party winds down, Gatsby takes Jordan aside to speak privately. Jordan is greatly amazed by what she's learned from Gatsby.One day, Nick and Gatsby take a trip into the city and there Nick meets Meyer Wolfshiem, one of Gatsby's associates and Gatsby's link to organized crime. On that same day, while having tea with Jordan Baker, Nick learns the amazing story that Gatsby told her the night of his party. Gatsby, it appears, is in love with Daisy Buchannan. They met years earlier when he was in the army but could not be together because he did not yet have the means to support her. In the intervening years, Gatsby made his fortune, all with the goal of winning Daisy back. He bought his house so that he would be across the Sound from her and hosted the elaborate parties in the hopes that she would notice. It has come time for Gatsby to meet Daisy again, face-to-face, and so, through the intermediary of Jordan Baker, Gatsby asks Nick to invite Daisy to his little house where Gatsby will show up unannounced.The day for the re-acquaintance of Gatsby and Daisy finally arrives. Gatsby makes sure that everything is perfectly prepared, and wants every detail to be perfect for his reunion with his lost love. When the two former lovers meet, their reunion is slightly nervous, but shortly, the two are again comfortable with each other.. Later on, the three move the party from Nick's house to Gatsby's, where he takes special delight in showing Daisy his meticulously decorated house and his impressive arrangement of belongings, as if demonstrating in a very tangible way just how far out of poverty he has traveled.When Nick, Jordan, and Tom take a drive one day, they discover that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom's lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle's husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then turns the gun on himself.After Gatsby's death, Nick is left to help prepare for his burial, only problem is that no one seems overly concerned with Gatsby's death. A telegram from Gatsby's father indicates he will be coming from Minnesota to bury his son. Gatsby's funeral hosts only Nick, Gatsby's father, a few servants, the postman, and the minister at his gravesite. Although Gatsby, during his lifetime held high popularity, at the time of his death, he was completely forgotten.Nick, after everything he has experienced, heads back home to the Midwest."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I decided to read The Great Gatsby knowing what a classic it's considered to be, but I have to say I didn't personally think it was great. I'll tell the basic plot to the story and then elaborate on my feelings.The story is told by Nick Carraway, a man living on Long Island next to the very wealthy Jay Gatsby. On first sight it appears Jay Gatsby has a wonderful live with his wealth and the extravagant parties he throws every week, but he's missing something. He's missing Daisy Buchanan's love. Daisy Buchanan is a woman he knew 5 years ago and fell in love with, but circumstances kept them apart. Coincidentally, Nick Carraway happens to be the 2nd cousin of Daisy whom lives only across a lake(which Gatsby knows). So, Gatsby befriends Carraway in an attempt to get back the love he lost. In retrospect, Carraway, as the narrator, relates the events of the period of his life in which he knew Gatsby and what happened.Reading this book, I just found trouble getting really into it. The characters are described well enough and a pretty clear picture of them is painted of them(except maybe for Gatsby who is always surrounded by some mystery) and the writing was pretty good(the book isn't bogged down with very sophisticated language or anything like that), but for about the first half of the book I just found things to be kind of boring. The 2nd half gets a little more interesting when things start to pick up between Daisy and Jay. Also, there's an interesting cast of characters which seem very real and make the book more interesting.Overall, I'd say that I would recommend reading this book since it is considered to be a classic and I know that others which read The Great Gatsby would probably have completely different opinions about the book and think it's great. Also, it's only about 197 pages, so it's really not too long. It's a book that I wouldn't be surprised that if I read again, like in a few years, perhaps maybe I'd have a different view of things. I do sort of get the feeling that maybe this is a book I'd appreciate a little more after another reading."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Amazing book.

We can all learn things from this book; like, how corrosive money can be, when love is gone we should move on, and that we all live some kind of misguided life. It's the book Bret Easton Ellis, Tom Woolf, et al, have always tried to write but never managed to come remotely close to. That's why, dear readers, it's still with us today. Check it out."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Ernest Hemingway, who had a lifelong love-hate relationship with F. Scott Fitzgerald once described Scott's talent as &quot;perfect and delicate as the wings of a butterfly.&quot; Yes, and that is what the lucky readers get in The Great Gatsby:that wonderful, exhilerating, lyrical delicacy shadowed by tragedy. I keep re-reading this book. It contains four or five of my favorite scenes in all literature: the scene of Daisy on the couch in the cottage with the breeze billowing her dress; the car accident at the party when we glimpse this dancing shoe emerging from the car; the great passage about &quot;those thrilling, returning trains of my youth&quot; and the scene where they're getting drunk in the hotel. There has never been a better, more subtly written drunk scene. Many have called Gatsby the best American novel of the century. It's not hard to see why. It's got everything in it. And it still stands, fresher than ever, as the great sad story of the American Dream gone sour."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I can only attempt to redeem the view many earlier readers on this board held of The Great Gatsby. This book is a classic and has been so well loved for so long by most types of people because it's so very easy to read. Fitzgerald has quite a lucid prose style; he's not a minimalist like his friend Hemingway but he keeps his writing concise. Gatsby can be read very easily by the skilled reader; I'm fifteen years old- I read the book first when I was fourteen- and have read the book five times since then, sometimes in a matter of hours. If you want to read a book that's hard to get through, pick up D. H. Lawrence and Kafka (who are both masters of writing in their own right). It kind of makes me sad to see how illiterate many of my peers are- I'm not sure if it's our generation or just the adolescent's innate desire to COMPLAIN constantly. But Gatsby is a work of art because of the way Fitzgerald turns the lives of these shallow people into an art form that flows easily into the reader's subconsious."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book interestingly enough tied right into F.Scott's real life story with his wife Zelda. He does such a great job explaining his version of the American dream, or nightmare if you will. His depiction of the roaring 20's and materialism left me a great catharsis of anger but also of sympathy towards Jay Gatsby. The whole novel ties into one idea and never leaves it for one moment. Even the words F.Scott used were &quot;full of money&quot; This book is almost like a commentary on the american people of that era and also the American Dream deferred. Great book, one of Fitzgerald's best."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"What a work of art, wow! I lived in a different world as I feasted my eyes upon what appeared as typed, structured sentences,but seemed like poetry to my sensitive and fragile heart.

In the end ,this book shows you that no matter how much money you have ,reality can still make life not so great after all. This book is intresting ,because one mans idea of the American dream is soon then doomed by materialistic things.

The theme of this novel is extremly valuble, and can be applied to everyone in their life. I recommend this novel to read just for fun. Trust me, it is definitly worth the time!!!!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Overall I really enjoyed the great Gatsby. Although it seemed a little dull in the first few chapters, The Great Gatsby has a great impact on a reader. The symbolism and the story contrast with each other perfectly. It is an exciting heartfelt story that I was hesitant to read at first but I actually ended up reading most of it in one day, which I think is very unusual for a student like me. The Characters in the novel seem almost to real and the story if followed carefully has an overwhelming amount of symbolism and meaning. This book really suprised me. Most books really don't appeal to me I am a very picky person when it comes to reading a good book and when I was finished The Great Gatsby I was very pleased with it overall!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I'm not an avid reader, but I absolutely adored Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'.

I thought this book was extremely well written and perfect for any literature class."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I'm a high school student who read this book by choice, as we must read several books of our own as part of our English class.I enjoyed this book tremendously. Fitzgerald has an amazing talent for drawing you into the worlds of the characters. The characters aren't especially deep but perhaps that's what makes them so intriguing. At first when introduced to them, especially Gatsby, you might think &quot; Oh how shallow&quot; but when examining yourself do some of the emotions not feel strangely familiar?This book is proof that money does nothing but create a world that covers pain with a nearly sheer curtain that can be ripped by raw emotions, revealing universal human desires, fears and mortality.I will definately read this book again, certain to discover more and more each time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Called \\"required reading\\" by so many people...it better be good right? If it isn't than why are so many children being forced to read it? The plot is none too exciting, in fact it's rather thin and stretched. For me, it was not the reason that I kept turning the pages--it was the amazing use of the English language that kept me going. For once I agree with the educators, who say this is an American classic that should be read by all students...not for the plot or even the characters but for the way F. Scott Fitzgerald uses language."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a book full of ironies. Gatsby was great because he was pure in his pursuit of love, yet as the tragedy unfolds, he had to pay for his &quot;greatness.&quot; Fitzgerald cleverly depicted a whole range of characters who are your typical everyday people with slightly accelerated and dramatic events happening around them. After all the book is set in the Roaring 20's.Gatsby himself was the touchstone character. He provided the contrast to all the characters around him. As one party scene in the book presented, most people were phonies - yet, Gatsby remained uncontaminated. He pursued love. And his failure was Fitzgerald's condemn of the world in which the Roaring 20's was, or rather how it always is.When reading this book, you see the society, you see your own life, and you'll see the fireworks produced by the deft writing that only Fitzgerald brings. It has something for everyone. And you'll see your bit of world, though less glamorous, perhaps, is no less colorful than the one painted by the author."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby, by F.S. Fitzgerald is a tragic love story. Throughout the novel, Fitzgerald is very descriptive and uses many themes to add a deeper understanding of the emotions and trials of the characters. Two major themes are wealth and self-improvement. Jay Gatsby had been in love with Daisy since the two met a month before he was sent to war. Gatsby admired her voice and felt the \\"stirring warmth that flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to (him) in one of those breathless, thrilling words.\\" She had \\"an excitement in her voice that men who cared for her found difficult to forget.\\" Gatsby loved Daisy's youthful beauty and cherished their limited time together. They devoted themselves to each other and expressed their powerful love. However, one problem existed- Gatsby's social status made him unsuitable for Daisy. Daisy came from a very wealthy family and Gatsby even noticed the \\"money in her voice.\\" Throughout and after his service in military, Jay Gatsby desperately tried to improve himself and his status so that when he returned his proposal would be accepted. When Jay Gatsby left the military, he began to establish himself with illegal \\"new money.\\" He met Meyer Wolfshiem, who \\"raised him... out of the gutter.\\" They were involved in illegal activities such as bootlegging, the unlawful sale of alcohol. They established a series of \\"drug stores\\" that provided it to the people. Jay Gatsby also forged counterfeit bonds. Although the sources of his income were illegal, he saw only the quick money that he was making and thought he could win Daisy back with his improved status. Sure enough, when Daisy and Jay were reunited, she was very impressed with his possessions. Oddly, she seemed to adore Jay more when he boasted his multiple silk shirts. She realized that Jay has done well for himself and she fell in love with him and the money. Although Daisy enjoyed Jay's lifestyle, she could not leave Tom Buchanan, her wealthy, arrogant husband (especially when she learned that the source of Jay's money may only be short-term.) Right before Jay Gatsby is killed, he began to realize that Daisy was a selfish being who was too obsessed with money and herself. He also realized that he spent about five years improving himself and becoming a man that he thought would be suitable for Daisy, but now he knows that Daisy was not suitable for him. When Gatsby was murdered, none of his party guests, business acquaintances or even Daisy pay their respects at his funeral. Some had picnics to attend; others were too wrapped up in a business deal at the moment. Daisy's selfish mind ran from the problems she caused and escaped on a vacation with her husband. She sent neither a letter nor flowers to acknowledge Gatsby's death. She did not recognize the trouble and struggle that Gatsby went through to improve himself and to gain her approval. Instead she retreated into her luxuries and forgot the one who loved her.Money distorts the mind and often produces false priorities. Daisy was accustomed to a certain lifestyle and wanted luxuries more than love. She was not able to face realty and often retreated intoher money, which she thought would solve everything. For Jay, it was the idea that he could buy Daisy's love. He soon realized that if someone would not accept you for who you are, then they are not worth accepting. Daisy was in love with money, not Tom or Jay---\\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\""},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a document of an era, like the Rosetta Stone -- an artifact that, all on its own, permits us to decipher the words and meanings of another era. In this case the era is the Jazz Age, a time of promise and excitement, especially for young people intoxicated by its novelties. It's no easy thing to capture a moment like that, but Fitzgerald does it with remarkable fluidity, because his writing skills are simply unparalleled. You can open any page of this great book and revel in the sheer artistry of phrasing, the wit, the precision of description. Since it was published it has continually been enjoyed by generation after generation because it is the perfect snapshot of the moment. For an equivalent in later years, On the Road captures the 50's brilliantly. For contemporary times, the very best I've found is the remarkable Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, which demonstrates ably that the concerns of the Jazz age -- fast living, young people grabbing the world by the throat and giving it a good shake -- are still with us. Great books from great writers, evoking eras perfectly."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Nick Carraway spends a summer learning about responsibility and romance as his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, begins an adulterous affair with a long-lost love, Jay Gatsby. This one-sentence plot summary does nothing to relay the considerable issues of the book. We learn that Jay Gatsby has a strong sense of romance--he is a product of the American Dream, where everything is possible as long as anything can be bought. He becomes a product of reputation, a carefully cultivated fictional past, and ready money at a time when established order has suffered a severe jolt from early twentieth-century ennui and loss of faith. Fitzgerald's analysis of shifting societal proprieties remains relevant as we begin our new century, but Jay Gatsby's yearning for a pure, enduring love makes this book timeless. If THE GREAT GATSBY isn't the greatest American novel, it must be in the top ten. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"How can anyone NOT give this book 5 stars? I appreciated the foreword, preface, afterword, explanatory notes &amp; the notes about the author by Matthew J. Bruccoli which enlightened my eyes before I started on the path of reading The Great Gatsby.It's funny that somehow my high school English teacher skipped this as required reading for me in the mid to late seventies. I bought the book for my niece, Ashley, a few years ago. I remembered a co-worker, Kim, who was an avid reader who once told me that The Great Gatsby was her all-time favorite book. I was curious. It's strang that it took my 17 year old niece to 'get me on the bandwagon' to finally read this classic book at age forty-one. It amazes me to realize that the author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, died at age forty-four in Southern California on December 21, 1940, believing himself a failure.It's quite clear that Fitzgerald's ideas may have been 'made up' but he sued real life people, his own experiences and other true events to make his story.In retrosprect, the novel contains a story of money, greed, love, deceit, suspense, hate, alcoholism, stress, passion, time, ambition, death, life, status, 'leaving a mark in life', pleasure, vacation, free time, heroes, lies, trust, women vs. men, the 1920s, mystery, intrigue, romance, poor vs. rich, Sundays in the park, art, happiness, choices, fashion, lust, loneliness, friendship, adventure, honesty, making conversation, scenic views, people, music, dance, avoidance, communication, observation, summer, intelligence, panic, forgetting, agin, laughter, family values, prejudice, jealousy, past, future, youth, tranquility, grief, responsibility, self-improvement, self-actualization, carelessness, escaping and living life."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I thought this book was really good.

She some times loved too much. which you will find out when u read the book, I give it two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I felt that The Great Gatsby was a good book. It definitely illustrates well the daily activities of life in the 1920's. There are many things that were happening at that time that influenced the plot of the book such as the war and the KKK. I enjoyed reading material by a new author. Fitzgerald does an incredible job of bringing to life the settings of the book, and he uses such vivid and colorful words to describe them. There are times when the novel could become a bit confusing as far as the time element was concerned, but Fitzgerald would usually give subtle hints to allow you to estimate around what time it was. I think that the book is a book that can be enjoyed by many different kinds of readers, and it is a good book to read if you are interested in getting a taste of life in the 1920's."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The favorite novel of romantics, it is put together like a mysterious machine from another world. Interestingly, movies can't get close to portraying Gatsby's passion. The code has never been broken by those who wish to trade on or exploit this tale. There are a couple of flaws in the marble, but that just adds to its mysterious greatness. This novel is read, and then re-read and then re-read. There is nothing else like it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, \\"The Great Gatsby\\", is narrated by the passive Nick Carrraway, who has recently settled into the West Egg section of Long Island, a decidedly less prestigious area than its East Egg counterpart. He has come to find his way in New York and to make his name known in the bond business. Nick's story, however, is not so much about himself as it is about his new neighbor, the mysterious Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gaudy mansion next door and hosts wild weekly parties to all of New York's upper crust. When Nick is brought into this fast-paced world, he must reexamine himself and the world he lives in.The novel is a classic examination of what it means to be a success the American Dream. As secrets unfold about the mythologized Gatsby, we discover that he has reinvented himself into the persona that he is, and that he is a man who is tormented by an idealistic vision of the woman he loves, and his desire to capture that woman for himself.Written in 1922, the novel is both a tragedy and a scathing indictment of the time of decadence that preceded the immediate economic upheaval and crash of 1929. Although it is situated very much in the context of the 20s and New York, it serves as a timeless story of a man's dream and the sometimes impossibility of those dreams."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A couple of thoughts:1. Don't read this book, or any book, because you believe it to be \\"a classic.\\" That term is essentially meaningless, and the people who use it -- either as praise or blame -- generally don't have any souls. Really. And that is not a subjective opinion.2. Do read this book because, in doing so, you may learn things about the reality of America, the dream of America, dreaming itself and the beautiful emptiness of it, and perhaps even yourself. You may not learn all these things. You may, in fact, not learn any of them. And, frankly, you may not like the way the book is challenging your conception of yourself once you realize just how deeply it is doing so. But at the very least, even if you hate the book after you have read it, you will have exposed yourself to some thoughts that are, in and of themselves, quite beautifully expressed. Worse things can happen to you. And if the worst thing that ever happens to you is that you don't like a book, you'll be luckier than most.3. A lot of people have found in this book something worthwhile, although it hasn't always been (as evidenced by these reviews) \\"pleasure.\\" Some of those people may indeed be fools, and others of them may have been hornswaggled by the Evil American Culture Industry into thinking this book was more meaningful to them than, say, the Iliad. But, probably, the rest of them are just being honest. You might give them the benefit of the doubt.4. Likewise, a lot of people (albeit fewer of them, again as evidenced by these reviews) have found absolutely nothing worthwhile in this book. I encourage you to read their reviews, and then to press the \\"read the rest of my reviews button\\" to find out just how many of them prefer, say, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (which is, without a doubt, funnier) to this book. But, as in thought number 3 above, it is probably a mistake to generalize: certainly not all of the people who find this book valueless are unsophisticated, imaginationless, anti-intellectual, snobbish, or even just plain douchebags.It is remarkable, however, how often they sound that way.5. You may disregard thought 4 with respect to Luder of Saddam City. I'm pretty sure he/she IS a douchebag. And I reiterate: he/she really doesn't get the book. Or, I suspect, books generally. But he/she does seem to like Spanish an awful lot."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a fictional novel portraying the lives of wealthy young citizens of West and East-Egg, Long Island. Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby was his chance for something new. It was his chance for what he believed was greatness. Today the Great Gastby's name is synonymous with that of Fitzgerald's. Fitzgerald's novel includes love,mystery, and a myriad of events that would lead to downfall and tragedy.The story takes place around the jazz era. Nick, the narrator of the story is a young gentlman who comes out to the west into Long Island into a bonds business. He spends his summer with his cousin Daisy Bunchanan, her husband Tom Buchanan, and their friend/tennis star, Jordan Baker. Nick is fascinated by the mystery and lifestyle of his neighbor Jay Gatsby. Gatsby, the topic of the story, is a man who had built an empire for himself which eventually like many empires, fall. As much as Gatsby is great, he is plagued with many rumors.Gatsby befriends Nick to get to his cousin Daisy whom he was once in love with five years ago before he had gone to war. He goes through many obstacles such as Daisy's husband Tom and his fear of rejection once again. It turns out that Daisy had rejected him in the past because he was too poor. Gatsby makes his way up top through some illegal activities accompanied by his friend Meyer Wolfshiem. For years Gastby had been hosting parties and moved to West Egg to lure Daisy and to meet her once again. After wising to the fact that Nick was her cousin he had found his trump card.However this novel does not end in fairy tale. It is more of a Shakespeareian play, a tragedy. Althoygh I'm more partial to happy endings, the twist in the story does very well suit it. The story is wonderfully pieced together, in storym plot, and ending but it lacks excitement. Maybe Fitzgerald was headed in the direction of simplicity but this is definitely too simplistic.I don't agree with Fitzgerald's title for the story. To my knowledge there was nothing great about Gatsby. He used people to his advantage like the way he used Nick to get to Daisy. To get Nicks help he would even in a manner, bribe him. Was it because he was rich and famous? He became rich through illegal acitvities such as bootlegging with shady figures such as Wolfshiem and he was just as famous as rumors about him were. There is nothing great about that struggling man. A more appropriate title would be \\"The Late Gatsby\\". He is dead inside.I found some parts of the story quite blurry and hard to understand. Was the role of Tom Buchanan a bad man or a good yet misunderstood man? Some say he's a brute but was his actions justifiable? I believe they were; he was only standing up for his wife. He does admit to loving his wife Daisy and tries to keep Gatsby away from her. Is he wrong for doing so? In one man's opinion he may be protecting his family from a home wrecker and in another man's opnion he may be blocking the starving lover from his candy of his eye.In the end I believe this isn't much of a reading material. I was easily bored. Maybe the story could have been more interesting had Fitzgerald created a much better narrator. Everything in this story wa pure descriptive. Although it was pieced together well, it lacked substance. Maybe this story would be more appealing to the older age groups but to keep interest in teenage readers, I would have to disagree. It is not really a bad story in terms of construction, just in the ability to maintain a reader's interest."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"There's so much critique-wise that could be said of this book. It's an entertaining, interesting story. The characters are so well-developed and their actions and words so consistent and unique throughout the novel that they seem so real. This is something most novels lack. Fitzgerald brings even the minor characters to life. The imagery and symbols are intricate, both serving to further the theme. The symbols are an integral part of the story, like Gatsby's car, which characterizes him as ostentatious and symbolically leads to his death. The characters themselves are symbolic. The story serves as a historical document of the 20's. The thematic material applies as much to our present society as it did back then. It is condensed, fitting so much meaning into each page, each sentence, each phrase. Much of the wording of the book is so memorable, so quotable, even magical. The Preface, Publisher's Afterward, and the Explanatory notes of this edition, as well as Cliff's Notes are very helpful to understand and appreciate this novel.The basic theme is that of the American Dream. Jay Gatsby is defined by his dream to win Daisy Buchanan, a popular, beautiful, but superficial girl. To win her, he needs exorbitant sums of money which he gains through corruption. Gatsby has all the \\"toys\\"-- a mansion, a Rolls-Royce, a hydroplane, and connections to people like Meyer Wolfsheif who fixed the 1919 World Series. Dan Cody circling the continent aimlessly in his yacht as he falls victim to alcohol shows that money is not an end in itself. Gatsby is different because money is only a means to an end for him; still, he fails. This book shows the harmful effects of a wide gap between the rich and the poor. The wealthy Buchanan's are not productive at all and the poor Wilson struggles to survive and is pushed around by Tom Buchanan. This book shows that such extreme wealth as Gatsby's and the Buchanan's leads to waste. Gatsby has a pool he only uses once all summer. He drives a Rolls-Royce which can cost over 300 grand in today's money. Daisy drives the car and accidentally kills Wilson's wife who was having an affair with Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband. Tom manipulates Wilson into thinking Gatsby killed her and Wilson shoots him then turns the gun on himself. The major theme of the novel is that \\"money isn't real\\" as the movie \\"Blow\\" put it. The material world is illusion, in other words. I've heard it said that \\"You can't buy happiness but you can rent it.\\" If that's true, then it helps explain Gatsby's failure-- he tried to, and thought he did, buy it.Gatsby's boyhood program for self-improvement as revealed by his dad at the ending is just like Ben Franklin's autobiography. Two self-help books I've read and reviewed negatively are \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" by Dale Carnegie and \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" by Anthony Robbins. After reading Gatsby it seemed as though these two books were studied and practiced thoroughly by Jay Gatsby.First off, Gatsby's mannerisms resemble what is recommended in \\"Win Friends.\\" Gatsby is very indirect. He can't just go directly to Daisy or even directly to Nick to arrange the meeting between he and Daisy. He has Jordan tell Nick about the background between them then has Nick invite Daisy over to his house (he's Gatsby's neighbor) and tells him to tell her not to bring her husband. Gatsby then disappears outside when she comes and knocks on the back door. He must have looked like an idiot to Daisy being so ridiculously indirect and obvious like this. Gatsby even bought his house in the neighborhood of Daisy for this reason. Another aspect of Win Friends is to smile-- whether you are truthfully happy or not to charm other people into liking you. Consider Nick's description of Gatsby's smile, \\"It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it. It faced--or seemed to face-- the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you, with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck...whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.\\" As is advised to do in \\"Win Friends\\", Gatsby makes other people feel special like the way he calls everyone \\"old sport.\\" But keep in mind Gatsby has no real friends and everyone but Nick merely uses him. They flocked to his mansion by the hundred for his parties but only a few people were at his funeral.The other Jay Gatsby handbook is \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" by Anthony Robbins. I once saw Tony on TV and Jay Gatsby came to my mind before I realized it was him. I saw Tony's signature before and it was signed in a \\"majestic hand\\" just like Gatsby's writing on the note of invitation to his party to Nick. Throughout his book, Robbins writes of his accomplishments of making money and buying all the ostentatious \\"toys\\" like Gatsby has. Both men's obsession with materialism is so intense as to almost take on a spiritual level. Comparing \\"The Great Gatsby\\" to these two books and the movies \\"Blow\\" and \\"Casino\\" are just some ways you can understand how Gatsby relates to our world now even though it was written about the 1920's.I don't feel a review of a 1000 word limit can possibly do justice to this novel. To appreciate it yourself, all the more I can say is read it, read Cliff's notes, think about it, read it again, and observe how the theme relates to the world around you very much today."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is the horrifically real tale of people and lost dreams. The story takes place in New York in the 1930's -40's. The main charcter, Nick is a bondsman from Wisconsin who happens to move into a house nextdoor to the mysterious Jay Gatsby who throws extraveagnt parties nightly. Nick's summer in New York was a colorful menagerie of elaborate society where he meets his sweetheart and gets into some mixups with his cousin Daisy and Gatsby. Nick discovers after not too much time there is a reason why Gatsby's past is so elusive and that there is a very real and very powerful agenda on Gatsby's mind. The Great Gatsby was an awesome book. Fitzgerald has a bold voice in his writing and expresses abstrsct ideas in a very tangible form. It gave a tragic look into life and society of the East Coast and the forlorn hopes that people hold to in their minds. Gatsby was a pleasant read and the sentences seemed to contain so much substance that I found myself rereading a lot so I wouldn't miss anything. I read the authorized text, so it was identical to the original publication, so it was wholly preserved. I would reccommend this book as intriguing and enchanting to most."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I purchased this book for my high school lit class and found it to be a huge rip-off. Besides lacking page numbers, the opening epigraph, and consistent formatting, the copy is also printed in an extremely small font, making it quite difficult to read. Save your money and buy one of the other versions of this book!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I am utterly baffled by the reputation this book enjoys. Fitzgerald seems to assume (rightly it would seem) that the mere evocation of fantastic wealth (shiny automobiles, lavish parties etc) will be fantastically interesting to his readers. A triumph of content over style if you ask me! Admittedly there are a few very brilliant passages, but overall I find the book's much-vaunted prose to be like iridescent steam, vapid and affected. There is precious little complexity of thought, and more of what I would call \`sentiment' than genuine emotion. The symbolism is laughably trite (to take just 3 examples : the green light on Daisy's side of the bay, characters in white, and - last but not least - the celebrated Valley of Ashes (Oh come on now ! Give us break!)). The characterization struck me as hollow, and the dialogue stilted and unnatural. Very rarely was I able to hear real men and women. I could go on, but after reading what other readers have said I feel like a voice in the wilderness..."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book arrived on time and was as eexpected. The book was required reading by my daughters American Lit class. It has been read and annotated and analyzed...she found the book to be interesting and easy to read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I pretty much had my mind made up about this book going into it. Having read numerous spoilers over the years (Gatsby is, after all, everywhere) and having just finished two depressingly weary previous novels of Fitzgerald, I was braced for another unredemptive drag through the dust with yet another hoard of hard-drinking, adulterous characters. And, in essence, that's exactly what it is. But there's more to this one than just that. I wasn't more than a chapter in before I could tell this was something different from anything else Fitzgerald had done. It's lighter, less self-indulgent, and as a result a much more piquant and incisive study of character and culture. A large part of its difference is the narrative voice, which is thankfully far away from the Avery and Anthony of his earlier novels. For once, we have a basically decent character objectively observing the crumbling of the immoral rich. It's not a book I would enjoy reading over and over again, but there is a magic here that makes me understand why it is so beloved."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I believe THE GREAT GATSBY (that did not sell well in its day) is not Fitzgerald's best book. I think it has endured in academia because liberal professors like how it &quot;damns&quot; the American Dream. Gatsby tries to realize the American Dream by going from a poor boy to a rich man, and moving into high society. But he fails. (He never started down the American Dream trail anyway. Gatsby makes his money illegally, which is NOT the American Dream). Academics love when the American Dream is &quot;shown&quot; to be a house of cards. Then we can all embrace socialism. Fitzgerald actually wrote better short stories (especially &quot;Absolution,&quot; which, ironically, was originally a childhood scene for THE GREAT GATSBY, but cut out). And Fitzgerald's contemporary, John O'Hara, said about Fitzgerald's later novel TENDER IS THE NIGHT: &quot;Compared with TENDER IS THE NIGHT, THE GREAT GATSBY is greasy kid stuff.&quot; And O'Hara was absolutely right. TENDER IS THE NIGHT is a much better novel. Ernest Hemingway even thought TENDER IS THE NIGHT was Fitzgerald's best novel. GATSBY ain't bad, but if you want to read the best of Fitzgerald, check his other work out first."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel has a certain magnetism, a certain style that the author used to beautify and immortalise the mundane aspects of life and glorify them forever in our memory; aesthetic language is the manuscript of this amazing opus..In this case, it is a sweet lullaby that came from the 1920's, a most singular era potrayed to us through the eyes of a virtuous writter, F.Scott.Fitzgerald; He gave life to an era and wings to its cast, creating a world full of surreal parties, dusty limbos and glamourus automobiles.Yet it is surely through the special appeal of its language that the novel makes its first claim on our interest; for it it is a highly poetic novel, with strong, powerful, touching evocations that make our senses submerge and transmigrate into a perpetual limbo.The novel is strung together by motifs that appear and return, lingering in our mind for future innuendosIn a society, accidents happen and are taken for granted, but as they multiply in the book, they reveal a whole new meaning in which cars are merely futile excuses for careless driving with no moral or ethical directions at all.Irresponsability is the essence, the fuel on which this nemesis drives on, running over anything without any regret but expecting that someone ( the white trash ) will always clean after them.It is as if the 1920's were just pleasent cocktail waves impregnated with the mezmerising sounds of jazz, catalysed in the anarchy of charleston's moodThis were the parties Gatsby hosted, were all the USA intoxicated themserlves with champagne and sinecures, merely to sober up and presence the reality of the hangoverGatsby merely intended to extend the curfew, in order not to face the reality of his anguish, the slow trepidation of time's forgotten realm, showing itself as an incubus that would end the dream....his dreamGatsby wanted to trascend time, and to him time appeared submissive to his wealth and power, as he tried to recreate the past, the american dream, holding the clock's wrath aimlessly and in vain against his hopes, desires and aspirations, leading to his destruction while the others,&quot;the foul dust that floated on the wake of his dreams&quot; lingers on forever, covering meaningless actions in a meaningless worldBut soon the 20's would sail etheraly into the past with all its cast viciously darkened by the definite crash"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby was a great novel and one that everyone who has read this, will remember. I truly believed that it defined and era of our country. The extravagant parties and tea times. Gatsby's tragic flaw although was the fact that he loved Daisy and fell in love with her once again, too easily. Daisy, I feel had no respect for Gatsby, especially after his death. Not going to your lovers funeral is the worst flaw anyone can possess. I feel sorry for Gatsby and hope that this never happens to anyone close to me. Everyone who said and acted like they were his friends truly weren't. I also feel very sorry for Nick Carrawy because he has to witness a great man st and alone and still be happy in the process. Gatsby's book also describes the era of the 20's very well. He has been known to define the Jazz age and th era. Affer doing some basic work on the 20's, it shows that it really does describe alot of the time period. Gatsby's place in life was not showed through his work. His life suffered more hard work than Gatsby ever could. I think that through his works he tried to portray his life in a way that he wish it would have went."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"At this point a wide variety of teachers have been teaching me English, in one form or another, for the last 12 years or so. I have often heard some of those teachers describe &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; as an American literary classic, but I haven't had the opportunity to read the story until now. One reason is that a novel like &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; written in 1925 didn't exactly appeal to the average teenager at these earlier stages of education. Another, more valid, reason is that we probably wouldn't have understood it anyway.At first sight &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; seems to be a long story about nothing in particular except for an obscene amount of parties. It turns out though that the story contains multiple levels of observation on the American society during the &quot;roaring twenties&quot;, as well as more general reflections over human nature and even philosophical and theological points.A thing I find interesting about &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, is the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, because this says a great deal about Gatsby. During the story three different images of Gatsby are transmitted to the readers. At first Gatsby is portrayed as a decent and noble Oxford man who has made himself a fortune in ways unknown to us and with a lot of things going on. He gives great parties and even though several of his guests perceive him as a somewhat mystical figure who isn't quite what he seems to be - some even suggest that he killed a man or acted as a German spy during the war - he stands out as the perfect host. Later it turns out that he actually does have a lot of things going on, though not exactly of the reputable kind.The truth is that he participated in the war and came out as a highly decorated officer. After the war however his decorations could not buy food or clothes and by coincidence he met Meyer Wolfsheim, who had just the right thing for him...So Gatsby is actually in the business of bootlegging. Having established that, it would be easy to write him off as a liar and a common - although wealthy - criminal. This image of him is softened though by the observation, that he did it for love. In fact it seems that everything in his life revolves around one person, namely Daisy.It turns out that Gatsby and Daisy know each other from five years earlier, when they were a couple and were actually going to marry each other. Gatsby was madly in love with Daisy and she loved him too, but when he was in Europe during the war, she eventually got a little bit desperate and wanted her life to take on a steady and reassuring direction - I would imagine that her parents had something to do with it as well. Consequently she married Tom Buchanan, who was extremely wealthy and an impressive physical presence as well. This explains Gatsby's actions to a certain extent, since it is obvious that the only purpose of his extravagant house is to impress Daisy.This is seen in the situation where Gatsby has Nick Carraway arrange a meeting with Daisy at Nick's - a rather embarrassing session at first that ends up with Gatsby giving Daisy the super-extended deluxe grand tour of his house. During the tour Gatsby perceives his own home through Daisy's eyes and generally does everything to seem interesting, for instance when asked how he can stand living in the house alone: &quot;I always keep it full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.&quot; It is not a coincidence either that he bought his house with a view across the water to where Daisy lives. At the end of the dock she has a green light that shines all night, which takes on a great deal of significance since it symbolises the distance between Daisy and himself.The span of water between Gatsby and the light (also great symbolism in itself, isn't it?) could be compared to the actual distance in emotion and time. Now he has met with her, talked to her and touched her. She has seen his home and given her approval, so the gap has closed and the light is just a light again. Or is it? The light could be any colour, but it is green which has always meant &quot;full speed ahead&quot;. So since the distance between Gatsby and the light has closed due to his recent entering the same high social class as Daisy, he is now worthy of her love, in his own eyes and apparently hers as well.So the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy has come full circle. Jay Gatsby's appearance towards his surroundings is built up on lies upon deceit and e.g. the large and wild parties are only meant to capture the attention of Daisy.Another thing that I find interesting in this story is the mentioning of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. After the death of his wife George Wilson states that &quot;God sees everything&quot; while looking specifically at the eyes of T.J. Eckleburg indicating that Eckleburg should or could be interpreted as God. He is, however, just an old billboard advertising for an optometrist - faded after not having been painted for a long time and brooding over a dumping ground . The symbolism is pretty clear. The presence of God is faded in the society described and the society as seen by God i.e. those who believe, is deranged - a dumping ground.As for George Wilson he says: &quot;...you can't fool God&quot; and &quot;God sees everything&quot; but the question he must be asking himself is, if God sees everything, why did he not stop Myrtle Wilson from running out in front of the car? Maybe that is why God is symbolised only by a pair of huge eyes - because He let go of the steering wheel years ago and has now retreated to the role of the observer. Omnipotence replaced by omniscience. Anyway Wilson decides to lend God's eyes a pair of hands, but manages - with a little help from Tom Buchanan - to kill the wrong man.Importance is in the mind of the beholder - a historian would find other aspects of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; interesting than I have. Interpreting this story, I found it exciting to work with the whole relationship between Gatsby and Daisy. The story of how his love for her gave birth to his ambitions and consequently his wealth hold faint reminiscence of Greek tragedy. It stands parallel to Fitzgerald's own life, where he could not marry Zelda Sayre until he had achieved some success and wealth , and even Fitzgerald's description of the wild life is somewhat autobiographical. In the story Daisy moves away with her husband, while in real life Fitzgerald was separated from Zelda because she was suffering from a severe mental illness.The passages about T.J. Eckleburg are a fine way of giving a hint that this wild life and social shallowness is actually leading nowhere - also illustrated by the fact that only three persons attend Gatsby's funeral - his father, Nick Carraway and the man with the owl-eyed glasses. He is the only other person who has taken the time to scratch the surface of Gatsby as a human being, symbolised by his opening the books in Gatsby's library instead of just assuming that they would be empty shells . This suggests that a man's legacy could be measured by the number of people by his grave rather than in parties or hard currency."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"How is it possible to label as &quot;underappreciated&quot; a book that is routinely included in the American literary canon? Understand this: _Gatsby_ forced its way into the canon--with the pellucid beauty of its prose and the undeniable resonance of its theme--against the wishes of many, if not most, in the critical intelligensia. In his time, Fitzgerald was regarded as a talented but irresponsible lightweight, a writer who dissolved his unique gift in expensive gin. Today, his lifetime reputation as a dissolute drunkard continues to tarnish his litarary legacy, particularly in comparison to the other two members of the Trinity of 20th Century American Literature, Hemingway and Faulkner. With some exceptions (most notably the fanatically devoted Matthew Bruccoli), critics and academics continue to regard Fitzgerald's work of love, wealth, and dreams as a shade beneath Hemingway and Faulkner, with their more gaudily &quot;literary&quot; themes of mortality, family, and death. But _Gatsby_ makes liars and fools of those who remain intent on observing only a chronicler of the gin-soaked privileged classes. Yes, there is wealth, and parties and cars and stars, but _Gatsby_ is a book that rewards not only the dazzling first read, but repeated readings. Of course, the book features some of the best of Fitzgerald's spectacular, inimitable prose style, which even detractors acknowledge as unmatched in its poetic grace. But there is much more underneath the fine finish, where so many have failed to look, distracted by the glossy exterior. Dreams, ambition, financial and moral corruption, love real and imagined, morality, success, failure and death: these are _Gatsby_'s themes, the themes of the American story--and are there bigger themes in Hemingway's bullfights and war, or Faulkner's incest and insanity? Modern critics continue to insist that Fitzgerald understood only a certain class and time, but this assessment suffers from a failure of the vision and imagination that Fitzgerald possessed in abundance. The very slightness of the plot of _Gatsby_ facilitates its analogy to contemporary America. Just imagine how easy it would be for Hollywood to remake _Gatsby_ as a modern tale of a boy from the ghetto rising through raw ambition and illicit means, chasing a dream he left behind that was never within his reach. In fact, Hollywood has made that movie, a hundred times over, because it is the prototypical American story, applicable to any time or place in the nation's history. _Gatsby_ is really a perfect, particular retelling of the most enduring story in American mythology"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Few books can be as consistently incredible as Gatsby. The idea of astockbroker/promoter who has a heart must send chills of fear downthe managers of the great Wall Street firms. Yet, it is so, and isdecisively the realm of fiction.Gatsby is the prototypical social mountaineer, climbing and climbingin the 1920s towards an impossible dream: having the love of a flipand indecisive Southern gal, and being accepted for who he dreams hemay be within his questing heart. Like the best American novels itis replete with greed, over consumption of limited goods, graced bya cynical narrator, and clever in its jaded appraisal of life.Ultimately the book comes down to one central issue that is notexplained: &quot;Why would a great man have so much love for a selfishlyundeserving woman?&quot; Gatsby has grandeur but his love has nothing.It's a spoiled book in that sense, and without the quality of virtuein Daisy, the book becomes a cruel mistake that can only end in death.Fitzgerald's style is elegant, brief, he never makes mistakes injudgment, and his narrative is impeccable. The book rushes forwardlike a Greek tragedy and ends just as Sunset Boulevard begins: withGatsby dead in a pool killed by that which he loved. Somehow thereis some great truth in the idea that in great American fiction theuse of coincidence is always deadly, and satisfaction never easy.Plato would have used the book as an exemplar in his proof of theideal, Aristotle would have merely laughed, yet inwardly agreed -the book is a cautionary tale; but more importantly hagiography.....C.K.

Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY is the tale of an aloof narrator caught up in adultery and murder in a 1920s America flush with new money. The novel has been touted as a mirror of its age, a meditation on the loss of a basic humanity in the midst of economic prosperity, and even the summit of American prose writing in the 20th century.In fact, I must confess that I find THE GREAT GATSBY a sometimes tiresome soap opera that never manages to make that leap to great novel. The novel can be read to the end, and even often enjoyed. There's a decent bit of humour, and clearly some elements have been original enough to sink into the public consciousness. However, those elements that are so often referenced -- Gatsby's unrequited love, Nick's disgust with what he sees -- always sound more profound when detached from the actual text with its contrived turns, unrealistic dialogue and the occasional (and generally unsuccessful) try at poetic metaphor.All in all, THE GREAT GATSBY belongs in that list of books one must read to be an informed person, but for which one should steel oneself for the disappointment that may come."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read this book because I'm trying to read a lot of the classics on the various \\"Top 100\\" book lists floating around out there.

The reason I say that is because I'm an avid reader of classic fiction (great literature from the past and the present), but I just didn't understand why this is considered one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. I chose to read this book in part because of its &quot;greatness&quot; in the eyes of most reviewers. But I found myself 150 pages into it and still waiting for something exciting to happen. It started out slow and just got slower. But I just didn't get it. The ending was definitely surprising (I won't spoil it for whoever's reading this), but somewhat of an anticlimax.What was the most depressing to me is that I have read many other great books that my friends have hated or found utterly boring, and I have just loved them. Examples include &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;Ethan Frome.&quot; But I must have just missed something major in this book. I understand all the fuss about the &quot;American Dream&quot; and how this is about the hollowness of rich living, but it seems that in writing about that hollowness, the book becomes hollow too. Well, I'm only 16 and in the 10th grade, so that definitely must be affecting something. I guess I'll just leave it on my bookshelf for a decade and go back and then we'll see where I am.

Even when we do meet Gatsby, we, along with Carraway and the inhabitants of West Egg, are made aware of the fact that we still do not fully know who he is, where he comes from or very much about the man. This subtle characterization illustrates Fitzgerald's genius.There are a handful of moments in The Great Gatsby when the reader drops the book down and says, &quot;Ohmygosh!&quot;. Fitzgerald doesn't make this book flat and predictable, but instead takes some interesting turns. One such turn occurs when Tom Buchanan gets confrontational with Gatsby, and Gatsby, the polished gentleman, opens right up and speaks the truth as he sees it -- giving a shocking revelation.We wade into The Great Gatsby not knowing what lurks in the murky waters. Is this a story about a mysterious man with a dark past? Oh-- okay, this is a love story!...No, wait...this is a story about life... It is not until the last word is read, the book is closed and set down, that the reader truly &quot;gets&quot; The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is narrated through Nick Carroway, a man who is new to the town of West Egg. Through Nick's eyes the reader learns of Gatsby, Daisy and Daisy's husband Tom. Gatsby is a veteran who has horded much wealth through corrupt means. In the beginning of the story, the reader knows very little of Gatsby or his past. The conflict is apparent in Gatsby's utter love for Daisy. The plot centers around this conflict and much happens because of it.The theme of this story is that money can't buy happiness; therefore the search for happiness should be of one's own accord. This theme is brought out by the characterization the author uses in the story. For example, through the first quarter of the book the reader learns about Gatsby from rumors and gossip. The characterization brings out the tone of suspicion and nerviousness, leaving the reader to guess the next step of the plot for themselves. Through and through &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a classic book with very effective literary techniques and a universal theme."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I had to read this book for school. I enjoyed it very much, and I see how it defined the \\"Jazz Age\\" so well, but I tend to think this book is overrated. It is listed as the 2nd best novel of the century according to the Modern Library's List of the Top 100 Books of the Century. The book has many good points, but I do believe there are many better books out there. I like the characters and how the story is told from the eyes of a bystander to the happenings, Nick Carraway. I also admire Fitzgerald's way with words and his ability to tell a story. The descriptions of Gatsby's mansion and parties give a vivid picture of what the 1920's were really like, and because of this, the book is known as the definitive novel of the 1920's. The theme of the \\"death of the American Dream\\" cannot be underrated, either; this undoubtedly is a major reason why the book is rated so high in booklists. On the bad side, I believe the story takes way to long to get going. It only contains 197 pages and nine chapters; the first four chapters all contain exposition. Once the action gets going, the book is good, but overall, I believe this book, while definitely a classic, is overrated."}]`),z={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],D={key:0},N={key:1};function q(s,a,n,c,r,i){const y=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",F,[(e(!0),t(f,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,u)=>(e(),w(y,{key:u,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",N,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",D,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const S=d(z,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-e41dcff9"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/29.md","filePath":"quotesmag/29.md"}'),H={name:"quotesmag/29.md"},B=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(S)]))}});export{W as __pageData,B as default};
