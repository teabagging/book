That invitation was the start of a career that spanned half a century and culminated with Martin's induction into the International Bluegrass Music Association's Hall of Honor. Always an enigmatic figure, Martin was as famous for his temper as he was for his talent. On assignment from the Oxford American magazine, fiction writer and music critic Tom Piazza drove from his home in New Orleans to Nashville to interview Martin and found himself pitched headlong into a world he couldn't have anticipated. Martin's mercurial personality drew the writer into a series of escalating encounters (with mean dogs, broken-down cars, and near electrocution), culminating in a harrowing and unforgettable expedition, with Martin, to the Grand Ole Opry. Though, or perhaps because, visits to the Opry like the one Piazza recounts were common for Martin, and though he frequently played on its stage and always hoped to become a member, he died before seeing his dream fulfilled. True Adventures with the King of Bluegrass is the funny, scary, and powerfully poignant portrait of one of the legends of American music.

Natural laws govern the working of the mind, he says. Those who do not understand the laws usually label mental phenomena as supernatural or extrasensory. In fact, few of us have tapped more than a fraction of our mental potential. In this book, he reveals how readers can use their latent mental abilities to enhance the ordinary senses to accomplish effects that resemble telepathy and clairvoyance. Kreskin insists that there is nothing supernatural about any of these effects, and he redefines ESP as extremely sensitive perception to remove all connotation of the other world from this completely natural ability.Kreskin explains how to heighten awareness, increase powers of concentration, discover unknown strengths, tap the power of the unconscious, employ the power of illusion, utilize the power of suggestion, control attitudes and behavior, use silent communication, and predict with educated guesses. He also offers tips on how to hear whispers in a crowded room; predict news stories weeks in advance; read thoughts in the minds of complete strangers; influence others' attitudes and actions; produce hypnotic effects without hypnosis; become a human lie detector; and locate lost objects.

First published in book form in 1873, it is a vivid description of the money market that seamlessly brings together theoretical analyses, historical anecdotes, and incisive commentary on sociology, politics, and the Street's various personalities. Sharing his invaluable insights and unique observations, Bagehot touches on everything from the mechanics of deposit banking within a fractional reserve system to the nature of foreign deposits in Britain. Along with a clear explanation of why economic growth and rising living standards are dependent upon a well-managed financial system, he offers straightforward guidelines for the function of lender-of-last resort; a penetrating look at the consequences of uncontrolled credit and speculation; and an in-depth examination of the exchequer in the money market that includes a stimulating analysis of the interaction between the government's fiscal operations and the functioning of the Bank of England, the commercial banks, and the money market. Perhaps most importantly, Lombard Street features Bagehot's prescription for crisis management, which after nearly 150 years, remains the formula of choice for containing-and curtailing-financial crises. Filled with descriptions of Lombard Street that still ring true today, this jewel of a book has withstood the test of time to become a true investment classic-one that will appeal as much to the readers of today as it did to those of years ago.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e1-wt2WihewC&dq=Lombard+Street+:+A+Description+of+the+Money+Market+(Wiley+Investment+Classic)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Your Baby Spanish [With Teaching Guide]","description":"Teach Your Child Spanish Through Play is a valuable resource for parents, home educators and teachers which includes tips for parents who don't speak the language, creative games and activities that cater to each learning style, a guide to teaching culture, ideas for building and maintaining bilingual communities through playgroups and language clubs as well as a voluminous resource directory.

What happens when three hundred years of human knowledge and expertise disappear before the onslaught of the technology-driven world? The Doryman s Reflection is simply the most accurate and eloquent account of what transpired in the New England fisheries over the past half century, as told by the people who lived it, including author Paul Molyneaux. Fishermen survive as relics, the last hunter-gatherers among us. Their boats, crammed with ropes and nets, carry the mystique of a nearly forgotten world ruled by the elements. Now an accomplished writer, Molyneaux as a young man journeyed to Maine with no experience and a dream of working on a boat. This is the story of his apprenticeship with Bernard Raynes, one of Maine s last independent commercial fishermen. The Doryman s Reflection speaks to those who want to know what really happened, and what will happen, on our oceans. Part coming-of-age memoir, part biography, it is a very personal account of what families in this dying but important industry face each day. Molyneaux shares his own history as a young man seeking the fisherman s life in Maine and Alaska. Originally published in 2005, it has been thoroughly updated to cover the events of the past ten years. Told through the life of the colorful and engaging Bernard Raynes, The Doryman s Reflection is alive and real and powerful far from a dry, pedantic treatise on the economics of commercial fishing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1V-CDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Native Science: Natural Laws of Interdependence","description":"Cajete examines the multiple levels of meaning that inform Native astronomy, cosmology, psychology, agriculture, and the healing arts.

Yet again they unearth a dead body in a looted tomb - not a mummified one though, this one is only too fresh, and it leads the clan on a search for the man who has threatened them with death if they pursue the excavations. If that wasn't distraction enough, Nefret reveals a secret she has kept hidden: there is reason to believe that Sethos, master criminal and spy may be helping the enemy. It's up to the Emersons to find out, and either prove his innocence or prevent him from betraying Britain's plans to take Jerusalem and win the war in the Middle East.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4tDABAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Golden+One&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus","description":"An all-in-one reference providing convenience, value, and the authority of Oxford dictionaries.

A Screaming Eagle at Normandy. Donald R. Burgett is a real Screaming Eagle, who jumped with that famed division at Normandy and survived to tell the tale. His memoir vividly portrays the tragic chaos of war: the blood and sweat, the glory and tears of one of the greatest battles of all time. Currahee! (this was the battle cry and motto of his regiment) begins with jump training and explodes in drama as they are parachuted into Normandy with orders to take and hold the high ground behind the beaches. It contains unforgettable incidents. The author's almost dispassionate tone goes a long way toward explaining a particular set of psychological defenses which enabled these men to do their duty and-for some of them-to survive with their sanity intact. Currahee! is the only book on World War II that General Dwight D. Eisenhower ever endorsed, calling it \\"a fascinating tale of personal combat\\" that \\"portrays the courage, endurance, initiative and fighting qualities of an American soldier on a European battlefield of World War II.\\" Currahee! was originally published to critical acclaim in 1967.

Thayer, University of North Carolina, Wilmington \\"A marvelous and timely overview of the geology of Florida . . . assembled by some of the state's best geoscientists.\\"--Henry T. Mullins, Syracuse University The first comprehensive geology of the state of Florida published in over thirty years, this volume brings together leading geoscience authorities from academia, state and federal geological surveys, and private industry in a liberally illustrated, up-to-date summary and analysis. Early chapters introduce the origin and development of the unique landscape of the Florida peninsula and panhandle. Succeeding chapters cover geomorphology, stratigraphy, plate tectonics, petrology, geochemistry, hydrogeology, vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology, geologic history, economic geology, coastal and marine geology, and environmental geology. With the longest coastline of any state except Alaska and a geology noted for its rich fossil record and abundance of living coral reefs, mineral deposits, springs, and sinkholes, Florida's identity--past, present, and future--is linked intrinsically to its landscape. The definitive reference for that landscape, The Geology of Florida illustrates the importance of basic geological research and its application to issues facing a society that places increasing demands upon its physical world. Anthony F. Randazzo is professor of geology at the University of Florida and author of numerous articles in Sedimentary Geology, Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, American Scientist, and others.

Kienzle's first Father Koesler mystery, published in 1978. Twenty-three more books followed, creating a best-selling mystery series mostly set in Detroit and reflecting the personality of its hero, Father Robert Koesler, a diocesan priest with a penchant for sleuthing. The Rosary Murders was named one of the top twenty-five mysteries of the twentieth century in spring 2000 by the Chicago Sun-Times. It was also made into a movie, with Donald Sutherland in the role of Father Koesler. In The Rosary Murders, Detroit priests and nuns are being methodically murdered; all are found with a plain black rosary entwined between their fingers as a calling card. From Ash Wednesday, when the murderer first struck, the police seem helpless to solve the string of senseless murders. The weeks that follow become a nightmare for the crack homicide team headed by Lieutenant Walter Koznicki, until Father Koesler breaks the madmen's code. Here is a story with tension, excitement, intelligence, and a rare wit and humor. Kienzle painstakingly leads you through every step in an intensive police investigation of heinous series of murders. Police procedure and Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper reporting are as much a part of the action as the crimes themselves.

The basis for this approach lies in the fact that natural selection, as a powerful determining force, tends to decline in importance with age. Many of the characteristics we associate with aging, the author argues, are more the result of this decline than any mechanical imperative contained within organic structures. This theory in turn yields the most fruitful avenues for seeking answers to the problem of aging, and should be recognized as the intellectual core of gerontology and the foundation for future research. The author ably surveys the vast literature on aging, presenting mathematical, experimental, and comparative findings to illustrate and support the central thesis. The result is the first complete synthesis of this vital field. Evolutionary biologists, gerontologists, and all those concerned with the science of aging will find it a stimulating, strongly argued account.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LZ1mY1G-myoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wedding Dress: Stories from the Dakota Plains","description":"These finely wrought stories unfold in the Dakotas during the struggling pioneer days and bone-dry landscape of the thirties as well as the verdant years that followed, where the nighttime plains are bathed by softly radiant harvest moons shining down from dazzling northern skies. Young's absorbing narratives begin with the pleasant sense of  Once upon a time...  anticipation, but the firmly sketched details, warm humor, and vivid characterizations reveal an unanticipated and satisfying realism. The haunting title story is about a beautiful and tragic pioneer woman and her wedding dress; her gown takes on a life of its own and turns into an enduring symbol for the grace and compassion of homesteading women on the plains. In  Bank Night,  a hired hand working during the midst of the Depression wins $250 at the movies, careening him into a single night of notoriety that becomes a legend in its time.  The Nights of Ragna Rundhaug  tells the tale of a woman who wants only to be left alone with her white dog, Vittehund, and her crocheting but instead is propelled into a life of midwifery  because there was no one else to do it.  The babies have predilection for arriving during blizzards and always at night, when she must be transported across the dark plains by frantic husbands who have fortified themselves with strong drink and headstrong horses. All the stories in The Wedding Dress are linked by the enigmatic Nordic characters who people them and by the skill with which Young draws them. Emotions run so deep that they are seldom able to surface; when they do the interaction is extraordinarily luminous, both for the characters themselves and for the fortunate reader. The Wedding Dress is for all readers, young and old.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s2Y5VUyyF_IC&dq=The+Wedding+Dress:+Stories+from+the+Dakota+Plains&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2nd Tactical Air Force, Vol. 1: Spartan to Normandy, June 1943 to June 1944","description":"The Western European and Mediterranean Theaters in World War II is a concise, comprehensive guide for students, teachers, and history buffs of the Second World War.

After the war, radar per se received much publicity, but the Navy's program for selecting and preparing personnel to become electronics specialists - one of the most challenging training activities of all times - has remained almost unknown. Noted scientist/historian Louis Brown made no mention of the program in his highly acclaimed book, A Radar History of World War II. He subsequently commented, \\"It is an omission that I greatly regret, especially because it is the kind of history that I value.\\" This book has been written to finally document the history of this program. It is especially intended for the few remaining men who participated in this activity and their descendants. It should also be of interest to the huge number of persons whose careers have been greatly influenced by aftereffects of the war's electronic miracles, as well as to students and others in broadening their knowledge of electronics evolution. Radar was first demonstrated at the Naval Research Laboratory, and the U.S. fleet had its initial operational system in 1939. It was then directed that radar be incorporated on all major ships. At the time of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, however, only 79 sets had been installed on the Navy's approximately 2,000 vessels. In the then-existing Navy and Marine forces, only a few hundred men were qualified in advanced electronics and essentially none in radar. Further, President Roosevelt had ordered huge increases in ships, aircraft, and submarines; many thousands of highly qualified personnel would be needed to maintain the associated electronics. Thus, there was a crisis in naval electronics, especially radar. The crisis was solved through the Electronics Training Program - an activity of almost unbelievable intensity, cramming the major topics of a standard electrical engineering curriculum into less than a year. The program began in mid-1942 as a combined effort of six engineering colleges and several highly advanced Navy schools. Captain William C. Eddy was largely responsible for its coordination. An admissions examination, commonly called the Eddy Test, was used in selecting the students. Chapters 1 and 2 review the evolution of electronics during the first four decades of the 20th century. Chapter 3 examines the avalanche of radar and the resulting crisis. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 cover in detail the Electronics Training Program -- its origin, curriculum, locations, facilities, and key personnel. Information on the many types of wartime electronic systems is given in Appendix I, and Appendix II summarizes radar developments in other countries. Extensive pictures are included throughout the book. During the war years, about 30,000 men made it through the Navy's electronics training, corresponding roughly to 6 percent of those initially taking the Eddy Test and 35 percent of those admitted to the program. The final appendix of this book gives brief biographies of 33 representative graduates, members of what Tom Brokaw has called \\"the greatest generation.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WzXGPAAACAAJ&dq=Naval+Radar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Phylogeography of the freckled python (Liasis mackloti) of Indonesia's lesser sundas archipelago based on multiple character analyses.

Violently waged from 1910 to 1920, the revolution profoundly transformed Mexican government and culture. And Pancho Villa was its  incarnation and its eagle of a soul  so says Rodolfo Fierro, the novel s narrator, an ex-con, train robber, and Villa s loyal friend. Killers of men and lovers of life, the revolutionaries fought for freedom, for a new Mexico, for Villa. And in return, they shared victory and death with their country s most powerful hero.

Michael A. Ross creates a colorful portrait of a passionate man grappling with the difficult legal issues arising from a time of wrenching social and political change. He also explores the impact President Lincoln's Supreme Court appointments made on American constitutional history. Best known for his opinions in cases dealing with race and the Fourteenth Amendment, particularly the 1873 Slaughter-House Cases, Miller has often been considered a misguided opponent of Reconstruction and racial equality. In this major reinterpretation, Ross argues that historians have failed to study the evolution of Miller's views during the war and explains how Miller, a former slaveholder, became a champion of African Americans' economic and political rights. He was also the staunchest supporter of the Court of Lincoln's controversial war measures, including the decision to suspend such civil liberties as habeas corpus. Although commonly portrayed as an agrarian folk hero, Miller in fact initially foresaw and embraced a future in which frontier and rivertown settlements would bloom into thriving metropolises. The optimistic vision grew from the free-labor ideology Miller brought to the Iowa Republican Party he helped found, one that celebrated ordinatry citizens' right to rise in station an driches. Disillusioned by the eventual failure of the boomtowns and repelled by the swelling coffers of eastern financiers, corporations, and robber barons, Miller became an insistent judicial voice for western Republicans embittered and marginalized in the Gilded Age. The first biography of Miller since 1939, this welcome volume draws on Miller's previously unavailable papers to shed new light on a man who saw his dreams for America shattered but whose essential political and social values, as well as his personal integrity, remained intact.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5v1hAQ0VkEMC&dq=Justice+of+Shattered+Dreams:+Samuel+Freeman+Miller+and+the+Supreme+Court+During+the+Civil+War+Era+(Conflicting+Worlds)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sleepwalk: and Other Stories","description":"\\"Worth reading just for Tomine's eloquent restraint and literary leanings\\"--The Boston Phoenix.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=32FQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Sleepwalk:+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Italia Contemporanea: Conversations with Native Speakers (Yale Language Series)","description":"This exciting, authentic video will enhance any Italian class or laboratory program.

Each of these habits can be developed individually, but their coordination and mutual reinforcement is most desirable. Indeed, habits of hope are the basis for developing hopefulness, a complex habit that nurtures and sustains us even when we fail to realize particular hopes. Hopefulness, Shade maintains, helps us to avoid the paralysis of despair.

His times were interesting and deadly, but that he survived them is not the greatest surprise. Rather, what stands out is that Fred never lost his compassion, nor his humanity, nor his mind. Growing up in 1930s Vienna, the former home of a young, frustrated, and fuming artist named Adolf Hitler, Fred was the stepson of a dedicated Social Democrat. As such, he grew up with a visceral and deep dislike and distrust of their rival parties, including the National Socialists, or ?Nazis.? Although the political situation in Austria throughout the 1930s was stormy, the German annexation of Austria absolutely ended effective opposition to the ?New Order.? Attracted by the superficial benefits of unity with Germany and the evident achievements of the Nazis, young Alfred gradually parted ways with his stepfather. He performed his duty to the Reich when called up for service in the Reich Labor Corps, and later proudly served in the most elite division of the German Army in World War II, Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\" (\\"Greater Germany\\"). From 1942 forward, Fred saw more than his share of combat. Starting with action as a member of a hurriedly-armed labor detachment in the famous British naval and commando raid at St. Nazaire, France, in March 1942, Fred later joined the Grossdeutschland Division in time to participate in some of the most well-knownand most bloody battles of the war on the Eastern Front. During the Germans? last great offensive in the Soviet Union in 1943, Fred fought at Poltava and in the titanic clash of thousands of tanks at Kursk. Wounded there, he later returned to his unit and fought in the long series of fiercely-contested defensive battles that ended only when the Soviets occupied much of eastern and central Germany and Austria. . . and when Hitler and the Thousand Year Reich were finally destroyed. Like so many members of German units, Fred was happy to surrender to the US Army at the end of the war, but under the terms of inter-Allied agreements reached months before, units which had fought only against the Soviets were turned over to the Red Army, en masse. Thus began the ordeal after the ordeal?2? years in Soviet prison camps.After being freed from captivity by the Soviets, Fred eventually escaped the old world and the old conflicts . . . and started a new life in the United States, free of the competing \\"isms\\" of Europe that had wreaked misery on millions.Supported by detailed commentary by author/historian Marc Rikmenspoel, The Good Soldier contains 62 illustrations, including original diagrams and sketches drawn before the war and during the author's captivity; comprehensive documentary authentication of the author's military service; and extensive wartime photography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T12fAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Good+Soldier:+From+Austrian+Social+Democracy+to+Communist+Captivity+with+a+Soldier+of+Panzer-Grenadier+Division+%22Grossdeutschland%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Improve Mgb, Mgc & Mgb V8 (Speedpro)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sustaining Utterance : Discoures on Chasidic Thought","description":"An in-depth look at Elie Wiesel s writings, from his earliest works to his final novels. Elie Wiesel (19282016) was one of the most important literary voices to emerge from the Holocaust. The Nazis took the lives of most of his family, destroyed the community in which he was raised, and subjected him to ghettoization, imprisonment in Auschwitz and Buchenwald, and a death march. It is remarkable not only that Wiesel survived and found a way to write about his experiences, but that he did so with elegance and profundity. His novels grapple with questions of tradition, memory, trauma, madness, atrocity, and faith. The Struggle for Understanding examines Wiesel s literary, religious, and cultural roots and the indelible impact of the Holocaust on his storytelling. Grouped in sections on Hasidic origins, the role of the Other, theology and tradition, and later works, the chapters cover the entire span of Wiesel s career. Books analyzed include the novels Dawn, The Forgotten, The Gates of the Forest, The Town Beyond the Wall, The Testament, The Time of the Uprooted, The Sonderberg Case, and Hostage, as well as his memoir, Night. What emerges is a portrait of Wiesel s work in its full literary richness.

NPR From the woman who gave the landmark testimony against Clarence Thomas as a sexual menace, a new manifesto about the origins and course of gender violence in our society; a combination of memoir, personal accounts, law, and social analysis, and a powerful call to arms from one of our most prominent and poised survivors. In 1991, Anita Hill began something that's still unfinished work. The issues of gender violence, touching on sex, race, age, and power, are as urgent today as they were when she first testified. Believing is a story of America's three decades long reckoning with gender violence, one that offers insights into its roots, and paths to creating dialogue and substantive change. It is a call to action that offers guidance based on what this brave, committed fighter has learned from a lifetime of advocacy and her search for solutions to a problem that is still tearing America apart. We once thought gender-based violence--from casual harassment to rape and murder--was an individual problem that affected a few; we now know it's cultural and endemic, and happens to our acquaintances, colleagues, friends and family members, and it can be physical, emotional and verbal. Women of color experience sexual harassment at higher rates than White women. Street harassment is ubiquitous and can escalate to violence. Transgender and nonbinary people are particularly vulnerable. Anita Hill draws on her years as a teacher, legal scholar, and advocate, and on the experiences of the thousands of individuals who have told her their stories, to trace the pipeline of behavior that follows individuals from place to place: from home to school to work and back home. In measured, clear, blunt terms, she demonstrates the impact it has on every aspect of our lives, including our physical and mental wellbeing, housing stability, political participation, economy and community safety, and how our descriptive language undermines progress toward solutions. And she is uncompromising in her demands that our laws and our leaders must address the issue concretely and immediately.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hlhFEAAAQBAJ&dq=Radcliffe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After the Storm (Percy the Park Keeper)","description":"Celebrate thirty years of the Percy the Park Keeper and his animal friends with this funny story in the classic series from award-winning author and illustrator Nick Butterworth!

Another Life is not just an adventure--the engaging and often hilarious story of a young man making his career--but the insider's story of how a cottage industry metamorphosed into a big business, with sometimes alarming results for all concerned. Korda writes with grace, humor, and a shrewd eye, not only about himself and his rise from a lowly (but not humble) assistant editor reading the \\"slush pile\\" of manuscripts to a famous editor in chief of a major publishing house, but also about the celebrities and writers with whom he worked over four decades. Here are portraits--rare, intimate, always keenly observed--of such larger-than-life figures as Ronald Reagan, affable and good-natured but the most reluctant of authors, struggling with his \\"ghosted\\" presidential autobiography; Richard Nixon, seen here as a genial, if bizarrely detached, host; superagent Irving Lazar, pursuing his endless deals and dreams of \\"class\\"; retired Mafia boss Joseph Bonanno, the last of the old-time dons, laboring over his own version of his life in his desert retreat; Joan Crawford, giving Korda her rules for successful living; and countless other greats, near greats, and would-be greats. Here too are famous writers, sometimes eccentric, sometimes infuriating, sometimes lost souls, captured memorably by someone who was close to them for years: Graham Greene, in pursuit of his FBI file and a Nobel Prize; Tennessee Williams, wrestling unsuccessfully with his demons; Jacqueline Susann, facing and conquering the dreaded \\"second-novel syndrome\\" after the stunning success of Valley of the Dolls; Harold Robbins (who had to be guarded under lock and key and made to finish his novels), struggling to keep the IRS at bay from the deck of his yacht; Carlos Castaneda, at his most sorcerously charming, described--at last--in detail, as he really was, by one of the few people who knew him well; not to mention Richard Adams, Will and Ariel Durant, Susan Howatch, S. J. Perelman, Fannie Hurst, Larry McMurtry, and many, many more. Parts of this book that have appeared in The New Yorker over the years have brought Korda great acclaim--the chapter about Jacqueline Susann has been made into a major motion picture. Here at last, entertaining and provocative and always hugely readable, is the whole story--a book as engaging and full of life as Korda's highly acclaimed memoir of his family, Charmed Lives, about which Irwin Shaw wrote: \\"I don't know when I have enjoyed a book more.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7MJv8YDA58UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nobody Does It Better (Women Who Dare, Book 30) (Harlequin Superromance, No 741)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2XbqqKHY4FIC&dq=Nobody+Does+It+Better+(Women+Who+Dare,+Book+30)+(Harlequin+Superromance,+No+741)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Army Regulars on the Western Frontier","description":"Unlike previous histories, this book argues that the politics of slavery profoundly influenced the western mission of the regular army - affecting the hearts and minds of officers and enlisted men both as the nation plummented toward civil war.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t7wzjM5IHgMC&dq=Army+Regulars+on+the+Western+Frontier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Film Terms","description":"Textbook","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jj7vAjkArz4C&dq=Dictionary+of+Film+Terms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Get to Grips With Competition Judo","description":"To become a winner at competition judo, you must pay attention to diet, weight training, stretching and mobility exercises, and develop a winning attitude.

Henry IV, Part 2 is the only Shakespeare play that is a  sequel,  in the modern sense, to an earlier play of his. Like most sequels, it repeats many elements from the previous work, Henry IV, Part 1. This play again puts on stage Henry IV s son, Prince Hal, who continues to conceal his potential greatness by consorting with tavern dwellers, including the witty Sir John Falstaff. As in Part 1, Prince Hal and Falstaff seek to best each other in conversation, while Falstaff tries to ingratiate himself with Hal and Hal disdains him. Part 2 adds some fresh characters, the rural justices Shallow and Silence and Shallow s household. Political rebellion, while important to the plot, does not loom as large as in Part 1. There are no glorious champions; combat is replaced by deception, cunning, and treachery. This edition includes: -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library s vast holdings of rare books -An annotated guide to further reading Essay by A.

P. Cavafy: Collected Poems","description":"C. P. Cavafy (1863-1933) lived in relative obscurity in Alexandria, and a collected edition of his poems was not published until after his death. Now, however, he is regarded as the most important figure in twentieth-century Greek poetry, and his poems are considered among the most powerful in modern European literature. Here is an extensively revised edition of the acclaimed translations of Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard, which capture Cavafy's mixture of formal and idiomatic use of language and preserve the immediacy of his frank treatment of homosexual themes, his brilliant re-creation of history, and his astute political ironies. The resetting of the entire edition has permitted the translators to review each poem and to make alterations where appropriate. George Savidis has revised the notes according to his latest edition of the Greek text. About the first edition: \\"The best [English version] we are likely to see for some time.\\"--James Merrill, The New York Review of Books \\"[Keeley and Sherrard] have managed the miracle of capturing this elusive, inimitable, unforgettable voice.

In addition to photographing each site, oral history was taken from the area's residents. Sketches record the configuration of sites not previously mapped, and in the case of the largest Baja California mission, Comondu, the foundation was traced and old photographs utilized to computer-generate three-dimensional architectural drawings.

To prove his innocence. Not to the prosecutors, not to the cops. To his brother. But brother Hanford is halfway across the country and between Carson City, Nevada and Huntsville, Texas is a pile of trouble that Hal simply can't seem to avoid. From stealing $20,000 to buy a DVD of a murder, to a low-rent casino in Vegas where a sadistic security guard is killed and a church filled with self-flagellant priests in Valentine, Texas, where a second shoot-out leaves a riot of bodies, Hal simply can't catch a break. And during it all, Hal wavers. He wants to prove to his brother-the good brother-that he isn't a killer. But as situations begin to pile up, Hal thinks less of his brother than his girlfriend and a safe, new life in Mexico. It is a 2000 mile journey that could lead to redemption and could just get him killed, and yet there is no way Hal Turnbull can avoid driving those miles.

Was this \\"parting of the ways\\" spurred by internal tensions within the Christian church, socio-political factors in the Roman city of Antioch, or growing hostility from the larger Jewish community? In Ignatius of Antioch and the Parting of the Ways, Thomas A. Robinson addresses this intriguing historical question by taking a careful look at the writings of one of the few Christian writers who wrote about this parting firsthand--Ignatius, the Bishop of Antioch, who was martyred in the early years of the second century. Through a careful examination of the historical and sociological setting of first-century Antioch, Robinson sifts the testimony of this church father on issues such as the nature of Christian conversion at Antioch, the sources of Jewish-Christian tensions in that city and in the broader Roman world, and the development of the terms \\"Christian\\" and \\"Christianity.\\" Assessing a number of current theories about the nature of the Jewish-Christian parting, Robinson stresses the importance of hearing the voice of Ignatius himself on these questions.

At the same time, the shift from manufacturing to a service-based economy in the area has contributed to a decline in good-paying jobs, significantly impacting working class families. These transformations have created a backlash that has included state propositions impacting Latinas/os and escalating anti-immigrant rhetoric and Latina/os of all backgrounds are making their voices heard. Until recently, most research on Latinas/os in the U.S. has ignored historical and contemporary dynamics in Latin America, just as scholars of Latin America have generally stopped their studies at the border. This volume roots Los Angeles in the larger arena of globalization, exploring the demographic changes that have transformed the Latino presence in LA from primarily Mexican-origin to one that now includes peoples from throughout the hemisphere. Bringing together scholars from a range of disciplines, it combines historical perspectives with analyses of power and inequality to consider how Latinas/os are responding to exclusionary immigration, labor, and schooling practices and actively creating communities. The contributors examine Latina/o Los Angeles in the context of historical, economic and social factors that have shaped the region. The first section provides contexts for understanding Latina/o migration, with chapters focusing on such factors as U.S. economic and military domination, labor and economic integration in the Americas, and Los Angeles  economic history. The second section considers how various Latina/o groups have settled and formed communities and interacted with the existing Mexican-origin populations, showing how Zapotecs, Salvadorans, and other peoples are remaking urban demographics. The final section on labor organizing and political activism examines the role of Latina/o immigrants in such actions as the janitors  strike and also considers the contemporary role of students in political activism. The volume concludes with an up-to-date compilation of contemporary scholarship on immigration, the economy, schools, neighborhoods, gender and activism as they relate to Central American and Mexican immigrants. Reflecting a range of methodologies statistical, historical, ethnographic, and participatory research this collection is relevant not only to ethnic studies but also to broader concerns in political science, sociology, history, economics, and urban studies. In addition, some chapters focus explicitly on women, and gender issues are interwoven throughout the text. Latino Los Angeles is an important work that contributes to contemporary scholarship on transnationalism as it reexamines the changing face of America s largest western metropolis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_kPNtvk09l0C&dq=Latino+Los+Angeles:+Transformations,+Communities,+and+Activism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alternate Tunings Picture Chords","description":"This is by far the most extensive chord encyclopedia for guitar alternate tunings yet published, including 1,340 chords from 56 tunings and covering all styles of guitar music.

These are the stories of the visionaries who helped America complete his vision with the first lunar landing fifty years ago. A Companion Book to the AMERICAN EXPERIENCE? Film on PBS? Going in depth to explore their stories beyond the PBS series, writer/producer Robert Stone called  one of our most important documentary filmmakers  by Entertainment Weekly brings these important figures to brilliant life. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy proposed the nation spend twenty billion dollars to land a man on the Moon before the end of the decade. Based on eyewitness accounts and newly discovered archival material, Chasing the Moon reveals for the first time the unknown stories of the fascinating individuals whose imaginative work across several decades culminated in America s momentous achievement. More than a story of engineers and astronauts, the moon landing now celebrating its fiftieth anniversary grew out of the dreams of science fiction writers, filmmakers, military geniuses, and rule-breaking scientists. They include ? Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, whose writing inspired some of the key players in the Moon race. A scientific paper he wrote in his twenties led to the U.S. beating Russia in one area of space: communications satellites. ? Wernher von Braun, the former Nazi military genius who oversaw Hitler's rocket weapons program. After working on ballistic missiles for the U.S. Army, he was recruited by NASA to manage the creation of the Saturn V moon rocket. ? Astronaut Frank Borman, commander of the first mission to circumnavigate the Moon, whose powerful testimony before Congress in 1967 decisively saved the U.S. lunar program from being cancelled. ? Poppy Northcutt, a young mathematician who was the first woman to work in Mission Control. Her media exposure as a unique presence in this all-male world allowed her the freedom to stand up for equal rights for women and minorities. ? Edward Dwight, an African American astronaut candidate, recruited at the urging of the Kennedy White House to further the administration s civil rights agenda but not everyone welcomed his inclusion. Setting these key players in the political, social, and cultural climate of the time, and including captivating photographs throughout, Chasing the Moon focuses on the science and the history, but most important, the extraordinary individuals behind what was undoubtedly the greatest human achievement of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UKhtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","description":"Since 2002, Mutants & Masterminds has earned its title as the World's Greatest Superhero RPG, inspiring countless game sessions and winning many awards for excellence.

The best story I know of in a long, long time  (Vanity Fair). As a boy, Claude Rawlings looks up through the grated window of his basement apartment to watch the world go by. Poor, lonely, supported by a taxi-driver mother whose eccentricities spin more and more out of control, he faces the terrible task of growing up on the margins of life, destined to be a spectator of that great world always hurrying out of reach. But there is an out-of-tune piano in the small apartment, and in unlocking the secrets of its keys, as if by magic, Claude discovers himself. He is a musical prodigy. Body & Soul is the story of a young man whose life is transformed by a gift. The gift is not without price the work is relentless, the teachers exacting but the reward is a journey that takes him to the drawing rooms of the rich and powerful, private schools, a gilt-edged marriage, and Carnegie Hall. Claude moves through this life as if he were playing a difficult composition, swept up in its drama and tension, surprised by its grace notes. Music, here, becomes a character in its own right, equaled in strength only by the music of Frank Conroy s own unmistakable and true voice. Bristling with character and invention, Body & Soul is Dickensian in its range and richness.

A series of authoritative chapters have been written by the top names in conservation biology with the principal aim of disseminating cutting-edge conservation knowledge as widely as possible. Important topics such as balancing conversion and human needs, climate change, conservation planning, designing and analyzing conservation research, ecosystem services, endangered species management, extinctions, fire, habitat loss, and invasive species are covered. Numerous textboxes describing additional relevant material or case studies are also included. The global biodiversity crisis is now unstoppable; what can be saved in the developing world will require an educated constituency in both the developing and developed world. Habitat loss is particularly acute in developing countries, which is of special concern because it tends to be these locations where the greatest species diversity and richest centres of endemism are to be found. Sadly, developing world conservation scientists have found it difficult to access an authoritative textbook, which is particularly ironic since it is these countries where the potential benefits of knowledge application are greatest. There is now an urgent need to educate the next generation of scientists in developing countries, so that they are in a better position to protect their natural resources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bCiQDwAAQBAJ&dq=Conservation+Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Corvette Restoration and Technical Guide, Vol. 2: 1963 Through 1967","description":"The 1963-1967 Corvette Sting Rays are coved by collectors as the most desirable Corvettes ever.

In Physics of the Future, Michio Kaku the New York Times bestselling author of Physics of the Impossible gives us a stunning, provocative, and exhilarating vision of the coming century based on interviews with over three hundred of the world s top scientists who are already inventing the future in their labs. The result is the most authoritative and scientifically accurate description of the revolutionary developments taking place in medicine, computers, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, energy production, and astronautics. In all likelihood, by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain sensors and, like magicians, move objects around with the power of our minds. Artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout the environment, and Internet-enabled contact lenses will allow us to access the world's information base or conjure up any image we desire in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, cars will drive themselves using GPS, and if room-temperature superconductors are discovered, vehicles will effortlessly fly on a cushion of air, coasting on powerful magnetic fields and ushering in the age of magnetism. Using molecular medicine, scientists will be able to grow almost every organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. Millions of tiny DNA sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will silently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness, while rapid advances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or maybe even reverse the aging process, allowing human life spans to increase dramatically. In space, radically new ships needle-sized vessels using laser propulsion could replace the expensive chemical rockets of today and perhaps visit nearby stars. Advances in nanotechnology may lead to the fabled space elevator, which would propel humans hundreds of miles above the earth s atmosphere at the push of a button. But these astonishing revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. Kaku also discusses emotional robots, antimatter rockets, X-ray vision, and the ability to create new life-forms, and he considers the development of the world economy. He addresses the key questions: Who are the winner and losers of the future? Who will have jobs, and which nations will prosper? All the while, Kaku illuminates the rigorous scientific principles, examining the rate at which certain technologies are likely to mature, how far they can advance, and what their ultimate limitations and hazards are. Synthesizing a vast amount of information to construct an exciting look at the years leading up to 2100, Physics of the Future is a thrilling, wondrous ride through the next 100 years of breathtaking scientific revolution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UaRlfPLLiakC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meaning, Medicine and the 'Placebo Effect' (Cambridge Studies in Medical Anthropology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b4D7vgEACAAJ&dq=Meaning,+Medicine+and+the+%27Placebo+Effect%27+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Medical+Anthropology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 More Library Lifesavers: A Survival Guide for School Library Media Specialists","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wFnhm_k5jucC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Bunny, Biddle Bunny","description":"Curious Biddle bunny hops out of the crowded bunny nest to sniff out new experiences all on her own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5MKmhGrJI9cC&dq=Little+Bunny,+Biddle+Bunny&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ballet For Beginners","description":"Thinking of taking up ballet for the first time as an adult?

We are not accustomed to thinking about a cure. We think of remission as the only possibility. But this book is not about remission. It is about a cure. This is possible because the true cause of cancer has been found. The cause of the malignancy is explained in the earlier book, \\"The Cure For All Cancers\\" (1890035009,  14.50). But removing the malignancy left behind the tumours as they were, prior to the malignant development. So, eliminating tumours became the focus of additional research, and is the subject of this book. The 21 Day Program described in this book does both. Once you win this battle, even advanced cancer can be cured. The success rate for advanced cancer is about 95%. So you can count on this method, not merely hope it will work for you. It is a total approach that not only shrinks tumours, but also normalises your blood chemistry, lowers your cancer markers, and returns your health. The small failure rate (5%) is due to clinical emergencies that beset the advanced cancer sufferer. However, if you combine the advice in this book with access to hospital care, even 'hopeless' patients can gain the time necessary to become well again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W8hkwFaHT-0C&dq=The+Cure+For+All+Advanced+Cancers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Food for better living","description":"Michael Fenster, a cardiologist and professional chef, offers a realistic approach to losing weight, eating a balanced diet, and enjoying good food.

For more than two decades, he has stuck to that credo. In this updated version of curiosity leads him from New Mexico to Romania, from the Congo to the Amazon, asking questions about mosquitoes (what are their redeeming merits?), dinosaurs (how did they change the life of a dyslexic Vietnam vet?), and cloning (can it save endangered species?). This revised and expanded edition best-loved \\"Natural Acts\\" columns, which first appeared in Outside magazine in the early 1980s, and includes recent pieces such as \\"Planet of Weeds,\\" an influential new Natural Acts is an eye-opening journey that will please both Quammen fans and newcomers to his work.

For the rest of that night, she lived a woman's worst nightmare as she was repeatedly raped and beaten by the stranger. The event changed her life into something resembling a Kafka novel: a justice system that bungled the case then blamed the victim, a social service system that provided no services or comfort, uneasy and awkward friends, exploitative media, and insensitive university administrators and colleagues. The pain of those four hours was dwarfed by the frustration of her decade-long fight to find the rapist and bring him to justice, ultimately through one of the first successful uses of DNA evidence in a rape case. Winkler, a brilliant observer and ethnographer, chronicles this struggle here-including her own growing awareness of her power to stare down district attorneys, to use the media to her own ends (including segments on 48 Hours and Court TV), and, ultimately through her persistence, to put the rapist behind bars for life. As a story of triumph over adversity, One Night is an inspirational work. And it provides a model of how researchers can turn the lens inward and incisively examine ourselves and our own world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jvK5ibI53q0C&dq=One+Night:+Realities+of+Rape&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official M.D. Handbook (Plume)","description":"Discusses how to overcome fears, phobias, and panic attacks; improve intimate communication, and cope with anxiety disorders, and includes information about commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dUAQAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Official+M.D.+Handbook+(Plume)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pious Persuasions: Laity and Clergy in Eighteenth-Century New England (Early America: History, Context, Culture)","description":"This sweeping history of popular religion in eighteenth-century New England examines the experiences of ordinary people living through extraordinary times. Drawing on an unprecedented quantity of letters, diaries, and testimonies, Douglas Winiarski recovers the pervasive and vigorous lay piety of the early eighteenth century. George Whitefield's preaching tour of 1740 called into question the fundamental assumptions of this thriving religious culture. Incited by Whitefield and fascinated by miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit--visions, bodily fits, and sudden conversions--countless New Englanders broke ranks with family, neighbors, and ministers who dismissed their religious experiences as delusive enthusiasm. These new converts, the progenitors of today's evangelical movement, bitterly assaulted the Congregational establishment. The 1740s and 1750s were the dark night of the New England soul, as men and women groped toward a restructured religious order. Conflict transformed inclusive parishes into exclusive networks of combative spiritual seekers. Then as now, evangelicalism emboldened ordinary people to question traditional authorities. Their challenge shattered whole communities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6qMwDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The baptism of disciples alone: A covenantal argument for credobaptism versus paedobaptism","description":"A Covenantal argument for believer's baptism versus paedobaptism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=70ZkAAAACAAJ&dq=The+baptism+of+disciples+alone:+A+covenantal+argument+for+credobaptism+versus+paedobaptism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Clue In The Antique Trunk","description":"In a town as pretty as a picture postcard, Nancy seeks the key to a picture-perfect crime!

The authors combine an operational theory of regional security with an empirical application across the whole of the international system. Individual chapters cover Africa, the Balkans, CIS Europe, East Asia, EU Europe, the Middle East, North America, South America, and South Asia. The main focus is on the post-Cold War period, but the history of each regional security complex is traced back to its beginnings. By relating the regional dynamics of security to current debates about the global power structure, the authors unfold a distinctive interpretation of post-Cold War international security, avoiding both the extreme oversimplifications of the unipolar view, and the extreme deterritorialisations of many globalist visions of a new world disorder. Their framework brings out the radical diversity of security dynamics in different parts of the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N3LfkrrNM4QC&dq=Regions+and+Powers:+The+Structure+of+International+Security+(Cambridge+Studies+in+International+Relations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chrome Circle (The Serrated Edge, Bk. 4)","description":"Thinking he has found his mate for life, rock-music playing and fast-driving mage Tannim finds his dreams complicated by her dragon father, her part-human-part-fox personality, and her apparent desire to kill him.

Likewise, chewing coca in the countryside spells  inferior indian,  but in La Paz jazz bars it?s decidedly cool. In the Andes and elsewhere, the commodification of indianness has impacted urban lifestyles as people co-opt indigenous cultures for qualities that emphasize the uniqueness of their national culture. This volume looks at how metropolitan ideas of nation employed by politicians, the media and education are produced, reproduced, and contested by people of the rural Andes?people who have long been regarded as ethnically and racially distinct from more culturally European urban citizens. Yet these peripheral  natives  are shown to be actively engaged with the idea of the nation in their own communities, forcing us to re-think the ways in which indigeneity is defined by its marginality. The contributors examine the ways in which numerous identities?racial, generational, ethnic, regional, national, gender, and sexual?are both mutually informing and contradictory among subaltern Andean people who are more likely now to claim an allegiance to a nation than ever before. Although indians are less often confronted with crude assimilationist policies, they continue to face racism and discrimination as they struggle to assert an identity that is more than a mere refraction of the dominant culture. Yet despite the language of multiculturalism employed even in constitutional reform, any assertion of indian identity is likely to be resisted. By exploring topics as varied as nation-building in the 1930s or the chuqila dance, these authors expose a paradox in the relation between indians and the nation: that the nation can be claimed as a source of power and distinct identity while simultaneously making some types of national imaginings unattainable. Whether dancing together or simply talking to one another, the people described in these essays are shown creating identity through processes that are inherently social and interactive. To sing, to eat, to weave . . . In the performance of these simple acts, bodies move in particular spaces and contexts and do so within certain understandings of gender, race and nation. Through its presentation of this rich variety of ethnographic and historical contexts, Natives Making Nation provides a finely nuanced view of contemporary Andean life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HhaW2WSueT4C&dq=Natives+Making+Nation:+Gender,+Indigeneity,+and+the+State+in+the+Andes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Library of Christmas Music: A Collection of the World's Best Loved Music for the Holiday Season","description":"This book may be used by students in Level 1A or the Complete Level 1 of Alfred's Basic Piano Library or in the first or second book of any method.

In Pete's words, Oceti Wakan is a response to events that have devastated the Dakota people over the past six generations, and is focused on creating a place \\"for the healing of the family as a whole by rekindling Lakota spiritual values and culture.\\" Sacred Fireplace is part of Pete Catches' contribution to making his vision a concrete reality. A healer and teacher, Petaga Yuha Mani (He Walks With Hot Coals) was credited with reviving the traditional Sundance ceremony among the Lakota. In 1964 he was named Sundance chief by the Oglala Sioux tribal council, the only such distinction in tribal history. Pete Catches lived on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota throughout his life, and for decades healed and instructed both Native and non-Natives near his home and off the reservation.

In less than a decade, he went from being a teenage graffiti artist to an international art star; he was dead of a drug overdose at age twenty-seven. Basquiat s brief career spanned the giddy 1980s art boom and epitomized its outrageous excess. A legend in his own lifetime, Basquiat was a fixture of the downtown scene, a wild nexus of music, fashion, art, and drugs. Along the way, the artist got involved with many of the period s most celebrated personalities, from his friendships with Keith Haring and Andy Warhol to his brief romantic fling with Madonna. Nearly thirty years after his death, Basquiat s story and his art continue to resonate and inspire. Posthumously, Basquiat is more successful than ever, with international retrospectives, critical acclaim, and multimillion dollar sales. Widely considered to be a major twentieth-century artist, Basquiat s work has permeated the culture, from hip-hop shout-outs to a plethora of products. A definitive biography of this charismatic figure, Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art is as much a portrait of the era as a portrait of the artist; an incisive expos  of the eighties art market that paints a vivid picture of the rise and fall of the graffiti movement, the East Village art scene, and the art galleries and auction houses that fueled his meteoric career.

Human colonies are thriving on numerous planets, life on Earth is peaceful and prosperous, and as more humans are being born with metapsychic abilities, it will not be long before these gifted minds at last achieve total Unity. But xenophobia is deeply rooted in the human soul. A growing corps of rebels plots to keep the people of Earth forever separate, led by a man obsessed with human superiority: Marc Remillard.

That was before dozens of miraculous images of Jesus Christ were discovered in the most unlikely of places a young teen's soiled maxi pads. Now a throng of revival-seeking zealots has overrun the town, seeking to apotheosize Miriam Baxter, the reluctant prophetess whose unwilling vagina brought forth the phenomenal feminine napkins of God. Unfortunately for poor Miriam, the only woman who may be able to restore order to the universe is a sexually repressed neurotic who worships a cosmic, apocalyptic gopher named Tsemsar. In Eliot Stafford's new book, readers are invited to take an irreverent look at the confusing world of radical American Christianity through the eyes of eccentric heroine Martha James-a thirty-something millionaire with high anxiety and an unhealthy fixation on Muppets. Her quixotic adventures, as chronicled by retired OBGYN/amateur psychiatrist/fledgling novelist Daniel Morrison, will surely entertain, enlighten, inspire, and/or offend and enrage. Audacious and absurd; hilarious, yet heart-warming; inspiring, but mostly idiotic-The Great American Novel is a must read for all believers, wishers, and fairy-tale readers and people who think that certain Christians should be studied in a lab.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wIQXPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Great+American+Novel:+Or,+Random+Start&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treating Patients with Alcohol and Other Drug Problems: An Integrated Approach (Psychologists in Independent Practice Books)","description":"This second edition includes new material on individual psychotherapy and family therapy for clients with alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4kCZkgAACAAJ&dq=Treating+Patients+with+Alcohol+and+Other+Drug+Problems:+An+Integrated+Approach+(Psychologists+in+Independent+Practice+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eyewitness: Russia","description":"Discover the fascinating cities and vast landscapes of the world's largest country - from stunning imperial palaces to remote lakes and soaring mountains - with the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Russia.

There are numerous project management books on how to build technology, but the increase in project failure, limited resources, and accelerated change in systems and platforms has forced IT managers to move from building to buying technology, thereby shifting substantial risks to third parties.

Technology Acquisition covers all facets of technology acquisition management, including the \\"people dynamics\\" that can make or break a project. The book offers useful templates, example documents, checklists, and schedules that guide you through the entire procedure, as well as case studies to illustrate the processes described.

This book assesses Northern Ireland's contribution to the war effort its industrial production, its use as a base and training center for British and American troops, its strategic importance in the Battle of the Atlantic and the contribution of its volunteers to the allied campaigns. Using recently released papers in Dublin, it looks anew at the Blitz, particularly on whether the lights in neutral Eire helped the German bombers in their devasting raids. It recreates much of the atmosphere of what it was like to live for over 5 years under the combined attentions of German bombers, shortages, bureancracy and American soldiers. It examines the sensitive issues of why there was no conscription, the initially lacklustre performance of the Unionist government, de Valera's persistence with neutrality, and the extent of the tensions between locals and GIs stationed here. The long-term significance of the War on inter-community relations, on governmental relations north and south, and between Stormont and Westminster - is assessed. It contends that in many of these areas, and in the establishment of the post-war welfare state, the Second World War was a major turning point in the history of Northern Ireland.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J2VfFIxcUZgC&dq=North+of+Ireland,+2nd&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dewey's Empirical Theory of Knowledge and Reality (Vanderbilt Library of American Philosophy)","description":"The ongoing revival of interest in the work of American philosopher and pragmatist John Dewey has given rise to a burgeoning flow of commentaries, critical editions, and reevaluations of Dewey's writings. While previous studies of Dewey's work have taken either a historical or a topical focus, Shook offers an innovative, organic approach to understanding Dewey and eloquently shows that Dewey's instrumentalism grew seamlessly out of his idealism. He argues that most current scholarship operates under a mistaken impression of Dewey's early philosophical positions and convincingly demonstrates a number of key points: that Dewey's metaphysical empiricism remained more indebted to Kant and Hegel than is commonly supposed; that Dewey owed more to the influence of Wundt than is commonly believed; that the influence of Peirce and James was not as significant for the development of Dewey's theories of mind and truth as has been argued in the past; and that Dewey's pragmatic theory of knowledge never really abandoned idealism. Shook's exposition of the unity of Dewey's thought challenges a large scholarly industry devoted to suppressing or explaining away the consistency between Dewey's early thought and his later work. In every respect, Dewey's Empirical Theory of Knowledge and Reality is a provocative and engaging study that will occupy a unique niche in this field. It is certain to stimulate discussion and controversy, forcing Dewey traditionalists out of habitual modes of thought and transforming our conventional understanding of the development of classical American philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e_CxRsMZ-6oC&dq=Dewey%27s+Empirical+Theory+of+Knowledge+and+Reality+(Vanderbilt+Library+of+American+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strong Women Eat Well : Nutritional Strategies for a Healthy Body and Mind","description":"Dr. Miriam Nelson clears away the misconceptions and myths-often fueled by the proponents of diets that focus on weight loss-and explains how to make the right food decisions.

At that edge, an abyss falls away before us, and we are helpless not to tumble into it unless grace reaches out and saves us. We do not always know how we arrived at such a precarious point; but once there, we know we need healing, meaning, love, peace, hope and happiness. We know that we are seeking something to fulfill us and take away our angst and our sadness. What we do not know, is that we are seeking God. Each true life story in this book reveals a person who has teetered on the edge of grace, in seemingly hopeless situations, and discovered hope and healing in a loving God. The people-an atheist, a stripper, a car thief, a woman who had two abortions, a sex addict, a lonely youth, a woman who told God to go to hell, a woman who hears the voice of God, a priest, a man with the hidden stigmata, and a homosexual man abandoned by his mother-all possess, as diverse as they are, vital elements in common: they have truly found God, and they have received help in their journeys of faith through the Blessed Virgin Mary's presence and messages in Medjugorje. Each story, therefore, begins with a message that Mary has given to the world, a message which speaks to that person's life, and perhaps to our own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZESguqnfdJ8C&dq=On+the+Edge+of+Grace:+Mystical+Stories+of+True+Transformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Lands That Never Were: Tales of Swords and Sorcery from The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hKTQzgEACAAJ&dq=In+Lands+That+Never+Were:+Tales+of+Swords+and+Sorcery+from+The+Magazine+of+Fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strange Business","description":"The strangeness of life and death play out in a fictional American small town Lyla Mae Muncy meets her first love at Falls Creek Baptist Assembly Summer Bible Church Camp and regrets it on their awkward first date.

In posing this question and others, The Elusive Messiah opens a window for looking anew at the age old problem of faith vs. reason.To fully understand the implications of the historical search, Raymond Martin suggests we must first examine the inquiries of the individual scholars. In the book's first section, he provides an insightful overview into the major players who have written on the subject, among them E. P. Sanders, John Meier, Elizabeth Schussler Fiorenza, J. D. Crossan, and Luke Timothy Johnson.In his second section, Martin discusses various Christian responses to the challenges presented by the historians' work. Martin goes on to argue philosophically that faith and reason are able to coexist alongside each other, and then suggests how this may be the key to Christianity's future.Through readily understandable language and examples, Martin poses basic questions, looks for the answers, and explains how these answers correspond to the overall problem. His accessible writing synthesizes complex academic arguments in ways that bring them down to earth, enabling Christians and other readers to understand what is being claimed and to test these claims for meaningfulness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c1JPDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The campaign for Atlanta","description":"A detailed history of one of the most grisly episodes of the Civil War provides a balanced treatment of the North's invasion of Atlanta, debunking many long-standing myths and misconceptions of the battle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l5F2AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+campaign+for+Atlanta&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Your Quality Guru Never Told You","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x15GAAAACAAJ&dq=What+Your+Quality+Guru+Never+Told+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solar Home, The (How-To Guides)","description":"New methods of breaking into corporate networks are resulting in major losses.

This is the first oral (or other) history of the 9th Engineers, the only Marine battalion formed specifically to go to Vietnam. More than 35 men of the 9th talk about why they joined the Marines and their experiences in basic training. They speak candidly and compellingly about their five years (1966 to 1970) in country. The soldiers also discuss what it was like to come home and get on with their lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-RaBCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"She Wins, You Win: The Most Important Strategies for Making Women More Powerful","description":"Builds on the lessons presented in Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman to offer strategies on how women can create their own rules while climbing the corporate ladder, revealing how the achievements of one woman can benefit all women and their organizations.

Changing that became the lifelong obsession of the brilliant, irascible geographer Matthew Fontaine Maury, whose career both aided and mirrored America's rise as a maritime power. With his controversial appointment as the first superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory in 1840, he at last found his life's work. While others built railroads across the trackless interior, Maury mapped the highways of wind and current over the previously trackless sea. In Tracks in the Sea, Chester G. Hearn uses Maury's career as a window on the 19th century, including the brief but glorious clipper-ship era of the 1850s, the rise of steam and steel, the Civil War and the destruction of the U.S. merchant fleet, and the points of intersection with some of the most colorful and influential people of the time, including presidents, congressmen, military leaders, scientists, explorers, merchants, and writers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XasPAQAAIAAJ&dq=Tracks+in+the+Sea:+Matthew+Fontaine+Maury+and+the+Mapping+of+the+Oceans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Exposition of the Whole Bible, Vol. 1","description":"With this final installation in this six-volume set, Dr. Wiersbe has covered the entire Bible!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DUCs8HJTmhEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2nd Tactical Air Force, Vol. 2: Breakout to Bodenplatte, July 1944 to January 1945","description":"The Western European and Mediterranean Theaters in World War II is a concise, comprehensive guide for students, teachers, and history buffs of the Second World War.

Modernism gave them a tool for coping with the mobility of their circumstances, as well as the inspiration for works that questioned the very concepts of the artist and the artwork and opened the realm of art to untrained and self-taught artists, artisans, and women. Writing about the modernist works in newspapers and magazines, critics provided a new vocabulary with which to interpret and assign value to the expanding sets of abstracted forms produced by these artists, whose lives were shaped by mobility. The Mobility of Modernism examines modernist artworks and criticism that circulated among a network of cities, including Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Havana, and Lima. Harper Montgomery maps the dialogues and relationships among critics who published in avant-gardist magazines such as Amauta and Revista de Avance and artists such as Carlos M rida, Xul Solar, and Emilio Pettoruti, among others, who championed esoteric forms of abstraction. She makes a convincing case that, for these artists and critics, modernism became an anticolonial stance which raised issues that are still vital today the tensions between the local and the global, the ability of artists to speak for blighted or unincorporated people, and, above all, how advanced art and its champions can enact a politics of opposition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RjTUDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linguistics: An Introduction to Language and Communication","description":"Linguistics: an introduction to language and communication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gPbQyRdnM18C&dq=Linguistics:+An+Introduction+to+Language+and+Communication&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shallow Graves: Two Women and Vietnam","description":"Two friends, an American woman teaching in Saigon in the early 1970s, and a Vietnamese woman who later comes to America, have composed a satisfying collection of one-page \\"prose-poems,\\" a term that suggests the verses' straightforward narrative.

Some people say they re dying of it; others claim to have killed because of it. It s a key component of depression, creativity, and sex-toy advertisements. It s boredom, the subject of Yawn, a delightful and at times moving take on the oft-derided emotion and how we deal with it. Deftly wrought from interviews, research, and personal experience, Yawn follows Mary Mann s search through history for the truth about boredom, spanning the globe, introducing a varied cast of characters. The Desert Fathers fourth-century Christian monks who made their homes far from civilization offer the first recorded accounts of lethargy; Thomas Cook, grandfather of the tourism industry, provided escape from the mundane for England s working class; and contemporarily, we meet couples who are disenchanted by monogamous sex, deployed soldiers who seek entertainment and connection in porn, and prisoners held in solitary confinement, for whom boredom is a punishment for crimes they may or may not have committed. With sharp wit and impressive historical acumen, Mann tells the unexpected story of the hunt for a deeper understanding of boredom, in all its absurd, irritating, and inspiring splendor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_uhQDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Banker's Insights on International Trade","description":"This book answers questions regarding international trade, letters of credit, methods of payment and other international banking issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WOFxxKaQeecC&dq=A+Banker%27s+Insights+on+International+Trade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stokes Beginner's Guide to Dragonflies","description":"A pocket-size, brilliantly colorful, simple-to-use guide to dragonflies, containing dozens of full-color photographs that enable readers of all ages to identify the most common species; range maps; tips on attracting dragonflies, information on habitat needs, life cycle, food preferences; and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CK6dYgEACAAJ&dq=Stokes+Beginner%27s+Guide+to+Dragonflies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hour of the Horde","description":"Miles Vander is Earth's representative on a super defense force formed to repel an invading horde of space travelers that is destroying life on the planets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3jx3swEACAAJ&dq=Hour+of+the+Horde&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Judgment Day","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"CREOLE GUMBO AND ALL THAT JAZZ: A NEW ORLEANS SEAFOOD COOKBOOK.","description":"A celebration of New Orleans cookery offers three hundred seafood recipes and includes anecdotes and folklore that trace the development of Cajun and Creole cooking","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N6zBAgAAQBAJ&dq=CREOLE+GUMBO+AND+ALL+THAT+JAZZ:+A+NEW+ORLEANS+SEAFOOD+COOKBOOK.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The bag","description":"In Brooklyn, nine-year-old Jax joins Ma, a curmudgeonly witch who lives in his building, on a quest to deliver three baby dragons to a magical world, and along the way discovers his true calling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPOiDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+bag&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Organic Suburbanite : An Environmentally Friendly Way to Live the American Dream","description":"An award-winning garden writer demystifies the world of organics with his trademark wit and extensive horticulture knowledge in this comprehensive guide to protecting the environment while living in the suburbs.

Yours, mine and the truth. In Before I Wake, debut novelist Robert J. Wiersema cleverly introduces a multitude of voices to tell this astonishing story of loss, redemption and forgiveness. And the truth? Well, when miracles start happening around Sherry Barrett, a three-year-old girl in a coma, explanations of a rational kind no longer seem important. Injured by a hit-and-run driver while crossing the street, Sherry Barrett lies in a hospital where her doctors say she will never wake up. Her distraught parents, Karen and Simon, make the painful decision to take her off life support. But when they do, Sherry spontaneously begins breathing on her own, the first of many miraculous events to occur. Henry Denton, the driver who struck Sherry, is haunted by the accident and attempts to take his own life, only to be saved by an unexplained force. Sherry s nurse discovers that the little girl has the power to heal. When word of her gift leaks, the sick begin lining up to be saved and a mysterious stranger sets his sights on vanquishing the believers and the Barretts. Before I Wake delicately brings together grandiose leaps of faith with the fragility of every day moments. There s a fly-on-the-wall quality in Wiersema s observations, as his realistically flawed characters struggle with guilt, self-loathing and belief while they go about their daily lives. The novel s fractured narrative style is propulsive and unexpected at every turn, and succeeds in raising questions about times of great faith, and what happens when they happen to the most unlikely of people.

Smokescreen: What the Marijuana Industry Doesn't Want You to Know examines the inside story behind the headlines, containing accounts from Sabet s time in the Obama administration to stunning revelations from whistleblowers speaking out for the first time. What it finds is how the marijuana industry is running rampant without proper oversight, leaving Americans  health seriously at risk. Included are interviews with industry insiders who reveal the hidden dangers of a product they had once worshipped. Also contained in these pages are insights from a major underground-market dealer who admits that legalization is hastening the growth of the illicit drug trade. And more to the heart of the issue are the tragic stories of those who have suffered and died as a result of marijuana use, and in many cases, as a result of its mischaracterization. Readers will learn how power brokers worked behind the scenes to market marijuana as a miracle plant in order to help it gain widespread acceptance and to set the stage for the lucrative expansion of recreational pot. The author of this compelling first-person narrative leading the national fight against the legalization of cannabis through his nonprofit, Smart Approaches to Marijuana (aka SAM) is Kevin Sabet. As a policy advisor to everyone from county health commissioners to Pope Francis, and a frequent public speaker on television, radio and through other media outlets, his analysis is consistently relied upon by those who recognize what s at stake as marijuana lobbyists downplay the risks of massive commercialization. A book several years in the making, filled with vivid characters and informed by hundreds of interviews and scores of confidential documents, Sabet's Smokescreen lays bare the unvarnished truth about marijuana in America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mDcPEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liberated String Quilts","description":"Contains an illustrated guide to twenty string quilt designs, including traditional and Amish, instructions for short strings, long strings, rectangles, and wedges, and photographs of antique string quilts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UFNlm_rVGCUC&dq=Liberated+String+Quilts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Care and Breeding of the African Spurred Tortoise Geochelone Sulcata","description":"This practical handbook covers the keeping and breeding of the large African spurred tortoise.

As they move from darkness to light, from rage to self-governance, from primitive ritual to civilized institution, their spirit of struggle and regeneration becomes an everlasting song of celebration. In Agamemnon, a king's decision to sacrifice his daughter and turn the tide of war inflicts lasting damage on his family, culminating in a terrible act of retribution; The Libation Bearers deals with the aftermath of Clytemnestra's regicide, as her son Orestes sets out to avenge his father's death; and in The Eumenides, Orestes is tormented by supernatural powers that can never be appeased. Forming an elegant and subtle discourse on the emergence of Athenian democracy out of a period of chaos and destruction, The Oresteia is a compelling tragedy of the tensions between our obligations to our families and the laws that bind us together as a society. The only trilogy in Greek drama that survives from antiquity, Aeschylus' The Oresteia is translated by Robert Fagles with an introduction, notes and glossary written in collaboration with W.B. Stanford in Penguin Classics. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

That s exactly what I meant!  Mitchard s clear-eyed takes on everyday life in process are described over and over as  a letter from home,  as  the best friend I can really count on,  as  the kind of story you tell at the coffee machine and keep under your pillow.  Jacquelyn Mitchard reaches for heart and mind simultaneously, with both wit and nostalgia but never with sentimentality. Whether writing of gun laws and garage sales, the loneliness of the long-haul single mother, fear of gardening, or the late great American game of baseball, Mitchard stresses the personal stake each of us has in the stand-up drama of daily life. The single mother of five children, she shares her own family s dramas and epiphanies her own mother s tradition of optimism based on nothing, the early death of her husband, the adoption of her baby daughter, as well as the great wheeling issues that confound Americans every day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VT7K07gP9nMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Legend","description":"The famous military leader, Commander Cain, suddenly appears to lead the Galactica in the battle against the Cylon forces, but doubts about his capabilities and sanity begin to grow","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4CTVAAAACAAJ&dq=Living+Legend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Minerva and William Green Hill,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XxIYAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Codex Seraphinianus (Spanish Edition)","description":"An extraordinary and surreal art book, this edition has been redesigned by the author and includes new illustrations.

It was a new type of air warfare: the first ever offensive counter-air campaign against an integrated air defence system.

This book is an original, rigorous campaign study of the Luftwaffe's Operation Adlerangriff, researched in Germany's World War II archives and using the most accurate data available. Doug Dildy explains the capabilities of both sides, sets the campaign in context, and argues persuasively that it was the Luftwaffe's own mistakes and failures that led to its defeat, and kept alive the Allies' chance to ultimately defeat Nazi Germany.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o31GDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","description":"The  gripping, romantic, and dazzlingly original  (Cosmopolitan) Arkady Renko book that started it all: the #1 bestseller Gorky Park, an espionage classic that begins the series, by Martin Cruz Smith,  the master of the international thriller  (The New York Times).

In Female Masculinity Judith Halberstam takes aim at the protected status of male masculinity and shows that female masculinity has offered a distinct alternative to it for well over two hundred years. Providing the first full-length study on this subject, Halberstam catalogs the diversity of gender expressions among masculine women from nineteenth-century pre-lesbian practices to contemporary drag king performances. Through detailed textual readings as well as empirical research, Halberstam uncovers a hidden history of female masculinities while arguing for a more nuanced understanding of gender categories that would incorporate rather than pathologize them. She rereads Anne Lister's diaries and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness as foundational assertions of female masculine identity. She considers the enigma of the stone butch and the politics surrounding butch/femme roles within lesbian communities. She also explores issues of transsexuality among \\"transgender dykes\\"--lesbians who pass as men--and female-to-male transsexuals who may find the label of \\"lesbian\\" a temporary refuge. Halberstam also tackles such topics as women and boxing, butches in Hollywood and independent cinema, and the phenomenon of male impersonators. Female Masculinity signals a new understanding of masculine behaviors and identities, and a new direction in interdisciplinary queer scholarship. Illustrated with nearly forty photographs, including portraits, film stills, and drag king performance shots, this book provides an extensive record of the wide range of female masculinities. And as Halberstam clearly demonstrates, female masculinity is not some bad imitation of virility, but a lively and dramatic staging of hybrid and minority genders.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UYAi9OEYRekC&dq=Female+Masculinity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rapid Descent: Deregulation and the Shakeout in the Airlines","description":"Traces the history of airline deregulation, examining the complicated strategems, colorful personalites, and unfortunate decisions involved","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fk8PAQAAMAAJ&dq=Rapid+Descent:+Deregulation+and+the+Shakeout+in+the+Airlines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ETRUSCAN ROMAN REMAINS","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eGh884SrW3kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spacestation Ark: The year 2010, a new nation, a new society","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M98NPAAACAAJ&dq=Spacestation+Ark:+The+year+2010,+a+new+nation,+a+new+society&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"VANGUARD OF NAZISM: The Free Corps Movement in Postwar Germany 1918-1923","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iAMnjwEACAAJ&dq=VANGUARD+OF+NAZISM:+The+Free+Corps+Movement+in+Postwar+Germany+1918-1923&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Filming of the Douglas Adams Classic","description":"Boxtree is delighted to announce the acquisition of The Making of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

The United States boasts a culturally and ethnically diverse population which makes for a continually changing culinary landscape. But a young historical gastronomist named Sarah Lohman discovered that American food is united by eight flavors: black pepper, vanilla, curry powder, chili powder, soy sauce, garlic, MSG, and Sriracha. In Eight Flavors, Lohman sets out to explore how these influential ingredients made their way to the American table. She begins in the archives, searching through economic, scientific, political, religious, and culinary records. She pores over cookbooks and manuscripts, dating back to the eighteenth century, through modern standards like How to Cook Everything by Mark Bittman. Lohman discovers when each of these eight flavors first appear in American kitchens then she asks why. Eight Flavors introduces the explorers, merchants, botanists, farmers, writers, and chefs whose choices came to define the American palate. Lohman takes you on a journey through the past to tell us something about our present, and our future. We meet John Crowninshield a New England merchant who traveled to Sumatra in the 1790s in search of black pepper. And Edmond Albius, a twelve-year-old slave who lived on an island off the coast of Madagascar, who discovered the technique still used to pollinate vanilla orchids today. Weaving together original research, historical recipes, gorgeous illustrations and Lohman s own adventures both in the kitchen and in the field, Eight Flavors is a delicious treat ready to be devoured.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=adWcDQAAQBAJ&dq=Flavors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ocean Basins: Their Structure and Evolution, Second Edition (Oceanography)","description":"This is an invaluable textbook, prepared by the Open University team and designed so that it can be read on its own or as part of the OU course.

It concerned a very optimistic young boy who happened upon a huge pile of horse manure and began digging excitedly. When someone asked him what he was doing covered in muck, the foolish boy answered brightly,  There must be a pony in here somewhere!    From the Prologue If you re wondering what happened after  a company without assets acquired a company without a clue,  as Kara Swisher wryly writes, it s time to crack open this trenchant book about the doomed merger of America Online and Time Warner. On a quest to discover how the deal of the century became the messiest merger in history, Swisher delivers a rollicking narrative and a keen analysis of this debacle that is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand what it all means for the digital future. Packed with new revelations and on-the-record interviews with key players, it is the first detailed examination of the merger s aftermath and also looks forward to what is coming next. It certainly has not been a pretty picture so far with $100 billion in losses, a sinking stock price, employees in revolt, and lawsuits galore. As Swisher writes,  It is hard not to feel a bit queasy about the whole sorry mess. . . . It felt a bit like I was watching someone fall down a flight of stairs in slow motion, and every bump and thump made me wince. It made me reassess old ideas and wonder what I had gotten wrong. And it left me deeply confused as to what had happened and, more important, what was coming next.  For Swisher, finding the answers to what went awry is important because she remains a staunch believer in the digital future maybe not in the AOL Time Warner merger, but in the essential idea at the heart of it that someday the distinction of old and new media will no longer exist. Borrowing from Winston Churchill, Swisher calls it  the end of the beginning  of the digital revolution.  By that, I mean that it is from the ashes of this bust that the really important companies of the next era will emerge. And that evolution will, I believe, be shaped by what happened and what is happening now at AOL Time Warner.  To figure it all out, Swisher takes her reader on a journey that begins with a portrait of two wildly different corporate cultures and businesses that somehow came to believe, in the crucible of the red-hot Internet era, that they could successfully join forces and achieve unprecedented growth and success. When the merger was announced in early 2000, the irresistible combination was hailed as the new paradigm and its executives Steve Case, Jerry Levin, Bob Pittman as popular icons of the future. But after the boom so spectacularly turned to bust and the visions of New Media Supremacy lay in ruins, Swisher searches for clues about where the merger went wrong and who is to blame. More important, she looks to the future of both AOL Time Warner and the Internet as she seeks to answer the key question that the noise of the disaster has all but drowned out. Will the demise of the AOL Time Warner merger be the final and inevitable chapter of the dot-com debacle or will it herald a new paradigm altogether? This book, then, is a primer for the time to come, using the story of the AOL Time Warner merger as the vehicle to show the troubled journey into the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VKV2CaCX0PYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","description":"A harrowing memoir of loss and the struggle to connect, Brown's story is told with a spare poetic elegance.

Focusing on the parish of St. Sabina's in the southwest Chicago neighborhood of Auburn-Gresham, Eileen McMahon takes a penetrating look at the response of Catholic ethnics to life in twentieth-century America. She reveals the role the parish church played in achieving a cohesive and vital ethnic neighborhood and shows how ethno-religious distinctions gave way to racial differences as a central point of identity and conflict. For most of this century the parish served as an important mechanism for helping Irish Catholics cope with a dominant Protestant-American culture. Anti-Catholicism in the society at large contributed to dependency on parishes and to a desire for separateness from the American mainstream. As much as Catholics may have wanted to insulate themselves in their parish communities, however, Chicago demographics and the fluid nature of the larger society made this ultimately impossible. Despite efforts at integration attempted by St. Sabina's liberal clergy, white parishioners viewed black migration into their neighborhood as a threat to their way of life and resisted it even as they relocated to the suburbs. The transition from white to black neighborhoods and parishes is a major theme of twentieth-century urban history. The experience of St. Sabina's, which changed from a predominantly Irish parish to a vibrant African-American Catholic community, provides insights into this social trend and suggests how the interplay between faith and ethnicity contributes to a resistance to change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t-MzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Working with Your Three Selves","description":"Huna philosophy is about learning to become a conscious cocreator with the Universe.

These volatile storehouses played a vital role in earning and preserving American independence.

The British were thwarted, and the colonists' defense of the powder house ignited the Revolutionary War.

Born to a wealthy plantation owner, Thomas was the third of nine children. When he was just fourteen, his father died, leaving him half his land, slaves, and wealth. These circumstances allowed Thomas to attend college at the age of sixteen, and later on, to study under one of the top lawyers of the time. His political history is one of great triumph and struggle. Jefferson first practiced law and served in the government as a member of the House of Burgesses, later serving as a member of the Continental Congress, where he wrote the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson left Congress in 1776 and returned to Virginia to serve in the legislature, and then as Governor of Virginia for two years. He took a brief sabbatical until 1784, when he replaced Benjamin Franklin as minister to France. In 1790, Jefferson became Secretary of State under George Washington and later served as Vice President to John Adams. Jefferson won the presidency in a heated election in 1800. His first term resulted in some notable achievements, including the purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, and then his support of the Lewis and Clark expedition. In his second term, he faced difficulties in the domestic and foreign fronts and was most remembered for his effort to remain neutral in the midst of the conflict between France and Britain. In 1809, President Jefferson was succeeded by James Madison. While he lived out his final seventeen years at his Virginia plantation, Monticello, Jefferson sold his collection of books to the government. Not only did he lay the foundation for the Library of Congress, but he was also the founder of the University of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson passed away on July 4, 1826, just hours before his friend John Adams died on the same date. It was the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and Jefferson was eighty-three years old.

Such a test is not as sensitive as the organ test, described next, but for this reason allows you to select those entities most abundant in the body and therefore of special significance; in the second, you can identify which organs contain a particular entity. For example, the mercury may be in the kidney, the Streptococcus in the joints, and so on. This allows you to embark on a cleanup program for your body in a focused way.

He left us to go into service in 1941 and he was called up from inactive status on his reserve commission.  From the time he left us until he came back this year, Bert went through a lot that many other men did not survive. He was taken prisoner of the Japs on Bataan, survived the Bataan March of Death and 33 months internment in a Jap prison camp. Now he s a patient at Valley Forge General Hospital where Army doctors are attempting to restore his sight to normal. The long, gruelling months on a meager diet took its toll.  But Bert doesn t complain.  There are a lot of other fellows less fortunate than I,  he will tell you.  Many friends have asked him to tell of his experiences. During the course of bond tours and other public appearances in the Army s behalf, Bert has recounted these experiences. And so he thought he would write them down for these friends.

Next Saturday, in fact. So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, the Four Bikers of the Apocalypse are revving up their mighty hogs and hitting the road, and the world's last two remaining witch-finders are getting ready to fight the good fight, armed with awkwardly antiquated instructions and stick pins. Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. . . . Right. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan.

On December 16, bitter weather and brutal warfare tragically met in Southeastern Belgium s rolling hills of the Ardennes where the 106th Division had arrived only five days earlier. The well-trained, but inexperienced, soldiers were soon overwhelmed by Hitler s tanks and troops surging into Belgium. Hell Frozen Over describes the personal experiences of sixteen men most of them in the 81st Engineers who were caught in Hitler s final grasp to strangle the continent. More than half of these men were among the 7,001 in the Division who were taken as prisoners of war. Scattered in camps throughout Germany, they willed themselves to survive as deprivation and even slave labor threatened their lives and sanity. Their comrades-in-arms who escaped capture and remained to fight in foxholes and tanks had other hells to endure, as did the civilians of every town in the area. That winter war permanently stamped its cold, dark memories on the souls of America s young men who found themselves in the Battle of the Bulge. Their stories, many of them told after many decades of silence, will inspire Americans to realize that the human spirit can survive even the worst circumstances. The torturous experiences of that dedicated generation will remind both present and future generations that freedom from tyranny has come at a horrible price.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iPzEcdtR70UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Book of King Arthur and his Noble Knights","description":"This text is a collection of Steinbeck's rendition of stories heroic, romantic and tragic from Malory's Morte D'Arthur which chronicle the life of Arthur, from his mysterious birth through battles and adventures to his establishment as king.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7Q-AHOl5xbMC&dq=Book+of+King+Arthur+and+his+Noble+Knights&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Honeycomb, An Autobiography by the Author of Final Verdict and Tell No Man","description":"Although the 1932 kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh s baby was a worldwide sensation, it was only one of an estimated three thousand ransom kidnappings that occurred in the United States that year. The epidemic hit America during the Great Depression and the last days of Prohibition as criminal gangs turned kidnapping into the highly lucrative  snatch racket.  Wealthy families and celebrities purchased kidnap insurance, hired armed chauffeurs and bodyguards, and carried loaded handguns. Some sent their children to school or summer camp in Europe to get them out of harm s way.  Recent Kidnappings in America  was a regular feature in the New York Times, while Time magazine included kidnappings in its weekly list of notable births, deaths, and other milestones. The Snatch Racket is the story of a crime epidemic that so frightened families that it undermined confidence in law enforcement and government in general. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt waged a three-year War against Kidnappers with J. Edgar Hoover and his G-men (newly empowered to carry weapons and make arrests) on the front lines. This first U.S. war against terrorism revolutionized and modernized law enforcement in the United States, dramatically expanding the powers of the federal government in the fight against not only kidnapping but many new types of interstate crime. At the heart of the narrative are some of the most iconic names of the twentieth century: Rockefeller, Ford, Lindbergh, Roosevelt, Hoover, Capone, Schwarzkopf, and Hearst, all caught up in the kidnapping frenzy. The Snatch Racket is a spellbinding account of terrifying abductions of prominent citizens, gangsters invading homes with machine guns, the struggles of law enforcement, and the courage of families doing whatever it took to bring home the ransomed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pAcWEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cornerstones of Freedom the Story of the declaration of Independence","description":"When the Declaration of Independence was read aloud, the crowds cheered and set off gunpowder explosions.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","description":"The lack of personal accountability is a problem that has resulted in an epidemic of blame, victim thinking, complaining, and procrastination. No organization or individual can successfully compete in the marketplace, achieve goals and objectives, provide outstanding service, engage in exceptional teamwork, or develop people without personal accountability. John G. Miller believes that the troubles that plague organizations cannot be solved by pointing fingers and blaming others. Rather, the real solutions are found when each of us recognizes the power of personal accountability. In QBQ! The Question Behind the Question?, Miller explains how negative, ill-focused questions like  Why do we have to go through all this change?  and  Who dropped the ball?  represent a lack of personal accountability. Conversely, when we ask better questions QBQs such as  What can I do to contribute?  or  How can I help solve the problem?  our lives and our organizations are transformed. THE QBQ! PROMISE This remarkable and timely book provides a practical method for putting personal accountability into daily actions, with astonishing results: problems are solved, internal barriers come down, service improves, teams thrive, and people adapt to change more quickly.

In a riveting narrative of daredevils and eccentrics, Fergus Fleming gives us the breathtaking story of some of history s greatest explorers as they conquer the soaring peaks of the Alps. Fleming recounts the incredible exploits of the men whose centuries-old fear of the mountain range turned quickly to curiosity, then to obsession, as they explored Europe s frozen wilderness. In the late eighteenth century, French and Swiss scientists became interested in the Alps as a research destination, but in the 1850s the focus changed: the icy mountains now offered an all-out competition for British climbers who wanted to conquer ever higher and more impossible heights, and explorers fought each other on the peaks and in the press, entertaining a vast public smitten with their bravery, delighted by their personal animosities, and horrified by the disasters that befell them.  Fleming attacks his theme with verve, mining entertainment from eccentric Alpinists, sensational ascents and grisly accidents.

One Corpsman's Journey Back to Vietnam. Revised","description":"New York Times Bestseller: A  powerful and epic story . . . the best account of infantry combat I have ever read  (Col. David Hackworth, author of About Face). In November 1965, some 450 men of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, were dropped into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was brutally slaughtered. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. They were the first major engagements between the US Army and the People s Army of Vietnam. How these Americans persevered sacrificing themselves for their comrades and never giving up creates a vivid portrait of war at its most devastating and inspiring. Lt. Gen. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting interviewed hundreds of men who fought in the battle, including the North Vietnamese commanders. Their poignant account rises above the ordeal it chronicles to depict men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have once found unimaginable.

Century after century, they tried to understand the causes of epidemics, the vulnerability of American Indians, and the persistence of health disparities. They confronted their own responsibility for the epidemics, accepted the obligation to intervene, and imposed social and medical reforms to improve conditions. In Rationalizing Epidemics, David Jones examines crucial episodes in this history: Puritan responses to Indian depopulation in the seventeenth century; attempts to spread or prevent smallpox on the Western frontier in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; tuberculosis campaigns on the Sioux reservations from 1870 until 1910; and programs to test new antibiotics and implement modern medicine on the Navajo reservation in the 1950s. These encounters were always complex. Colonists, traders, physicians, and bureaucrats often saw epidemics as markers of social injustice and worked to improve Indians' health. At the same time, they exploited epidemics to obtain land, fur, and research subjects, and used health disparities as grounds for \\"civilizing\\" American Indians. Revealing the economic and political patterns that link these cases, Jones provides insight into the dilemmas of modern health policy in which desire and action stand alongside indifference and inaction. Table of Contents: List of Figures Acknowledgments Introduction 1. Expecting Providence 2. Meanings of Depopulation 3. Frontiers of Smallpox 4. Using Smallpox 5. Race to Extinction 6. Impossible Responsibilities 7. Pursuit of Efficacy 8. Experiments at Many Farms Epilogue and Conclusions Notes Index Rationalizing Epidemics is a superb work of scholarship. By contextualizing his deep and thorough research in original documents within the larger literature on the history and nature of epidemics, Jones has produced a profound account of how epidemics are social and cultural phenomena, not just biological. This book will be of great interest to scholars of American Indian history and the history of medicine, and with its engaging and accessible writing style, it promises to be a book that students and the general public will appreciate as well. --Nancy Shoemaker, University of Connecticut An imaginative and insightful approach to health and disease among American Indians, Rationalizing Epidemics represents a remarkable accomplishment. The breadth of reading and depth of research, the subtlety used in explaining each case, and the original approach to the material are altogether impressive. Jones's book undoubtedly will be a major contribution to American history. --Daniel H.

As a spirit of nationalism inspired by Chiang Kai-shek s leadership begins to sweep through China, the river gunship San Pablo is ordered to patrol the region and to protect US citizens. Jack Holman is a machinist aboard the San Pablo, who has joined the navy in order to avoid jail time. Because he is so fiercely independent, Jake remains a relative loner and is uncomfortable with navy protocol and discipline. McKenna s independent mind chafes against military hierarchy and also ensures that he does not share his shipmates  disdain for the Chinese. Instead, McKenna is fascinated with the culture and the people that surround him and develops emotional bonds that prove quite thorny when the circumstances become more tumultuous and more dire. The perspective of The Sand Pebbles is therefore both panoramic as well as personal. Like Lawrence of Arabia, the tension explored here is between the self as individual against the broader spectrum of social and historical forces against which we are all measured.  A bold well-written book, inclusive in its concepts, memorable in character and incident, fearlessly impartial in its delineation of the incompatible sets of values held by the men on all sides.

To what extent are decisions of Jewish law influenced by subjective factors? Does rabbinic authority extend to all areas of life or does it confine itself to a narrower field of influence? What freedom does a rabbinic authority have to make innovations, and are there grounds for pluralism within the system of Jewish law? These questions cut to the core of Jewish life in the modern world. With the advent of modernity, great emphasis has been placed on the value of personal autonomy. Yet traditional Judaism has historically emphasized the authority of the rabbinic decision maker. The essays in this volume are concerned with exploring the tension between these two poles. Experts from such diverse fields as history, sociology, philosophy, and Jewish law explore the questions raised above. Their analyses are informed not only by their academic expertise but by their deep understanding of the Jewish legal system and Jewish life and their abiding concern for what it means to live that life in the modern world. The contributors to this volume were participants in the Orthodox Forum, an annual gathering of scholars who meet to consider major issues of concern to the Jewish community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QFvGtAEACAAJ&dq=Rabbinic+Authority+and+Personal+Autonomy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Open Your Ears to Love","description":"Ms. Clemens shows that we can connect with the world around us in a way that contributes to the healing of ourselves and our planet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XX3FgutfzisC&dq=Open+Your+Ears+to+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Swimming Pool","description":"An illicit affair, an unsolved murder, an intense summer romance in Cape Cod - introducing Holly LeCraw's explosive and stunningly-written debut.

Her powers of description make the story leap from the page and the reader is transported to far off places and times; and the people and the things she describes can almost be touched, smelled and seen.Patricia was not just a gifted story-teller, though; she was also a deeply committed follower of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose spiritual journey began when she was only six years old. 'My name is Patricia, ' she prayed, 'and if You are really calling me I want to come and be Yours. ' Out of that small beginning there issued a river of life and light and blessing that went on increasing right up to the end of her life. Although she always thought of herself as 'an ordinary sort of girl', her life was extraordinary because of her supreme love for Jesus Christ.The life portrayed here is not that of the self-conscious saint, concerned only with her own saintliness. On the contrary these pages offer us an inside view of someone utterly human, prone to mistakes and failures like the rest of us, yet suffused with the love of God and a contagious joy and peace that was like the bubbling up of a perpetual fountain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YvSzV4rRUy8C&dq=Patricia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nine O'Clock in the Morning","description":"Experiences of an Episcopal minister in the charismatic movement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RiqRFdcJULQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red Hat Linux Bible Bundle","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FfyBnQEACAAJ&dq=Red+Hat+Linux+Bible+Bundle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stephen Crane: A study in American letters","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k1A7AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Microsoft&reg; Crabby Office Lady Tells It Like It Is: Secrets to Surviving Office Life","description":"Imagine if you could see the playbook that returned a struggling tech empire to the top of the tech leaderboard.

But, now, Microsoft is back on top. The company s value is soaring and once again Microsoft is being recognized as a tech leader once again. What changed?

Revelation and Rebellion in the Old Testament and the Christian World","description":"Winner of the Best Anthology Award from John Whitmer Historical Association Latter-day Saints have a paradoxical relationship to the past; even as they invest their own history with sacred meaning, celebrating the restoration of ancient truths and the fulfillment of biblical prophecies, they repudiate the eighteen centuries of Christianity that preceded the founding of their church as apostate distortions of the truth. Since the early days of Mormonism, Latter-day Saints have used the paradigm of apostasy and restoration in their narratives about the origin of their church. This has generated a powerful and enduring binary of categorization that has profoundly impacted Mormon self-perception and relations with others. Standing Apart explores how the idea of apostasy has functioned as a category to mark, define, and set apart \\"the other\\" in Mormon historical consciousness and in the construction of Mormon narrative identity. The volume's fifteen contributors trace the development of LDS narratives of apostasy within the context of both Mormon history and American Protestant historiography. They suggest ways in which these narratives might be reformulated to engage with the past, as well as offering new models for interfaith relations. This volume provides a novel approach for understanding and resolving some of the challenges faced by the LDS church in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7WiVAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Good Stick","description":"Forced by federal regulations to retire at age 60, Jerry Sorlucco had served as an airline captain for nearly forty years and was probably the senior pilot on the planet. During that long career, he flew everything from DC3s to Boeing 767s. His memoir documents that experience professionally, personally and to some extent technically. Anyone with any curiosity about the life, work, gear and training of an airline pilot will find something engaging in this book. The story begins with an Italian kid from Brooklyn''s early love of flying and ends with his final flight from Frankfurt in 1997. Photographs of the aircraft Sorlucco flew, crewmembers, and his friends and family enhance the lively narrative. Given the sorry state of the airline industry, this story is especially timely. Sorlucco discusses some of the reasons for the industry''s collapse and offers some possible solutions. In fact, the entire narrative is framed in its historical context, so the reader will be constantly reminded of the wider world surrounding a personal journey. A Good Stick is a must read for the thousands of fellow pilots who shared an era with Jerry Sorlucco, for young pilots trying to keep afloat in a sea of airline red ink, and for anyone wondering what on Earth happened to America''s airline industry. For the aficionado, the historical and technical data in the narrative is not merely anecdotal; it is thoroughly researched and accurate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wXsnFjXe14YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walt Disney Fun to Read Library 19 Volume Set (19 Volume Set)","description":"Mickey Mouse saves a town from a giant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2qs7ZIPCg2QC&dq=Walt+Disney+Fun+to+Read+Library+19+Volume+Set+(19+Volume+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art principles in house, furniture, and village building;: An exposition of designing principles which every house builder, furniture user, and village dweller should know,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=grNLAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The casting away of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U6UeAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blackwell Companion to Social Work","description":"The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Social Work provides a concise guide to 400 topics relevant to the practice of social work in the 21st Century.

For the world's most formidable detective it is a tantalizing puzzle involving an unlikely combination of philanthropy, deception, blackmail, and an unrepentant killer who just may have committed the perfect crime.

He had learned his father's patriotism, and then, through the impact of firsthand experience, formulated his own. Melvin Isaacs, aged seventeen, became a Navy Air Force cadet in 1942. His course of training as a flyer was an education in fear and death, even though it had its wonderfully comic times and a sense of comradeship that was new to him. Perhaps it was in the air for Melvin loved to fly that the first feelings of aloneness stirred his mind. Melvin, who queried the whys and wherefores of his regimented training life, became, despite all efforts to conform, a maverick. This portion of the novel is a touching and true mixture of human comedy and tragedy, and it also embodies scenes of flight and danger that are unmatched for pure vividness and sensate realism. The story of Melvin after the war is a continuation of the absurdities that can pursue a man so constituted that he must think for himself. And here the implications of the novel become clear. It is partly the ageold story of a father and son in conflict, of an older generation's notions that are insupportable to the younger, a human dilemma that has no possible resolution. It is also the story of Melvin's final rejection of war, of his unshakeable conviction that a man today must think and act for the good of the planet, Stephen Decatur's slogan notwithstanding. With too many excellences to catalogue and extol, the novel has a total effect of a new voice telling a new story of this old familiar world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i5b3wAEACAAJ&dq=The+patriot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angus and the Hidden Fort","description":"The chase was on!

The Old Testament Speaks offers a clear picture of the archaeological, geographical, historical, and linguistic dimensions of God's covenant with his people from the time of Abraham to the coming of the Messiah. The Old Testament Speaks examines the historical and religious life of the Hebrews, integrates the development of non-hebraic cultures with conventional biblical history, and reviews the best modern scholarly research in placing the Scriptures in their Near Eastern setting. Samuel J. Schultz emphasizes the importance of letting the Scriptures tell their own stories. He makes selective use of the best and latest literature in Old Testament studies, and offers a balanced perspective. Schultz sifts the facts and follows them to their inevitable conclusions. However, when the evidence is not definitive, he exercises caution, presenting his own interpretation as only one of several possible views. Schultz also appraises the impact of recent archaeological and historical findings on the understanding of key portions of the Old Testament. The Old Testament Speaks contains all the relevant material -- biblical and nonbiblical -- necessary for classroom use or personal study of the Old Testament. Schultz provides outlines that reflect the historical background and summarize the contents of each biblical book, as well as charts and maps to help visualize the biblical narrative. He has also revised and updated the biblio-graphies at the end of each chapter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=otchaASAlaYC&dq=The+Old+Testament+Speaks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elvis Presley, Richard Nixon, and the American Dream","description":"Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon are two of the most important and controversial figures of the twentieth century. Although fame came to them in very different ways, they rose from very similar backgrounds of poverty to seek the American Dream. These two remarkable men both had to face falls from grace, but while Nixon rebounded from Watergate to regain a reputation as a distinguished elder statesman, Elvis was destroyed by the pressures of fame, only to have his image restored after his death.

It explains and illustrates the literary symbols that we frequently encounter (such as swan, rose, moon, gold) and gives thousands of cross-references and quotations. The dictionary concentrates on English literature, but its entries range widely from the Bible and classical authors to the twentieth century, taking in American and European literatures. For this third edition, Michael Ferber has included some twenty completely new entries (such as birch, childbirth, grove, mill and railroad) and has added to many of the existing entries. Its rich references make this book an essential tool not only for literary and classical scholars but also for all students of literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LoYBMQAACAAJ&dq=A+Dictionary+of+Literary+Symbols&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rough Mix","description":"Chronicles the life and career of the record producer","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tEjkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Rough+Mix&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Antarctica","description":"Updated throughout, the 7th edition of Bradt's Antarctica: a Guide to Wildlife is the most practical guide to the flora and fauna available for those 'going south'. Celebrating the amazing and often unique species of this spectacular environment, the title features chapters on the region's famous whales and penguins, and also on lesser known species such as skuas and sheathbills, with full coverage of plumage and identification. Each chapter is accompanied by vibrant illustrations from Dafila Scott to help bring species to life. Tony Soper's immaculate and engaging text remains the indispensible choice for the intrepid wildlife enthusiast. Antarctica's wildlife is under threat. The Southern Ocean is warming and the most obvious effect is on the continental ice shelves. Spectacular retreats and monster carvings from the west coast of the peninsula have been seen in recent decades. Less ice means fewer krill, which depend on the ice-edge for the algae which nourish them. In turn, this will impact on seal and whale numbers. In the case of penguins, while kings and macaronis, for instance, are doing well, the magnificently adapted and truly Antarctic species, Ad lies and emperors, are in decline. In the case of emperors, maybe by as much as 50%. Bradt's Antarctica not only helps you to identify and understand species and habitats, it also explains the issues faced by this extraordinary continent, regarded by many as one of the most precious places on the planet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nMxPDwAAQBAJ&dq=Antarctica&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kodoku: Sailing alone across the Pacific","description":"Kodoku is the true story of a young Japanese sailor whose fascination with the art of sailing led him on a solo trans-Pacific journey.

Accidents occur. Stock markets crash. We make mistakes. No matter how much we plan or prepare or prevent, adversity still finds a way to surprise us. Some of these adversities are small but frustrating, like flat tires in the rain. Others are not so small, like illness or loss. But, says Max Davis, a former pastor, we all have the ability to turn our tragedy into triumph, our hurt into happiness, our outrage into outreach. Davis himself has faced and cleared some of life's highest hurdles. When he was at his personal worst-unemployed, steeped in debt, and uninvolved with his children-he almost gave up. Instead, he systematically rebuilt his life from the bottom up. Through his personal trials as well as his work counseling people in crisis, Davis created the Seven Power Tools for Changing Those Flat Tires in the Rain. Filled with these and other tried-in-the-trenches techniques, his book incorporates old-fashioned values, new-fashioned wisdom, real-life stories of everyday people, and a big dose of faith to help readers find empowerment and peace in the midst of life's difficult circumstances.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rCdmZDEKFFwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","description":"Presents the issue of Christianity and Liberalism in such as way that the reader may be aided in deciding it for himself.

It begins with Peter, a devoted man of faith, as he is called to the mission of a lifetime, one that takes him galaxies away from his wife, Bea. Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment, overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter s teachings his Bible is their  book of strange new things.  But Peter is rattled when Bea s letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries, and governments are crumbling. Bea s faith, once the guiding light of their lives, begins to falter. Suddenly, a separation measured by an otherworldly distance, and defined both by one newly discovered world and another in a state of collapse, is threatened by an ever-widening gulf that is much less quantifiable. While Peter is reconciling the needs of his congregation with the desires of his strange employer, Bea is struggling for survival. Their trials lay bare a profound meditation on faith, love tested beyond endurance, and our responsibility to those closest to us. Marked by the same bravura storytelling and precise language that made The Crimson Petal and the White such an international success, The Book of Strange New Things is extraordinary, mesmerizing, and replete with emotional complexity and genuine pathos.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5HOBAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marriages and Obituaries Macon Georgia Messenger 1818-1865","description":"By: Willard Rocker, Pub. 1988, 588 pages, Soft Cover, Index, ISBN #0-89308-340-2.

The night of the Silent Dinner when Athens placates the spirits of the dead passes with a creeping mist accompanied by eerie portents and a strange disappearance. Stephanos, son of Nikiarkhos and his teacher, the philosopher Aristotle, are drawn into solving the perplexing abduction case of Anthia, the heiress of a prominent silver merchant. Someone has snatched her from her home, but what is the motive: rape, a forced marriage or murder? All that is known is that the abductor and the heiress are on the road to Delphi and its ancient oracle. Stephanos and Aristotle pursue them but along the way there are plenty of distractions: it's spring time and the country is full of reborn life, the thought of romance and marriage is never far from young Stephanos' mind, and rumours of mysterious strangers passing in the night abound, of disguises and swapping of identity. Then the actuality of murder shatters the idyll. It seems that there is a psychopath on the road pursuing abductor and heiress. But who the abductor is and who the murderer is are mysteries that only Aristotle with the aid of the Delphian oracle will be able to solve.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uWNiZQ3dFVgC&dq=Aristotle+and+Poetic+Justice:+Murder+and+Mystery+in+Ancient+Athens+(Aristotle+and+Stephanos+Novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conceiving Luc: A Family Story","description":"A moving memoir of two women--one who couldn't become pregnant and her cousin, who carried a baby for her. photo insert.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UCpTHQAACAAJ&dq=Conceiving+Luc:+A+Family+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","description":"Pyramids is the seventh book in the award-winning comic fantasy Discworld series by Terry Pratchett.

It emphasizes guidelines for working solutions and practical advice for their implementation rather than the theoretical background of Gaussian process (GP) models. The book demonstrates the potential of this recent development in probabilistic machine-learning methods and gives the reader an intuitive understanding of the topic. The current state of the art is treated along with possible future directions for research. Systems control design relies on mathematical models and these may be developed from measurement data. This process of system identification, when based on GP models, can play an integral part of control design in data-based control and its description as such is an essential aspect of the text. The background of GP regression is introduced first with system identification and incorporation of prior knowledge then leading into full-blown control. The book is illustrated by extensive use of examples, line drawings, and graphical presentation of computer-simulation results and plant measurements. The research results presented are applied in real-life case studies drawn from successful applications including: a gasliquid separator control; urban-traffic signal modelling and reconstruction; and prediction of atmospheric ozone concentration.

Despite these successes, the Experimental Mechanised Force was disbanded in the 1930s, making Britain relatively unprepared for World War II, both in terms of armoured doctrine and equipment. This fully illustrated new study examines the men who crewed the tanks of Britain's armoured force during World War II, which was only four battalions large in 1939. It looks at the recruitment and training of the vast numbers of men required, their equipment, appearance and combat experience in every theatre of the war as the British armoured division sought to catch up with the German Panzers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j4A0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"W.E.B.

Or explored how a magnet attracted a nail? If these questions bring back memories of joy and wonder, then you understand the idea behind inquiry-based science--an approach to science education that challenges children to ask questions, solve problems, and develop scientific skills as well as gain knowledge. Inquiry-based science is based on research and experience, both of which confirm that children learn science best when they engage in hands-on science activities rather than read from a textbook. The recent National Science Education Standards prepared by the National Research Council call for a revolution in science education. They stress that the science taught must be based on active inquiry and that science should become a core activity in every grade, starting in kindergarten. This easy-to-read and practical book shows how to bring about the changes recommended in the standards. It provides guidelines for planning and implementing an inquiry-based science program in any school district. The book is divided into three parts. \\"Building a Foundation for Change,\\" presents a rationale for inquiry-based science and describes how teaching through inquiry supports the way children naturally learn. It concludes with basic guidelines for planning a program. School administrators, teachers, and parents will be especially interested in the second part, \\"The Nuts and Bolts of Change.\\" This section describes the five building blocks of an elementary science program: Community and administrative support. A developmentally appropriate curriculum. Opportunities for professional development. Materials support. Appropriate assessment tools. Together, these five elements provide a working model of how to implement hands-on science. The third part, \\"Inquiry-Centered Science in Practice,\\" presents profiles of the successful inquiry-based science programs in districts nationwide. These profiles show how the principles of hands-on science can be adapted to different school settings. If you want to improve the way science is taught in the elementary schools in your community, Science for All Children is an indispensable resource.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FlSbAgAAQBAJ&dq=Science+for+All+Children:+A+Guide+to+Improving+Elementary+Science+Education+in+Your+School+District&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","description":"DROW STALK THE SHADOWS.

Can we create a comprehensive model of the mind and brain, their interactions, and their influences? Synthesizing research from neuroscience, physics, biology, systems science, information science, psychology, and the cognitive sciences, The Neurophysics of Human Behavior advances a unified theory of brain, mind, behavior and information. This groundbreaking work helps you more deeply understand, more accurately predict, and more effectively change human behavior - a significant contribution to the fields of psychology, education, medicine, communications, and human relations. Cognitive neurophysics, as detailed in this work, presents an integrated perspective of brain, mind, behavior, thoughts, and nature. The distinguished authors emphasize the need to view psychological science - and our image of the \\"self\\" - in the context of the physical world: matter, energy, and natural laws. NeuroPrint is the powerful application model of this perspective. This comprehensive, detailed algorithm defines the network of interactions that develop brain, mind, behavior, thoughts, and emotions and redefines the meaning of psychotherapeutic intervention. The Neurophysics of Human Behavior gives the background, tools, and methods for intervention and modeling. It outlines the systematic, behavioral approach of NeuroPrint, promising to promote a deep understanding of the process of human change. Using The Neurophysics of Human Behavior, practitioners and researchers can plot and gauge the paths of change in neurocognitive dynamics and the improvements in mental health.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k5PMBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Like Things (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Modern Curriculum Press Beginning to Read Series)","description":"Rhymes and colorful illustrations reveal how simple shapes come together to form houses, boats, and lots of other things in the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5dL4PgAACAAJ&dq=I+Like+Things+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Box","description":"\\"In April 1956, a refitted oil tanker carried fifty-eight shipping containers from Newark to Houston.

In The Great Divide, Joseph E. Stiglitz expands on the diagnosis he offered in his best-selling book The Price of Inequality and suggests ways to counter this growing problem. With his characteristic blend of clarity and passion, Stiglitz argues that inequality is a choice - the cumulative result of unjust policies and misguided priorities. In these essays, articles and reflections, Stiglitz fully exposes the inequality - from its dimensions and its causes to its consequences for the world - that is afflicting America and other Western countries in thrall to neoliberalism. From Reagan-era policies to the Great Recession and its long aftermath, Stiglitz delves into the processes and irresponsible policies - deregulation, tax cuts for the rich, the corruption of the political process - that are leaving many people further and further behind and turning the dream of a socially mobile society into an ever more unachievable myth. With formidable yet accessible economic insight, he urges us to embrace real solutions: increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthy; investing in education, science, and infrastructure; helping homeowners instead of banks; and, most importantly, doing more to restore the economy to full employment. Stiglitz's analysis reaches beyond America - the inequality leader of the developed world - to draw lessons from Scandinavia, Singapore, and Japan, and he argues against the tide of unnecessary, destructive austerity that is sweeping across Europe. Ultimately, Stiglitz believes our choice is not between growth and fairness; with the right policies, we can choose both.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0qEdjgEACAAJ&dq=The+Big+Divide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Community Capitalism","description":"Perhaps you thought it was fantasy. Perhaps you thought it was a ruse. Perhaps you thought it was the actions of an immature heart and love that had yet to be \\"educated\\" by reality. Wrong! Actually your first answer was right. Now you have to be unschooled and learn love all over again, and you might want to start here at that foundation of love. But you forgot, after all it only lasted a couple of seconds, a couple of days and then that place that those eyes took you disappeared like a mirage. You no longer have what it takes to graduate to love's stage seven. Don't worry, Illuminations will take you back. If infatuation is oft the cornerstone with which we set the foundation of love, why do we throw away that foundation when we build the school of our convictions as to what love is? But remember when we thought a love was perfect and we thought that love was supreme? Remember when we thought love would find ourselves in a perfect plot and we could reside there forever? Remember when love was the most beautiful thing in existence and so was our love? Might I ask, what is wrong with that? And if there is nothing wrong with that, why isn't it considered right? If the school of love in which the world learns fails, and we are unable to graduate to love's better vision. If indeed, we fail to take our love to a higher grade, perhaps we aught to find a better school. Love instinctively knows better, and the new foundation upon which love will be reschooled goes back to our original convictions when we thought love was perfect, that love was supreme, that love would deliver and that love is perfect.

In four years, Maconochie transformed what was one of the most brutal convict settlements in history into a controlled, stable, and productive environment that achieved such success that upon release his prisoners came to be called \\"Maconochie's Gentlemen\\". Here Norval Morris, one of our most renowned criminologists, offers a highly inventive and engaging account of this early pioneer in penal reform, enhancing Maconochie's life story with a trenchant policy twist. Maconochie's life and efforts on Norfolk Island, Morris shows, provide a model with profound relevance to the running of correctional institutions today. Using a unique combination of fictionalized history and critical commentary, Morris gives this work a powerful policy impact lacking in most standard academic accounts. In an era of \\"mass incarceration\\" that rivals that of the settlement of Australia, Morris injects the question of humane treatment back into the debate over prison reform. Maconochie and his \\"Marks system\\" played an influential role in the development of prisons; but for the last thirty years prison reform has been dominated by punitive and retributive sentiments, the conventional wisdom holding that we need 'supermax' prisons to control the 'worst of the worst' in solitary and harsh conditions. Norval Morris argues to the contrary, holding up the example of Alexander Maconochie as a clear-cut alternative to the \\"living hell\\" of prison systems today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bgox160AIBgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beginner's Kosher Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VsbfPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Beginner%27s+Kosher+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","description":"An easy-to-learn repertoire for the chessboard assassin","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lngsQAAACAAJ&dq=A+Killer+Chess+Opening+Repertoire+(Cadogan+Chess+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"De-Facing Power (Contemporary Political Theory)","description":"A sophisticated new view of power as a network of social boundaries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MYQvl4MgoukC&dq=De-Facing+Power+(Contemporary+Political+Theory)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Curse of the Creeping Coffin (Give Yourself Goosebumps, No 8)","description":"Readers are placed into the life of a character who visits Grandmother and her spooky home, which borders a graveyard filled with headstones that creep closer and closer every day, in a story with more than twenty possible endings.

Review, March 22, 1887 In leaving us, he has taken a. Much more manly and commendable course than most of those who have withdrawn from us, coming voluntarily to our leading brethren, and frankly stating the condition of mind he was in. He did this before his own church, in our presence, and, so far as we know, has taken no unfair, underhanded means to injure us in any way. He goes from our midst with no immoral stain upon his character, chooses associations more pleasant to himself. This is every man's personal privilege if he chooses to take it. The quotations in my book are from the Adventist books published up to the date when I wrote my book, 1889. Since then most of their books have been reprinted and paged differently. To conform to these books as now paged, I would need to change many of my references. To do this I would have to reprint my whole book, as it is in electrotype plates. A change of a few plates would necessitate a change Of all. SO it leaves them as they were. The quotations are all there, onlv some are on a different page in their present editions.

First, Modernist studies has seen a temporal expansion, to the extent that scholars in the field have come to turn to both the pre- and posterior history of Modernism. Second, the field has witnessed a spatial expansion, in that increasingly so researchers have also come to scrutinize the Modernisms of regions at the fringes of Europe, and beyond. Thirdly, a vertical expansion too has marked Modernist studies in recent decades, not only by further expanding the canon of women writers and exploring the continuum between high- and lowbrow, but also by looking at the artistic and mediatized hierarchies and cross-fertilizations operative in the period. A fourth conceptual expansion of the field shows that whereas concepts such as  middlebrow ,  arri re-garde , and to some extent even  avant-garde , were once exotic notions of at best marginal importance in European Modernist studies, they now form part and parcel of the field, complicating and expanding it conceptually.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HCaLAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second Amendment Primer : A Citizen's Guidebook To The History , Sources, And Authorities For The Constitutional Guarantee Of The Right To Keep And Bear Arms","description":"A basic, jargon-free guide to understanding this Constitutional amendment and the arguments over the right to bear arms. So much of the debate about the Second Amendment is in academic journals and papers, written by and intended for scholars, law professors, attorneys, and judges. Trying to wade through the extensive footnotes and references to legal cases and historical precedents known only to the academic elite is more than enough to make anyone feel hopelessly confused. The Second Amendment Primer finally provides an elementary and accessible discussion of the Second Amendment. Chronologically arranged, it traces the development of the right to keep and bear arms from its birth in ancient Greece to its addition to the U.S. Constitution. Supplemental essays discuss the Second Amendment s interpretation in today s world from the viewpoints of both firearms enthusiasts as well as those who would limit the amendment s purview. Facts are detailed and well-documented, and reference margin notes, an extensive bibliography, and a comprehensive subject index showcase the author s research and show more curious readers how to continue on their path to understanding exactly what the Second Amendment is saying.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-nGCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mexican Cooking at the Academy: At the Academy (California Culinary Academy Series)","description":"This book gives recipes for salsas, chiles, salads and vegetables, egg dishes, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zkS8v6jbtqYC&dq=Mexican+Cooking+at+the+Academy:+At+the+Academy+(California+Culinary+Academy+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Community Psychology: Theory, Method and Practice, South African and Other Perspectives","description":"This introductory volume takes a look at the contribution of psychology up to the present in South Africa's democracy.

The succeeding chapters deal with the first scientific meetings on marijuana, social impact of marijuana, and its widespread use in some countries, such as in Morocco and Egypt.

During the many decades of the author s clinical psychiatric practice, the primary aim was to seek the most effective ways to relieve human suffering in all of its many forms. The inner mechanism of surrender was found to be of great practical benefit and is described in this book. Dr Hawkins s previous books focused on advanced states of awareness and Enlightenment. Over the years, thousands of students had asked for a practical technique by which to remove the inner blocks to happiness, love, joy, success, health and, ultimately, Enlightenment. This book provides a mechanism for letting go of those blocks. The mechanism of surrender that Dr Hawkins describes can be done in the midst of everyday life. The book is equally useful for all dimensions of human life: physical health, creativity, financial success, emotional healing, vocational fulfillment, relationships, sexuality and spiritual growth. It is an invaluable resource for all professionals who work in the areas of mental health, psychology, medicine, self-help, addiction recovery and spiritual development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n1_6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Letting+go&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jagdwaffe: Reich Defense 1 1943-1944 -Volume 5, Section 1 (Luftwaffe Colours) (Vol 5)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tJZHAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Study of History, Vol. I-VI","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ga4qngEACAAJ&dq=A+Study+of+History,+Vol.+I-VI&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wisdom Warrior: Native American Animal Legends","description":"Traditional Native American legend and lore, often used to impart wisdom and teach lessons about living in harmony with the Earth, are shared in this thought-provoking collection, repackaged in a gift format. 25 phoots.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zvcIAAAACAAJ&dq=Wisdom+Warrior:+Native+American+Animal+Legends&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing For Literacy (Literacy Series)","description":"In this essay collection, scholars in the area of early literacy provide concrete strategies for achieving excellence in literacy instruction.

Dog owners and trainers who are fortunate enough to find a trained animal chiropractor also know of these benefits. But that's the problem--finding a practitioner in your area. Very few veterinarians offer chiropractic services since they are too busy with medical emergencies. And most of the licensed human chiropractors, who became certified in animal chiropractic, are prohibited or severely limited by law to adjust animals in their state. \\"The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do\\" will give dog owners insight on how a lot of the adjustments are performed and what to expect when they take their dog to an animal chiropractor--if they can find one. For those who want to adjust their own dogs, the author provides step-by-step instructions with over 90 illustrations. However, Dr. Kamen strongly advises first consulting with a licensed veterinarian for a proper evaluation and to rule out any possible contraindications to adjusting. About the Author Dr. Daniel Kamen was born in Chicago, Illinois and has been practicing chiropractic since 1981. His father is a highly respected anesthesiologist; his mother, a gifted artist. Dr. Kamen's original animal chiropractic organization, \\"Animal Crackers,\\" produced animal chiropractic educational materials, which taught others how to adjust dogs and horses. Dr. Kamen lives with his wife, Sharon, of thirty-four years. Together they have three sons, Jeffrey, Gary and Kevin. He makes his home in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. Dr. Kamen has been featured in many TV, radio, and newspaper stories concerning his work with animal chiropractic. He currently is on tour, teaching a professional as well as a lay lecture seminar on animal chiropractic (horse and dog adjusting). His hobbies include playing the piano and chess (master level).

Scheler's response is multi-faceted but centers on Nietzsche's failure to understand the nature of Christian love. Christianity is not a destructive enterprise trying to bring everyone down to the same low level of its impotent faithful, who must put their trust in the next world because they can get nowhere in this one. Rather, it attempts constructively to bring everyone up to a new level of human flourishing. Christianity's preoccupation with the poor, weak, and marginalized stems from a recognition, through divine love, of the miracle of God's creation and infinite possibilities present even in them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sm-5QgAACAAJ&dq=Ressentiment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bible and Government: Public Policy from a Christian Perspective","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Double Deception","description":"Laura Dalwood, a young widow of an unhappy marriage, is disturbed when she hears disquieting rumors about her new husband's past","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4U-bPQAACAAJ&dq=A+Double+Deception&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diccionario Avanzado Italiano - Espanol / Espanol - Italiano : Dizionario Italiano - Spagnolo / Spagnolo - Italiano (Italian and Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3y7qAAAAMAAJ&dq=Diccionario+Avanzado+Italiano+-+Espanol+/+Espanol+-+Italiano+:+Dizionario+Italiano+-+Spagnolo+/+Spagnolo+-+Italiano+(Italian+and+Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Duty Bound","description":"As long as there is Light, there is hope!

However, the discourse around Sharia law is largely focussed on its development and the theories, principles and rules that inform it. Less attention has been given to studying the consequences of its operation, particularly in the area of Islamic criminal law. Even fewer studies explore the actual practice of Islamic criminal law in contemporary societies. This book aims to fill these gaps in our understanding of Sharia law in practice. It deals specifically with the consequences of enforcing Islamic criminal law in Pakistan, providing an in-depth and critical analysis of the application of the Islamic law of Qisas and Diyat (retribution and blood money) in the Muslim world today. The empirical evidence adduced more broadly demonstrates the complications of applying traditional Sharia in a modern state.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=88-XutlkJAQC&dq=Kitab+al-Nasikh+wa-l-Mansukh+(Abu+%27Ubaid+al-Qasim+b.+Sallam)+(New)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moon Prairie","description":"Haunted by the memories of life with an adoring husband, widowed Della Ward lives on a run-down farm near a small Texas town.

Sandra Cisneros Fifteen-year-old Ana Cancion never dreamed of moving to America, the way the girls she grew up with in the Dominican countryside did. But when Juan Ruiz proposes and promises to take her to New York City, she has to say yes. It doesn t matter that he is twice her age, that there is no love between them. Their marriage is an opportunity for her entire close-knit family to eventually immigrate. So on New Year s Day, 1965, Ana leaves behind everything she knows and becomes Ana Ruiz, a wife confined to a cold six-floor walk-up in Washington Heights. Lonely and miserable, Ana hatches a reckless plan to escape. But at the bus terminal, she is stopped by Cesar, Juan s free-spirited younger brother, who convinces her to stay. As the Dominican Republic slides into political turmoil, Juan returns to protect his family s assets, leaving Cesar to take care of Ana. Suddenly, Ana is free to take English lessons at a local church, lie on the beach at Coney Island, see a movie at Radio City Music Hall, go dancing with Cesar, and imagine the possibility of a different kind of life in America. When Juan returns, Ana must decide once again between her heart and her duty to her family.

Drawn from Jenny Uglow's own love for plants, this lively 'potted' history of gardening in Britain takes us on a garden tour from the thorn hedges around prehistoric settlements to the rage for ornamental grasses and 'outdoor rooms' today. Tracking down the ordinary folk who worked the earth - from weeding women to florists - as well as aristocrats and grand designers and famous plant-hunters, A Little History of British Gardening is brought to life by gorgeously vivid illustrations and Uglow's insightful wisdom. Not only dealing with flowery meads, grottoes and vistas, landscapes and ha-has, parks and allotments, Uglow explains, for example, how the Tudors made their curious knots; how housewives used herbs to stop freckles; how the suburbs dug for victory in World War II. With a brief guide to particular historic or evocative gardens open to the public, this is a book to put in your pocket when planning a crisp, winter's day out - but also to read in your armchair with a well-earned glass of red, after a hard day's graft in your own garden.

They have served as gurus to Mongolian khans and Chinese emperors alike, as well as to the masses of peoples inhabiting the numerous kingdoms of Central Asia.Author Glenn Mullin vividly brings to life the sacred mythology associated with the Dalai Lama. He captures the spiritual and political history of this remarkable personage, with accounts not only of the fourteen Dalai Lamas and the legacy of reincarnation surrounding them, but also of the dozens of previous lives of the soul that became these fourteen extraordinary beings. In addition, he has supplemented the stories of the various Dalai Lamas with excerpts from their spiritual teachings, their philosophy and their mystical poetry.The Fourteenth Dalai Lama, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, is now almost a household name around the world. However, the ancient tradition of reincarnation to which he is heir is less well known. The First Dalai Lama was born in a nomadic hut in 1391, and each subsequent Dalai Lama is regarded as his reincarnation, choosing to take up the burdens of a human life again and again in order to benefit the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8AwIPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Fourteen+Dalai+Lamas:+A+Sacred+Legacy+of+Reincarnation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tom Sawyer & the Spiritual Whirlwind","description":"The adventures of a mischievous young boy and his friends growing up in a Mississippi River town in the nineteenth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t5yFTpIJYhcC&dq=Tom+Sawyer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Adolph Hitler","description":"A New York Times Bestseller In The Life And Death of Adolf Hitler, biographer Robert Payne unravels the tangled threads of Hitler's public and private life and looks behind the caricature with the Charlie Chaplin mustache and the unruly shock of hair to reveal a Hitler possessed of immense personal charm that impressed both men and women and brought followers and contributions to the burgeoning Nazi Party. Although he misread his strength and organized an ill-fated putsch, Hitler spent his months in prison writing Mein Kampf, which increased his following. Once in undisputed command of the Party, Hitler renounced the chastity of his youth and began a sordid affair with his niece, whose suicide prompted him to reject forever all conventional morality. He promised anything to prospective supporters, then cold-bloodedly murdered them before they could claim a share of the power he reserved for himself. Once he became Chancellor, Hitler step by step bent the powers of the state to his own purposes to satisfy his private fantasies, rearming Germany, slaughtering his real or imaginary enemies, blackmailing one by one the leaders of Europe, and plunging the world into the holocaust of World War II. THE LIFE AND DEATH OF ADOLF HITLER is the story of not so much a man corrupted by power as a corrupt man who achieved absolute power and used it to an unprecedented degree, knowing at every moment exactly what he was doing and calculating his enemies' weaknesses to a hair's breadth. It is the story of a living man. Robert Payne (1911-1983) was born in Cornwall, U.K. His father was English, his mother French. He was educated at St. Paul's School in London and at the universities of Liverpool, Capetown in South Africa, Munich and The Sorbonne. During his lifetime he had over a hundred books published on a wide range of subjects, the widest range of any known author. He was known chiefly for his biographies and history books, among them Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Gandhi, Leonardo, Chaplin, the Christian Centuries, The World of Art. He also wrote novels and poetry. Librarians loved him; critics raved about him. Orville Prescott of The New York Times referred to him as \\"a literary phenomenon of astounding versatility and industry.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fP8CswEACAAJ&dq=The+Life+and+Death+of+Adolph+Hitler&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark the Match Boy (Two Novels)","description":"Two famous novels by Horatio Alger that focus on rags-to-riches tales.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8eJAPgAACAAJ&dq=Ragged+Dick+and+Mark+the+Match+Boy+(Two+Novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","description":"Author's experiences as a fighter pilot during World War I.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jr0ezwEACAAJ&dq=Fighting+the+flying+circus+(Wings+of+war)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Venture to the Interior (Transaction Large Print Books)","description":"Create your own adventure on the high seas!

If his untimely end fails even to point a moral that shall benefit the surviving species of mammals which are now being slaughtered in like manner, it will be sad indeed.Although Bison americanus is a true bison, according to scientific classification, and not a buffalo, the fact that more than sixty millions of people in this country unite in calling him a  buffalo,  and know him by no other name, renders it quite unnecessary for me to apologize for following, in part, a harmless custom which has now become so universal that all the naturalists in the world could not change it if they would.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6aI_AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hair of the Bear: Campfire Yarns and Short Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ED0FAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Hair+of+the+Bear:+Campfire+Yarns+and+Short+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","description":"The fastest route to true HTML/CSS mastery!

In the face of historically assimilationist agendas, institutional racism, and structural opposition by Western educational institutions, collaborative programs continue to grow and promote the values and goals of sovereign tribal communities. The contributors show how many departments grew significantly following the landmark 1969 Senate report, 'Indian Education: A National Tragedy, A National Challenge.' They evaluate the university efforts to offer Native students intellectual and technical skills, and the long battle to represent Native cultures and world views in the university curriculum. In twelve case studies, Indian and non-Indian teachers provide rich, contextual histories of their programs through three decades of growth. They frankly discuss successes and failures as innovative strategies and models are tested. Programs from University of California-Davis, Harvard, Saskatchewan, Arizona and others provide detailed analyses of academic battles over curriculum content, the marginalization of indigenous faculty and students, the pedagogical implications of integrating native instructors, the vagaries of administrative support and funding, Native student retention, the vulnerability of native language programs, and community collaborations. A vision of Indian education that emerges from these pages that reveals the university's potential as a vehicle for Indian nation-building, one in which the university curriculum also benefits from sustained contacts with tribal communities. As Native populations grow and the demand for university training increases, this book will be a valuable resource for Native American leaders, educators in Native American studies, race and ethnic studies, comparative education, minorities in education, anthropology, sociology, higher education administration and educational policy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dld0kF_3PT4C&dq=Native+American+Studies+in+Higher+Education:+Models+for+Collaboration+between+Universities+and+Indigenous+Nations+(Contemporary+Native+American+Communities)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Brief for Belief: The Case for Catholicism","description":"Dr. Frederick Marks, Ph.D., has taken many of the misconceptions of the Catholic faith and explained them in easy-to-understand terms for the average Catholic in the pew.

Richard N. Goodwin entered public service in 1958 as a law clerk for Supreme Court Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter. He left politics ten years later in the aftermath of Senator Robert F. Kennedy s assassination. Over the course of one extraordinary decade, Goodwin orchestrated some of the noblest achievements in the history of the US government and bore witness to two of its greatest tragedies. His eloquent and inspirational memoir is one of the most captivating chronicles of those turbulent years ever published. From the Twenty-One quiz-show scandal to the heady days of John F. Kennedy s presidential campaign to President Lyndon Johnson s heroic vote wrangling on behalf of civil rights legislation, Remembering America brings to life the most fascinating figures and events of the era. As a member of the Kennedy administration, Goodwin charted a new course for US relations with Latin America and met in secret with Che Guevara in Uruguay. He wrote Johnson s historic civil rights speech,  We Shall Overcome,  in support of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and formulated the concept of the Great Society and its programs, which sought to eradicate poverty and racial injustice. After breaking with Johnson over the president s commitment to the Vietnam War, Goodwin played a pivotal role in bringing antiwar candidate Eugene McCarthy to within a few hundred votes of victory in the 1968 New Hampshire primary. Three months later, he was with his good friend Robert F. Kennedy in Los Angeles the night that the young senator s life and the progressive movement that had rapidly brought about such significant change came to a devastating end. Throughout this critical decade, Goodwin held steadfast to the passions and principles that had first led him to public service. Remembering America is a thrilling account of the breathtaking victories and heartbreaking disappointments of the 1960s, and a rousing call to action for readers committed to justice today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z4nhAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legends, traditions and laws, of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of the Tuscarora Indians.","description":"This collection of literature attempts to compile many of the classic works that have stood the test of time and offer them at a reduced, affordable price, in an attractive volume so that everyone can enjoy them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K0O6rQEACAAJ&dq=Legends,+traditions+and+laws,+of+the+Iroquois,+or+Six+Nations,+and+History+of+the+Tuscarora+Indians.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistical Methods for Quality Improvement","description":"Praise for the Second Edition \\"As a comprehensive statistics reference book for quality improvement, it certainly is one of the best books available.\\"  Technometrics This new edition continues to provide the most current, proven statistical methods for quality control and quality improvement The use of quantitative methods offers numerous benefits in the fields of industry and business, both through identifying existing trouble spots and alerting management and technical personnel to potential problems.

She then describes the founding of Hull-House and the varied social and educational activities which the organization pioneered and developed.

In this acclaimed and riveting bookpart expos , part user s manualthe astute and entertaining columnist from the Financial Times demystifies the ways in which money works in the world. From why the coffee in your cup costs so much to why efficiency is not necessarily the answer to ensuring a fair society, from improving health care to curing crosstown trafficall the dirty little secrets of dollars and cents are delightfully revealed by The Undercover Economist.  A rare specimen: a book on economics that will enthrall its readers . . . It brings the power of economics to life.  Steven D. Levitt, coauthor of Freakonomics  A playful guide to the economics of everyday life, and as such is something of an elder sibling to Steven Levitt s wild child, the hugely successful Freakonomics.  The Economist  A tour de force . . . If you need to be convinced of the everrelevant and fascinating nature of economics, read this insightful and witty book.  Jagdish Bhagwati, author of In Defense of Globalization  This is a book to savor.  The New York Times  Harford writes like a dream. From his book I found out why there s a Starbucks on every corner [and] how not to get duped in an auction. Reading The Undercover Economist is like spending an ordinary day wearing X-ray goggles.  David Bodanis, author of Electric Universe  Much wit and wisdom.  The Houston Chronicle From Publishers Weekly Nattily packaged-the cover sports a Roy Lichtensteinesque image of an economist in Dick Tracy garb-and cleverly written, this book applies basic economic theory to such modern phenomena as Starbucks' pricing system and Microsoft's stock values. While the concepts explored are those encountered in Microeconomics 101, Harford gracefully explains abstruse ideas like pricing along the demand curve and game theory using real world examples without relying on graphs or jargon. The book addresses free market economic theory, but Harford is not a complete apologist for capitalism; he shows how companies from Amazon.com to Whole Foods to Starbucks have gouged consumers through guerrilla pricing techniques and explains the high rents in London (it has more to do with agriculture than one might think). Harford comes down soft on Chinese sweatshops, acknowledging \\"conditions in factories are terrible,\\" but \\"sweatshops are better than the horrors that came before them, and a step on the road to something better.\\" Perhaps, but Harford doesn't question whether communism or a capitalist-style industrial revolution are the only two choices available in modern economies. That aside, the book is unequaled in its accessibility and ability to show how free market economic forces affect readers' day-to-day. Copyright ? Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. From Bookmarks Magazine Harford exposes the dark underbelly of capitalism in Undercover Economist. Compared with Steven Levitt s and Stephen J. Dubner s popular Freakonomics (*** July/Aug 2005), the book uses simple, playful examples (written in plain English) to elucidate complex economic theories. Critics agree that the book will grip readers interested in understanding free-market forces but disagree about Harford s approach. Some thought the author mastered the small ideas while keeping in sight the larger context of globalization; others faulted Harford for failing to criticize certain economic theories and to ground his arguments in political, organizational structures. Either way, his case studies some entertaining, others indicative of times to come will make you think twice about that cup of coffee.

Although his thrillers were immensely popular, and Hitchcock himself courted reviewers, he was, for many years, regarded as no more than a master craftsman. By the 1960s, though, critics began calling him an artist of unique vision and gifts. What happened to make Hitchcock's reputation as a true innovator and singular talent? Through a close examination of Hitchcock's personal papers, scripts, production notes, publicity files, correspondence, and hundreds of British and American reviews, Robert Kapsis here traces Hitchcock's changing critical fortunes. Vertigo, for instance, was considered a flawed film when first released; today it is viewed by many as the signal achievement of a great director. According to Kapsis, this dramatic change occurred because the making of the Hitchcock legend was not solely dependent on the quality of his films. Rather, his elevation to artist was caused by a successful blending of self-promotion, sponsorship by prominent members of the film community, and, most important, changes in critical theory which for the first time allowed for the idea of director as auteur. Kapsis also examines the careers of several other filmmakers who, like Hitchcock, have managed to cross the line that separates craftsman from artist, and shows how Hitchcock's legacy and reputation shed light on the way contemporary reputations are made. In a chapter about Brian De Palma, the most reknowned thriller director since Hitchcock, Kapsis explores how Hitchcock's legacy has affected contemporary work in and criticism of the thriller genre. Filled with fascinating anecdotes and intriguing excerpts, and augmented by interviews with Hitchcock's associates, this thoroughly documented and engagingly written book will appeal to scholars and film enthusiasts alike. \\"Required reading for Hitchcock scholars...scrupulously researched, invaluable material for those who continue to ask: what made the master tick?\\" Anthony Perkins","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mfx4PaeL1nUC&dq=Hitchcock:+The+Making+of+a+Reputation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic and Romance of Art Dolls","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wbvpAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Magic+and+Romance+of+Art+Dolls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Should students share the power?: A study of their role in college and university governance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PyadAAAAMAAJ&dq=Should+students+share+the+power%3F:+A+study+of+their+role+in+college+and+university+governance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goldoon and Professor: Memoirs and Reflections of a Bicultural Marriage","description":"A stash of historic letters is the starting point for this intimate view of life in pre-Revolutionary Iran.

We share the excitement of Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter as they first glimpse the riches of Tutankhamen's tomb, of George Smith when he found the ancient clay tablets that contained the records of the Biblical Flood. We rediscover the ruined splendors of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the wonders of the ancient wold; of Chichen Itza, the abandoned pyramids of the Maya: and the legendary Labyrinth of tile Minotaur in Crete.

Long out of print, this classic is one of the preeminent examples of Africana, and belongs on every collector's shelf.Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) was a heroic figure who served as the 26th president of the United States.

Loud, smoke-belching trains might have cut across the rough terrain, but harsh weather, rigid seats, and short breaks for bad food in the middle of nowhere showed the West was by no means won. Entrepreneur Fred Harvey had an eye for such problems and a nerve for the impossible. In 1876, he began establishing high-quality dining rooms along the Santa Fe Railroad, and his Harvey Houses helped change the entire picture of the American West.

At the same time it addresses the complex results of this survival skill and the challenges that MPD clients and their therapists face in reintegrating the shattered self. Judy Kessler's story is the thread that weaves the book together. Without going into the details of the abuse that Judy endured, the authors illuminate the intensity of her suffering, the strength of her spirit, and the miracle of her recovery from multiple personality disorder. Now integrated, she is a powerful voice, not only for herself but for other multiples who seek wholeness. In addition to telling Judy's story in her own words, the book is illustrated with numerous drawings, paintings, and sculptures that Judy did during her therapy. The therapists write from a background that is humanistic, blending their own personal experiences and findings with concepts from Virginia Satir, Erik Erikson, and Gestalt therapy, as well as research on the development of multiple personality disorder. They present a therapeutic map that portrays the work with a multiple from the beginning of therapy through integration. Information and techniques are described in a detailed and down-to-earth manner. Throughout the book, but particularly in their final chapter on ritualistic abuse of children, the authors show compassion for the multiple, who experienced so much suffering as a child. Their approach to the \\"inner family\\" of the multiple is consistently respectful; after all, these personalities enabled the child to survive. Seldomdo readers have the opportunity to witness the dramatic success of therapy for a multiple personality, told by both the patient and her therapists. Not only the clearly presented treatment approach but also the honestly shared memories and impressions will be helpful to clients, teachers, students, and multiples as they endeavor to understand some of the most disenfranchised people in our society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YKmDQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Family+Inside:+Working+With+the+Multiple&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Al corriente","description":"The core of this proficiency-based worktext is more than 250 expressions that help students learn conversational \\"survival\\" Spanish.

Natural fires are as essential as sun and rain in fire-adapted forests, but as humans encroach on wild spaces, fear, arrogance, and greed have shaped the way that people view these regenerative events and given rise to misinformation that threatens whole ecosystems as well as humanity's chances of overcoming the climate crisis. Scientist and activist Chad T. Hanson explains how natural alarm over wildfire has been marshaled to advance corporate and political agendas, notably those of the logging industry. He also shows that, in stark contrast to the fear-driven narrative around these events, contemporary research has demonstrated that forests in the United States, North America, and around the world have a significant deficit of fire. Forest fires, including the largest ones, can create extraordinarily important and rich wildlife habitats as long as they are not subjected to postfire logging. Smokescreen confronts the devastating cost of current policies and practices head-on and ultimately offers a hopeful vision and practical suggestions for the future -- one in which both communities and the climate are protected and fires are understood as a natural and necessary force.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OxT2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One God: Peoples of the Book","description":"With compelling clarity, this inviting and informed journey through the Bible offers hope for eternity.

The German army had broken through the French lines on the River Meuse at Sedan and elsewhere, only five days after launching their attack. Churchill, who had been telephoned by Prime Minister Reynaud the previous evening to be told that the French were beaten, rushed to Paris to meet the French leaders. The mood in the meeting was one of panic and despair; there was talk of evacuating Paris. Churchill asked Gamelin, the French Commander in Chief, 'Where is the strategic reserve?' 'There is none,' replied Gamelin. This exciting book by Julian Jackson, a leading historian of twentieth-century France, charts the breathtakingly rapid events that led to the defeat and surrender of one of the greatest bastions of the Western Allies, and thus to a dramatic new phase of the Second World War. The search for scapegoats for the most humiliating military disaster in French history began almost at once: were miscalculations by military leaders to blame, or was this an indictment of an entire nation? Using eyewitness accounts, memoirs, and diaries, Julian Jackson recreates, in gripping detail, the intense atmosphere and dramatic events of these six weeks in 1940, unravelling the historical evidence to produce a fresh answer to the perennial question of whether the fall of France was inevitable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ADasvbSMGUEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gatherings from Spain","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=65A9zvy92KoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We're all guilty, a play for today","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UAFfEuMofJYC&dq=We%27re+all+guilty,+a+play+for+today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hymns of Sankara","description":"English translation of Puranas planned in a hundred volume series, of which 68 volumes have appeared so far.

[People in the country can take their economic misfortune better than people in cities because they can work and grow their food.] There was a hit-and-run accident that injured a woman and killed her baby; that car was stolen. D.A. Doug Selby got a phone call from a woman at the bus depot, Alice Grolley. People tried to get her into a car and she is afraid her baby might be hurt. Selby and Sheriff Rex Brandon go to the bus depot, find the baby, but the woman is missing! Police Chief Larkin is called in. They find the woman that was Ezra Grolley's wife. Ezra is in the hospital, and dies before Selby can talk to him. Sheriff Brandon and Selby go to Ezra Grolley's shack in the country with Coroner Harry Perkins. They find a small fortune in hidden money! A.B. Carr meets Selby and tells him he is representing the widow Grolley. At the Inquest for the dead baby A.B. Carr suggests that accident was a murder attempt! Inez Stapleton visits Selby and tells him Carr is representing Alice Grolley and Mrs. Hunter, the accident victim. Inez heard that Ezra Grolley was quite rich. Then Sheriff Brandon comes to tell Selby that Alice Grolley was found murdered. From the wounds and the blood spatter they surmise Alice was attacked by two people. There is a clue from a tire track. Reporter Sylvia Martin tells Selby he should arrest someone to impress the public. Selby goes to San Francisco, searches Alice Grolley's apartment, and finds a packet of letters - evidence of inheritance. A fingerprint expert is brought to gather the baby's prints. Alice's jewel case has no fingerprints! Someone broke into Ezra's shack and dug around. Selby and Brandon now find Ezra's will leaving everything to his sister. Selby takes this will and some standards to a questioned document examiner, who explains his methods, and why the ink is two days old! Selby meets Jackson Teel, who financed Alice Grolley against a share in the estate. Selby learns that will and the letter were the work of a professional forger. Selby asks Sylvia Martin to plant two stories about Ezra Grolley in her newspaper. Selby experiments with the effect of height on blood spatter. Selby and Sylvia Martin hide in a tree to see if their bait attracts their game. But Selby's plan goes awry. Selby gets withheld information from a witness, and calls Sheriff Brandon. Another trap is set. This draws in a person who confesses about the whole plot. But Selby can't pin anything on the lawyer A.B. Carr. The last chapter explains Selby's thinking about the people and their stories. Selby noticed the pattern of blood spatter and what that represented: planting evidence, not an actual bleeding person! There were other inconsistencies that raised suspicions. They learn A.B. Carr got the Losstens to split 50-50 with the baby girl, a compromise solution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PbRCAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+D.+A.+Cooks+a+Goose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The naked sun.","description":"A millennium into the future, two advancements have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the Galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain.

Hilarious  (Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times). Chris Ayres is a small-town boy, a hypochondriac, and a neat freak with an anxiety disorder. Not exactly the picture of a war correspondent. But when his boss asks him if he would like to go to Iraq, he doesn t have the guts to say no. After signing a one million dollar life-insurance policy, studying a tutorial on repairing severed limbs, and spending twenty thousand dollars on camping gear (only to find out that his bright yellow tent makes him a sitting duck), Ayres is embedded with a battalion of gung ho Marines who either shun him or threaten him when he files an unfavorable story. As time goes on, though, he begins to understand them (and his inexplicably enthusiastic fellow war reporters) more and more: Each night of terrifying combat brings, in the morning, something more visceral than he has ever experienced the thrill of having won a fight for survival. A  heartbreakingly funny  memoir (Anthony Swofford, author of Jarhead), War Reporting for Cowards tells, with  self-deprecating wit  (The New Yorker), the story of Iraq in a way that is extraordinarily honest, and bitterly hilarious.

(European Perspectives: A Series in Social Thought and Cultural Criticism)","description":"Why do some people still choose psychoanalysis-Freud's so-called talking cure-when numerous medications are available that treat the symptoms of psychic distress so much faster? Elisabeth Roudinesco tackles this difficult question, exploring what she sees as a \\"depressive society\\": an epidemic of distress addressed only by an increasing reliance on prescription drugs. Far from contesting the efficacy of new medications like Prozac, Zoloft, and Viagra in alleviating the symptoms of any number of mental or nervous conditions, Roudinesco argues that the use of such drugs fails to solve patients' real problems. In the man who takes Viagra without ever wondering why he is suffering from impotence and the woman who is given antidepressants to deal with the loss of a loved one, Roudinesco sees a society obsessed with efficiency and desperate for the quick fix. She argues that \\"the talking cure\\" and pharmacology represent not just different approaches to psychiatry, but different worldviews. The rush to treat symptoms is itself symptomatic of an antiseptic and depressive culture in which thought is reduced to the firing of neurons and desire is just a chemical secretion. In contrast, psychoanalysis testifies to human freedom and the power of language.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QAkoHImXF2EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Golden West","description":"Friendship.

Four years later all had vanished in the chaos of World War I. One event precipitated the conflict, and at its hear was a tragic love story. When Austrian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand married for love against the wishes of the emperor, he and his wife Sophie were humiliated and shunned, yet they remained devoted to each other and to their children. The two bullets fired in Sarajevo not only ended their love story, but also led to war and a century of conflict. Set against a backdrop of glittering privilege, The Assassination of the Archduke combines royal history, touching romance, and political murder in a moving portrait of the end of an era. One hundred years after the event, it offers the startling truth behind the Sarajevo assassinations, including Serbian complicity and examines rumors of conspiracy and official negligence. Events in Sarajevo also doomed the couple's children to lives of loss, exile, and the horrors of Nazi concentration camps, their plight echoing the horrors unleashed by their parents' deaths. Challenging a century of myth, The Assassination of the Archduke resonates as a very human story of love destroyed by murder, revolution, and war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GaxpFpsI9kUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trusted Platform Module Basics: Using TPM in Embedded Systems (Embedded Technology)","description":"Clear, practical tutorial style text with real-world applications First book on TPM for embedded designers Provides a sound foundation on the TPM, helping designers take advantage of hardware security based on sound TCG standards Covers all the TPM basics, discussing in detail the TPM Key Hierarchy and the Trusted Platform Module specification Presents a methodology to enable designers and developers to successfully integrate the TPM into an embedded design and verify the TPM's operation on a specific platform This sound foundation on the TPM provides clear, practical tutorials with detailed real-world application examples The author is reknowned for training embedded systems developers to successfully implement the TPM worldwide","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bFTprPxHvdgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leo Kottke Transcribed","description":"\\"Book and CD guide to the styles of a premier acoustic guitarist.

One of the best books ever written on the rise and fall of a great college football coach.\\"  Allen Barra, San Francisco Chronicle The Lion in Autumn takes readers inside Penn State s storied football program as legendary coach Joe Paterno fights to turn his struggling team into a winner once again. In more than a half century at Penn State, Paterno has won more bowl games (21) than any other coach and more games (354) than all but one, en route to two national championships and five perfect seasons. But in the new millennium hard times arrived in Happy Valley. His Nittany Lions had losing seasons in four of five years, dropping sixteen of twenty-three games in 2003 and 2004. There were boos at Beaver Stadium and increasing calls for the aging Paterno to step down. Award-winning sportswriter Frank Fitzpatrick followed JoePa through the 2004 season as the beloved coach struggled to save himself and his storied program. Fitzpatrick trailed Paterno from fund-raisers to the spring practices to the sidelines, detailing how the coach endured another losing season while building a team that would win the Orange Bowl and compete for the national championship in 2005. Interweaving stories from past seasons into the narrative, Fitzpatrick fleshes out the legend of Paterno.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nKLvWPvG8ZcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"3D; Diet, Discipline and Discipleship (Individual Member's Kit)","description":"The candid, moving count of how God led Carol Showalter to an understanding of why she ate as she did, and how he gave her concrete, positive steps to alter behavior patterns of a lifetime.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1ArnAAAACAAJ&dq=3D%3B+Diet,+Discipline+and+Discipleship+(Individual+Member%27s+Kit)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Montrose (Brief lives)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G1frjgEACAAJ&dq=Montrose+(Brief+lives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My secret war","description":"Thirteen-year-old Madeline's diaries for 1941 and 1942 reveal her experiences living on Long Island during World War II while her father is away in the Navy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zow3PQAACAAJ&dq=My+secret+war&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A history of ships and seafaring","description":"Amply illustrated book traces evolution of the sailing ship over the course of 6,000 years   from vessels of ancient Egypt to full-rigged clipper ships of the 19th century. 20 halftones and 134 figures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Re-7AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dewey Decimal System Defeats Truman!: Library Cartoons","description":"Ever wanted a quiet place to read?

Hays Town","description":"A. Hays Town changed the face of the Louisiana house. In a career that includes designing more than five hundred homes, he led architects, builders, and homeowners to embrace the finest elements of Louisiana's architectural past. Almost every home built in Louisiana during the last twenty years is in some way inspired by Town's work. The Louisiana Houses of A. Hays Town honors his legacy as Louisiana's premier residential architect. Color photographs of numerous homes -- including Town's own -- by Philip Gould combined with an illuminating text by Cyril E. Vetter produce a volume that captures the appeal and beauty of the state's finest architectural tradition. Born and raised in rural southwest Louisiana, Hays Town graduated from Tulane University with a degree in architecture in 1926 and worked for a firm in Jackson, Mississippi, for many years. He established his own successful commercial practice in Baton Rouge in 1939, but in the 1960s, Town turned to his abiding passion -- residential architecture. Throughout this chapter of his career, he perfected his inimitable style and emerged as one of the most prominent architects in the South. Town's residential designs are perceptibly influenced by the diverse culture of south Louisiana. His synthesis of the classic Acadian cottage, Spanish courtyards, and exterior French doors with Creole-influenced full-length shutters achieves an original confluence of seemingly disparate yet elegantly balanced themes and forms. Other Town trademarks include pigeonniers, tree alleys, thirteen-foot ceilings, heavy use of such woods as cypress and heart of pine, plantation-style separate structures, and brick floors with a special beeswax finish. The Louisiana Houses of A. Hays Town illuminates the momentous effect Town has had on the look of Louisiana. Crafted from the perspective of two people, Vetter and Gould, who are not architects but admirers of one man's exceptional talent, this delightful book demonstrates that each Town house is a work of art that fits both person and terrain. At the door of each home, proud owners hang a bronze plaque that says it all: A. Hays Town, Architect.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NIybDbTtufcC&dq=The+Louisiana+Houses+of+A.+Hays+Town&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Growing Up Italian: How Being Brought Up As an Italian-American Helped Shape the Characters, Lives and Fortunes of Twenty-Four Celebrated Americans","description":"Looks at how being brought up as an Italian-American shaped the lives, characters, and careers of twenty-four prominent people including Mario Cuomo, Tony Bennett, Geraldine Ferraro, and Francis Ford Coppola","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_fdiIP7uspsC&dq=Growing+Up+Italian:+How+Being+Brought+Up+As+an+Italian-American+Helped+Shape+the+Characters,+Lives+and+Fortunes+of+Twenty-Four+Celebrated+Americans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Restaurant Franchising","description":"This book is the only up-to-date book of its kind that will provide an introduction to franchising, its pros and cons, and other aspects pertinent to restaurant franchises.

Few antique Amish crib quilts remain because they were put to hard use in large families which typically averaged seven children. But Sara Miller of Kalona, Iowa, herself a member of the Old Order Amish, began building a collection of lovely antique crib quilts which she learned about as the proprietor of a fabric and quilt shop. Thus began an unusual odyssey -- Sara, who once disparaged the quilting tradition of her heritage, thinking it dull and drab, began to see its graphic beauty when outsiders became intent on owning Amish quilts. The richly colorful quilts featured here come from Amish communities through the Midwestern United States. In addition to 90 full-color plates of the exquisite quilts is interpretive commentary and documentation, plus three essays elaborating on the significance of the collection. Author Janneken Smucker descends from a line of quilters in the Amish-Mennonite community of Goshen, IN; Dr. Patricia Cox Crews is Director of the International Quilt Study Center in Lincoln, NE; Dr. Linda Welters is Professor of Textiles at the University of Rhode Island. Amish Crib Quilts from the Midwest: The Sara Miller Collection is an unusual feast visually. The analyses that accompany the boldly beautiful images contribute scholarship to this intersection of art and the life of the Amish.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wP1JAQAAIAAJ&dq=Amish+Crib+Quilts+from+the+Midwest:+The+Sara+Millier+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rich and The Super-Rich by Ferdinand Lundberg","description":"Thirty years ago, a bombshell of a book appeared which told the story of the lords of wealth and their glittering clans. It was called America's Sixty Families. It rocked the nation and became a classic. Lundberg showed how America was ruled by a plutocracy of inherited wealth, even under the New Deal. At the time he could only provide a sampling of the economic and political patterns of those families, which, for one reason or another, had come under public scrutiny. In addition to the Sixty Families he dealt with in depth he was able to outline the probable holdings of a few hundred other families. Where are they today - those Sixty Families? What ravages of time, death and taxes worked on the mighty fortunes of yesteryear? Is the \\"Welfare State\\" robbing them of the opulence they knew in the good old days?...

The wild rush of action in this classic frontier adventure novel has made The Last of the Mohicans the most popular of James Fenimore Cooper s  Leatherstocking Tales.  Deep in the forests of upper New York State, the brave woodsman Hawkeye Natty Bumppo and his loyal Mohican friends Chingachgook and Uncas become embroiled in the bloody battles of the French and Indian War. The abduction of the beautiful Munro sisters by hostile savages; the treachery of the renegade brave Magua; the ambush of innocent settlers; and the thrilling events that lead to the final, tragic confrontation between rival war parties create an unforgettable, spine-tingling picture of life on the frontier. At the center of the novel is the infamous massacre of British troops and their families by Indian allies of the French at Fort William Henry in 1757. Around this historical event, Cooper builds a romantic fiction of captivity, sexuality, and heroism, in which the destiny of the Mohican Chingachgook and his son Uncas is inseparable from the lives of Alice and Cora Munro and of Hawkeye the frontier scout. And as the idyllic wilderness gives way to the forces of civilization, the novel presents a moving portrayal of a vanishing people and the end of its way of life in the great American forests.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FGk-swEACAAJ&dq=The+Last+of+the+Mohicans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Brown Box","description":"It's a big brown box!

In an unconventional and provocative argument, Calvin Goldscheider departs from the limiting vision of the demographic projections that have shaped predictions about the health and future of Jewish communities and asserts that \\"the quality of Jewish life has become the key to the future of Jewish communities.\\" Through the lens of individual biographies, Goldscheider shows how context shapes Jewish senses of the future and how conceptions of the future are shaped and altered by life experiences. Goldscheider?s distinctive comparative approach includes a critical review of population issues, a consideration of biographies as a basis for understanding Jewish values, and an analysis of biblical texts for studying contemporary values. He combines demographic and sociological analyses in historical and comparative perspectives to dispel the notion that quantitative issues are at the heart of the challenge of Jewish continuity in the future. Numbers are clearly the building blocks of community. But the interpretations of these demographic issues are often confusing and biased by ideological preconceptions. As a basis for studying the core themes of the Jewish future, ?hard facts? are less ?hard? and less \\"factual\\" than interpreters have made them out to be. Population projections are limited by the vision of those who prepare them. Goldscheider concludes that the futures of Jewish communities--in America, Europe, and Israel--are much more secure than has been presented in most scholarly and popular publications, and discussions about the Jewish future should shift to other patterns of distinctiveness. This book will appeal to the general Jewish reader as well as to social scientists and modern Jewish historians. It is appropriate for Jewish studies courses, particularly, but not exclusively, those focusing on Jews in the United States, the American Jewish community, and modern Jewish society, and in courses on ethnicity, multiculturalism, cultural diversity, and ethnic relations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZB39fEyq4QUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charlie Chan Is Dead: An Anthology of Contemporary Asian American Fiction","description":"Stories by and about Asian Americans published from 1933 to the present.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=egrmAAAAIAAJ&dq=Charlie+Chan+Is+Dead:+An+Anthology+of+Contemporary+Asian+American+Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transvestites and Transsexuals","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CDsbAAAAYAAJ&dq=Transvestites+and+Transsexuals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicken ten thousand","description":"Chicken Ten Thousand was just like nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine others hatched in the artificial hatcher until she escaped from the egg factory and discovered what the life of a hen should be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sM0lAAAAMAAJ&dq=Chicken+ten+thousand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue Ridge Billy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beyond The Checkride: What Your Flight Instructor Never Taught You","description":"THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE FOR NEW PILOTS--FULLY UPDATED!

Myroslaw Tataryn contributes to this effort with Augustine and Russian Orthodoxy, in which he presents Orthodox perceptions of the theology of St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430), one of the most significant figures in Western Christianity. Specifically, he analyzes the views of Russian Orthodox theologians working in Paris after the Bolshevik Revolution. This period was significant as it marked the violent end of the 19th century Russian religious renaissance, and the work of these Russian ZmigrZs in the years following WWI represents a landmark of Orthodox thinking in an atmosphere of true freedom. Understanding Augustine's reception by these Orthodox thinkers is important as it will help explain the deeper Orthodox mentality and help foster an appreciation of its distinctiveness vis-^-vis Western Christianity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k10QAQAAIAAJ&dq=Augustine+and+Russian+Orthodoxy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Palacio de Los Placeres Celestiales (Spanish Edition)","description":"Northern China, 1899.

Only those who cannot care for the consequences run the risk of the direct confrontation of the Holy. This book is a study of six men who ran this risk. Balancing the negative and positive points of view throughout these six essays, Jaroslav Pelikan has written a brilliant examination of the three questions: the True, the Good, and the Beautiful. With Kierkegaard and Paul, Dr. Pelikan looks into the relationship between the True and the Holy. With Dostoevsky and Luther, it is the Good and the Holy and with Nietzche and Bach, it is the Beautiful and the Holy. In the first two he draws on the whole history of Western thought. In the second two, he looks into the background of Christian morality, and in the last two, he reaches all the way back to the Greeks in his penetrating study of Western aesthetics. Philosophy, theology, ethics, and aesthetics - they are all here. Beyond them all, Dr. Pelikan shows how the Holy cannot be captured and held by any of them, although the attempt is frequently made. Rather the Holy must remain unqualified, transfiguring within itself the experience of the True, the Good, or the Beautiful.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9rJKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathematics on the Internet: A Resource for K-12 Teachers","description":"This fully revised edition provides examples of how to use the Internet to support learning mathematics in ways that reflect the NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics.

Jean Curthoys argues that the intellectual decline of university arts education and the loss of a deep moral commitment in feminism are related phenomena. The contradiction set up by the radical ideas of the 1960s, and institutionalised life of many of its protagonists in the academy has produced a special kind of intellectual distortion. This book criticises current trends in feminist theory from the perspective of forgotten and allegedly outdated feminist ideas. Jean Curthroys show that much contemporary feminist theory, like much of today's radical thought, is muddled. The 'forgotten' theory of Women's Liberation was, she argues, deeply oppositional and moral. The repression of this theory has led to distortions, most notabley in the preoccupation with binary oppositions. Jean Curthoys argues that where Women's Liberation was once radical, much of contemporary feminist thought hides behind obscurantism, and has become conservative and orthodox. These controversial ideas will be keenly debated by all those involved in womens's studies, feminist theory and moral philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=10OEAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead End","description":"Dead End in Norvelt is the winner of the 2012 Newbery Medal for the year's best contribution to children's literature and the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction!

Now Brenda E. Stevenson presents a reality far more gripping than popular legend, even as she challenges the conventional wisdom of academic historians. Life in Black and White provides a panoramic portrait of family and community life in and around Loudoun County, Virginia--weaving the fascinating personal stories of planters and slaves, of free blacks and poor-to-middling whites, into a powerful portrait of southern society from the mid-eighteenth century to the Civil War. Loudoun County and its vicinity encapsulated the full sweep of southern life. Here the region's most illustrious families--the Lees, Masons, Carters, Monroes, and Peytons--helped forge southern traditions and attitudes that became characteristic of the entire region while mingling with yeoman farmers of German, Scotch-Irish, and Irish descent, and free black families who lived alongside abolitionist Quakers and thousands of slaves. Stevenson brilliantly recounts their stories as she builds the complex picture of their intertwined lives, revealing how their combined histories guaranteed Loudon's role in important state, regional, and national events and controversies. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, for example, were hidden at a local plantation during the War of 1812. James Monroe wrote his famous \\"Doctrine\\" at his Loudon estate. The area also was the birthplace of celebrated fugitive slave Daniel Dangerfield, the home of John Janney, chairman of the Virginia secession convention, a center for Underground Railroad activities, and the location of John Brown's infamous 1859 raid at Harpers Ferry. In exploring the central role of the family, Brenda Stevenson offers a wealth of insight: we look into the lives of upper class women, who bore the oppressive weight of marriage and motherhood as practiced in the South and the equally burdensome roles of their husbands whose honor was tied to their ability to support and lead regardless of their personal preference; the yeoman farm family's struggle for respectability; and the marginal economic existence of free blacks and its undermining influence on their family life. Most important, Stevenson breaks new ground in her depiction of slave family life. Following the lead of historian Herbert Gutman, most scholars have accepted the idea that, like white, slaves embraced the nuclear family, both as a living reality and an ideal. Stevenson destroys this notion, showing that the harsh realities of slavery, even for those who belonged to such attentive masters as George Washington, allowed little possibility of a nuclear family. Far more important were extended kin networks and female headed households. Meticulously researched, insightful, and moving, Life in Black and White offers our most detailed portrait yet of the reality of southern life. It forever changes our understanding of family and race relations during the reign of the peculiar institution in the American South.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qZOvYiG4XwoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Global Electronic Commerce: Theory and Case Studies","description":"Provides an understanding of the technologies of electronic commerce.

Will Christians be living on earth when the antichrist is revealed? What does the Bible say about the rapture? In this most comprehensive analysis of the Bible's End Time Prophecies, Mr.Reid presents a remarkably insightful and straight-forward explanation of what is to come in the last days. Drawing heavily from both Old and New Testament prophecies, the author lays out the events of the last days, beginning with the 70th week of Daniel, and continuing through the advent of the New Jerusalem; addressing in detail the timing of the rapture with respect to the Great Tribulation and the Millennium. This book is unique in its handling of the book of Revelation. John's vision of the end times is divided into four individual sequences of events. While each of the four sequences cover different time spans, events within each of the sequences progress in chronological order. Therefore, upon harmonizing the four sequences, the end time calendar unfolds neatly and consistently. \\"Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh\\" (Matthew 24:44). Though no one knows the exact day and time, this book will help prepare you for what lies ahead in the last days.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WoLdoQEACAAJ&dq=The+Kingdom+of+Heaven+Is+at+Hand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treating Families and Children in the Child Protective System: Strategies for Systemic Advocacy and Family Healing (Family Therapy and Counseling)","description":"Crenshaw proposes a new integration of many of the existing theories and practices of family and child counselling with those of the welfare, child protection, and social services programs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3vqTAgAAQBAJ&dq=Treating+Families+and+Children+in+the+Child+Protective+System:+Strategies+for+Systemic+Advocacy+and+Family+Healing+(Family+Therapy+and+Counseling)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Cabbages to Kings","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fk1KZlD1nBsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Final Hour","description":"Michael Brown takes a look at the spate of apparitions of the Virgin Mary reported in the past decade in many quarters of the globe.

Neither vision is accurate. The millions of people with an intersex condition, or DSD (disorder of sex development), are men or women whose sex chromosomes, gonads, or sex anatomy do not fit clearly into the male/female binary norm. Until recently, intersex conditions were shrouded in shame and secrecy: many adults were unaware that they had been born with an intersex condition and those who did know were advised to hide the truth. Current medical protocols and societal treatment of people with an intersex condition are based upon false stereotypes about sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability, which create unique challenges to framing effective legal claims and building a strong cohesive movement. InIntersexuality and the Law, Julie A. Greenberg examines the role that legal institutions can play in protecting the rights of people with an intersex condition. She also explores the relationship between the intersex movement and other social justice movements that have effectively utilized legal strategies to challenge similar discriminatory practices. She discusses the feasibility of forming effective alliances and developing mutually beneficial legal arguments with feminists, LGBT organizations, and disability rights advocates to eradicate the discrimination suffered by these marginalized groups.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7ngTCgAAQBAJ&dq=Pregnancy+and+Power:+A+Short+History+of+Reproductive+Politics+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Utopia and Cosmopolis: Globalization in the Era of American Literary Realism (New Americanists)","description":"A discussion of Henry James and other utopian writers (Charlotte Perkins, Gilman, Edward Bellamy and William Dean Howells) and how the commercial and territorial expansion of the U.S. prompted these utopians to imagine a universal culture standing at the","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VceHJnSP9eUC&dq=Utopia+and+Cosmopolis:+Globalization+in+the+Era+of+American+Literary+Realism+(New+Americanists)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY OF MIDDLE EARTH","description":"The detailed, scholarly study of Tolkien's myth of Middle-earth compares the themes, places, beings, and things in his writings to the historic myths that have evolved in many cultures","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yXdbAAAAMAAJ&dq=MYTHOLOGY+OF+MIDDLE+EARTH&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","description":"Over 20 million copies sold!

He has inspired more stories, books and films than any other historical or legendary figure. But who was the real King Arthur? Here is the most comprehensive guide to the real Arthurian world and the legends that surround and often obscure it. Sifting fact from fancy, Mike Ashley reveals the originals not only of King Arthur but also of Merlin. Guinevere, Lancelot and the knights of the Round Table - as well as all the major Arthurian sites. He traces each of the legends as they developed and brilliantly shows how they were later used to inspire major works of art, poetry, fiction and film. There is clear evidence that. The Arthurian legends arose from the exploits of not just one man, but at least three originating in Wales, Scotland and Brittany The true historical Arthur really existed and is distantly related to the present royal family The real Arthur and the real Merlin never knew each other The real Lancelot was not British but was closer to a sixth-century asylum-seeker The Holy Grail legend probably grew out of a cosmic catastrophe that could have destroyed most of civilization","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XMjABAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Polish Armies (1) : 1569-1696 (Men-At-Arms Series, 184)","description":"Few people will realise that at one time the Polish state was one of Europe's great powers.

Sex, Time, and Power offers a tantalizing answer to an age-old question: Why did big-brained Homo sapiens suddenly emerge some 150,000 years ago? The key, according to Shlain, is female sexuality. Drawing on an awesome breadth of research, he shows how, long ago, the narrowness of the newly bipedal human female s pelvis and the increasing size of infants  heads precipitated a crisis for the species. Natural selection allowed for the adaptation of the human female to this environmental stress by reconfiguring her hormonal cycles, entraining them with the periodicity of the moon. The results, however, did much more than ensure our existence; they imbued women with the concept of time, and gave them control over sex a power that males sought to reclaim. And the possibility of achieving immortality through heirs drove men to construct patriarchal cultures that went on to dominate so much of human history. From the nature of courtship to the evolution of language, Shlain s brilliant and wide-ranging exploration stimulates new thinking about very old matters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lZ_u181EM_IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bible History: Containing the Most Remarkable Events of the Old and the New Testament","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PTQXAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cuisines of Southeast Asia: Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Burmese and More (California Culinary Academy Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LhAtFcYVttgC&dq=Cuisines+of+Southeast+Asia:+Thai,+Vietnamese,+Indonesian,+Burmese+and+More+(California+Culinary+Academy+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Born Beautiful: The African American Teenager's Complete Beauty Guide","description":"\\"When I read Born Beautiful, I thought ' finally, a beauty book that addresses the unique needs of black teens.'

El Nino s droughts and an insatiable ivory trade have cut African elephant numbers by a third in the last decade alone, and if elephants disappear entirely, Africa s entire ecosystem could collapse. But Botswana has become a safe haven, where one-sixth of the world s elephants now reside. Each year their numbers grow and an incredible migration takes place, which Wood witnesses and records. He teams up with local trackers to gain insight into how this iconic species survives, camps out in the wild, meets the people and tribes living on the migration s path, and joins the park rangers whose job it is to protect these land goliaths, equipped with his  good eye for detail and better ear for dialogue  (The Wall Street Journal).  Adventurer Wood followed elephants on a 650-mile migration across Botswana for a British television program. This fascinating companion volume to that series examines the past, present, and future of the African elephant.   Library Journal (starred review)  A smart, inviting portrait of elephants from a keen-eyed observer.   Kirkus Reviews  A rewarding look at the habits and habitats of the African elephant . . . Comprehensively yet accessibly conveying Wood s lifelong fascination with African elephants, his discussion will appeal to anyone keen on learning more about them.

But this notorious corner's 24-hour open-air drug market provides the economic fuel for a dying neighborhood. David Simon, an award-winning author and crime reporter, and Edward Burns, a 20-year veteran of the urban drug war, tell the chilling story of this desolate crossroad. Through the eyes of one broken family--two drug-addicted adults and their smart, vulnerable 15-year-old son, DeAndre McCollough, Simon and Burns examine the sinister realities of inner cities across the country and unflinchingly assess why law enforcement policies, moral crusades, and the welfare system have accomplished so little. This extraordinary book is a crucial look at the price of the drug culture and the poignant scenes of hope, caring, and love that astonishingly rise in the midst of a place America has abandoned.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pEp8ILjTcrcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of the Battle of Bull Run (Cornerstones of Freedom (Paperback))","description":"This book presents the events in the Civil War leading up to the first major battle, at Bull Run in 1861, and describes that clash and its aftermath.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KZxinHtrt2EC&dq=The+Story+of+the+Battle+of+Bull+Run+(Cornerstones+of+Freedom+(Paperback))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Twentieth Century Philosophy","description":"This collection features eleven original essays, divided into three thematic sections, which explore the work of Wilfrid Sellars in relation to other twentieth-century thinkers.

The book s final section extracts some of the most significant lessons Sellars s work has to offer for contemporary philosophy. These chapters address his views on inference, his views on truth and its connection to recent discussions about truth-relativism and truth-pluralism, his conception of self-knowledge, and his theory of perceptual experience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mbKoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Improving the reliability of function point measurement: An empirical study (CISR WP)","description":"This highly practical handbook is an exhaustive treatment of eddy covariance measurement that will be of keen interest to scientists who are not necessarily specialists in micrometeorology.

In Praying the Angelus, popular author and speaker Jared Dees reinvigorates the devotion, shares intimately from his own experience of it, shows us how to get started, and enriches the practice with original meditations to reflect on the words of both the Angelus and the Regina Caeli. Jared Dees was twenty-seven and in his fourth year of teaching religion in a Catholic school when he first experienced the Angelus.The creator of The Religion Teacher website allows the devotion to anchor his prayer life and challenge him to daily conversion of heart and will. Dees introduces the Angelus devotion and explores its rich history and significance for the Church. As spiritual companion and guide, he offers meditations on the words and images of both the Angelus and the Regina Caeli, which is prayed during the Easter season. We find lessons about the power of repetitive prayer, the humility of being a disciple, the importance of admitting time belongs to God, the wisdom of taking time with discernment, and the joy of resting in the Lord s presence. He shares personal stories of the life-change power of the Angelus and guides both newcomers and those already familiar with the prayer to contemplate the mysteries of salvation that lie at the heart of the devotion the Annunciation, Incarnation, and Resurrection. Named forthe opening words of the devotion's first prayer in Latin, \\"The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary,\\" the Angelus is typically prayed at 6:00 a.m., noon, and 6:00 p.m. each day. Likewise the Regina Caeli is named for the opening lines of its prayer, \\"Queen of heaven, rejoice, alleluia.\\" Praying the Angelus is supported by Dees s website, TheAngelusPrayer.com, where people can gather online to participate in and share this devotion with others.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uNMuvgAACAAJ&dq=Angelus!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diary of a Mad Mummy (Give Yourself Goosebumps #10)","description":"In San Francisco, an exhibit of Egyptian artifacts leads the reader to a weird diary and a spooky search for a real mummy who's on the run!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VULcHAAACAAJ&dq=Diary+of+a+Mad+Mummy+(Give+Yourself+Goosebumps&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Religion of Masonry","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SQkkAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Application Server for Distributed Platforms and z/OS&reg;: An Administrator's Guide","description":"A history of one of the most influential American companies of the last century. For decades, IBM shaped the way the world did business. IBM products were in every large organization, and IBM corporate culture established a management style that was imitated by companies around the globe. It was  Big Blue,   an icon. And yet over the years, IBM has gone through both failure and success, surviving flatlining revenue and forced reinvention. The company almost went out of business in the early 1990s, then came back strong with new business strategies and an emphasis on artificial intelligence. In this authoritative, monumental history, James Cortada tells the story of one of the most influential American companies of the last century. Cortada, a historian who worked at IBM for many years, describes IBM's technology breakthroughs, including the development of the punch card (used for automatic tabulation in the 1890 census), the calculation and printing of the first Social Security checks in the 1930s, the introduction of the PC to a mass audience in the 1980s, and the company's shift in focus from hardware to software. He discusses IBM's business culture and its orientation toward employees and customers; its global expansion; regulatory and legal issues, including antitrust litigation; and the track records of its CEOs. The secret to IBM's unequalled longevity in the information technology market, Cortada shows, is its capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and technologies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aLeHDwAAQBAJ&dq=IBM&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AAA 1999 INTERSTATE ROAD ATLAS (AAA Interstate Road Atlas)","description":"Updated with the latest highway changes, this guide includes same-page indexing, major city and metro area inserts, exit numbers, and area codes, and time zone maps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5iTiPQAACAAJ&dq=AAA+1999+INTERSTATE+ROAD+ATLAS+(AAA+Interstate+Road+Atlas)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Texas Cavalry Officer's Civil War: The Diary and Letters of James C.

Bates rode thousands of miles, fighting in the Indian Territory; at Elkhorn Tavern in Arkansas; at Corinth, Holly Springs, and Jackson, Mississippi; at Thompson's Station, Tennessee; and at the crossing of the Etowah River during Sherman's Atlanta campaign. In a detailed diary and dozens of long letters to his family, he recorded his impressions, confirming the image of the Texas cavalrymen as a hard-riding bunch -- long on aggression and short on discipline.

Women are coming together nationwide in consciousness-raising groups, sharing their knowledge and experiences with each other. A group of six women in Stentoria, California bond through such a group, and support each other as women in this new Movement are forming collectives; publishing their own books and periodicals; creating an exciting new genre of Womens Music; as well as starting their own bookstores, to make these new materials readily available to the community. New spiritual movementsfocused on the Divine Feminine principleare also beginning. Even some men are sympathetic and supportive of these ideals. But as the 1980s arrive, the situation changes: the backlash against the womens movement in politics and the media seemingly turns into a full-fledged war, specifically targeting the gains that women have achieved. Opposition from traditional religions hardens, and womens reproductive rights come under renewed attack; the Equal Rights Amendment fails, even as women themselves debate controversial questions: such as banning pornography, and how to view a rising Third Wave of the womens movement. Ominously, the threat of AIDS seemingly brings the era of sexual freedom to a close. The six women deal with all these issues, as well as personal challengesincluding balancing work and family responsibilities. As the new century begins, they reflect about what the womens movement ultimately accomplished. In a world now characterized by growing economic inequality, increasing low self-esteem for some women (exemplified by cosmetic surgery and extreme makeovers), legalized same-sex marriage, and media attention to Transgender issues, this book may help you to appreciate not only how far weve come, but how far we have yet to go.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vfAzCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beethoven in Denver and Other Poems","description":"In Beethoven in Denver and Other Poems, Burton Raffel (bestselling translator of Beowulf) brings a lifetime of artistry to an enchanting and visionary story, followed by a sequence of jewel-like lyrics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y-uMzgEACAAJ&dq=Beethoven+in+Denver+and+Other+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An American Adventure in Bookburning: In the Style of 1918","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ahPyPQAACAAJ&dq=An+American+Adventure+in+Bookburning:+In+the+Style+of+1918&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caddo Indians: Where We Come From","description":"This narrative history of the Caddo Indians creates a vivid picture of daily life in the Caddo Nation.

Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union's secret military-industrial complex began in 1926 and lasted long after the Capitulation. Newly declassified historical records point to the Soviet Union's double-crossing its Western Allies. The Communists long range plans with the Nazis to overthrow democracies from within through tick borne diseases of the nervous system and doping the belligerents intensified during the Cold War. After all, we cannot run a democracy on drug addicts. As our US Health Department remained silent for over half a century on the advancement of these tick borne plagues, the American Intelligence Community opened the doors to Nazi Paperclip scientists and Dragon Returnees \\"from Russia With Love\\" to fight the Cold War, totally compromising our national security. By 1951, Congress passed the Trade Agreements Extension Act banning shipments of Russian and Chinese furs; too little, too late. Here lies the explanation for an onslaught of global drug trafficking from the Golden Triangle to the ODESSA drug cartel. We seek a witness to the Soviet Union's military/industrial collaboration with Nazis before, during and after WWII. Who was I.G. Farben chemist, Dr. Henry Tolkmith? Was his identity switched with the infamous Auschwitz Angel of Death, Dr. Josef Mengele, both an expert in poison gas and tick borne plagues, his expertise highly coveted both East and West?

There seems to be nothing for criticism to get its teeth into. Everything is plain sailing. There is no shell to crack, no secret to explore, no difficulty of language, no impenetrable thought, no interplay of images to be unraveled. In whatever direction the critic looks, whether at the technique, the ideas, the images of the psychological sphere, there is nothing to be done, or at any rate nothing worth doing.

Despite their close connections, however, scholars tend to treat them separately. Whereas the study of Western mysticism enjoys a long and established history, Western esotericism is a young field.

The volume demonstrates that the roots of esotericism almost always lead back to mystical traditions, while the work of mystics was bound up with esoteric or occult preoccupations. It also shows why mysticism and esotericism must be examined together if either is to be understood fully. Including contributions by leading scholars, this volume features essays on such topics as alchemy, astrology, magic, Neoplatonism, Kabbalism, Renaissance Hermetism, Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, numerology, Christian theosophy, spiritualism, and much more.

Los Angeles Times reporter Eve Diamond usually works out of the paper's San Gabriel Valley bureau, but she's taking a weekend shift downtown when a distraught Vincent Chevalier breaks through security and demands her help. His fifteen-year-old daughter, Isabel, is missing, and the cops won't go looking for her until forty-eight hours have passed. The man thinks he knows where she might be -- with some runaways in a dismal squat in East Hollywood. He wants Eve as his witness when he enters the squat and tries to bring Isabel home. Eve senses a possible story: Why would a privileged young girl from Pasadena spend time with the down-and-outs in East Hollywood? But there will be no interview with Isabel. Isabel is dead, her body wrapped in a dirty futon and abandoned in a derelict basement. Eve's questions have only begun. What brought the blond-haired teenager to such a tragic, early demise? Did a man named Finch, who's had past arrests for drugs, burglary, and theft, have something to do with Isabel's murder? What about her father? There's something unsettling about him. And what was Isabel's relationship with Paolo Langdon, her schoolmate and the son of a socialite hostess and a prominent politician? Even as Eve must fight against powerful forces that want her off the story, she finds herself emotionally drawn to the brooding scion of a Mexican music-promotion titan. It's dangerous to mix professional with personal, but Silvio Aguilar is hard to resist. And in his world, in the little sugar skull confections that commemorate the Mexican Day of the Dead, Eve may find some clue to a killer. Written with the authenticity and bold strokes that Denise Hamilton has made her own, Sugar Skull is much more than a triumphant crime novel -- it's a dazzling portrait of a city full of diversity. Rich with nuance and insight, this is compelling, illuminating crime writing at its best.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lfvXaeAHeSAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","description":"\\"Lectures ... given at Harvard University in the first half of the academic year 1936-37\\"--Foreword.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d2O1VkUpsCgC&dq=The+unity+of+philosophical+experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writers in Training","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KhCcPAAACAAJ&dq=Writers+in+Training&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masters Of The Universe Skeletor's Flower Of Power","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BthKxrcwadEC&dq=Masters+Of+The+Universe+Skeletor%27s+Flower+Of+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aerosphere 1939.

An inherited Nantucket restaurant. One year before they can sell. Mandy, Emma and Jill are as close as three sisters who live hundreds of miles apart can be. They grew up together on Nantucket, but Mandy is the only one that stayed. Jill lives a glamorous life in Manhattan as a co-owner of a successful executive search firm. Never married, she is in her mid-thirties and lives in a stunning, corner condo with breathtaking views of the city and Hudson river. Everyone thinks there's something going on with her partner, Billy, because as a workaholic, she spends more time with him than anyone else. But there's never been anything but friendship between them and Billy loves being a bachelor in NYC. Emma lives in Arizona and is an elementary school teacher and an aspiring photographer. She met her college professor husband, Peter, in grad school and they've been married for about fifteen years. In recent years, she's noticed that Peter has grown distant. But when he shares a surprising secret, she doesn't see it coming and her world is turned upside down. Mandy followed her high school boyfriend, Cory to Boston College, and right after graduation, they married and settled in Dover, just outside of Boston. Cory joined a successful hedge fund, while Mandy took a job at a downtown financial services firm as an administrative assistant. She quit a year later, when Blake, the first baby came. Two years later, when Brooke was born, Cory left to open a competing Hedge Fund and they moved home to Nantucket. Now that the children are older, Mandy has more free time and is eager to do more than just volunteer with local charity events. But Cory doesn't want her to work. He thinks it doesn't reflect well on him and appearances are everything to Cory. Though when Mandy finds something unusual in his gym bag, she begins to question what is really going on. When their beloved grandmother, Rose Ferguson passes peacefully in her sleep a week before her ninety-ninth birthday she leaves them quite a surprise. In addition to her Nantucket home, they learned that she was the silent owner of Mimi's Place, one of Nantucket's most popular year-round restaurants. There is of course, a catch--she left the restaurant equally to Mandy, Emma, and Jill--and also to Paul, the chef for the past twelve years. And before they can sell, all three girls need to work at the restaurant for a period of one year--or else their shares will go to Paul--who was also Emma's first love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u2gHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sweet Life: Erotic Fantasies for Couples","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"History, Religion, and Antisemitism (Centennial Book)","description":"Gavin I. Langmuir's work on the formation and nature of antisemitism has earned him an international reputation. In History, Religion, and Antisemitism he bravely confronts the problems that arise when historians have to describe and explain religious phenomena, as any historian of antisemitism must. How, and to what extent, can the historian be objective? Is it possible to discuss Christian attitudes toward Jews, for example, without adopting the historical explanations of those whose thoughts and actions one is discussing? What, exactly, does the historian mean by \\"religion\\" or \\"religious\\"? Langmuir's original and stimulating responses to these questions reflect his inquiry into the approaches of anthropology, sociology, and psychology and into recent empirical research on the functioning of the mind and the nature of thought. His distinction between religiosity, a property of individuals, and religion, a social phenomenon, allows him to place unusual emphasis on the role of religious doubts and tensions and the irrationality they can produce. Defining antisemitism as irrational beliefs about Jews, he distinguishes Christian anti-Judaism from Christian antisemitism, demonstrates that antisemitism emerged in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries because of rising Christian doubts, and sketches how the revolutionary changes in religion and mentality in the modern period brought new faiths, new kinds of religious doubt, and a deadlier expression of antisemitism. Although he developed it in dealing with the difficult question of antisemitism, Langmuir's approach to religious history is important for historians in all areas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F6MwDwAAQBAJ&dq=History,+Religion,+and+Antisemitism+(Centennial+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Coffee House Manual","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wv5DGQAACAAJ&dq=A+Coffee+House+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WHAT DO YOU DO DEAR LB","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aEpPAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eureka!: Scientific Breakthroughs that Changed the World","description":"The common language of genius: Eureka!

Its goal is, thus, to remove the last major obstacle to a unified scientific account of the natural world. In this title, originally published in 1991, Alan Garnham provides an invaluable introduction to this exciting new development in the study of mind. The Mind in Action focuses on the development of a systematic explanation of cognition, rather than on facts about the way we perceive things, remember them, talk about them, think about them, and interact with them. The author looks in detail at the nature of scientific explanations, the reasons for developing them, and the way they are assessed. He describes the work carried out by cognitive scientists and considers the questions that motivate it. He introduces the computational metaphor for the mind, and explains how flushing out the metaphor might lead to an integrated scientific account of mental phenomena. Designed primarily for people about to embark on courses in cognitive science and related disciplines, The Mind in Action captures the liveliness and excitement of debates about the mind. It is readily accessible to anyone with an interest in how the mind works, avoiding technical terms where possible and explaining them fully where they are necessary.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PkhnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At the Sign of the Golden Anchor;","description":"As New Englanders endure embargo acts, Judy Lane, a quickwitted, young daughter of an innkeeper in Annisquam, Massachusetts, saves her brother's ship from destruction by the British during the War of 1812 with her courage and courtesy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=noTctgAACAAJ&dq=At+the+Sign+of+the+Golden+Anchor%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Epilepsy: Models, Mechanisms and Concepts","description":"Advances in epilepsy research are occurring at a rapid rate, resulting in a bewildering wealth of data.

Written by prominent researchers in the field, it describes and discusses the relevant models used to address critical questions, and reviews the most up-to-date issues. Chapters focus on the pathways and mechanisms through which seizure activity is initiated and spread, in both normal and abnormal brain tissues, and discuss the special properties of epileptogenesis in the immature brain. In a field in which rapid advances lead to constant update of empirical data, this book takes a conceptual approach to the subject and provides a solid framework within which to understand the emerging issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=euUrpwAACAAJ&dq=Epilepsy:+Models,+Mechanisms+and+Concepts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Nose Is Running","description":"After her mother says that her nose is running, a little girl who needs to sneeze tries to imagine where she might find it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u3MCAAAACAAJ&dq=My+Nose+Is+Running&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battery Park City: Politics and Planning on the New York Waterfront (Cities & Regions Series, Vol 1)","description":"Battery Park City in Manhattan has been hailed as a triumph of urban design, and is considered to be one of the success stories of American urban redevelopment planning. The flood of praise for its design, however, can obscure the many lessons from the long struggle to develop the project. Nothing was built on the site for more than a decade after the first master plan was approved, and the redevelopment agency flirted with bankruptcy in 1979. Taking a practice-oriented approach, the book examines the role of planning and development agencies in implementing urban waterfront redevelopment. It focuses upon the experience of the central actor - the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) - and includes personal interviews with executives of the BPCA, former New York mayors John Lindsay and Ed Koch, key public officials, planners, and developers. Describing the political, financial, planning, and implementation issues faced by public agencies and private developers from 1962 to 1993, it is both a case study and history of one of the most ambitious examples of urban waterfront redevelopment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4SY5KxTWrSIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picturing Men: A Century of Male Relationships in Everyday American Photography","description":"These photographs, spanning from before the Civil War to the 1950s, reveal a lost world.

Students dive in to intensive communicative practice, building confidence in their ability to interact in a meaningful way in Spanish with access to a wealth of tools to support and guide their progress, including video chat, interactive online scenarios, and an adaptive diagnostic program. In addition, students are able to create their own sense of community, resulting in a unique individual experience that will evolve organically with each student, sparking their natural curiosity about their world. Tu mundo employs a communicative methodology that focuses on developing all four skills, supported by the best digital learning platform available today: Connect Spanish. Because Tu mundo was designed with today s students in mind, students are more readily engaged with the content, thanks to their avid use of web-based tools, their innate interest the cultures of other countries, and their preference for visual presentations and quick access to information. Tu mundo reflects the world in which our students live; where online learning, social networking, texting, instant messaging, mobile devices, tablets, online gaming, and virtual scenarios are an integral part of daily life. What are the pillars of Tu mundo? Our extensive and ongoing research in the Intro Spanish course has led to the creation of Tu mundo, with a strong emphasis on the 5 C s: Communication, Culture, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities. Tu mundo delivers content in a variety of ways in order to ensure consistent course outcomes across all course formats. 1.Improved communication performance & skills: By jumping directly into communicative practice at the beginning of every chapter, students are encouraged to immerse themselves in the experience of active learning, whether in a face-to-face or online classroom. Grammar is presented at the end of each chapter, allowing students to study at home and work through the exercises in Connect Spanish for automatic feedback, coming to class ready to engage in discussion. This emphasis on communication in the classroom makes Tu mundo the most effective communicative program on the market. No other program commits to this methodology like Tu mundo. 2.Creating consistent learning outcomes: Tu mundo offers a powerful adaptive learning system called LearnSmart that allows students to identify grammatical structures and vocabulary words not yet mastered and to receive an individualized study program for mastering them. Students of all experience levels will benefit from using LearnSmart, which includes built-in reporting and a competitive scoreboard. Connect Spanish Voice Board and Blackboard Instant Messenger (BbIM), both powered by Wimba, ensure that students are getting ample practice time no matter where their classes take place. 3. Building community and connections between students: Creating a sense of community in the face-to-face or virtual classroom is a huge part of language learning and something that Tu mundo does implicitly. Whether students collaborate in a physical classroom or in Connect Spanish, they are provided with opportunities to engage in meaningful conversations and collaborative task-based activities. The Amigos sin fronteras, a cast of young Hispanic students that share common interests, are featured throughout the entire program and showcased in the As  somos video segments. Through the Amigos sin fronteras, students are exposed to a friendly model on how to apply what they are learning to another friendly group of students, i.e. their own class. In addition, Tu mundo presents an interactive online environment that applies engaging content and task-based scenarios that enable you to practicing your language skills in a fun, immersive way. Thus, students can practice Spanish in a context that is not only fun but extremely motivating. 4.More Culture and Comparisons coverage: Culture is so often left behind so Tu mundo offers it throughout the program. Each chapter features a country of focus which doubles as the home country of one of the fifteen amigos. Along with in-chapter cultural sections, every chapter of Tu mundo features a second video segment called Mi pa s (within Connect), narrated by the amigos themselves, as they share information about their native countries. This window into the lives of the amigos provides a point of comparison for you to describe your own life. The Mundo interactivo scenarios represent a variety of cultural contexts in which you can interact with language and culture in a way that is meaningful to you.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BhBArgEACAAJ&dq=Workbook/Lab+Manual+for+Asi+es,+4th&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abigail","description":"From the author of The Door, a beloved coming-of-age tale set in WWII-era Hungary. Abigail, the story of a headstrong teenager growing up during World War II, is the most beloved of Magda Szab  s books in her native Hungary. Gina is the only child of a general, a widower who has long been happy to spoil his bright and willful daughter. Gina is devastated when the general tells her that he must go away on a mission and that he will be sending her to boarding school in the country. She is even more aghast at the grim religious institution to which she soon finds herself consigned. She fights with her fellow students, she rebels against her teachers, finds herself completely ostracized, and runs away. Caught and brought back, there is nothing for Gina to do except entrust her fate to the legendary Abigail, as the classical statue of a woman with an urn that stands on the school s grounds has come to be called. If you re in trouble, it s said, leave a message with Abigail and help will be on the way. And for Gina, who is in much deeper trouble than she could possibly suspect, a life-changing adventure is only beginning. There is something of Jane Austen in this story of the deceptiveness of appearances; fans of J.K. Rowling are sure to enjoy Szab  s picture of irreverent students, eccentric teachers, and boarding-school life.

Updated with new research and interviews, unpublished photographs, and thoughtful comments from Pete Seeger himself, this is an inside history of the man Carl Sandburg called  America s Tuning Fork.  In the only biography on Seeger, David Dunaway parts the curtains on his life. Who is this rail-thin, eighty-eight-year-old with the five-string banjo, whose performances have touched millions of people for more than seven decades? Bob Dylan called him a saint. Joan Baez said,  We all owe our careers to him.  But Seeger s considerable musical achievements were overshadowed by political controversy when he became perhaps the most blacklisted performer in American history. He was investigated for sedition, harassed by the FBI and the CIA, picketed, and literally stoned by conservative groups. Still, he sang. Today, Seeger remains an icon of conscience and culture, and his classic antiwar songs, sung by Bruce Springsteen and millions of others, live again in the movement against foreign wars. His life holds lessons for surviving repressive times and for turning to music to change the world.  This biography is a beauty. It captures not only the life of the bard but the world of which he sings.  Studs Terkel  A fine and meticulous biography . . . Dunaway has taken [Seeger s] materials and woven them into a detailed, interesting, and well-written narrative of a most fascinating life.  American Music  An extraordinary tale of an extraordinary man [that] will intrigue not only his legions of followers but everyone interested in one man s battles and victories.

Yes, Buddha can teach you to dance Tango through Zen. You might ask,  How does Tango have anything to do with Zen?  TangoZen is an innovative yet natural way of meditating while dancing Tango. Referring to striking similarities between the two, this book will introduce methods through which Tango dancers and non-dancers can practice TangoZen to experience and enjoy the wonderful benefits, which both Tango and Zen have to offer. Everybody knows meditation is a good thing. For example, Zen meditation, if practiced properly, can create balance, calmness, groundedness, centering, and harmony in mind and body. However, it is difficult to meditate for many reasons. Meditation is mainly practiced while sitting with legs crossed to support and ground one s body. Unfortunately this sitting posture can create uncomfortable feelings and even pains before you benefit from the meditation practice. In addition, despite the importance of practicing meditation regularly, it can be difficult to stick to it with regularity due to the hectic life style we live every day. Can one meditate while moving around instead of sitting down? Although it appears to be sedate and passive, Zen meditation can also be practiced in more active ways than the sitting posture. For example, walking meditation has been practiced among Buddhists since the Buddha himself practiced it. Other forms of Zen meditation in motion can also be found in sports and performing arts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b0jSAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maigret travels south","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GW2SnQEACAAJ&dq=Maigret+travels+south&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Gentlemen prefer blondes;\\": A play in three acts,","description":"Lorelei Lee is just a little girl from Little Rock who takes the world by storm to teach its gentlemen that \\"kissing your hand may make you feel very very good but a diamond and sapphire bracelet lasts forever.\\" Anita Loos first published the diaries of the gold-digging blonde in 1925, forging a new archetype for the modern world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JDGXFVpWD80C&dq=%22Gentlemen+prefer+blondes%3B%22:+A+play+in+three+acts,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mary Emmerling's Romantic Country: Style That's Straight from the Heart","description":"In \\"Romantic Country,\\" Mary Ellisor Emmerling brings a fresh spirit of youthful elegance to her country roots as she showcases 25 beautiful houses and offers her unique mix of ideas and inspiration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OLW_7pVKWYQC&dq=Mary+Emmerling%27s+Romantic+Country:+Style+That%27s+Straight+from+the+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yoga Journal 2002 Calendar","description":"For more than 30 years, Yoga Journal has been helping readers achieve the balance and well-being they seek in their everyday lives.

Somewhere between her thoughts and her deeds the reader stands witness to the knowledge that doing justice to one's own experience entails the most grotesque transfigurations. Delta Tells, the eloquent protagonist of Singer's novel, testifies to this belief in a riveting succession of scenes which pit her against the intimidations of an intractable physical world: the sexual indifference of her husband, the physical jealousies and recalcitrant organs of the women to whom she ministers as midwife, the gravity of her own troubled motherhood, and the authorities who suspect her of committing an unimaginable crime against Nature. Delta's telling of this crime is meant to be the unravelling of anyone who might believe it. And so the husband's desperation to test the truthfulness of his wife's vengeful tale begins to loom as a portentous question about how we gauge the limits of our experience - sexual, intellectual, emotional - or whether any such limits apply.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_hpvmMcE_cC&dq=Memory+Wax&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lives Of A Bengal Lancer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DP5yPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Lives+Of+A+Bengal+Lancer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No coffin for the corpse (Collier mystery)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ioqmtAEACAAJ&dq=No+coffin+for+the+corpse+(Collier+mystery)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stinky the Bulldog","description":"Lovable Stinky moves to a new neighborhood and can't wait to begin making new friends, and is flabbergasted when potential buddies can't seem to get past his name.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ye2UAAAAQBAJ&dq=Stinky+the+Bulldog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ethical Issues in Business: A Philosophical Approach (6th Edition)","description":"The core of this text comprises chapters on all the key issues of business in Canada today.

Early rumblings of the Civil Rights Movement shook many towns across the south in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and in Separate Fountains, author Patti Wilson Byars shows that her hometown of Jonesboro, Georgia was not excluded. Jonesboro reflected the typical sleepy, little southern town of that era -- where bigotry, along with the magnolias, was in full bloom. Georgia's red clay roads led into Jonesboro where soda fountains enticed children out of the hot sun. But, that same red clay also stained neighbors' shoes that stuck out from underneath white robes. The dichotomy of the ideal and the unjust could be found in picturesque Jonesboro -- as it could in most any other Southern town. In Separate Fountains, twelve year old Katie Jane Taylor questions the social issues of the south of the 1940s and 1950s as her beloved black housekeeper, Ardella, has to drink from a water fountain marked \\"COLORED\\" and has to ride behind the white line on the Greyhound bus to Atlanta. Katie Jane also challenges her father to stand up against the Ku Klux Klan and how they control the political and social climate of the town. One day while in the drugstore, Katie Jane and her six year old brother, Josh, eavesdrop on a conversation between Ku Klux Klan members and learn that Ardella's brother is the Klan's next victim. Separate Fountains is history not found in textbooks. It's history every American citizen needs to know -- as our nation continues to fight against racial and ethnic discrimination. SEPARATE FOUNTAINS stresses tolerance for others -- no matter race or creed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W5bksgEACAAJ&dq=SEPARATE+FOUNTAINS.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Family","description":"There are so many different types of families, and THE FAMILY BOOK celebrates them all in a funny, silly, and reassuring way.

Sewage generated by a population of over two million Londoners was pouring into the river and was being carried to and fro by the tides. The Times called the crisis \\"The Great Stink\\". Parliament had to act - drastic measures were required to clean the Thames and to improve London's primitive system of sanitation. The great engineer entrusted by Parliament with this enormous task was Sir Joseph Bazalgette, and this book is a fascinating account of his life and work. Bazalgette's response to the challenge was to conceive and build the system of intercepting sewers, pumping stations and treatment works that serves London to this day. In the process he cleansed the River Thames of the capital's sewage and helped to banish cholera, which in the mid-nineteenth century carried off over 40,000 Londoners. But this successful scheme was only one element in Bazalgette's wider contribution to the development of the Victorian capital. He also reclaimed land from the Thames to construct the Victoria, Albert and Chelsea Embankments, built bridges across the Thames at Putney, Battersea and Hammersmith, and created many notable new thoroughfares including Charing Cross Road, Northumberland Avenue and Shaftesbury Avenue. Stephen Halliday's enthralling social and personal history gives a vivid insight into Bazalgette's achievements and the era in which he worked and lived. The author traces the origins of Bazalgette's family in revolutionary France, the confusing sanitation system that he inherited from medieval and Tudor times and his heroic battle with politicians, bureaucrats and huge engineering problems to transform the face and health of the world's largest city.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OvwSDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of Celebrity Murder: Murder Played Out in the Spotlight of Maximum Publicity","description":"A selection of real-life celebrity murder cases includes details of the killings of Gianni Versace, John Lennon, Marvin Gaye, and Patrizia Gucci as well as twenty-one other famous and not-so-famous cases.

Tougias comes a new, heart-stopping true-life tale of maritime disaster, his most thrilling and amazing story yet. In May 2005, Tom Tighe, captain of a forty-five-foot-long sailboat named the Almeisan, and his first mate, Loch Reidy, welcomed three new crewmembers for a five-day voyage from Connecticut across the blue waters of the Gulf Stream to sun-drenched Bermuda. The new crew included forty-six-year-old Kathy Gilchrist, seventy-year-old Ron Burd, and thirty-four-year-old Chris Ferrer. Although Tighe had made the trip forty-eight times, with Reidy accompanying him on twenty of those voyages, the rest of the crew had joined to learn more about offshore sailing. Four days into the voyage, an enormous storm struck, sweeping two of the crew into the towering sea. The remaining crewmembers managed to stay aboard the vessel as it was slowly torn apart by the rampaging ocean. Overboard! follows the simultaneous desperate struggles of both those still on the boat and those fighting for their lives in the sea. The Coast Guard, alerted to the Almeisan s distress, rushed to the storm-tossed scene. Their ensuing search and rescue mission proved so spectacularly difficult and dangerous that it was later selected from among thousands of incidents as the Guard s search and rescue case of the year. Highly trained helicopter pilots and rescue swimmers alike found themselves in almost as much trouble as those trapped by the ferocious ocean. By turns tragic, thrilling, and deeply inspiring, Overboard! is a riveting, fast-paced story of death and survival at sea amazing, unforgettable, and all true.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZjRBJf0V9UAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clare and Francis","description":"Francis (c. 1182-1226) and Clare (c. 1193-1254) together shaped the spirituality of early 13th-century Europe.

The Guardian said of Shishkin's writing: \\"richly textured and innovative. . . arguably Russia's greatest living novelist.\\" The Wall Street Journal raved that \\"Shishkin has created a bewitching potion of reality and fantasy, of history and fable, and of lonely need and joyful consolation. An exquisite novel... His sovereignty is over the invisible and the timeless. Mr. Shishkin traces this sad story with great beauty and finesse.\\" In The Light and the Dark Shishkin has created an evocative love story of two young lovers, Vladimir, a solider flighting the Boxer Rebellion, and Alexandra. Known fondly to each other as Vovka and Sashka, the two young lovers sustain their love by writing passionate letters to each other. But as their correspondence continues, it becomes clear that the couple's separation is chronological as well as geographical--that their extraordinary romance is actually created out of, as well as kept alive by, their yearning epistolary exchange, which defies not only space but time. With this contrapuntal literary testament to the delirious, transcendent power of love, Mikhail Shishkin--the most celebrated Russian author of his generation--has created a masterpiece of modern fiction.

Leaving the railway, we took a motor and pressed on over the solidly paved roads of France, which are now pulsing arteries of traffic, crowded with trains of motor transports pouring in their steady stream of supplies for the men and munitions for the guns. Now we turn out for the rumbling tank-like caterpillars, which slowly creep forward, drawing the big guns up to the front; then we pass a light field-battery. Next comes a battalion of Tommies swinging down the road, loaded like Christmas trees with their cumbrous kits, sweating, singing, whistling, as they march by with dogged cheer toward the trenches. We have crossed the Somme with its memories of blood, on across northern France, and now we have passed the Belgian frontier and are in the historic fields of Flanders, where the creaking windmills are still grinding the peasants' corn, and the little church spires stand guard over the sleeping villages. A turn of the road brings us close within sound of the guns, which by night are heard far across France and along the coasts of England. Soon we enter villages, which lie within range of the enemy's \\"heavies,\\" with their shattered window glass, torn roofs, ruined houses, tottering churches, and deep shell holes in the streets. Now we are in the danger zone and have to put on our shrapnel-proof steel helmets, and box respirators, to be ready for a possible attack of poison gas. Another turn in the road, and the great battle field rises in grim reality before us. Far to the left stands the terrible Ypres salient, so long swept by the tide of war, and away to the right are the blasted woods of \\"Plug Street.\\" Right before us rises the historic ridge of Messines, won at such cost during the summer. We are standing now at the foot of the low ridge where the British trenches were so long held under the merciless fire of the enemy. From here to the top of the ridge the ground has been fought over, inch by inch and foot by foot. It is blasted and blackened, deep seamed by shot and shell. The trees stand on the bare ridge, stiff and stark, charred and leafless, like lonely sentinels of the dead. The ground, without a blade of grass left, is torn and tossed as by earthquake and volcano. Trenches have been blown into shapeless heaps of debris. Deep shell holes and mine craters mark the advance of death. Small villages are left without one stone or brick upon another, mere formless heaps, ground almost to dust. Deserted in wild confusion, half buried in the churned mud, on every hand are heaps of unused ammunition, bombs, gas shells, and infernal machines wrecked or hurriedly left in the enemy's flight. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public.

This book looks in detail at the military operations that occurred in Louisiana most of them minor skirmishes, but some of them battles and campaigns of major importance. The Civil War in Louisiana begins with the first talk of secession in the state and ends with the last tragic days of the war. John D. Winters describes with great fervor and detail such events as the fall of Confederate New Orleans and the burning of Alexandria. In addition to military action, Winters discusses the political, economic, and social aspects of the war in Louisiana.

This intellectual history of medieval and modern Jewish attitudes toward art and representation overturns the modern assumption of Jewish iconophobia that denies to Jewish culture a visual dimension. Kalman Bland synthesizes evidence from medieval Jewish philosophy, mysticism, poetry, biblical commentaries, travelogues, and law, concluding that premodern Jewish intellectuals held a positive, liberal understanding of the Second Commandment and did, in fact, articulate a certain Jewish aesthetic. He draws on this insight to consider modern ideas of Jewish art, revealing how they are inextricably linked to diverse notions about modern Jewish identity that are themselves entwined with arguments over Zionism, integration, and anti-Semitism. Through its use of the past to illuminate the present and its analysis of how the present informs our readings of the past, this book establishes a new assessment of Jewish aesthetic theory rooted in historical analysis. Authoritative and original in its identification of authentic Jewish traditions of painting, sculpture, and architecture, this volume will ripple the waters of several disciplines, including Jewish studies, art history, medieval and modern history, and philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gY125uCDkp8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spam: The Cookbook","description":"In 1937, the first SPAM? product came off the production line.

Unfortunately, much of it is misleading or downright false information. Now, the man at the center of the controversy tells his side of the story for the very first time. In The Contractor: How I Landed in a Pakistani Prison and Ignited a Diplomatic Crisis, Davis offers an up-close and personal look at the 2011 incident in Lahore, Pakistan, that led to his imprisonment and the events that took place as diplomats on both sides of the bargaining table scrambled to get him out. How did a routine drive turn into front-page news? Davis dissects the incident before taking readers on the same journey he endured while trapped in the Kafkaesque Pakistani legal system. As a veteran security contractor, Davis had come to terms with the prospect of dying long before the January 27, 2011 shooting, but nothing could prepare him for being a political pawn in a game with the highest stakes imaginable. An eye-opening memoir, The Contractor takes the veil off Raymond Davis's story and offers a sober reflection on the true cost of the War on Terror.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FCbZDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CIO Wisdom II: More Best Practices","description":"Presents solutions for managing both the internal and external forces impacting IT, and for dealing with more than 20 of your toughest issues - business, technical, and human.

Style, she maintains, reflects an era's mood, altering only with changes in attitude and taste. Fashion, conversely, exists only to perpetuate sales. Hawes denounces the industry's predatory practices, advising readers to reject ever-changing fads in favor of comfortable, durable, flattering attire.

Following a childhood spent in Bologna, and an adulthood in the bosom of an Italian family in New York, Biba Caggiano found herself in Sacramento, California, in 1968, unable to find the food that was familiar to her palate--and essential to her heritage. Working from memory, Biba recalled her roots and recreated authentic Italian flavor in this most American of cities, and quickly became a local legend for her cooking classes and, ultimately for her famously delicious restaurant, Biba. Biba's fantastic, simple dishes represent what the Italians call la buona cucina casalinga--more commonly known as \\"good home cooking\\"--and are now available to all in From Biba's Italian Kitchen. Biba's foolproof method relies on the senses, not on the repetition of rigid recipes. Do the tomatoes at the market look particularly fresh? Then it's time to whip up a quick puttanesca sauce to top practically any pasta or meat dish. Are the porcini mushrooms especially eye-catching today? A tangy and woodsy sauce of porcini and tomatoes for. delicate spinach-ricotta gnocchi is just minutes away. Did a batch of walnuts just arrive from your aunt out West? Walnut pesto is the only proper reply. Biba trusts her (and your)impulses, and encourages a casual but committed approach to food, two hallmarks of la dolce vita, the sweet life that From Biba's Italian Kitchen promotes on every page. Biba starts with a staple of Italian cooking: the elegant, integral antipasti. Simple or sophisticated antipasti show the instruments of the Italian symphony tuning up before the first act. Gorgeous red bell peppers nestle with hunks of Italian bread and are topped by verdant parsley to make luscious bruschetta, plump little artichokes nuzzle with sun-dried tomatoes for sun-drenched carciofini all'olio; and fresh eggs with earthy potatoes and onions blend to create rustic fritatta di patate e cipolle. The harmony continues into the main dishes, a cavalcade of pasta, meat, and fish dishes that catch attention without disrupting a schedule. Prepare in haste and enjoy in leisure such delicacies as seafood cannelloni, delectably bitter pasta with broccoli rabe, succulent osso buco, veal shank with tomatoes and peas, or classic tagliatelle with sweet prosciutto and fresh tomatoes. A chapter on vegetable side dishes (whether grilled, saut ed, baked, stuffed, roasted, braised, or steamed) shows how primizie--the first, freshest produce of the season--bring the vegetable garden to the urban table. Complete sections on pizza (of course!),risotti, the light yet hearty dishes, made from Italian arborio rice, and polenta, the scrumptious cornmeal preparation that is the perfect foil to vegetable and meat alike, round out Biba's memorable tavola calda. And dessert!Italian desserts! Juicy fig and jam tart, sinful mascarpone-zabaglione mousse, juicy strawberries in red wine, and apple and amaretti cake serve as an elegant, graceful cadenza to the mellifluous meals in From Biba's Italian Kitchen.Striking every grace note, Biba conducts her culinary symphony, Biba conducts her culinary symphony with verve, and makes a maestro of every cook.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2Vs4HQAACAAJ&dq=ITALIAN.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pesher Nahum Scroll from Qumran: An Exegetical Study of 4Q169 (Studies of the Texts of Thedesert of Judah, Vol. 53)","description":"This collection of essays investigates signs of toleration, recognition, respect and other positive forms of interaction between and within religious groups of late antiquity. At the same time, it acknowledges that examples of tolerance are significantly fewer in ancient sources than examples of intolerance and are often limited to insiders, while outsiders often met with contempt, or even outright violence. The essays take both perspectives seriously by analysing the complexity pertaining to these encounters. Religious concerns, ethnicity, gender and other social factors central to identity formation were often intertwined and they yielded different ways of drawing the limits of tolerance and intolerance. This book enhances our understanding of the formative centuries of Jewish and Christian religious traditions. It also brings the results of historical inquiry into dialogue with present-day questions of religious tolerance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rl8zEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Pesher+Nahum+Scroll+from+Qumran:+An+Exegetical+Study+of+4Q169+(Studies+of+the+Texts+of+Thedesert+of+Judah,+Vol.+53)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1 Corinthians (MacArthur Bible Studies)","description":"As the gospel spreads to the far corners of the earth, the apostle Paul is under mounting pressure to provide doctrinal direction to maturing churches before they go astray. The Corinthian church in particular refused to separate themselves from their old, pagan ways, and their worldliness was affecting the church s priority of spreading the gospel. As a result, Paul writes 1 Corinthians, a corrective letter to the church in Corinth, that gives Christians black-and-white boundaries in a gray world. As he explains doctrinal truths directly relating to sin and righteousness, he outlines a foundation for godly behavior. Paul s letter is a valuable tool of correction and encouragement for believers then and now to be alert, firm, mature, strong, and loving.

In this comprehensive, up-to-date study, seasoned observers tell the fascinating story of the GOP s remarkable advance at the regional level and in each of the eleven states of the former Confederacy, effectively capturing the current partisan dynamics at work throughout Dixie. In Southern Politics in the 1990s eleven teams of political scientists and journalists all of them long-time observers of the political scene in their own states offer individual chapters that closely examine partisan and electoral developments in each southern state. Alexander P. Lamis frames the state discussions with introductory and concluding chapters that highlight the evolution of the two-party South and the political transformation the region as a whole underwent during the decade of the 1990s. Together, the authors show that the amazing Republican spurt was fueled by many factors, including the ongoing entrenchment of the partisan competition begun three decades earlier; the national Republican sweep of 1994 that affected all regions of the country equally; and the successful efforts of Republicans to paint the Democrats as hopelessly mired in a corrupt political system and themselves as untainted reformers who represent the future. However, as the separate state chapters illustrate, the pace of change differed from state to state. For example, South Carolina was an early Dixie leader in the GOP s growth in the 1990s, but Arkansas caught the wave only in the middle of the decade. Offering in-depth political analysis on both the state and the regional level, Southern Politics in the 1990s reveals that the 1990s revolution in southern politics gave the country, for the first time since the 1850s, a truly national party system. The book will prove essential to anyone interested in southern politics at the dawn of the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dLykDAAAQBAJ&dq=Southern+Politics+in+the+1990s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Prayers (Golden Naptime Tales)","description":"Little Prayers; Little Thank-You's.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pZYPAAAACAAJ&dq=Little+Prayers+(Golden+Naptime+Tales)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Puppets From Everyday Materials","description":"Provides directions for making all kinds of puppets out of easily obtainable materials, including socks, paper rolls, boxes, spools, and even vegetables.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xlc8rNYEZvkC&dq=Simple+Puppets+From+Everyday+Materials&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prophets & Professors: Essays on the Lives and Works of Modern Poets","description":"Best Book of the Year NPR ?

BookBub ? KCRW ? Finalist for the National Book Award ? One of the New York Times Notable Books of the Year ? One of the New York Times Best Historical Fiction of the Year ? Instant New York Times Bestseller A singular and stunning debut novel about the forbidden union between two enslaved young men on a Deep South plantation, the refuge they find in each other, and a betrayal that threatens their existence. Isaiah was Samuel's and Samuel was Isaiah's. That was the way it was since the beginning, and the way it was to be until the end. In the barn they tended to the animals, but also to each other, transforming the hollowed-out shed into a place of human refuge, a source of intimacy and hope in a world ruled by vicious masters. But when an older man a fellow slave seeks to gain favor by preaching the master's gospel on the plantation, the enslaved begin to turn on their own. Isaiah and Samuel's love, which was once so simple, is seen as sinful and a clear danger to the plantation's harmony. With a lyricism reminiscent of Toni Morrison, Robert Jones, Jr., fiercely summons the voices of slaver and enslaved alike, from Isaiah and Samuel to the calculating slave master to the long line of women that surround them, women who have carried the soul of the plantation on their shoulders. As tensions build and the weight of centuries of ancestors and future generations to come culminates in a climactic reckoning, The Prophets fearlessly reveals the pain and suffering of inheritance, but is also shot through with hope, beauty, and truth, portraying the enormous, heroic power of love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fJlSEAAAQBAJ&dq=Prophets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whitney Biennial 2006: Day for Night","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BQk6zwEACAAJ&dq=Whitney+Biennial+2006:+Day+for+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nene, Nena y Guau 1","description":"En este volumen contiene cinco t tulos con un contenido que apoya la labor docente y formativa del ni?o.

Nevertheless, the story of Helen Huntingdon and her swaggering, debauched husband, and of Gilbert Markham, the man who falls in love with Helen, is notable for its honesty, psychological truth and burning sincerity - and for its startling modernity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=phqaAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Tenant+of+Wildfell+Hall+Set&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts","description":"In 1988, Dr. John Casey, a professor visiting Burma, meets a waiter in Mandalay with a passion for the works of James Joyce, and the encounter changes both their lives.

Miraculously reaching its destination, the letter leads to Pascal's rescue and his enrollment in Cambridge University, where he is the first Burmese tribesman ever to attend.

And then some. Between 1954 and 1960, Jasper Johns developed his well-known repertory of flat images, including flags, targets, alphabets, words, maps, and numbers--subjects drawn not from popular culture so much as from human consciousness. His explorations of these familiar symbols drew attention to how reality is represented through such visual signs, and how we interpret them. This exhibition catalogue accompanies the first show to concentrate in depth on a single subject by Johns--Numbers--and it brings together painting, drawing, collage, and printmaking from all periods of his career, focusing on the years between 1955 and 1979.

The flood of praise for its design, however, can obscure the many lessons from the long struggle to develop the project. Nothing was built on the site for more than a decade after the first master plan was approved, and the redevelopment agency flirted with bankruptcy in 1979. Taking a practice-oriented approach, the book examines the role of planning and development agencies in implementing urban waterfront redevelopment. It focuses upon the experience of the central actor - the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) - and includes personal interviews with executives of the BPCA, former New York mayors John Lindsay and Ed Koch, key public officials, planners, and developers. Describing the political, financial, planning, and implementation issues faced by public agencies and private developers from 1962 to 1993, it is both a case study and history of one of the most ambitious examples of urban waterfront redevelopment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4SY5KxTWrSIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buddha Sutra","description":"The Lotus Sutra is regarded as one of the world's great religious scriptures and most influential texts.

Sororophobia designates the complex and shifting relations between women's attempts to identify with other women and their often simultaneous desire to establish and retain difference. Michie argues for the centrality to feminism of a paradigm that moves beyond celebrations of identity and sisterhood to a more nuanced notion of women's relations with other women which may include such uncomfortable concepts as envy, jealousy, and competition as well as more institutionalized ideas of difference such as race and class. Chapters on literature are interspersed by \\"inter-chapters\\" on the choreography of sameness and difference among women in popular culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z3fmCwAAQBAJ&dq=Sororophobia:+Differences+among+Women+in+Literature+and+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ancient wisdom;: An outline of theosophical teachings","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ElIyAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Islamic Philosophy","description":"Islamic Philosophy has often been treated as mainly of historical interest, belonging to the history of ideas rather than to philosophy.

Rattled by this directive, his life begins to spiral out of control, fueled by his obsession over the case, heavy drinking, and several repercussions too close to home. In an effort to help the emotionally unstable Aoki, the police department sends him to a remote Japanese mountain retreat. What was supposed to be a relaxing stay for the recently suspended investigator instead becomes a hotbed of suspense. Soon, familiar faces, furtive glances, secret dinner conversations and lurking secrets make Aoki realize that the guests at the Kamakura Inn are not unrelated. It becomes clear that something beyond coincidence has put them together; politician, banker, suspended detective, and an elusive Go master who manipulates Aoki like his game board pieces. A sudden snowstorm traps the guests together just as Aoki begins to piece together each guest's connection to an unsolved disappearance years prior. With no communication to the outside world, or method of escape, the relaxing retreat becomes a maze of stone walls, a geisha's seduction, and bloody murders in the night. Before long, Aoki realizes that his investigation into ex-Governor Tamaki and the unsolved disappearance are part of a larger scheme.

Harper and Anthony Walton present the definitive collection of black verse in the United States--200 years of vision, struggle, power, beauty, and triumph from 52 outstanding poets. From the neoclassical stylings of slave-born Phillis Wheatley to the wistful lyricism of Paul Lawrence Dunbar . . . the rigorous wisdom of Gwendolyn Brooks...the chiseled modernism of Robert Hayden...the extraordinary prosody of Sterling A. Brown...the breathtaking, expansive narratives of Rita Dove...the plaintive rhapsodies of an imprisoned Elderidge Knight . . . The postmodern artistry of Yusef Komunyaka. Here, too, is a landmark exploration of lesser-known artists whose efforts birthed the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts movements--and changed forever our national literature and the course of America itself. Meticulously researched, thoughtfully structured, The Vintage Book of African-American Poetry is a collection of inestimable value to students, educators, and all those interested in the ever-evolving tradition that is American poetry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ErAYmQPHE6oC&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},I=["disabled"],E={key:0},x={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,a){const g=m("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",M,[(e(!0),o(f,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(h,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",x,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,I)):c("",!0)])}const P=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-eeb1806d"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/15.md","filePath":"drive/15.md"}'),J={name:"drive/15.md"},_=Object.assign(J,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[w(P)]))}});export{D as __pageData,_ as default};
