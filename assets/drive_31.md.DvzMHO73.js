While humans have depleted or eliminated most other native predators, the coyote has defied all attempts to exterminate it, simultaneously expanding its range from coast to coast and from wilderness to urban areas. As a result, coyotes are becoming the focus of increasing controversy and emotion for people across the continent  from livestock growers who would like to eradicate coyotes to conservationists who would protect them at any cost. In this thoughtful, well-argued, and timely book, Stuart Ellins makes the case that lethal methods of coyote management do not work and that people need to adopt a more humane way of coexisting with coyotes. Interweaving scientific data about coyote behavior and natural history with decades of field experience, he shows how endlessly adaptive coyotes are and how attempts to kill them off have only strengthened the species through natural selection. He then explains the process of taste aversion conditioning which he has successfully employed to stop coyotes from killing domestic livestock and pets. Writing frankly as an advocate of this effective and humane method of controlling coyotes, he asks, \\"Why are we mired in the use of archaic, inefficient, unsophisticated, and barbaric methods of wildlife management in this age of reason and high technology? This question must be addressed while there is still a wildlife to manage.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7RbUAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practice Of Gods Presence (7 In 1 Anthology)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tommytown","description":"Tommytown is a composite of time, people, and attitudes during a period that has long been in exile; when boys ran free outside, laughing their way to another adventure with no thought of danger from adults or even nature.

It's more than just a fact. It's an understanding of how things really are.This remarkably brief book delivers tons of truth about existing, surviving, moving up, achieving leadership, delivering results, reaping rewards...and ultimately finding self-perspective and satisfaction in the world of Senior Management.Only rarely in any decade does a book capture, and bring new insights to, an infinitely broad subject in just a few words.This one does, because it's derived from a wealth of first-hand observation.For over 30 years, John Lucht has been recruiting senior executives from CEO on down...first for six years at Heidrick and Struggles, America's second-largest search firm, and for the past 24 years in his own independent practice which, for the past ten years, has also included outplacement and executive coaching at the highest levels of management. For ten earlier years he, too, was an executive on the fast track...acutely aware of the cultural and performance issues that determine progress, rewards and-ultimately-personal satisfaction among executives.\\"It's been my privilege-and a fascinating pleasure-to interview over 4,000 high-level executives,\\" he says. \\"I've also come to know many of these men and women on a far more informal and personal basis. Increasingly in recent years, I've helped some of them with their interpersonal, organizational, and even their operating concerns.\\"\\"What you and I are sharing together in this book comes mainly from knowing, evaluating, and assisting so many senior executives.

In the wake of an embarrassing disaster for MI6 in a divided Berlin, Wilderness is reprimanded with a posting to remote northern Finland under the guise of a cultural exchange program to promote Britain abroad. Bored by his work, with nothing to spy on, Wilderness strikes a deal with his old KGB pal Kostya to smuggle vodka into the USSR. But there is something fishy about why Kostya has suddenly turned up in Finland and MI6 intelligence from London points to a connection with cobalt mining in the region, a critical component in the casing of the atomic bomb.

In the wake of World War II, with Britain s empire collapsing and Stalin s on the rise, US officials under new Secretary of State George C. Marshall set out to reconstruct western Europe as a bulwark against communist authoritarianism. Their massive, costly, and ambitious undertaking would confront Europeans and Americans alike with a vision at odds with their history and self-conceptions. In the process, they would drive the creation of NATO, the European Union, and a Western identity that continue to shape world events. Benn Steil s  thoroughly researched and well-written account  (USA TODAY) tells the story behind the birth of the Cold War, told with verve, insight, and resonance for today. Focusing on the critical years 1947 to 1949, Benn Steil s gripping narrative takes us through the seminal episodes marking the collapse of postwar US-Soviet relations the Prague coup, the Berlin blockade, and the division of Germany. In each case, Stalin s determination to crush the Marshall Plan and undermine American power in Europe is vividly portrayed.

After his great victories at Gettysburg and Union Mills, General Robert E. Lee's attempt to bring the war to a final conclusion by attacking Washington, D.C., fails. However, in securing Washington, the remnants of the valiant Union Army of the Potomac, under the command of the impetuous General Dan Sickles, is trapped and destroyed. For Lincoln there is only one hope left: that General Ulysses S. Grant can save the Union cause. It is now August 22, 1863. Lincoln and Grant are facing a collapse of political will to continue the fight to preserve the Union. Lee, desperately short of manpower, must conserve his remaining strength while maneuvering for the killing blow that will take Grant's army out of the fight and, at last, bring a final and complete victory for the South. Pursuing the remnants of the defeated Army of the Potomac up to the banks of the Susquehanna, Lee is caught off balance when news arrives that General Ulysses S. Grant, in command of more than seventy thousand men, has crossed that same river, a hundred miles to the northwest at Harrisburg. As General Grant brings his Army of the Susquehanna into Maryland, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia maneuvers for position. Grant first sends General George Armstrong Custer on a mad dash to block Lee's path toward Frederick and with it control of the crucial B&O railroad, which moves troops and supplies. The two armies finally collide in Central Maryland, and a bloody week-long battle ensues along the banks of Monocacy Creek. This must be the \\"final\\" battle for both sides.

Its spacious longhouse lodges and council-house squares, supported by hundreds of acres of planted fields, were the envy of white Americans who had already begun to encroach upon the rich Indian land that served as the center of the Sauk's spiritual world. When the inevitable conflicts between natives and white squatters turned violent, Black Hawk's Sauks were forced into exile, banished forever from the east side of the Mississippi River. Longing for what their culture had been, Black Hawk and his followers, including 700 warriors, rose up in a rage in the spring of 1832, and defiantly crossed the Mississippi from Iowa to Illinois in order to reclaim their ancestral home. Though the war lasted only three months, no other violent encounter between white America and native peoples embodies so clearly the essence of the Republic's inner conflict between its belief in freedom and human rights and its insatiable appetite for new territory. Kerry A. Trask gives new and vivid life to the heroic efforts of Black Hawk and his men, illuminating the tragic history of frontier America through the eyes of those who were cast aside in the pursuit of the new nation's manifest destiny.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RZ3qAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The River of the Mother of God: and other Essays by Aldo Leopold","description":"His name is inextricably linked with a single work, A Sand County Almanac, a classic of natural history literature and the conservationist's bible.

The scope of the material covers works containing specific reference to TOC, including Synchronous Manufacturing and Constraint Management. The book is organized into three sections. The first section contains an analysis and interpretation of the results of the search. The second provides abstracts on all the material. The third supplies author, keyword, and subject indexes along with a list of books, journals, websites, and publishers. Extensively researched and referenced, The World of the Theory of Constraints furnishes comprehensive material on TOC.

At the time, General Dwight Eisenhower, General Douglas MacArthur, and chief of staff Admiral William Leahy all agreed that an atomic attack on Japanese cities was unnecessary. All of them believed that Japan had already been beaten and that the war would soon end. Was the bomb dropped to end the war more quickly? Or did it herald the start of the Cold War? In his probing new study, prizewinning historian Ronald Takaki explores these factors and more. He considers the cultural context of race - the ways in which stereotypes of the Japanese influenced public opinion and policymakers - and also probes the human dimension. Relying on top secret military reports, diaries, and personal letters, Takaki relates international policies to the individuals involved: Los Alamos director J. Robert Oppenheimer, Secretary of State James Byrnes, Secretary of War Henry L.

Buckminster Fuller consummates his literary canon, his panoramic lifetime survey of all aspects of the responsibility of human beings for their own destiny. This book is a modern allegory - his long-gestated myth-of the villainy of capitalism and the fecklessness of classic economics. For Fuller, the academic discipline of economics is irrelevant since it derives from an invalid assumption of scarcity. In fact, he has long argued that future historians of our era may subsume our business practices as a branch of mythology; thus it is not surprising that the word economic appears nowhere in his text. Fuller s myth is no idle fairy tale, since he faces his question - the question of a technological imperative which only he could raise with the deadly seriousness of satire. That question is: Can our system of national political sovereignties and corporate profits survive the inevitable technology revolution require to obviate wars by effecting a worldwide rise in the standard of living. One of the functions of myth is to resolve contradictions in our culture. Grunch of Giants portrays the rising of multinational corporations in the paradoxical role of function both as the epitome of capitalistic selfishness and as the inadvertent vehicle for the dissolution of national political boundaries - the last deterrent to a one-world economy. The result is more subversive of the property and profit values of the capitalist system than anything dreamed of since Karl Marx.  E.J.

The Druid Magic Handbook is the first manual of magical practice in Druidry, one of the fastest growing branches of the Pagan movement. The book breaks new ground, teaching Druids how to practice ritual magic for practical and spiritual goals within their own tradition. What sets The Druid Magic Handbook apart is that it does not require the reader to use a particular pantheon or set of symbols. Although it presents one drawn from Welsh Druid tradition, it also shows the reader how to adapt rites and other practices to fit the deities and symbols most meaningful to them. This cutting edge system of ritual magic can be used by Druids, Pagans, Christians, and Thelemites alike! This is the first manual of Druidic magical practice ever, replete with spell work and rituals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=feHr5fW1b60C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey Across Russia the Soviet Union Today","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=15dPITlsX68C&dq=Journey+Across+Russia+the+Soviet+Union+Today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freakshow","description":"This cultural history of the travelling freak show in America chronicles the rise and fall of the industry as attitudes about disability evolved. From 1840 until 1940, hundreds of freak shows crisscrossed the United States, from the smallest towns to the largest cities, exhibiting their casts of dwarfs, giants, Siamese twins, bearded ladies, savages, snake charmers, fire eaters, and other oddities. By today s standards such displays would be considered cruel and exploitative the pornography of disability. Yet for one hundred years the freak show was widely accepted as one of America s most popular forms of entertainment. Robert Bogdan s fascinating social history brings to life the world of the freak show and explores the culture that nurtured and, later, abandoned it. In uncovering this neglected chapter of show business, he describes in detail the flimflam artistry behind the shows, the promoters and the audiences, and the gradual evolution of public opinion from awe to embarrassment. Freaks were not born, Bogdan reveals; they were manufactured by the amusement world, usually with the active participation of the freaks themselves. Many of the \\"human curiosities\\" found fame and fortune, until the ascent of professional medicine transformed them from marvels into pathological specimens.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ZXeBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Language Learnability and Language Development: First Edition (Cognitive Science Series)","description":"A classic book about language acquisition and conceptual structure, with a new preface by the author, \\"The Secret Life of Verbs.\\" Before Steven Pinker wrote bestsellers on language and human nature, he wrote several technical monographs on language acquisition that have become classics in cognitive science. Learnability and Cognition, first published in 1989, brought together two big topics: how do children learn their mother tongue, and how does the mind represent basic categories of meaning such as space, time, causality, agency, and goals? The stage for this synthesis was set by the fact that when children learn a language, they come to make surprisingly subtle distinctions: pour water into the glass and fill the glass with water sound natural, but pour the glass with water and fill water into the glass sound odd. How can this happen, given that children are not reliably corrected for uttering odd sentences, and they don't just parrot back the correct ones they hear from their parents? Pinker resolves this paradox with a theory of how children acquire the meaning and uses of verbs, and explores that theory's implications for language, thought, and the relationship between them. As Pinker writes in a new preface, \\"The Secret Life of Verbs,\\" the phenomena and ideas he explored in this book inspired his 2007 bestseller The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature. These technical discussions, he notes, provide insight not just into language acquisition but into literary metaphor, scientific understanding, political discourse, and even the conceptions of sexuality that go into obscenity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HDUvYcW5n6QC&dq=Language+Learnability+and+Language+Development:+First+Edition+(Cognitive+Science+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Citrix Access Suite 4 for Windows Server 2003: the Official Guide, Third Edition","description":"Containing checklists and technical best practices; this guide explains how to maximize the suite components to enable and manage secure access to applications and data across the Internet; intranets; extranets; and WANs; LANs; and wireless networks. --","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R-tN-r1_18gC&dq=Citrix+Access+Suite+4+for+Windows+Server+2003:+the+Official+Guide,+Third+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ON EVANGELIZATION IN THE MODERN WORLD: EVANGELII NUNTIANDI.","description":"Written by Pope Paul VI in 1975, Evangelii Nuntiandi has lost none of its force and brilliance over the past forty years.

S. Intervention in Venezuela","description":"Perhaps no world leader is better placed to challenge the global authority of the United States than Hugo Chavez, the populist leader of Venezuela. As the head of one of the world's largest oil-producing countries. Chavez has been instrumental in raising world oil prices, undermining the control and profits of the multinational oil companies, and introducing innovative plans to use the wealth from this natural resource to help the impoverished in his own country and around the world. When in 2005 Bush ally and Christian fundamentalist Pat Robertson called for Chavez's assassination, public outcry forced some questions: Was that, in fact, a CIA goal? Did the US have plans to invade Venezuela? And exactly what was the extent of US knowledge of or involvement in the April 2002 coup against Chavez? Venezuelan-American attorney Eva Golinger used the US Freedom of Information Act to obtain government documents about US intervention in Venezuela. The Chavez Code contains this irrefutable evidence that, at the very least, the US knew about the plot to overthrow Chavez before it happened. The history of US interventions across Latin America, the suspicious blacked-out lines and pages, and the ongoing investigation suggest an even darker tale.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KBl3AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Chavez+Code:+Cracking+U.+S.+Intervention+in+Venezuela&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shades of gray: In Vietnam there was no clear-cut right or wrong, no absolutes of black and white, only myriad shades of gray : a novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UwNSGwAACAAJ&dq=Shades+of+gray:+In+Vietnam+there+was+no+clear-cut+right+or+wrong,+no+absolutes+of+black+and+white,+only+myriad+shades+of+gray+:+a+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women of the Northern Plains: Gender and Settlement on the Homestead Frontier, 1870-1930","description":"Winner of the 2006 Caroline Bancroft History Prize  Impressively researched and highly readable, Barbara Handy-Marchello's analysis of North Dakota farm women's roles will become the standard by which other works on the subject will be judged.  Paula M. Nelson, author of The Prairie Winnows Out Its Own In Women of the Northern Plains, Barbara Handy-Marchello tells the stories of the unsung heroes of North Dakota's settlement era: the farm women. As the men struggled to raise and sell wheat, the women focused on barnyard labor raising chickens and cows and selling eggs and butter to feed and clothe their families and maintain their households through booms and busts. Handy-Marchello details the hopes and fears, the challenges and successes of these women from the Great Dakota Boom of the 1870s and '80s to the impending depression and drought of the 1930s. Women of the frontier willingly faced drudgery and loneliness, cramped and unconventional living quarters, the threat of prairie fires and fierce blizzards, and the isolation of homesteads located miles from the nearest neighbor. Despite these daunting realities, Dakota farm women cultivated communities among their distant neighbors, shared food and shelter with travelers, developed varied income sources, and raised large families, always keeping in sight the ultimate goal: to provide the next generation with rich, workable land. Enlivened by interviews with pioneer families as well as diaries, memoirs, and other primary sources, Women of the Northern Plains uncovers the significant and changing roles of Dakota farm women who were true partners to their husbands, their efforts marking the difference between success and failure for their families. Barbara Handy-Marchello is a history professor at the University of North Dakota. She has written articles on rural women and is the co-author of A History of the NDSU Seedstocks Project. She lives near Fargo, North Dakota.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3WN-aazHD8kC&dq=Women+of+the+Northern+Plains:+Gender+and+Settlement+on+the+Homestead+Frontier,+1870-1930&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philosophy of the Buddha","description":"What did the Buddha actually teach?

S. Portfolio Investment in Latin America, 1900-1986 (Studies in International Political Economy)","description":"By the end of 1985, Latin Americans owed their foreign creditors $368 billion. That was nearly $1,000 for every man, woman, and child between the Rio Grande and Tierra del Fuego. The debt represented more than half of the region's gross domestic product, and interest payments alone consumed 36 percent of export revenues. If profits are added to interest, and the total compared to new capital inflows, the drama of the situation becomes clear: a real resource transfer from Latin American was under way. More than three-fourths of Latin America's debt was owed to several hundred commercial banks with headquarters in North America, Europe, and Japan. Banker to the Third World examines why the loans that precipitated the 1985 debt crisis were made, how these loans were similar to, and different from, other loans, what solutions to the crisis would be effective, and how such problems could be avoided in the future. When originally published, this title presented a new and timely analysis of the crisis; today it serves as a historical exploration that will give readers a better understanding of both Latin American economic history and more recent foreign debt crises.

His mythic characters represent the ultimates in good and evil, and everything in between. Brilliant warriors, they are heartbreakingly human in their ability to love, sacrifice, and summon extraordinary courage when all seems lost. With Stormrider, Gemmell continues his spectacular Rigante saga as the imperiled highland clan faces its deadliest threat . . . and calls for it's greatest hero. STORMRIDER A Novel of the Rigante Centuries ago, Connavar s triumphant battles against the invading army of Stone gained the Rigante their freedom, yet magic that once flourished has been all but snuffed out. The Varlish king and his barons have stolen Rigante lands and robbed the people of their culture and liberty. From the Rigante's former seat of power the black-hearted Moidart rules; only in the north are the clansmen free. There, in the Druagh mountains, the magic still reigns, strengthened by bold, brilliant victories of the outlaw leader known as Ravenheart. One glorious spark, one moment of Rigante rebellion, has ignited a revolution and forged a legend. The conquered clans set about to rediscover their greatnessyet theirs is not the only call to arms. In the south, civil war has drenched the land in blood, and the armies of destruction have begun creeping north. There the brooding Ravenheart waits, knowing the forces of the hated Moidart will come, led by the brutal ruler s only son, Stormrider. Ravenheart and Stormrider: enemies of uncommon courage, are unaware that the fate of the world lies in their hands. Faced with this inexorable advance, deadly foes will be forced to unite, and a secret lost in the uncharted past will return to haunt these two warriors as they face the vengeance of an ancient evil. Immense armies of darkness advance on the highlanders, and it seems as if nothing will stop them. They crush their enemies with ease, until only a few thousand men stand before them, with no help in sight. But these are not ordinary men they face. They are clansmen, and more than that, they are Rigante.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L0T5VRj2CwYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Grotesque: An Account of the Clay Shaw-Jim Garrison-Kennedy Assassination Trial in New Orleans","description":"Reissued to coincide with the 30th anniversary of President Kennedy's death, this masterwork of journalism by a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer details the infamous, unsuccessful attempt by Jim Garrison to prosecute Clay Shaw in New Orleans as a key conspirator in the assassination of John F.

Just before they were put to death, the Rosenbergs wrote a letter to their two sons saying they were \\"secure in the knowledge that others would carry on after them.\\" The Rosenbergs left their young sons a legacy that was both a burden and a gift, as well as an aching emotional void. Robert Meeropol grew up torn between the need to pursue his political values and his intense fear that personal exposure might subject him and his family to violence or even death. An Execution in the Family details Robert Meeropol's political odyssey from being the Rosenbergs' son to becoming a prominent political activist in his own right, and it chronicles a very personal journey of self-discovery. This is the story of how he tried to balance a strong desire to live a normal life and raise a family with a growing need to create something useful out of his childhood nightmare.

It delivers the heart and soul of Henry's incomparable writings in a style that is easy to read and understand. -Dr. Leslie Church's meticulous abridgment retains the essential content of the original work. - Easily misunderstood words have been replaced with modern ones while keeping Henry's style. - Use of the New International Version (NIV) instead of the King James Version makes this edition fully compatible with today's most widely used Bible translation.

Although today only Lucy Maud Montgomery is remembered and read, there were several dozen writers who enjoyed the same level of success and renown. This book brings these authors and their most successful books back into the spotlight of Canadian writing. In 2001, Canadian literature specialist Gwen Davies and Formac publisher James Lorimer set out to republish books by these largely forgotten Maritime authors. Readers can now discover 35 of their novels, all reprinted in Formac's Fiction Treasures series. For each book, series editor Gwen Davies commissioned an introduction by a contemporary scholar who offers a brief biography of the writer and a discussion of the text itself. As Gwen Davies notes, \\"These introductions not only capture new research in literary biography or publishing history, but also broaden our understanding of regional popular reading tastes from the era of Queen Victoria to the Second World War.\\" This book brings these introductory essays together in a single volume so that readers can discover these writers and get an overview of their best works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8Vh3CgAAQBAJ&dq=Beautiful+Joe+(Fiction+Treasures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death Cruise: Crime Stories on the Open Seas","description":"Collects stories written by such members of the International Association of Crime Writers as Agatha Christie, Nancy Pickard, John Lutz, Piet Teigeler, Barbara Collins, Jan Burke, and John Mortimer","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lt5rCf52JmQC&dq=Death+Cruise:+Crime+Stories+on+the+Open+Seas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your wings,","description":"Two birds unwittingly hatch an alligator egg, which has been accidently placed in their nest, and then try to teach their \\"son\\" to fly.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OL_aCwAAQBAJ&dq=Your+wings,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nobody True","description":"What happens when you lose your body?

According to veteran educators Rita and Marco Portales, this relationship is the central issue in the education of students, especially Latino/a students who often face serious barriers to school success because of the legacy of racism, insufficient English-language skills, and cultural differences with the educational establishment. To break down these barriers and help Latino/a students acquire a quality education, the Portaleses focus attention on the teacher-student relationship and offer a proven method that teachers can use to strengthen the print and oral skills of their students. They begin by analyzing the reasons why schools too often fail to educate Latino/a students, using eloquent comments from young Latinos/as and their parents to confirm how important the teacher-student relationship is to the student's success. Then they show how all educational stakeholders teachers, administrators, state education agencies, legislators, and parents can work together to facilitate the teacher-student relationship and improve student education. By demonstrating how teachers can improve students' reading, critical thinking, writing, and oral communication skills across the curriculum, they argue that learning can be made more relevant for students, keeping their interest levels high while preparing them for academically competitive colleges.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vKBK65zJYYAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arkansas (America the Beautiful, Second)","description":"Provides an overview of various aspects of Arkansas that make it a unique state, including its people, land, government, culture, economy, and attractions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6oNxJaRrJm4C&dq=Arkansas+(America+the+Beautiful,+Second)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"African American Literature: Voices in a Tradition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R5oOAQAAMAAJ&dq=African+American+Literature:+Voices+in+a+Tradition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Halfdanes nonsense and nursery rhymes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AewmAAAACAAJ&dq=Halfdanes+nonsense+and+nursery+rhymes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Baseball Book 1991","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k4lgNwAACAAJ&dq=The+Baseball+Book+1991&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saints and Feasts of the Liturgical Year","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Terror in the Skies: Why 9/11 Could Happen Again","description":"Flying on Northwest Airlines in mid-2004, journalist and writer Jacobsen (WomensWallStreet.com) decided that a group of Middle Eastern men were acting suspiciously, apparently because the men were talking to each other, were using the bathroom too much, and because of the \\"cold, defiant look\\" she reports she got from one with whom she had earlier \\"exchanged friendly words.\\" When she and her husband shared her concerns with a flight attendant, she writes, she was told that Federal Air Marshals were on the plane and that they were on top of the situation. Although she was later told by investigators that the men were in fact 14 Syrian musicians backing up a well-known Middle Eastern singer (the \\"Syrian Wayne Newton\\"), Jacobsen remained convinced that the men were part of a terrorist plot conducting \\"probes\\" of American aviation. She wrote up her suspicions for an article that caused a brief Internet sensation: it was publicized by such right-wing writers and proponents of racial profiling as Michelle Malkin and generally greeted with rolling eyes and chortles by those more on the center and left. She has since parlayed the original article into a continuing series on WomensWallStreet.com, much of which has now been distilled into this book, which contains the original article, descriptions of her testimony before Congress, an account of her (not particularly thorough) \\"investigation\\" into the Syrian musicians, and a condemnation of government failure to address the issue.

It would be easy to dismiss these latter-day prophets as deluded, but amazingly, their revelations all have an internal consistency, a common theme: a time of judgment is at hand, and humankind must change its ways to avert disaster. Moreover, contemporary housewives, business executives, and \\"Jesus people\\" are experiencing the same symptoms of revelation- - a blinding light, a voice out of nowhere, an impulse to take on a new name and a new life. On the track of the elusive source of these messages, Steiger examines the spread of glossolalia and faith-healing; the folklore of elves and leprechauns; the awesome cases where a revelator's body is briefly occupied by an outside personality; the mysterious \\"Elijah\\" tradition of the Bible that suggests that the great prophets (perhaps even Jesus) were possessed by a single entity; and the latest laboratory research into consciousness expansion. Revelation: The Divine Fire presents actual warnings, predictions, and messages from a wide spectrum of contemporary revelators. In addition, there are interviews and evaluations from a number of clergymen, scientists, and psychics who have met the Divine Fire. \\"Steiger's 'divine fire' is something. . . which, from the: beginning of recorded history down to the present, has communicated a revelation to man. [Steiger] is properly objective in his evaluation of the significance of such phenomena, setting forth the opinions of various scientific - or at least thoughtful - observers on the subject and, where necessary, synthesizing such opinions.\\" Kirkus Reviews \\"In the tradition of William James' Varieties of Religious Experiences we have an important collection of valuable data that should be read and considered by any one interested in the pursuit of man, his meaning, and destiny. For me this book was an exciting adventure.\\" Paul Severson, Fate magazine \\"Steiger enormously expands the definition of revelation. . . . What emerges is an engrossing compilation of esoteric events reported by those experiencing them.\\" Library Journal \\"Brad Steiger has written a shelf-full of books on psychic phenomena. Many people throughout the country first developed an interest in extrasensory perception through the work of this prolific author.\\" Martin Ebon, OCCULT magazine Author Bio - Brad Steiger is a world renowned author of over 150 books with over 17 million copies in print.

Beginning with a brief history of Colombia, Murillo analyzes the complex forces driving Colombia's current decades-old guerilla war, U.S. involvement, media perceptions, and possible paths to peace. Whether it has been the U.S.-led war against \\"drug trafficking,\\" the newly constituted \\"war against terrorism,\\" or, as we have seen over the last two years, a convenient marriage of the two, the main effect has been to allow the U.S. to further expand its role in Colombia. The foundations of Colombia's social, political, and military conflict are rarely addressed by U.S. policy. Murillo describes Colombia's history of institutionalized corruption, state neglect, far-reaching poverty, and political violence and how they precede by decades the introduction and expansion of the drug trade. Colombia and the U.S. argues that the conflict in Colombia is not about drugs, nor guerrillas, nor \\"terrorism,\\" but rather about the unwillingness of the country's elite to open up spaces for truly democratic participation in areas of economic and social development and political representation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EJyuAgPl9XQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Symbiosis and Ambivalence: Poles and Jews in a Small Galician Town","description":"Linking the past and present of Polish-Jewish relations, and combining anthropological fieldwork with archival material and secondary literature, this study reveals a pattern of Polish-Jewish interdependence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SepD_1keJ6YC&dq=Symbiosis+and+Ambivalence:+Poles+and+Jews+in+a+Small+Galician+Town&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jacqueline Kennedy.","description":"Focusing largely on Jacqueline Kennedy's White House years, an intriguing portrait examines the complexities of Jacqueline Bouvier's marriage to John F.

Applying this metaphor to modern culture, economic systems, and the history of the New World, V liz provides an original and lively approach to understanding the development of English and Spanish America over the past 500 years. According to V liz, the dominant cultural achievements of Europe's English- and Spanish-speaking peoples have been the Industrial Revolution and the Counter-Reformation, respectively. These overwhelming cultural constructions have strongly influenced the subsequent historical developments of their great cultural outposts in North and South America. The British brought to the New World a stubborn ability to thrive on diversity and change that was entirely consistent with their vernacular Gothic style. The Iberians, by contrast, brought a cultural tradition shaped like a vast baroque dome, a monument to their successful attempt to arrest the changes that threatened their imperial moment. V liz writes with erudition and wit, using a multitude of sources historians and classical sociologists, Greek philosophers, today's newspaper sports pages, and modern literature to support a novel explanation of the prosperity and expanding cultural influence of the gothic fox and the economic and cultural decline endured by the baroque hedgehog.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PMFK2h1lVvAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catseye (The Gregg Press science fiction series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Architecture of Greece (Reference Guides to National Architecture)","description":"Describes both the design and social functions of the most buildings throughout Greece.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4F-v35--l_gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hurtigruten","description":"This book is concerned with the Hurtigruten Coastal Shipping Service of Norway.

For fourteen years American pilots dropped bombs on the Southeast Asian countryside -- eventually more than eight million tons of them. In doing so, they lost over 8,588 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. They did not win the war. Ironically, Vietnam, though one of our least popular wars, produced one of the most effective groups of warriors our nation has ever seen -- men of dedication, professionalism, and courage. In Fast Movers, official navy historian John Sherwood offers an authoritative social history of the air war, focused around fourteen of these aviators -- from legends like Robin Olds, Steve Ritchie, and John Nichols to lesser-known but equally heroic fighters like Roger Lerseth and Ted Sienecki. Sherwood draws on nearly 300 interviews to tell stories of great pilots and great planes in the words of the men themselves. Fliers recall jets such as McDonnell Douglas's famous F-4 Phantom, \\"a Corvette with wings\\"; the F-05 Thunderchief, the workhorse of the war; the F-8 Crusader, the last of the gun fighters; and the block-nosed but revolutionary A-6 Intruder with its fully computerized attack systems, terrain mapping radar, and digital all-weather navigation system. Ultimately, though, it was the men who mattered. Sherwood shows us the brash confidence of famous iconoclast Robin Olds, who does not hide his thrill of the hunt -- and the kill. Roger Sheets looked like Don Knotts but prepped his \\"Vulture Flight\\" of Marine A-6s with the simple, unequivocal line, \\"Gentlemen, let's go out and kill something.\\" But Sherwood lets us know that it wasn't all glory, that pilots suffered fear just like other soldiers. Ed Rasimus later admitted he thought that an assignment to Thailand was \\"like getting diagnosed with terminal cancer: everyone is hoping the cure will come before you die.\\" There were things worse than death, too. Fast Movers offers fascinating portraits -- based on Sherwood's interviews and just-declassified naval archives -- of Vietnam's POWs. Pilots lucky enough to suffer only broken bones and burns from the violence of 1960s-era Martin-Baker ejection seats struggled to find honorable ways to negotiate half-decade-long periods in captivity. Passive resistance, like Commander Jeremiah Denton's famous blinking of TORTURE in Morse Code, was sometimes successful, often brutally reprised. Escape was impossible. Those who avoided shootdown learned to live with other frustrations. Most wanted to \\"go downtown\\" (bomb Hanoi) but were foiled by their civilian superiors, who dictated the numbers and types of aircraft that could be used in a given strike, the kinds of ordnance that could be levied against a target, and even the flight paths that could be flown. Against all odds, the pilots spawned a culture of success in the midst of failure and frustration. Fast Movers captures a hidden and crucial story of America's least successful war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BxT6h8zo2X0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part II, Second Edition","description":"Designed for North American students, this special version of the Oxford Latin Course combines the best features of both modern and traditional methods of Latin teaching, providing an exciting, stimulating introduction and approach to Latin based on the reading of original texts. In this four-volume North American edition, the order of declensions corresponds to customary U.S. usage, and the spelling has been Americanized. In addition, it offers full-color illustrations and photographs throughout Parts I and II and an expanded Teacher's Book with translations for each part. Parts I-III (now available in hardcover editions) are built around a narrative detailing the life of Horace, now based more closely on historical sources, which helps students to get to know real Romans--with their daily activities, concerns, and habits--and to develop an understanding of Roman civilization during the time of Cicero and Augustus. Part IV (paperback) is a reader consisting of extracts from Caesar, Cicero, Catullus, Virgil, Livy, and Ovid. The second edition of the Oxford Latin Course has been carefully designed to maximize student interest, understanding, and competence. It features a clearer presentation of grammar, revised narrative passages, new background sections, more emphasis on daily life and on the role of women, a greater number and variety of exercises, and review chapters and tests. Each chapter opens with a set of cartoons with Latin captions that illustrate new grammar points. A Latin reading follows, with new vocabulary highlighted in the margins and follow-up exercises that focus on reading comprehension and grammatical analysis. A background essay in English concludes each chapter. Covering a variety of topics--from history to food, from slavery to travel, these engaging essays present a well-rounded picture of Augustan Rome. The Oxford Latin Course, Second Edition offers today's students and teachers an exceptionally engaging and attractive introduction to the language, literature, and culture of Rome--one that builds skills effectively and is exciting to use.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8KA6PwAACAAJ&dq=Oxford+Latin+Course,+Part+II,+Second+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Railroads of Indiana","description":"Despite the huge amount of interest in railroads, this is the first complete description and history of the railroads of Indiana from the first line, completed in 1838, up to the present.

Offering a comprehensive study of the logic and mode of existence of capital in the 21st century, the book will be of interest to academics and students of monetary and financial economics alongside political economy. Achim Szepanski is the founder of the Electronic Music Labels Force Inc., and Mille Plateaux. His research focuses on speculative capital.

They put the bad in badass because, well...it's their job. Navy SEAL Maverick Hart has everything. Women want him. Grown men idolize him. Little boys want to grow up and be like him. The job, the glory-it's all his. Not because it's handed to him...because he works hard for it. The second his sights lock on something, he owns it-or destroys it. Unfortunately he does both at the same time. Windsor Forbes only takes calculated risks in her profession and in her personal life. After being left at the altar by the only person she's ever loved, the very last thing she's looking for is a relationship-especially the insane brand an arrogant Navy SEAL is offering. Hesitant, yet trusting to a fault, she gives in. She knew she shouldn't take the chance, especially a second time, but love is irrational and their love is perfect, infallible. Or so she thought...

(Discussion paper)","description":"The very mention of nuclear terrorism is enough to rouse strong reactions, and understandably so, because it combines the most terrifying weapons and the most threatening of people in a single phrase. The possibility that terrorists could obtain and use nuclear weapons deserves careful analysis, but discussion has all too often been contaminated with exaggeration, even hysteria. For example, it has been claimed that nuclear terrorism poses an  existential threat  to the United States. This Adelphi Paper develops a more measured analysis of the risk of terrorists detonating a true fission device. The problem is attacked from two perspectives: the considerable, possibly insurmountable, technical challenges involved in obtaining a functional nuclear weapon, whether  home-made  or begged, borrowed or stolen from a state arsenal; and the question of the strategic, political and psychological motivations to  go nuclear . The conclusions are that nuclear terrorism is a less significant threat than is commonly believed, and that, among terrorists, Muslim extremists are not the most likely to use nuclear weapons.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eBUHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macromedia Director 8.5 Shockwave Studio for 3D: Training from the Source (Authorized)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gtnfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Macromedia+Director+8.5+Shockwave+Studio+for+3D:+Training+from+the+Source+(Authorized)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creating Effective Parenting Plans: a Developmental Approach for Lawyers and Divorce Professionals","description":"According to these pediatric psychologists, the best interest of the child calls for a developmentally appropriate parenting plan-that is, custody that accurately reflects the child's physical and psychological development.

O'Connor's artistic vision was located squarely in her Catholic faith, yet she realized that to view life only through the eyes of the Church was to ignore a large part of existence. In her fiction, therefore, she explored a wider world, employing voices that challenged conceptions of both self and faith, ultimately enlarging and deepening both. In The Art and Vision of Flannery O'Connor, Robert Brinkmeyer presents an innovative study of O'Connor's fiction by exploring the dialogic forces at work in her writing.Drawing on the insights of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, Brinkmeyer offers an explanation for the great depth and power of O'Connor's work, paying particular attention to the ways her art and audience bear upon her regnant Catholic vision. This pressure and resistance, Brinkmeyer writes, free O'Connor's vision from the limits of its perspective, opening it to growth and understanding. After a thorough discussion of the ways in which O'Connor's Catholic and southern heritage helped to form her artistic vision, Brinkmeyer shows how dialogic encounters are at work in O'Connor's interaction with her largely fundamentalist narrators, the stories they tell, and her readers. He focuses on several of her stories as well as her two novels, Wise Blood and The Violent Bear It Away.

As a neonatal therapist working with premature babies in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit), Sue Ludwig understood that the more intentional and responsible she was with her attitude and energy, the greater and more positive her impact was on her tiny patients. But while she spent her days caring for the most fragile of patients, attuned to their sensitivities, she realized she had been neglecting her own needs and desires. In this remarkable book about personal and professional transformation, Ludwig shares her journey from burned-out caregiver to powerful changemaker, and the lessons about self-care and energy she learned on the NICU floor. Through case studies, reflection, and practical tools, she guides you toward living a more purposeful, energetic, and intentional life. Most of us have been conditioned not to pay much attention to the mere moments of our days. We re told to keep our eye on the prize, on the future, on the next goal just beyond the horizon. We measure our lives by the outcomes we achieve. College degree, check. Professional career, check. Spouse, check. Children, check. And yet, by the time we ve collected most of those checkmarks, many of us don t feel all that vibrant. We might even feel like roadkill. But just as the lightest touch can have dramatic effects on the health and developmental outcomes of premature babies, the energy we bring to everything we do no matter how small impacts us, and our own personal development. By acknowledging and taking charge of your energy, you can start intentionally building an environment that supports, rather than depletes it. By taking baby steps, you can fill each moment of your life as you choose, and live the kind of life you were meant to.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rsQ3EAAAQBAJ&dq=The+tiniest+humans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Old World background (Catholic school history series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uUo6swEACAAJ&dq=Our+Old+World+background+(Catholic+school+history+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","description":"The moment the second line on the pee stick turns pink, women discover they've entered a world of parenting experts.

He rowed five days without food or water, with his hands frozen to the oars, to reach the coast of Newfoundland. Yet his tests had only begun. So begins Joe Garland s extraordinary account of the hero fisherman of Gloucester. Incredibly, though Blackburn lost his fingers to his icy misadventure, he went on to set a record for swiftest solo sailing voyage across the Atlantic that stood for decades.

But it's not necessary to be struck down by illness, a layoff, the threat of divorce, or the loss of a loved one before we evaluate priorities and reshape life along more sane lines. Instead, the more we reshape our lives to achieve better balance now, the more immediately we can enjoy the riches life offers. Balance 20/20 helps readers find the balance they need to have enough time for everything and everyone and to enjoy life. Author George Bartko recently quit his high-paying corporate job to devote himself completely to his burgeoning business. He used the system he describes in Balance 20/20 to successfully make the transition to living his dreams. Bartko calls his system The Six Pillars of Life Balance. The six pillars are key areas that make up daily life:1. Connections (relationships)2. Mind (intellect, creative expression, and reflection)3. Motion (physical activity)4. Spirituality (a sense of connection to the universe)5. Fuel (nutrition)6. Business (personal and professional tasks) In order to balance these six pillars, Bartko recommends analyzing which of these key areas we spend too much time on--and which areas we neglect. To help, Bartko offers a quiz at the beginning of each chapter so that readers can begin to see which of the six pillars need development and which areas need less time spent on them. Bartko's advice is clear and compelling--even for those pillars that are balanced, there's room to fine-tune and improve to get the most out of our days, the most out of our lives. Balance 20/20 offers recipes to help bring balance to the fuel pillar. And Bartko's stunning photography throughout offers visual inspiration to building balance into every day..","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K2qBg2jXIiEC&dq=Balance+20/20:+Six+Keys+to+a+Harmonious+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JEWISH WOMEN IN AMERICA: AN HISTORICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA : COMPLETE IN TWO VOLUMES.","description":"This encyclopedia provides the first standard reference work on the lives, history and activities of Jewish women in the United States.

It was not a good time for an upstart cowboy to try to make a go of ranching, but John Duncklee did-and succeeded. Transfixed by the rodeo at Madison Square Garden, young Duncklee decided to forego an Ivy League education and instead worked his way through the University of Arizona as a horse wrangler. After serving in the Navy, he returned to Arizona to lease the O Bar J Ranch on the bajada of the Sierrita Mountains southwest of Tucson. His account of those years is both a testament to determination and a window on modern-day ranch life under adverse conditions. The O Bar J had two deep wells that enabled Duncklee to maintain his herd; even so, he had to burn the spines off cholla cactus to provide forage. During those years he learned a lot about the care of cattle, the importance of neighbors, the vagaries of nature, and the ins and outs of ranching as both a business and a way of life. After the drought broke in the fall of 1958, Duncklee was able to sell his herb at a profit, but it wasn't much until much later that he learned how harsh an introduction to ranching he had received, for the drought of the fifties affected vegetation patterns and even the entire cattle business in the Southwest. Yet he had fulfilled his dream of becoming a cowman, an experience that instilled in him a self-confidence that would carry him through other changes in his life. Good years for the buzzards? John Duncklee will tell you, \\"They turned out to be good years, too, for the kid from New York.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lb8WPwAACAAJ&dq=Good+Years+for+the+Buzzards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bahamas Cruising Guide: With the Turks and Caicos Islands","description":"A thorough explanation of local geography, climate, weather, and navigation techniques for sailors is offered in this comprehensive guide to the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands.

But as much as he resisted the underworld of Murder, Inc. by becoming a championship fighter and a Brownsville hero, he never did escape the Jewish Mob's shadow. Though he repeatedly stood up to mob kingpins, Bummy suffered a spectacular fall from grace as a result of a smear campaign by the press. Ron Ross' Bummy Davis vs. Murder, Inc. is not just about one Jewish boxer, his meteoric rise to fame, and victimization by the press. Bummy's life was intertwined with the Great Depression, the survival of the Brooklyn Jewish immigrant population during Prohibition, and the inevitable offshoot of Prohibition-Murder Inc., one of American history's most notorious band of killers. Ron Ross portrays an important historical time period, an enigmatic Jewish subculture, and the surprising juxtaposition of a generation of Jews and their talent for boxing. Bummy Davis vs. Murder, Inc. features a cast of colorful villains whom you'll love to hate, a boxing legend who was the unwitting pawn of fate, and the human drama of the boxing world. With his vivid, street-smart Damon Runyonesque writing style, Ron Ross redeems a tragic hero who fought the pull of one of the most brutal groups of killers to grace the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OdbEAKEzhp8C&dq=Bummy+Davis+vs.+Murder,+Inc.:+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+the+Jewish+Mafia+and+an+Ill-Fated+Prizefighter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Herrick","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9RA_AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Huston family Iowa supplement","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZSNtgAACAAJ&dq=The+Huston+family+Iowa+supplement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R.

By: C. Angela Todd & C. Ann Todd You can achieve anything you want to  just Watch Out for the Elephants! The year was 1945, and the lives of black Americans showed little sign of improvement. We were still relegated to third-class statusforced to sit at the back of the bus, to drink from separate water fountains, to take only those menial jobs the white population considered beneath them. In sharp contrast, that same year, our father became only the 11th black man  permitted  to join the United States Foreign Service. His first posting was Cairo, Egypt, where he was sent as a Civilian Security Guard. For the next 35 years, our family traveled the world, moving from country to country and culture to culture, whereperhaps surprisinglywe lived very ordinary lives in very extraordinary settings. We have always considered our unusual upbringing a distinct privilege, and feel that this privileged background entails the responsibility to pass along important life lessons to others, such as:   If our parents could do it as black Americans living abroad in 1945, you can achieve anything you want to in the 21st century and beyond!   There is a big, beautiful world out there beyond your own personal boundaries, and we want to share some of the world s wonderful people and cultures with you through our stories and pictures.   As you travel though your life, always remember to Watch Out for the Elephants!--regardless of what shape or form they might take! It is our dream that this book will open the hearts and minds of young people to the endless possibilities and wonders of diverse cultures and ways of life. It is our hope that these stories will highlight the strength of the human spirit that is possible despite sometimes overbearing obstacles, such as the prejudices that our parents faced. It is our conviction that the world of opportunities is open to everyone.

Mourning her own mother's recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor's son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner.

As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt. In entrancing, lyrical prose, The Mothers asks whether a \\"what if\\" can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1PE0DwAAQBAJ&dq=MOTHERS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tillamook Burn","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1-lNAQAAMAAJ&dq=Tillamook+Burn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NXDxHIpAKm0C&dq=Shadow+Puppets+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Julia","description":" Julia Cameron invented the way people renovate the creative soul.

From these beginnings, Germantown evolved into a prosperous industrial center by the mid nineteenth century. It also became home to wealthy businessmen who built elaborate Victorian villas and gardens. Germantown was home to one of the nation's first commuter railroads and to many factories and textile mills. Immigrants from all parts of Europe were attracted to Germantown.

He attended their hunting parties and initiation ceremonies, witnessed their music and their rituals, observed their quarrels and love affairs. He documented them as an anthropologist but was accepted among them as a friend.

In doing so, he looks back over that life--from his childhood in rural northern Mississippi to the civil rights movement of the 1960s, from tears of humiliation to songs of celebration and triumph. When Do Lord Remember Me was first published in 1984, the Chicago Sun-Times compared it to Alex Haley's Roots, Newsday described it as \\"exquisitely crafted,\\" People as \\"distinguished,\\" the Philadelphia Inquirer as \\"riveting,\\" and the Cleveland Plain-Dealer declared \\"every page has something worth remembering.\\" Thirty years later and now a classic, Julius Lester's Do Lord Remember Me is an eloquent and deeply moving story about a black family's dignified struggle for survival.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=edxCAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","description":"Jennifer Chiaverini s bestselling Elm Creek Quilts series began with The Quilter s Apprentice and continues with Round Robin the name for a quilt stitched by many hands in turn a poignant story of friendship and loyalty.

The second edition of the Oxford Latin Course has been carefully designed to maximize student interest, understanding, and competence. It features a clearer presentation of grammar, revised narrative passages, new background sections, more emphasis on daily life and on the role of women, a greater number and variety of exercises, and review chapters and tests.

On graduation, she promised all the students jobs and she delivered.The ability to achieve is what the Sarina Russo brand stands for and why people have trusted it for nearly four decades.Synonymous with the phrases 'How to Get that Job' and 'See You at the Top', Sarina's philosophy is to constantly challenge the status quo, think differently, exceed expectations and deliver with speed and urgency.Sarina continues to build, both personal and business momentum since MEET ME at the Top! was first published in 2002.Sarina's dream to run her own University campus came to fruition when Russo Higher Education partnered with James Cook University to open James Cook University Brisbane in 2006.Soon afterwards, Sarina expanded into the apprenticeship and trainee sector with Sarina Russo Apprenticeship Services delivering assistance and advice to apprentices and employers in over 600 industry sectors.In 2009, Sarina's leadership qualities saw her 'rev-up' instead of close down when Sarina Russo Job Access lost Government contracts for 11 of her 19 Queensland offices. Determined to make no one redundant Sarina reinvented the offices as training centres. Sarina fought back six years later to become Australia's largest employment and apprenticeship provider.

Written for students and professionals, this book integrates the two approaches: art therapy and family systems. Although much has been written on art therapy and much, much more literature exists on family therapy, few integrate the two theoretical approaches. The structure of this book reflects the author's personal approach to art. Her art media are painting and combining found objects. The overall theme of family can quickly be seen within it, but this theme is overlaid with art, archetypal patterns and meanings, and symbolic enactments. It is also interfaced with personality development, and in this 'era of the brain,' with neurobiological research. The introduction begins with a brief introduction to Randy and his Dad and Stepmother. Chapter Two begins with the question: 'What is a family?' Chapter Three introduces the reader to the 'Cycle of Love' and the family influences in personality development, seen in personality theorists and theories (e.g., Freud, Jung, attachment and object relations, Eriksson, and Piaget). Stories about Michelle, Elizabeth, Tucker and Carl provide theoretical examples. Since more and more family therapy practice includes violence associated with the unfilled basic human needs of nourishment and nurturing, Chapter Four, 'The Cycle of Violence,' begins with a discussion of violence and its effect on early childhood environments. Chapter Five continues the theme of violence within families, and Chapter Six, 'The Cycle of Healing,' includes a discussion of resilience illustrated by a variety of stories from an integration of family and art therapy. Appendix A is filled with the practical 'how to's' of family art therapy. Appendix B includes the 'how to' interventions, and Appendix C includes key terms and concepts of a select group of family therapy theorists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tfFwCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreams Underfoot: The Newford Collection","description":"Newford's citizens--fey folk, magicians, hustlers, painters, fiddlers, and ordinary people--stumble headfirst into enchanting adventures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j5dxqRqNphMC&dq=Dreams+Underfoot:+The+Newford+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shadow Government","description":"In an age of security cameras, spy chips hidden in consumer products, and an ultra-secret global elite, Jeffrey reveals the biblical description of Satan's global conquest and identifies the tools of technology that the Antichrist will use to rule the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DwRwDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Shadow+Government&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lioness","description":"These people rise up like a lioness; like a majestic lion they stand. --Numbers 23:24 The lioness rises from her slumber, a magnificent image of strength, passion, and beauty.

Windows 8 represents what Microsoft terms as  a reimaging of Windows\\", with the most apparent change being the Metro technology: a new user interface and a new style of application that employs new APIs designed to work better with mobile devices and touch-enabled PCs. Beyond the Metro interface, though, IT professionals who manage computers and devices will need to know how to perform Windows 8 tasks such as installing, upgrading, and migrating to Windows 8, managing updates and malware protection, managing and implementing network connectivity, managing access to resources, supporting mobile devices, monitoring and maintaining Windows clients, configuring backup and recovery, and managing application compatibility. Microsoft Learning is prepared for the next round of its Windows Operating System Certification program with exams covering the new version of the software, Windows 8. The exams provide an opportunity for the MS line to capitalize on the dual disruption of brand-new software and brand-new certifications.

OVER TWO MILLION COPIES SOLD!  Packed with incredible insight about what it means to be a woman today.  Reese Witherspoon (Reese s Book Club Pick) In her most revealing and powerful memoir yet, the activist, speaker, bestselling author, and  patron saint of female empowerment  (People) explores the joy and peace we discover when we stop striving to meet others  expectations and start trusting the voice deep within us. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY O: The Oprah Magazine ? The Washington Post ? Cosmopolitan ? Marie Claire ? Bloomberg ? Parade ?  Untamed will liberate women emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It is phenomenal.  Elizabeth Gilbert, author of City of Girls and Eat Pray Love This is how you find yourself. There is a voice of longing inside each woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: Wasn t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontent even from ourselves. For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voice the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the world s expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living. Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member s ability to bring her full self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is. Untamed shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are, the luckier we get.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rQumDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Killy (Black Dagger Crime Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WBmUAAAACAAJ&dq=Killy+(Black+Dagger+Crime+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death, But At a Good Price","description":"Thirty years after its publication, The Death and Life of Great American Cities was described by The New York Times as \\"perhaps the most influential single work in the history of town planning....[It] can also be seen in a much larger context. It is first of all a work of literature; the descriptions of street life as a kind of ballet and the bitingly satiric account of traditional planning theory can still be read for pleasure even by those who long ago absorbed and appropriated the book's arguments.\\" Jane Jacobs, an editor and writer on architecture in New York City in the early sixties, argued that urban diversity and vitality were being destroyed by powerful architects and city planners.

It tells you how to use natural objects from the shamanic worlds -- Plant, Mineral, Animal, and Human -- to help make this personal connection with Earth energies. In doing this, you are able to reconnect with the center of your own power. Because the shamanic path is such a personal one, often not able to be shared, this book has been designed so that it has the experiential quality of the shamanic journey traditions. The author is also careful to present the information in a clear, organized manner. In doing so, she blends the deeply personal wisdom of a shamanic path with the shared, community wisdom of a medicine path. This represents an ideal for Aquarian shamanism. But this book is not simply about shamanism -- it shows, through techniques, exercises, meditations, and rituals, how anyone can become a shaman. You will learn how to attune yourself with the shamanic worlds of Nature, and with the Higher Self, for self-healing and self-empowerment. You will learn to develop shamanic balance, to become the living tree, and you will do this by using such tools as stones, crystals, feathers, masks, drums, and incense.

Completely re-typeset in nice, readable type by Kingsley Press. This autobiography of Gipsy Smith (1860-1947) tells the fascinating story of how God s amazing grace reached down into the life of a poor, uneducated gipsy boy and sent him singing and preaching all over Britain and America until he became a household name in many parts and influenced the lives of millions for Christ. He was born and raised in a gipsy tent to parents who made a living selling baskets, tinware and clothes pegs. His father was in and out of jail for various offences, but was gloriously converted during an evangelistic meeting. His mother died when he was only five years old. Converted at the age of sixteen, Gipsy taught himself to read and write and began to practice preaching. His beautiful singing voice earned him the nickname  the singing gipsy boy,  as he sang hymns to the people he met. At age seventeen he became an evangelist with the Christian Mission (which became the Salvation Army) and began to attract large crowds. Leaving the Salvation Army in 1882, he became an itinerant evangelist working with a variety of organizations. It is said that he never had a meeting without conversions. He was a born orator.

As gentry numbers grew faster than the imperial bureaucracy, traditional Confucian careers were closed to many; but visible philanthropy could publicize elite status outside the state realm. Actively sought by fundraising abbots, such patronage affected institutional Buddhism. After exploring the relation of Buddhism to Ming Neo-Confucianism, the growth of tourism to Buddhist sites, and the mechanisms and motives for charitable donations, Timothy Brook studies three widely separated and economically dissimilar counties. He draws on rich data in monastic gazetteers to examine the patterns and social consequences of patronage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wyq9xcHX25gC&dq=Praying+for+Power:+Buddhism+and+the+Formation+of+Gentry+Society+in+Late-Ming+China+(Harvard-Yenching+Institute+Monograph)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruth Bell Graham's Collected Poems","description":"A comprehensive volume of poetry follows the writer's entreaties to God for guidance as written throughout her childhood and during her years as a wife and mother.

As coastal and international trade dramatically increased after the War of 1812, the federal government was forced to increase safety aids to mariners. To ensure their safe passage, a series of lighthouses was built and the U.S. Life-Saving Service was created. More than two centuries of the history of New Jersey's treacherous coast are preserved in Guarding New Jersey's Shore: Lighthouses and Life-Saving Stations. Gathered from a wide array of sources, more than 200 historic photographs and fascinating, documented text combine to create the only illustrated history of the state's thirty-eight lighthouses and forty-one life-saving stations. Sandy Hook, built in 1764, is the nation's oldest operating lighthouse. Navesink's Twin Lights was the first lighthouse to use electricity and was the home of Marconi's early radio experiments. From the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, which once served as a lighthouse, to Cape May Point, and up the Delaware Bay and River, the fascinating story of protecting mariners from perils \\"Down the Shore\\" is presented and preserved in Guarding New Jersey's Shore: Lighthouses and Life-Saving Stations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fU9hwG2GuC4C&dq=Guarding+New+Jersey%27s+Shore:+Lighthouses+and+Life-Saving+Stations+(NJ)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victoria Magazine January 2000","description":"Indigenous self-determination is the recognised right of all peoples to freely determine their political status, and pursue their economic, social and cultural development. \\"Unfinished Constitutional Business\\" offers fresh insights into the ways Indigenous peoples can chart their own course and realise self-determination. The right to self-determination remains the most hotly contested issue in the UN Working Group's Draft Declaration: because the history of colonisation is emotionally charged, the issue has been clouded by a rhetoric that has sometimes obstructed analysis. This book provides a comprehensive international exploration of Indigenous self-determination. It argues that patterns are emerging that point to effective strategies that will allow Indigenous peoples to realise their goals. The UN Working Group's definition of Indigenous peoples has been influenced by these different experiences of colonisation. Diverse jurisdictions are examined as it surveys both common law and civil law systems: from the Saami Parliaments of Scandinavia, to the Maori seats in the New Zealand Parliament, of the Australian Indigenous peoples struggle for native title and self-governance, to the Canadian experience in territorial governance. A selection of international authors challenge readers to (re)consider the meanings of self-determination and their implic-ations for Indigenous peoples in different contexts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mY6GAwAAQBAJ&dq=Victoria+Magazine+January+2000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"James Bond: On Her Majesty's Secret Service","description":"Collects two strip cartoons based on Ian Fleming's original stories featuring the international spy James Bond.

Is it a literal week or a series of time periods? If I believe that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, am I denying the authority of Scripture? In response to the continuing controversy over the interpretation of the creation narrative in Genesis, John Lennox proposes a succinct method of reading and interpreting the first chapters of Genesis without discounting either science or Scripture. With examples from history, a brief but thorough exploration of the major interpretations, and a look into the particular significance of the creation of human beings, Lennox suggests that Christians can heed modern scientific knowledge while staying faithful to the biblical narrative. He moves beyond a simple response to the controversy, insisting that Genesis teaches us far more about the God of Jesus Christ and about God s intention for creation than it does about the age of the earth. With this book, Lennox offers a careful yet accessible introduction to a scientifically-savvy, theologically-astute, and Scripturally faithful interpretation of Genesis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rAEKJejbkiwC&dq=First+Seven+Days&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medieval Instrumental Dances (Music, Scholarship and Performance)","description":"In Europe the tradition of secular dance has continued unbroken until the present.

This rich and important biography, gracefully written by his wife and longtime professional colleague, records both his professional and his personal life. He was seen by some colleagues as a major integrator of the different trends in psychology at a time of fragmentation; by others as an enlarger of the scope of psychology when it was too limited; and by still others as a humanizer of psychology when it was forgetting the needs of human beings. Intensely committed to these efforts as he was, the whole Gardner Murphy was seen by few of his peers.

Indeed, the gospels and their interpretation have had a profound impact on theology, philosophy, the sciences, ethics, worship, architecture, and the creative arts. Building on the strengths of the first edition, The Cambridge Companion to the Gospels, 2nd edition, takes account of new directions in gospels research, notably: the milieu in which the gospels were read, copied, and circulated alongside non-canonical gospels; renewed debates about the sources of the gospels and their interrelations; how central gospel themes are illuminated by a variety of critical approaches and theological readings; the reception of the gospels over time and in various media; and how the gospels give insight into the human condition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=07Y8EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Noir Anxiety","description":"Among the elements that define the classic film noir -- chiaroscuro lighting, voice-over narration, and such archetypal characters as the world-weary private eye and the femme fatale -- perhaps no element is more responsible for the genre's continued popularity among movie buffs, filmmakers, and critics than the palpable sense of anxiety that emanates from the screen. Because the genre emerged in the shadow of the Second World War, this profound psychological and philosophical unease is usually ascribed either to postwar fears about the atomic bomb or to the reactions of returning soldiers to a new social landscape. In Noir Anxiety, however, Kelly Oliver and Benigno Trigo interpret what has been called the \\"free-floating anxiety\\" of film noir as concrete apprehensions about race and sexuality. Applying feminist and postcolonial psychoanalytic theory to traditional noir films (Murder, My Sweet; The Lady from Shanghai; Vertigo; and Touch of Evil) and the \\"neo-noirs\\" of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s (Chinatown, Devil in a Blue Dress, and Bound), the authors uncover a rich array of unconscious worries and desires about ambiguous sexual, racial, and national identities, often displaced onto these films' narrative and stylistic components. In particular, Oliver and Trigo focus on the looming absence of the mother figure within the genre and fears about maternal sexuality and miscegenation. Drawing on the work of Freud and Julia Kristeva, Noir Anxiety locates film noir's studied ambivalence toward these critical themes within the genre's social, historical, and cinematic context.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eMSengEACAAJ&dq=Noir+Anxiety&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ships and aircraft of the U.S. fleet","description":"Provides a detailed analysis of the U.S. Navy and gives the history, specifications and tactical role of naval ships and aircraft.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ibobQwAACAAJ&dq=The+ships+and+aircraft+of+the+U.S.+fleet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bedrooms: 30 Instant Bedroom Transformations (Decorating)","description":"Fantastic decorating results with the simplest techniques, including draping, tying stapling, buttoning, hanging and clipping a variety of materials.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DokNAAAACAAJ&dq=Bedrooms:+30+Instant+Bedroom+Transformations+(Decorating)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If He Doesn't Deliver, When Women Have Nowhere to Turn","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zg9MPQAACAAJ&dq=If+He+Doesn%27t+Deliver,+When+Women+Have+Nowhere+to+Turn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Profiles in Character: The Values That Made America","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9zbUxwEACAAJ&dq=Profiles+in+Character:+The+Values+That+Made+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","description":"\\"In this exhaustively researched study, Horigan points several fingers of guilt at Federal authorities for why 'Helmira' had a death rate almost equal to that at Andersonville.

Around 95 percent of all living species died out a global catastrophe far greater than the dinosaurs' demise 185 million years later. How this happened remains a mystery. But there are many competing theories. Some blame huge volcanic eruptions that covered an area as large as the continental United States; others argue for sudden changes in ocean levels and chemistry, including burps of methane gas; and still others cite the impact of an extraterrestrial object, similar to what caused the dinosaurs' extinction. Extinction is a paleontological mystery story. Here, the world's foremost authority on the subject provides a fascinating overview of the evidence for and against a whole host of hypotheses concerning this cataclysmic event that unfolded at the end of the Permian. After setting the scene, Erwin introduces the suite of possible perpetrators and the types of evidence paleontologists seek. He then unveils the actual evidence--moving from China, where much of the best evidence is found; to a look at extinction in the oceans; to the extraordinary fossil animals of the Karoo Desert of South Africa. Erwin reviews the evidence for each of the hypotheses before presenting his own view of what happened. Although full recovery took tens of millions of years, this most massive of mass extinctions was a powerful creative force, setting the stage for the development of the world as we know it today. In a new preface, Douglas Erwin assesses developments in the field since the book's initial publication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BOs9DwAAQBAJ&dq=Extinction:+How+Life+on+Earth+Nearly+Ended+250+Million+Years+Ago&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From the White House Inkwell: American Presidential Autographs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y5waAQAAIAAJ&dq=From+the+White+House+Inkwell:+American+Presidential+Autographs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Embroidery (Klutz)","description":"Everything you need to embroider anything you want: instructions for 11 different embroidery stitches and all the supplies needed to get stitching.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=svbYMgEACAAJ&dq=Simple+Embroidery+(Klutz)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","description":"Kamikaze Lust by first-time novelist Lauren Sanders takes the reader on an electrifying ride through the spectacle of life and death in millennial America.

The chapters are divided into two parts: the phenomenological theory and practical criticism. In making his case, Kaelin traces the development in the American academic tradition from the American New Criticism through structuralism to the French nouvelle critique. He calls his theory phenomenological structuralism, and shows its derivation from American pragmatism (contextualism) to an unabashed phenomenology through the criticisms of Roman Ingarden, Martin Heidegger, and Paul Ricoeur. The structuralism derives from the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, as incorporated into the philosophical linguistics of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Part II contains five chapters, each concerned with either direct application of the theory in acts of criticism, or in the metacriticism of accepted critical theories, such as the Aristotelians of early dramatic critics (Chapter 6), or of applied procedures in recent academic critical circles (Chapter 10). The argument is concluded in the author's Afterword, where pedagogical issues are introduced to suggest the future applicability of the theory. A glossary of technical and new terms is added, and a double index - of names and a subject matter - is included to map out the author's own interpretation of his bibliographic references.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q-B9EAAAQBAJ&dq=Gradiva+(Old+Edition)+(Sun+and+Moon+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Treasury Of Knowledge Book 6, Part 4: Systems Of Buddhist Tantra","description":"In Tibetan religious literature, Jamgon Kongtrul's Treasury of Knowledge stands out as a unique encyclopedic masterpiece embodying the entire range of Buddhist teachings as they were presented in Tibet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9l3YAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Treasury+Of+Knowledge+Book+6,+Part+4:+Systems+Of+Buddhist+Tantra&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McIntyre country: New Zealand landscapes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_dvjAAAACAAJ&dq=McIntyre+country:+New+Zealand+landscapes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 13, 2 Kings","description":"The Word Biblical Commentary delivers the best in biblical scholarship, from the leading scholars of our day who share a commitment to Scripture as divine revelation.

Phil Jordan is a non-religious journalist married to a fervently religious wife Terry, a fundamentalist Christian who was convinced that the end of the world was imminent, and that all true believers will be raptured before the period of The Tribulation and taken up to Heaven where they would sit out the suffering and death that was going to be visited on mankind. She was distressed that her husband did not share her believe and therefore destined to live through the painful experience of the period of tribulation and most probably spend eternity in Hell. To Phil, it was just the same old meaningless fantasy he had being hearing since Sunday School. Real life was different. From his vantage point as a distinguished journalist covering world events in all the major seats of power, things looked different. Why, he knew almost all the people that mattered. It even seemed ridiculously hysterical when Terry referred to his best friend in college as the Anti-Christ. He stopped listening to her then. Times End is written as his eye-witness recollection of the events leading up to and after the Rapture, when it finally did come. He lived through the Tribulation, Armageddon and the second coming of Christ.

Written by her mother, Nancy Aniston, this tender, poetic, and charming memoir represents a healing exercise, and most importantly serves as an example of how to cope with and understand estrangement between parent and child. During the meteoric rise of Jennifer's popularity on the hit television comedy 'Friends', Nancy and her daughter had a misunderstanding imposed on them by a tabloid TV report. In the three years since they last spoke, Nancy learned that separation from grown children is a national epidemic and that scores of parents suffer the same feelings of pain, guilt, and shame. This knowledge inspired Nancy Aniston to record family memories in this compelling volume, \\"and in the process of detailed retrospection a miraculous healing took place\\". Nancy chronicles her own childhood of poverty, abandonment, failed marriages, and the difficult early years as a single mother. She recalls Jennifer's early love for the theatre, the therapists, career managers, and hangers-on who endangered family bonds as she guided her daughter through the exciting, sometimes disappointing, stages of an acting career that came to realise phenomenal success. While refusing the lure of celebrity gossip, Nancy Aniston strives to secure her story's inherent dignity, hoping it will be helpful to those trying to overcome their own childhood trauma, fallout from divorce, single-parenting issues, and the \\"dark hole of child/parent estrangement\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zwf8ehDcysoC&dq=From+Mother+and+Daughter+to+Friends:+A+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NASB Update Side-Column Reference; Black Genuine Leather; Indexed","description":"NASB Side-column Reference Wide Margin Bible, Genuine Leather, Black, 863W","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I3WKngEACAAJ&dq=NASB+Update+Side-Column+Reference%3B+Black+Genuine+Leather%3B+Indexed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Feeling Soul: A Roadmap to Healing and Living","description":"The Feeling Soul provides you with a personal and well researched approach to increasing your ability to respond to difficulties and improve your emotional self-health.

But despite years of analysis of this failure, no consensus has been reached as to how to realistically address it. Taking a new approach to these issues, Marcos Pizarro goes directly to Chicana/o students in both urban and rural school districts to ask what their school experiences are really like, how teachers and administrators support or thwart their educational aspirations, and how schools could better serve their Chicana/o students. In this accessible, from-the-trenches account of the Chicana/o school experience, Marcos Pizarro makes the case that racial identity formation is the crucial variable in Chicana/o students' success or failure in school. He draws on the insights of students in East Los Angeles and rural Washington State, as well as years of research and activism in public education, to demonstrate that Chicana/o students face the daunting challenge of forming a positive sense of racial identity within an educational system that unintentionally yet consistently holds them to low standards because of their race. From his analysis of this systemic problem, he develops a model for understanding the process of racialization and for empowering Chicana/o students to succeed in school that can be used by teachers, school administrators, parents, community members, and students themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VQ7UAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sandino Affair","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mvkpAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Sandino+Affair&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raintree County","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=loQwvwEACAAJ&dq=Raintree+County&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Varieties of Conservatism in America (HOOVER INST PRESS PUBLICATION)","description":"This book examines the questions that divide conservatives today and reveals the variety of answers put forward by classical conservatives, libertarians, and neoconservatives.

Armageddon and the Second Coming of Christ will be very soon in the future, although neither myself, nor anyone else on earth, can say that they know in which day that will happen. This is because Jesus told us Himself, in the New Testament, that no man knows that day and hour, except my Father in heaven. I can attest, though, that I have had a number of angelic visits and also visions from the Lord, and in these pages I relate those experiences. I do not ask that you believe all, or any part, of my book. What has happened to me has been nearly unbelievable to myself. I cannot expect you to believe simply by my words. All that I do ask, though, is that you read and listen for your own self and you will receive all proof of my claims in the near future. It is my hope that you will have this information when you most need it -- during Armageddon. Many of you will fare much better by far to have this information now, while you can study and read it, then later, when earthquakes and all sorts of havoc are happening around some of you. Always remember that, even though there will be a time of havoc, afterwards the Lord will return for the Resurrection and life will be very beautiful, in heaven and on earth.

Now, in The Force of Character, Hillman brings the idea of character full circle, offering a revolutionary new vision of life's most feared and misunderstood chapter: old age. \\"Aging is no accident,\\" Hillman writes. \\"It is necessary to the human condition, intended by the soul.\\" We become more characteristic of who we are simply by lasting into later years; the older we become, the more our true natures emerge. Thus the final years have a very important purpose: the fulfillment and confirmation of one's character. Contrary to the current genetic determinism that sees increased longevity as a wasted aberrance created by civilization, The Force of Character presents an explosive new thesis: The changes of old age, even the debilitating ones, have purposes and values organized by the psyche. Memory for recent events may falter, offering more place for long-term recollections. A heart condition in later life brings an opportunity to remove blockages from constricted relationships, while changes in sleep patterns allow the old to experience the profound elements of nighttime that we usually overlook. As Hillman says, \\"Aging makes metaphors of biology.\\" In this empowering and original work, James Hillman resurrects the ancient, widespread, and socially effective idea of the old person as \\"ancestor,\\" a model for the young, the bearer of a society's cultural memory and traditions. America disregards old people who aren't young-acting and young-looking. We don't realize that \\"oldness\\" is an archetypal state of being that can add value and luster to things we treasure, places we revere, and people's character. When we open our imaginations to the idea of the ancestor, aging can free us from convention and transform us into a force of nature, releasing our deepest beliefs for the benefit of society. For all who read it, The Force of Character will be a seminal, life-affirming experience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mAInT41WvEAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena, Volume 19 (Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Waterborn (Children of the Changeling Ser., 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LfjiAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Waterborn+(Children+of+the+Changeling+Ser.,+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Franchise","description":"This comprehensively researched and deftly written franchise guide brings together experience and fact to give you the tools you need to understand which franchise is right for you.

His reading of Christianity is explicitly political, discerning in the Pauline community of believers the first version of a revolutionary collective. Since today even advocates of Enlightenment like Jurgen Habermas acknowledge that a religious vision is needed to ground our ethical and political stance in a \\"postsecular\\" age, this book with a stance that is clearly materialist and at the same time indebted to the core of the Christian legacy is certain to stir controversy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TL74DwAAQBAJ&dq=Puppet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moths of the Limberlost: With water color and photographic illustrations from life","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uIdos1R46Q0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World War I (American War Series)","description":"Profiles people involved in World War I, including both political and military leaders on both sides of the conflict.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QVeW2pUfGaIC&dq=World+War+I+(American+War+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Punjabi Century 1857-1947","description":"An important document in the social history of India, this volume presents the autobiography of a Punjabi family over the three tumultuous generations that spanned years from the Mutiny to Independence.

Taking its title from the Spaniard Jorge Manrique's most famous elegy, this collection is a meditation on time, memory, and the fleeting nature of life. Smith-Soto exercises the artist's prerogative to give shape to his experience, reaching beyond the merely autobiographical to explore the rich complexities of his cultural heritage in lyrics as varied and technically accomplished as they are heart-felt. Born in his father's hometown of Washington, D.C., and raised in Costa Rica until the age of eleven, Smith-Soto is representative of a large number of U.S. writers who fall outside the conventional definitions of the Hispanic. His poems are imbued with the sights, sounds, smells, and textures of his family-rich childhood in Costa Rica. Compelling and clear yet mysterious, his poems add a new and passionate voice to the growing chorus of Latino American poets today. Mark Smith-Soto is professor of romance languages at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. He has published two poetry collections: Green Mango Collage, winner of the North Carolina Writers' Network Persephone Chapbook Publication Prize, and Shafts, winner of the 2002 Randall Jarrell/Harperprints Poetry Chapbook Competition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U6hsQgAACAAJ&dq=Our+Lives+Are+Rivers+(Contemporary+Poetry+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Wise the Simple: The Torah in Christian Faith and Practice","description":"Too long restricted to children's storybooks and cinematic extravaganzas, the Torah -- comprising the first five books of the Bible -- is an underappreciated mother lode of divine instruction, vitally important for Christians and the church. Convinced that both those who take the Torah too literally and those who neglect it are guilty of a naive simplicity, Johanna van Wijk-Bos presents guidelines to help ordinary Christians recover this treasure in their faith and practice. Having lived in the Netherlands during the Nazi occupation, van Wijk-Bos recognizes that after the attempted annihilation of the Jews from Christian Europe, it cannot be business as usual for Christianity. In light of the Holocaust, Christians must commit themselves to the restoration of just relations between Christians and Jews. This commitment to address all that fractures human relations undergirds van Wijk-Bos's call for Christians to reengage the Torah. Making Wise the Simple points out how God's care for and engagement with the whole world in the Torah set the tone for the entire biblical story. The book pays special attention to how our treatment of strangers lies at the heart of the Torah's teaching. Without attempting a purely Jewish reading of the Torah, van Wijk-Bos reclaims the Torah as a vibrant word for the Christian community in covenant with God. Written in a personal style conversant with current scholarship but sprinkled with anecdotes, this book is for everyone who has a hunger and enthusiasm for what the biblical text may convey, the courage to ask disturbing questions of the text, and an openness to old words that may bring forth new things, perhaps even making one wise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aHBG2W_whKMC&dq=Making+Wise+the+Simple:+The+Torah+in+Christian+Faith+and+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picture power: authors of \\"Going Visual\\" show how to harness the impact of images.(Going Visual: Using Images to Enhance Productivity, Decision Making, and Profits): An article from: Photo Marketing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zSXP2Bg0LEkC&dq=Picture+power:+authors+of+%22Going+Visual%22+show+how+to+harness+the+impact+of+images.(Going+Visual:+Using+Images+to+Enhance+Productivity,+Decision+Making,+and+Profits):+An+article+from:+Photo+Marketing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shibori: The Inventive Art of Japanese Shaped Resist Dyeing : Tradition Techniques Innovation","description":"Potential for creating designs in textiles can be seen even in the physical properties of cloth. The simple fact that cloth tightly compressed into wrinkles or folds resists the penetration of dye is an opportunity an opportunity to let the pliancy of textiles speak in making designs and patterns. People around the world have recognized this opportunity, producing resist designs in textiles by shaping and then securing cloth in various ways before dyeing. Yet in no other country has the creative potential of this basic principle been understood and applied as it has in Japan. Here, in fact, it has been expanded into a whole family of traditional resist techniques, involving first shaping the cloth by plucking, pinching, twisting, stitching, folding, pleating, and wrapping it, and then securing the shapes thus made by binding, looping, knotting, clamping, and the like. This entire family of techniques is called shibori. Designs created with shibori processes all share a softness of outline and spontaneity of effect. Spontaneity is shibori's special magic, made possible by exploiting the beauty of the fortuitous things that happen when dye enters shaped cloth. Usually it is in response to the fact that a craft is being lost that the need for preserving and documenting it arises. The motivation behind this book is no exception, but the authors have gone far beyond simple documentation. Extensive research and experimentation have led to the revival here of shibori techniques that were once well known but have now been largely forgotten in Japan. In addition to more conventional techniques, the work of contemporary fiber artists in Japan and abroad in shibori textile art and wearable art is presented, to suggest the extent of the creative innovation possible. The 104 color and 298 black-and-white plates include a photographic Gallery of Shibori Examples, based on Japan's largest collection of traditional shibori fabrics. Included also are a detailed guide to basic natural dyes used in Japan, the making and care of an indigo vat, and a list of suppliers in North America, as well as a glossary and bibliography. Now available in paperback, this full documentation of one of the world's most inventive and exciting dyeing techniques continues as a classic in the textile field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x51NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Shibori:+The+Inventive+Art+of+Japanese+Shaped+Resist+Dyeing+:+Tradition+Techniques+Innovation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scotch, the Whisky of Scotland in Fact and Story","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XnBCxwEACAAJ&dq=Scotch,+the+Whisky+of+Scotland+in+Fact+and+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE DRAMATIZED OLD TESTAMENT - Two Volume Set - the Old Testament in Drama and Narrative - New International Version","description":"Those of us hearing a \\"Well Told Story\\" may become more aware of the Implications of that story than by a mere recital of facts.

In the understanding and presentation of the Christian faith, \\"Story\\" is considered as a \\"fundamental category of reality.\\" It is the perfect vehicle for presenting the Good News of the Gospel.\\" (John Paul Roth) The presentation of real events in story form preserves the remembrance of reality without limiting its implications to the mere recording of historical facts.

At times, as in the early days of the Korean and Vietnam Wars and in the Falklands conflict, carriers alone could deploy high-performance aircraft to the battlefield. In other operations, such as enforcing the no-fly zones and the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, only carriers could provide the bases needed for sustained combat and support operations. This second volume of Norman Polmar's landmark study details the role of carriers in the unification of the U.S. armed forces and strategic deterrence, fiscally constrained Great Britain, the development of British Commonwealth and ex-colonial navies, and the efforts of France and the Netherlands to rebuild their fleets. The role of the modern carrier-nine nations currently possess them-is discussed, as are the issues confronting nations that might acquire them. Chapters on the Soviet Union's effort to produce carriers are included for the first time. The development of both carrier planes and the many \\"oddball\\" aircraft that have flown from carriers-such as the U-2 spy plane-are also examined. Appendixes include comprehensive data on all carriers built and converted through 2006. This volume is a valuable companion to the critically acclaimed Volume I, which covers aircraft carrier development and operations from 1909 to 1945.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6z7quhWS-BoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Is A Mirror","description":"In the mixed days of happiness and sadness, life and death, an African-American woman guides her children to avoid the pitfalls of their hardship environment and leap over the systematic roadblocks that confine many to juvenile delinquency.

Manipulation. Murder. Cults are associated with all of these. But what really goes on inside them? More specifically, what goes on inside the minds of cult leaders and the people who join them? Based on the hit podcast Cults, this is essential reading for any true crime fan. Cults prey on the very attributes that make us human: our desire to belong; to find a deeper meaning in life; to live everyday with divine purpose. Their existence creates a sense that any one of us, at any time, could step off the cliff s edge and fall into that daunting abyss of manipulation and unhinged dedication to a misplaced cause. Perhaps it s this mindset that keeps us so utterly obsessed and desperate to learn more, or it s that the stories are so bizarre and unsettling that we are simply in awe of the mechanics that make these infamous groups tick. The premier storytelling podcast studio Parcast has been focusing on unearthing these mechanics the cult leaders and followers, and the world and culture that gave birth to both. Parcast s work in analyzing dozens of case studies has revealed patterns: distinct ways that cult leaders from different generations resemble one another. What links the ten notorious figures profiled in Cults are as disturbing as they are stunning from Manson to Applewhite, Koresh to Ra?l, the stories woven here are both spellbinding and disturbing. Cults is more than just a compilation of grisly biographies, however. In these pages, Parcast s founder Max Cutler and national bestselling author Kevin Conley look closely at the lives of some of the most disreputable cult figures and tell the stories of their rise to power and fall from grace, sanity, and decency. Beyond that, it is a study of humanity, an unflinching look at what happens when the most vulnerable recesses of the mind are manipulated and how the things we hold most sacred can be twisted into the lowest form of malevolence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7inODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Women","description":"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * #1 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER * #1 INDIE NEXT PICK Named a Best Book of the Year: The Washington Post * NPR * The Atlantic * New York Public Library * Vanity Fair * PBS * Time * Economist * Entertainment Weekly * Financial Times * Shelf Awareness * Guardian * Sunday Times * BBC * Esquire * Good Housekeeping * Elle * Real Simple * And more than twenty additional outlets  Staggeringly intimate...Taddeo spent eight years reporting this groundbreaking book.

A Memphis Beau Brummel even before he found fame, Elvis had a personal style that, like his music, had such a direct impact on his audience that it continues to influence us to this day. Elvis Presley compellingly examines Elvis' life and style to reveal the generous, complex, spiritual man behind the fourteen-carat-gold sunglasses and answers the question, \\"Why does Elvis matter?\\" \\"Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century,\\" proclaimed Leonard Bernstein. By any measure, Presley's life was remarkable. From his modest beginnings in a two-room house to his meteoric rise to international fame, everything about his life -- his outsized talent to his car collection -- clamored for attention. And he got it; even today, Elvis continues to fascinate. Written with the assistance of Elvis Presley Enterprises, Pamela Clarke Keogh's biography draws on extensive research and interviews with Presley friends and family, among them Priscilla Presley, Joe Esposito, Jerry Schilling, Larry Geller, Bernard Lansky, famed Hollywood photographer Bob Willoughby, and designer Bill Belew. Offered access to the Graceland archives, the author considered thousands of images, selecting more than one hundred color and black-and-white photographs for this book, many of them rarely seen before.

Although best known for his short stories, Edgar Allan Poe was by nature and choice a poet. From his exquisite lyric  To Helen,  to his immortal masterpieces,  Annabel Lee,   The Bells,  and  The Raven,  Poe stands beside the celebrated English romantic poets Shelley, Byron, and Keats, and his haunting, sensuous poetic vision profoundly influenced the Victorian giants Swinburne, Tennyson, and Rossetti. Today his dark side speaks eloquently to contemporary readers in poems such as  The Haunted Palace  and  The Conqueror Worm,  with their powerful images of madness and the macabre. But even at the end of his life, Poe reached out to his art for comfort and courage, giving us in  Eldorado  a talisman to hold during our darkest moments a timeless gift from a great American writer.

Ruiz cambia la manera en la que nos percibimos a nosotros mismos y a los dem s. Despu s, abre la puerta a una realidad que percib amos cuando s lo ten amos uno o dos a?os de edad: una realidad de verdad, amor y dicha.  Nacemos en la verdad, pero crecemos creyendo en mentiras. . . . Una de las mayores mentiras de la historia de la humanidad es la mentira de nuestra imperfecci n.    don Miguel Ruiz M s sobre el libro Antes de aprender a hablar, nuestra verdadera naturaleza es la de amar, ser felices, explorar y disfrutar la vida. Escuchamos la voz silenciosa de nuestra integridad. Una vez que aprendemos a hablar, las personas que nos rodean captan nuestra atenci n y nos programan con conocimiento. Pero ese conocimiento est  contaminado por las mentiras. Al centrar nuestra atenci n en el conocimiento que est  en nuestra cabeza, dejamos de percibir el mundo a trav s de los ojos del amor; s lo percibimos lo que hemos aprendido a creer. Estamos a merced de la voz del conocimiento. Esa voz no para de hablar, de juzgar, de chismorrear, y de maltratarnos. Sabotea nuestra felicidad y nos impide disfrutar de una realidad basada en la verdad y el amor. Ruiz nos ense?a a recobrar la voz silenciosa de nuestra integridad y a encontrar la paz interior. Cuando la voz del conocimiento deja de controlarnos, nuestra vida se convierte en una expresi n de nuestro yo aut ntico, tal como era antes de que aprendi ramos a hablar. Entonces, regresamos a la verdad, al amor, y vivimos de nuevo en la felicidad.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wk1LEAAAQBAJ&dq=La+voz+del+conocimiento:+Una+guia+practica+para+la+paz+interior+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Amboy Dukes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t2tKAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Amboy+Dukes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Practice of Everyday Life (v. 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Captain North's Three Biggest Cases","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MFdDAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trolls","description":"Aunt Sally is beyond any of Melissa, Amanda, and Pee Wee's expectations.

This view is based on the history of risk management being control focused. However, risk management has evolved rapidly to address the more strategic issue of optimization of return on risk. This evolutions has been accompanied by statistical, mathematical and financial techniques which, when actively applied, can produce disproportionately high return on risk. Given that financial institutions will have to make significant investments in their risk management systems to comply with the regulatory capital calculation requirements of BIS II, the book shows how to leverage this investment to extract shareholder value. Key concepts illustrated and explained in detail include: Opportunity costs of capital Economic profit Risk adjusted returns on capital Economic capital measurement and their relationship to economic capital allocation Capital structuring Capital budgeting The use of risk adjusted performance information in the formulation of management strategies that seek to optimize return to shareholders are discussed in depth and illustrated by practical case studies of several leading financial institutions. Finally, practical incentive and technology challenges are addressed and pragmatic recommendations for overcoming these challenges are given. The book aims to describe these techniques, illustrate their application, and discuss their strategic value in the management of financial institutions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wl3uAAAAMAAJ&dq=Value+Added+Risk+Management+in+Financial+Institutions:+Leveraging+Basel+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Perspectives on Microsoft Excel 2002 - Introductory","description":"Part of the New Perspectives series, this text offers a case-based, problem-solving approach and innovative technology for meaningful learning of Microsoft Excel 2002.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PPleJ49esdoC&dq=New+Perspectives+on+Microsoft+Excel+2002+-+Introductory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heavy Lifting: the Job Of the American Legislature","description":"What makes for a  good  legislature?

Head of the Lubavitcher movement for forty-four years and recognized throughout the world simply as  the Rebbe,  Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who passed away in June 1994, was a sage and a visionary of the highest order. Toward a Meaningful Life gives people of all backgrounds fresh perspectives on every aspect of their lives from birth to death, youth to old age; marriage, love, intimacy, and family; the persistent issues of career, health, pain, and suffering; and education, faith, science, and government. We learn to bridge the divisions between accelerated technology and decelerated morality, between unprecedented worldwide unity and unparalleled personal disunity. Although the Rebbe s teachings are firmly anchored in more than three thousand years of scholarship, the urgent relevance of these old-age truths to contemporary life has never been more manifest. At the threshold of a new world where matter and spirit converge, the Rebbe proposes spiritual principles that unite people as opposed to the materialism that divides them. In doing so, he continues to lead us toward personal and universal redemption, toward a meaningful life, and toward God.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EEK0dEUKfHgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lose It for Life for Teens","description":"Weight is such a critical issue with teenagers.

As Watson puts it, \\"Our life is military. Christ is our Captain, the gospel is the banner, the graces are our spiritual artillery, and heaven is only taken in a forcible way.\\" In his typically heart-searching style, replete with practical illustrations and gripping remarks, Watson describes how the Christian is to take the kingdom of heaven by holy violence through the reading and exposition of Scripture, prayer, meditation, self-examination, conversation, and the sanctification of the Lord's Day. Moreover, he poignantly calls the believer to be vigilant against the flesh, Satan, and the world. Soldiers of Christ will find this a practical handbook on Christian living.

Many of the poems contained here appear for the first time. The sensuous lyricism of the English tradition and the classic austerity of philosophical discourse are brought together in this poetry in a way that is unique in our time. A master of rhyme and meter, Weinfield's sonnets, tercets, and rhyme royal fall upon the ear with rare grace. Brilliantly allusive in their frames of reference, they are woven from the stuff of Dante, Shakespeare, and Shelley; Plato, Genesis, and the Book of Job. Yet Weinfield is also given to the kind of rigorous intellectual speculation that one usually associates with poets such as William Bronk or George Oppen, and a refined process of abstraction never fails to give the work an utterly contemporary edge. His subject matter is equally challenging; here are poems about political violence, the anomie of the postmodern city, the bittersweet disasters of the erotic life. Powerfully chastening, these poems nevertheless can comfort, charm, and delight; they are \\"The luminous and liquid solacings/That language proffers us against the void\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1oJbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Sorrows+of+Eros+and+Other+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rivers of Ireland","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bpkSAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","description":"This graduate textbook covers topics in statistical theory essential for graduate students preparing for work on a Ph.D. degree in statistics.

The result is that there is not one Great Brahmin, but many.

Once again, they are poised to influence a new generation of herpetologists and herpetoculturists.\\"--Gregory C. Lepera, curator of herpetology, Jacksonville Zoological Gardens \\"This book belongs in the field pack, under the front seat of the car, or on a table near the door where it can be consulted quickly to identify the rapidly retreating snake on the road, canal bank, hiking trail, or backyard.\\"--Richard Franz, Florida Museum of Natural History Because Florida's human population has increased so dramatically over the past three decades, residents are more likely than ever to encounter a snake or legless lizard. This book is designed to dispel some of the apprehension from these encounters by providing a comprehensive, illustrated guide to the 86 species and subspecies of snakes and legless lizards living within the state. Each reptile is illustrated with a color photograph accompanied by a range map detailing where it can be found. The descriptions of each animal provide specific details on appearance, size, behavior, and venomous qualities. Additional text addresses captive care, how to find snakes, legal issues, reproduction modes, prey and prey procurement, and an explanation of classification. Because of introduced species, there are actually more snake species living in the state today than when Florida was truly wild. The 2-to-6-foot snakes are most commonly encountered, such as the green snake, yellow rat snake, and diamond'backed rattlesnake, but Florida's ophidiofauna range in size from the earthworm'sized Brahminy blind snake (also called the flowerpot snake, after one of its favorite habitats) to the Burmese python, which reaches a length of 15 feet or more. Both are introduced species. This is the only field guide for Florida snakes that includes native along with introduced and established species and commonly seen but not yet established species. Its handy format and comprehensive coverage provide identification for species anywhere in Florida as well as in adjacent areas of neighboring states. R.D. Bartlett is the author of many books, including In Search of Reptiles and Amphibians and Popular Boas and Pythons, and has published more than 500 articles about herpetology in such magazines as Tropical Fish Hobbyist, Reptiles, and Reptile and Amphibian.

The most important thing that he did was to define this struggle as something more than one between parties, to emphasize the fact that human free dom itself was at stake. This he did in private, not public, and political considerations were mingled with philosophical in his own mind; but by encouraging his own followers to battle in the name of freedom he served both his party and his country well. The times called for the faith and patience with which he was so abundantly supplied. He remained a fitting symbol of republicanism, national independence, and individual liberties, for he embodied the spirit of 1776 as well as any civilian could. Indeed, it may be contended that his importance as a party leader in these bitter years, as in those immediately preceding them, lay less in what he did than in what he was. It should be noted, however, that the image of him which the Federalists sought to impress on the public mind was far from a good likeness of the man himself.

He describes how the so-called euthanasia of the handicapped provided a practical model for the later mass murder, thereby initiating the Holocaust. The Nazi regime pursued the extermination of Jews, Gypsies, and the handicapped based on a belief in the biological, and thus absolute, inferiority of those groups. To document the connection between the assault on the handicapped and the Final Solution, Friedlander shows how the legal restrictions and exclusionary policies of the 1930s, including mass sterilization, led to mass murder during the war. He also makes clear that the killing centers where the handicapped were gassed and cremated served as the models for the extermination camps. Based on extensive archival research, the book also analyzes the involvement of the German bureaucracy and judiciary, the participation of physicians and scientists, and the nature of popular opposition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xKjqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El-Hazard Role-Playing Game And Resource Book","description":"Serves as the only complete bibliography on comic art for the 87 countries discussed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yBMRV58IQD8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Danny Goodman's Applescript Handbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CY6GOQAACAAJ&dq=Danny+Goodman%27s+Applescript+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Funeral Rites","description":"Contains sections from the Order of Christian Funerals, Vigil for the Deceased and Rite of Committal.

But though Pop Art became synonymous with Warhol s name and dominated the public s image of him, his life and work are infinitely more complex and multi-faceted than that. In Warhol, esteemed art critic Blake Gopnik takes on Andy Warhol in all his depth and dimensions.  The meanings of his art depend on the way he lived and who he was,  as Gopnik writes.  That s why the details of his biography matter more than for almost any cultural figure,  from his working-class Pittsburgh upbringing as the child of immigrants to his early career in commercial art to his total immersion in the  performance  of being an artist, accompanied by global fame and stardom and his attempted assassination. The extent and range of Warhol s success, and his deliberate attempts to thwart his biographers, means that it hasn t been easy to put together an accurate or complete image of him. But in this biography, unprecedented in its scope and detail as well as in its access to Warhol s archives, Gopnik brings to life a figure who continues to fascinate because of his contradictions he was known as sweet and caring to his loved ones but also a coldhearted manipulator; a deep-thinking avant-gardist but also a true lover of schlock and kitsch; a faithful churchgoer but also an eager sinner, skeptic, and cynic. Wide-ranging and immersive, Warhol gives us the most robust and intricate picture to date of a man and an artist who consistently defied easy categorization and whose life and work continue to profoundly affect our culture and society today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W12kDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World Lived Within Me","description":"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ?

Publishers Weekly In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of  race,  a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden? Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son and readers the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TV05BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sweet Nothings","description":"Discover why readers and critics have called the Coulter family novels  romantic through and through  (Publishers Weekly) with this poignant contemporary romance from New York Times bestselling author Catherine Anderson.

As the train rumbled down a shor hill between Prospect Park and Ebbets Field in the very heart of Brooklyn, the unthinkable happened: the motorman lost control and the train left the tracks as it curved into a tunnel at the foot of the hill. The ensuing disaster, known ever since as the Malbone Street Wreck, took the lives of almost a hundred people and stands as the worst mass-transit accident in U.S. History. Unlike the Titanic disaster, however, the Malbone Street Wreck has received scant attention from scholars and historians over the years. As is so often the case, popular accounts of the tragedy have managed to enshrine as dogma thinkgs that are absolutely untrue. Now, Fordham University Press is proud to present Brian J. Cudahy's long-awaited account of the Malbone Street Wreck, a book that recounts the events leading up to the disaster, describes the faithful trip from its beginning to end, and reviews efforts conducted after the tragedy to fix blame and establish liability. Could the Malbone Stret Wreck have been avoided? Clearly yes, is Cudahy's answer. Had any number of factors not combined in precisely the way that they did, the five-car train might have well continued its journey to Brighton Beach in a completely uneventful manner. But they did happen exactly as they happened, and that is why The Malbone Street Wreck makes such arresting reading. Could another Malbone Street Wreck happen at some future time in New York, or on any other U.S. Mass Transit System? Transit professionals will have to answer this question after they read Cudahy's account of how and why November 1, 1918 has become such an important day in transportation history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KWaUzAEACAAJ&dq=The+Malbone+Street+Wreck&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jung and the Jungians on myth: An introduction (Theorists of myth)","description":"First Published in 2002.

An old landlady in Vancouver who alarms the just-married narrator with her prim advice about married life  and  the peculiar threat  of a china cabinet that must be washed once a month  is shown to have conspired when young in a crime of passion. A young mother, at the mercy of the  radiant explosion  that comes when she thinks of her secret life, abandons her baby and four-year old to be with her lover in the story  The Children Stay.  A gruff old country doctor in the 1960s is discovered by his daughter to be helping desperate women, his  special patients.  An impetuous young woman meets a visiting Indian student and conceives on a train from Vancouver to Toronto because of  the fact that you couldn t get condoms around the Calgary station, not for love or money.  An Ontario farm wife s affair drives her husband to commit a murder; its discovery, years later, will act as a negotiating point for a new, presumably satisfactory, marriage. The book is clear-eyed about the imperfections of marriage, the clutter of our emotional lives, and the impermanence of love:  Not that that was the end. For we did make up. But we didn t forgive each other.  Even the shared memories of earlier times prove to be a minefield, and many of the stories track the changes that time brings over generations to families, lovers, and even to friends who share old, intimate secrets about  the prostration of love.  As always these stories by Alice Munro are shot through with humour, and are as rich as novels. As always the characters in the stories are easily, sometimes uncomfortably, recognizable as people like us. One quote summarizes the delightful surprises that await the reader:  Did you ever think that people s lives could be like that and end up like this? Well, they can.

Traveling with an unwieldy pack and a keen curiosity, Christopher Wren bids farewell to the New York Times newsroom in midtown Manhattan and saunters up Broadway, through Harlem, the Bronx, and the affluent New York suburbs of Westchester and Putnam Counties. As his trek takes him into the Housatonic River Valley of Connecticut, the Berkshires of Massachusetts, the Green Mountains of Vermont, and along a bucolic riverbank in New Hampshire, the strenuous challenges become as much emotional as physical. Wren loses his way in a suburban thicket of million-dollar mansions, dodges speeding motorists, seeks serenity at a convent, shivers through a rainy night among Shaker ruins, camps in a stranger's backyard, panhandles cookies and water from a good samaritan, absorbs the lore of the Appalachian and Long Trails, sweats up and down mountains, and lands in a hospital emergency room. Struggling under the weight of a fifty-pound pack, he gripes, \\"We might grow less addicted to stuff if everything we bought had to be carried on our backs.\\" He hangs out with fellow wanderers named Old Rabbit, Flash, Gatorman, Stray Dog, and Buzzard, and learns gratitude from the anonymous charity of trail angels. His rite of passage into retirement, with its heat and dust and blisters galore, evokes vivid reminiscences of earlier risks taken, sometimes at gunpoint, during his years spent reporting from Russia, China, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, South America, and Africa. He loses track of time, waking with the sun, stopping to eat when hunger gnaws, and camping under starry skies that transform the nights of solitude. For all the self-inflicted hardship, he reports, \\"In fact, I felt pretty good.\\" Wren has woven an intensely personal story that is candid and often downright hilarious. As Vermont turns from a destination into a state of mind, he concludes, \\"I had stumbled upon the secret of how utterly irrelevant chronological age is.\\" This book, from the author of the acclaimed bestseller The Cat Who Covered the World, will delight not just hikers, walkers, and other lovers of the outdoors, but also anyone who contemplates retirement, wonders about foreign correspondents, or relishes a lively, off-beat adventure, even when it unfolds close to home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tr7yyQEACAAJ&dq=Walking+to+Vermont:+From+Times+Square+into+the+Green+Mountains+--+a+Homeward+Adventure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heritage of French Cooking","description":"A celebration of Old World French cookery traces the history of French cuisine through the ages, reveals traditional culinary secrets, offers historical tidbits and lore, and includes 150 recipes","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bAMJAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Heritage+of+French+Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dissecting Marilyn Manson","description":"In Dissecting Marilyn Manson, author Gavin Baddeley performs a cultural autopsy upon Manson, examining the seminal influences and psychotic sources that have gone into making him the Frankenstein monster that he is today.

Dissecting Marilyn Manson offers the legion of dedicated Manson fans an alternative look into his macabre and twisted world. This revised and updated edition continues dissecting up to the present day, analysing recent developments in Manson s professional and private life, including his recent high-profile court case, marriage to fetish model Dita Von Teese, and creative forays into the worlds of art and film.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HKt_DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Balance Sheet Recession: Japan's Struggle with Uncharted Economics and its Global Implications","description":"In this groundbreaking book, leading international economist, Richard Koo argues that far from being the sick man of Asia, Japan is suffering from a temporary but highly unusual economic aberration. Economists and business commentators have always assumed that the majority of companies in any economy are forward looking and are trying to maximize profits. They never considered the possibility that a vast majority of companies may be placing their highest priorities on minimizing debt in order to repair their balance sheets. But that remote possibility has been the reality in Japan for the past decade, and more recently in many other countries including at least a part of the US. Balance Sheet Recession argues that contrary to popular belief, it is this massive shift in corporate behavior, instead of structural problems, that is the root cause of both the deflation and the non-performing loan problems that have troubled Japan for so long. It argues that when the causality runs from the corporate balance sheet problems to deflation and banking problems, a highly unconventional policy response is needed to stabilize the economy. After all, the last time anything similar has happened was the 1930s in the US. Richard Koo's experience in dealing with both the US banking crisis of the early 1980s and the Japanese balance sheet and banking problems of the last ten years makes him unique qualified to comment on this situation. He clearly explains how such a recession can happen in any economy following an asset price bubble, and how best to deal with it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dkS5AAAAIAAJ&dq=Balance+Sheet+Recession:+Japan%27s+Struggle+with+Uncharted+Economics+and+its+Global+Implications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Penthouse Adult Magazine: January 1982","description":"Prologue: Naked ladies and ice cream bars -- Introduction: Smaller than life : adult video, pleasure, and control -- Panorams, motels, and pirates: the origins of adult video -- Adult video news: selling xxx without the sex -- The means of production: vivid video and femme productions -- Solidifying shame: community standards, regulation, and adult video -- Epilogue: one last thing : limousines and legacies","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PaswDwAAQBAJ&dq=Penthouse+Adult+Magazine:+January+1982&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Complete Coffee Book: A Gourmet Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Cooking","description":"Let Sara Perry guide you into the rich, aromatic world of coffee.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ixOUUoLWwEsC&dq=The+New+Complete+Coffee+Book:+A+Gourmet+Guide+to+Buying,+Brewing,+and+Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Minotaur","description":"From a New York Timesbestselling author: A military pilot is entangled in the hunt for a Cold War spy selling high-tech secrets to the USSR.

Whether the issue is the increasing number of natural disasters, disparities between rich and poor, or failure of governance to solve problems, the author delves into the revival of the ancient worldviews that focused on the sacredness of everything human beings pursue. In returning to this traditional worldview, and extracting its beneficial elements, the world and its unique cultures can readily reshape the planet through conscious, decentralized efforts. These must infuse all members of each culture with a renewed sense that they are indeed sacred individuals who possess a sacred responsibility to each and every thought and act to maintain inner and outer balance, harmony, and unity. Through such an interconnected cultural philosophy, implemented within each unique cultural definition, plus a globally-agreed upon general philosophy of sacredness, all problems can be approached and solved in order to create a sacred future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9QjRwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Healing+of+Satanically+Ritually+Abused+Multiple+Personality+Disorder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","description":"undefined","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j8ZlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Gumshoe+Gorilla&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Year College Student Guide to Creating a Great Resume","description":"There is a Way to significantly increase your chances for landing a great job with a well known and respected employer.

In contrast to this voluntary thought control process is the unadjusted person. Cast in the mold of great individualists from Thomas More to Friedrich Nietzsche, such a person responds to fundamental values of conscience rather than conformity built exclusively on ego gratification and icon worship. Viereck's book is a stinging critique of the liberal presumption of a monopoly in critical thought. He argues to the contrary, that most varieties of liberal expression offer little else than the common platitude dressed up as critique. In such a cultural environment, conservatism is the skeleton in the liberal closet. The virtue of conservatism is that in its very stress on liberty as dependent on tradition and law, it permits the human being an opportunity to test all transient things by the touchstone of all lasting ideas. \\"Unadjusted Man\\" cuts deep and in many directions: against left totalitarian regimes of Europe and right wannabes like McCarthyism in America. For Viereck, the art of conserving is not an embrace of utopias to come or empires that were, but retaining the sense of individuality over against the senselessness of the \\"massman.\\" Civil liberties in this approach are a right to non-conspiratorial dissent informed by fundamental values. The new material is presented unabashedly--without an attempt to rewrite personal history, and with an admission that not every prediction made in the original edition has come to fruition. That said, the underlying themes of the original are not so much repeated as expanded upon. For those seeking a work in the classic mold of conservatism, rather than the strident reactionary views that have come to dominate much of the conservative dialogue, this will be a special book, a special entrance to the mind of a great figure in American culture wars of present as well as past.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Xu9KvBGlZMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Play it Again (From the Files of Madison Finn, Book 3)","description":"Madison tries to figure out who her real friends are after she is made stage manager of the school musical.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y6djAAAACAAJ&dq=Play+it+Again+(From+the+Files+of+Madison+Finn,+Book+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Can You Do in the Sun?","description":"The sunshine provides opportunities to feel its glow, make a shadow, and spray a rainbow.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YzApHAAACAAJ&dq=What+Can+You+Do+in+the+Sun%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catecismo de la Iglesia Catolica (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cme-PwAACAAJ&dq=Catecismo+de+la+Iglesia+Catolica+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Wildflowers: Western Region","description":"A revised edition of the popular field guide includes hundreds of all new, full-color photographs, along with information on diverse species of eastern birds, their characteristics, habitats and ranges, identification tips, and more. 200,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MKzcSL8wF6IC&dq=The+National+Audubon+Society+Field+Guide+to+North+American+Wildflowers:+Western+Region&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Christmas Tree Advent Calendar","description":"Provides children and adults with a meaningful devotional experience at Christmas time now with a new cover!\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kppq8_H8Qg4C&dq=A+Christmas+Tree+Advent+Calendar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Radiant Health The Ancient Wisdom of the Chinese Tonic Herbs","description":"Physical health, this book explains, is irrelevant if it is accompanied by unhappiness and failure.

Turf governs the flow and fate of all legislation. In this innovative study, David C. King explains how jurisdictional areas for committees are created and changed in Congress. Political scientists have long maintained that jurisdictions are relatively static, changing only at times of dramatic reforms. Not so, says King. Combining quantitative evidence with interviews and case studies, he shows how on-going turf wars make jurisdictions fluid. According to King, jurisdictional change stems both from legislators seeking electoral advantage and from nonpartisan House parliamentarians referring ambiguous bills to committees with the expertise to handle the issues. King brilliantly dissects the politics of turf grabbing and at the same time shows how parliamentarians have become institutional guardians of the legislative process. Original and insightful, Turf Wars will be valuable to those interested in congressional studies and American politics more generally.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BgaJd6RP5gwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women in the Middle Ages","description":"Power in medieval society has traditionally been ascribed to figures of public authority--violent knights and conflicting sovereigns who altered the surface of civic life through the exercise of law and force. The wives and consorts of these powerful men have generally been viewed as decorative attendants, while common women were presumed to have had no power or consequence. Reassessing the conventional definition of power that has shaped such portrayals, Women and Power in the Middle Ages reveals the varied manifestations of female power in the medieval household and community--from the cultural power wielded by the wives of Venetian patriarchs to the economic power of English peasant women and the religious power of female saints. Among the specific topics addresses are Griselda's manipulation of silence as power in Chaucer's \\"The Clerk's Tale\\"; the extensive networks of influence devised by Lady Honor Lisle; and the role of medieval women book owners as arbiters of lay piety and ambassadors of culture. In every case, the essays seek to transcend simple polarities of public and private, male and female, in order to provide a more realistic analysis of the workings of power in feudal society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A_J3qDFLwqgC&dq=Women+in+the+Middle+Ages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Perspectives on Microsoft Excel 2002 - Comprehensive","description":"Part of the New Perspectives series, this text offers a case-based, problem-solving approach and innovative technology for meaningful learning of Microsoft Excel 2002.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2OAIAAAACAAJ&dq=New+Perspectives+on+Microsoft+Excel+2002+-+Comprehensive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gilbert Law Summaries: Secured Transactions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w-09AQAAIAAJ&dq=Gilbert+Law+Summaries:+Secured+Transactions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Circle of Deception","description":"The best-selling author of Dead by Sunset traces the murder case of Whidbey Island resident Russ Douglas, who after spending Christmas with his estranged wife and children in 2003 was found murdered in his car and whose death implicated a long list of suspects, including an aging beauty queen and her boyfriend.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kcgPAQAAQBAJ&dq=Circle+of+Deception&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thinking Skills: Critical and Creative : Basic Skills Workbook With Answer Key : Preschool & Grade K (Brighter Child)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OYTr6prPbpgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The African Grey: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","description":"This is our seventh set of Happy, Healthy Pet titles.

In The Silent Woman, Janet Malcolm examines the biographies of Sylvia Plath to create a book not about Plath s life but about her afterlife: how her estranged husband, the poet Ted Hughes, as executor of her estate, tried to serve two masters Plath s art and his own need for privacy; and how it fell to his sister, Olwyn Hughes, as literary agent for the estate, to protect him by limiting access to Plath s work. Even as Malcolm brings her skepticism to bear on the claims of biography to present the truth about a life, a portrait of Sylvia Plath emerges that gives us a sense of  knowing  this tragic poet in a way we have never known her before. And she dispels forever the innocence with which most of us have approached the reading of any biography.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pP6_uOYas4IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jsp Practical Program Design","description":"The design of this book is based on teaching the ]SP (Jackson Structured Pro gramming) methodology to undergaduates and postgraduates over a period of a number of years.

The aim of the book is to provide readers with an understanding of the concepts behind the ]SP methodology in order that they may apply it for themselves; simply using the notation is not sufficient, it must be used appropriately. The answer to the question \\"Why is this wrong?\\" can lead to a greater understanding than a sim ple response to \\"Is this right?\\". I have included illegal structures as \\"under standable mistakes\\" in the early sections for this reason. It is not necessary for readers of this text to have experience with any par ticular programming language; indeed, one of the virtues of ]SP is that it is lan guage independent. Examples have been given in Pascal, C and COBOL as these are languages which students of ]SP are likely to have met in the course of their studies, or will be meeting while they are learning ]SP. The COBOL lan guage is widely used in industry in a ]SP development environment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RyQRBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"QUAS PRIMAS: ON THE KINGSHIP OF CHRIST.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mkYQika0NWcC&dq=QUAS+PRIMAS:+ON+THE+KINGSHIP+OF+CHRIST.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masterclass in Japanese Cooking","description":"Step-by-step Masterclass recipes presented by renowned chefs introduce the fundamentals of the Japanese cuisine.

That's what the bewildered citizens of Mapleton, who lost many of their neighbors, friends and lovers in the event known as the Sudden Departure, have to figure out. Because nothing has been the same since it happened not marriages, not friendships, not even the relationships between parents and children. Kevin Garvey, Mapleton's new mayor, wants to speed up the healing process, to bring a sense of renewed hope and purpose to his traumatized community. Kevin's own family has fallen apart in the wake of the disaster: his wife, Laurie, has left to join the Guilty Remnant, a homegrown cult whose members take a vow of silence; his son, Tom, is gone, too, dropping out of college to follow a sketchy prophet named Holy Wayne. Only Kevin's teenaged daughter, Jill, remains, and she's definitely not the sweet \\"A\\" student she used to be. Kevin wants to help her, but he's distracted by his growing relationship with Nora Durst, a woman who lost her entire family on October 14th and is still reeling from the tragedy, even as she struggles to move beyond it and make a new start.

Leslie Sponsel and twelve other contributors, including archaeologists, biological anthropologists, cultural ecologists, and nutritionists, review traditional and changing adaptations of indigenous societies to Amazonian ecosystems; they analyze the challenges presented to indigenes by the massive cultural and environmental impact of Westernization. They also discuss the applications of research results to the needs, interests, and priorities of indigenous societies. In his concluding chapter, Sponsel calls for anthropologists to contribute through their research to the empowerment of indigenous communities and organizations. \\"In the Amazon the only people who already know and practice ecologically sound economies are most indigenous societies.

A nation mourns the loss of its president. A young boy mourns the life his Irish-Catholic, working-class father never had. Rory Maguire is a fourteen-year-old boy looking for a better life for himself and his family in Brooklyn, New York. His father, Harry, had a terrible accident that cost him his job, his ability to walk, and his dignity. His brother, Dermot, is hanging out with a local gang called the Shamrocks, and his two little sisters are growing hungry in the Maguires' frigid tenement apartment. Rory's dreams of becoming a writer seem hopelessly out of reach, as does winning the heart of Carol, the daughter of a prominent Brooklyn lawyer. What Rory needs most this Christmas is a miracle -- and even though he can't bring his hero John F. Kennedy back to life, he might be able to give his father, an ex-merchant marine, the recognition he deserves...and offer his family the gift of hope, health, and happiness for years to come.

Many think of barns as breathtaking landmarks along the byways. Others have their favorite barns--the well-kept, red dairy barn near St. Cloud, the faded horse barn on the way to Faribault. Still others know these structures more intimately: barns are as integral to their lives as family and home. In Barns of Minnesota, photographer Doug Ohman showcases the vast array of these exceptional landmarks, built by hand in wood, stone, brick, or metal and dating back as far as 1880. Where Ohman's photographs capture the beauty of the barn from the outside in, Will Weaver's evocative story illuminates the life of the barn from the inside out. Readers witness the making and breaking of one barn as it plays into the life and sustenance of several generations of one family who settled the land in 1922 and who farmed into the age of agribusiness. Seventy-five stunning color photographs accompanied by Weaver's moving story uplift these beautiful buildings and a way of life on the land that is as strong and proud, as fragile and humble, as the barns among us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fLfzXX_K6cQC&dq=Barns+of+Minnesota+(Minnesota+Byways)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Metal Monster (Masters of Science Fiction)","description":"Hidden in the heart of unknown Asia, a fantastic world of living metal awaited: Monsters of solid metal, pulsating with an unearthly electric life, wise with wisdom not of this world--and dreaming of the day when the harder-than-steel horde could roll forth smashing and flattening the world of mere humans.

The first editions, in hardcover, were published simultaneously in London and New York by Elkin Mathews and Mitchell Kennerly, respectively, in April, 1915. The British and American editions differ in that they arrange the material slightly differently and that each includes a story the other omits; \\"The Poet Speaks with Earth\\" in the British version, and \\"The Mist\\" in the American version. The collection's significance in the history of fantasy literature was recognized by its republication (as The Food of Death: Fifty-One Tales) by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the third volume of the celebrated Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library in September, 1974. The Newcastle edition used the American version of the text. The book collects fifty-one short stories by the author.

But since the end of the Cold War, journalists have increasingly resisted presidential views, even offering their own spin on events. What, then, determines whether the media will accept or reject the White House perspective? And what consequences does this new media environment have for policymaking and public opinion? To answer these questions, Robert M. Entman develops a powerful new model of how media framing works a model that allows him to explain why the media cheered American victories over small-time dictators in Grenada and Panama but barely noticed the success of far more difficult missions in Haiti and Kosovo. Discussing the practical implications of his model, Entman also suggests ways to more effectively encourage the exchange of ideas between the government and the media and between the media and the public. His book will be an essential guide for political scientists, students of the media, and anyone interested in the increasingly influential role of the media in foreign policy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SzG0HkZeoNIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frogs and Toads: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","description":"From a \\"common sense\\" approach to keeping frogs and toads to conservation concerns, Terry Gampper's extensive herp knowledge covers all the bases.

The editors have included topics such as the principles of \\"multiple\\" and \\"media,\\" including sound, two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics, animation, and text. All of these elements are stitched together by the programmer, or multimedia designer, based on the conceptualization of the designer. In order to take full advantage of the potential for a wide array of multimedia applications it is important to have a broad understanding of the principles of various media. The person preparing a multimedia \\"package,\\" which may include such media as sound, computer graphics, and software, will most likely have a strong background in only one or perhaps none of the media to be used. Introduction to Multimedia Systems has been developed to be the first place to turn, both as an introductory textbook or as a professional reference for anyone diving into multimedia preparation. Multimedia is first and foremost a medium of communication. In order to take advantage of the nearly unlimited potential provided by digital environments a full survey of multimedia capabilities is covered in this book. Website Feature: Learning by doing!

Steering away from metaphysical critiques of privacy, Graber compares the philosophical, constitutional, and democratic merits of the two systems of abortion regulation witnessed in the twentieth century: pre-Roe v. Wade statutory prohibitions on abortion and Roe's ban on significant state interference with the market for safe abortion services. He demonstrates that before Roe, pro-life measures were selectively and erratically administered, thereby subverting our constitutional commitment to equal justice. Claiming that these measures would be similarly administered if reinstated, the author seeks to increase support for keeping abortion legal, even among those who have reservations about its morality. Abortion should remain legal, Graber argues, because statutory bans on abortion have a history of being enforced in ways that intentionally discriminate against poor persons and persons of color. In the years before Roe, the same law enforcement officials who routinely ignored and sometimes assisted those physicians seeking to terminate pregnancies for their private patients too often prevented competent abortionists from offering the same services to the general public. This double standard violated the fundamental human and constitutional right of equal justice under law, a right that remains a major concern of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AwJfAAc7LqgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Open Range and Parking Lots: Southwest Photographs (University of Arizona Southwest Center series)","description":"The color photographs record decay and despair with beauty and elegance, accompanied by a text that plumbs the cultural backdrop of the contemporary American Southwest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DbZxQgAACAAJ&dq=Open+Range+and+Parking+Lots:+Southwest+Photographs+(University+of+Arizona+Southwest+Center+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Geostatistical simulation: Models and algorithms","description":"This book deals with the estimation of natural resources using the Monte Carlo methodology.

In today's hypercompetitive business environment, successful executives must be able to discover opportunities, face problems, and pursue innovative ideas, then turn those ideas into action throughout an organization. Based on both empirical research and practice experience, this book gives managers the tools to do just that. Organizational learning capability is the capacity to generate and generalize ideas with impact. Managers generate new ideas in four basic ways: experimentation, in which organizations learn by trying many new products and processes; continuous improvement, in which they learn by constantly improving what they have done before and mastering each step in a process before moving on to other processes; knowledge acquisition, in which they learn by encouraging individuals and teams to acquire new knowledge continuously; and benchmarking, in which they learn by studying how other groups do things and trying to adapt their techniques. Each learning types leads to different performance consequences. Managers must also be able to generalize information through technology, movement of people, incentives, and learning processes. By both generating and generalizing ideas with impact, managers have a blueprint for making learning happen. Learning may not be sustained, however, unless it is congruent with the larger business context--the organization's strategy and culture and the industry's characteristics. Unfortunately, just as organizations develop learning capabilities, they also suffer from certain learning disabilities. This book outlines common disabilities and the means to overcome them. The authors assist practicing managers by providing several examples of successful and unsuccessful organizations and describing the ways in which they have helped organizations improve learning capability in their consulting practices. Based on detailed case studies, a review of past literature, and data gleaned from a worldwide survey of companies,Organizational Learning Capability is an accessible and useful guide for managers competing in the information economy. This book turns abstract ideas into practice, offers tools that managers can use, and presents a simple yet profound road map for making learning a reality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QcTnCwAAQBAJ&dq=Organizational+Learning+Capability:+Generating+and+Generalizing+Ideas+with+Impact&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Single Piles and Pile Groups Under Lateral Loading","description":"The complexities of designing piles for lateral loads are manifold as there are many forces that are critical to the design of big structures such as bridges, offshore and waterfront structures and retaining walls. The loads on structures should be supported either horizontally or laterally or in both directions and most structures have in common that they are founded on piles. To create solid foundations, the pile designer is driven towards finding the critical load on a certain structure, either by causing overload or by causing too much lateral deflection. This second edition of Reese and Van Impe s course book explores and explains lateral load design and procedures for designing piles and pile groups, accounting for the soil resistance, as related to the lateral deflection of the pile. It addresses the analysis of piles of varying stiffness installed into soils with a variety of characteristics, accounting for the axial load at the top of the pile and for the rotational restraint of the pile head. The presented method using load-transfer functions is currently applied in practice by thousands of engineering offices in the world. Moreover, various experimental case design examples, including the design of an offshore platform pile foundation are given to complement theory. The rich list of relevant publications will serve the user into further reading. Designed as a textbook for senior undergraduate/graduate student courses in pile engineering, foundation engineering and related subjects, this set of book and CD-ROM will also benefit professionals in civil and mining engineering and in the applied earth sciences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=buTqBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Schoolmaster and Other Stories (Tales of Chekhov)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9f8_swEACAAJ&dq=The+Schoolmaster+and+Other+Stories+(Tales+of+Chekhov)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","description":"Written ten years after his legal emancipation, this book catapulted Frederick Douglass into the international spotlight as a leading spokesperson for American blacks, both freed and in slavery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o6uPuQAACAAJ&dq=My+Bondage+and+My+Freedom+(Dodo+Press)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Seduced: Two Celebrated Erotic Novels","description":"This volume includes two celebrated erotic novels.

Each story captures the force and sweep of our past in all its fierce reality, bringing us the strong, vigorous, unforgettable men and women of a simpler, harsher, more heroic time. The title story gives the collection its unifying theme, that of the frontier marriage, the  rawhide knot  the couple bound together by the rough exigencies of pioneer life. A young girl, Sayward Hewett, has walked with her family from Pennsylvania to a settlement in the Ohio wilderness, and she is afraid of nothing. One night the men of the settlement drunk, bent on real devilment, hardly less wild after a day s carousing than the panthers lurking just beyond the handful of log cabins decide to  hatch up a marryin   between an old maid and a shy, outcast, book-learned young lawyer from back East. But the girl Sayward, facing the whole lot of them, determined that she will marry their scapegoat bridegroom, wins her own victory. In  Smoke Over the Prarie,  a marriage seems to presage indeed, to precipitate the downfall of a great baron of the Old West. In  Early Americana,  and eighteen-year-old boy, trapped in a Comanche uprising, finds himself ambushed by love. In all of these stories, love and violence are yoked together by the challenge of life on the frontier. Here is the physical and emotional landscape of that world, with its vast spaces, its elemental struggles, its quality both of legend and of history, brought to us with the power and breadth that have given Conrad Richter s work its enduring place in American fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HRQ5AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thirst","description":"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ?

Our books diff er from most books on dog breeds because this book also provides you with a comprehensive and authoritative source of all the known predisposed hereditary health syndromes for the breed. You will find extensive references for each problem described. We also provide the breed club address for this breed and a list of laboratories and organizations that can provide professional help and information. As a small animal veterinarian, I have always been intrigued by the way dogs have been bred to fill a purpose in life and further impressed that they also tend to love performing that service. Greyhounds and other sight hounds are built for speed with aerodynamic bodies consisting of small head, deep chest, narrow waist and large leg muscles. On the other hand Dachshunds take their name from German words meaning  badger dog  and they use their long nose, long body and short legs to both track, enter and dig into badger dens. After developing a practice that catered to clients with show dogs, my interest in each breed continued to grow as I studied and observed more and more about the unique predisposition and incidence of health problems in each breed. Breeders of purebred dogs for show were a challenge and inspirational for me to research and help them with their unique health problems. Historically references to hereditary problems are scattered throughout various Veterinary medical texts and journals such as ophthalmology, neurology, gastroenterology, cardiovascular and dermatology. This book, as well as the other books and articles I have written, is researched and compiled with the intention to provide both veterinarians and dog owners with comprehensive and authoritative predisposition information under the breed name. At the date of this publication, The American Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation and the The Kennel Club of England reports over 400 known hereditary health syndromes throughout the dog kingdom. At the writing of my fi rst book in 1983, less than 50 hereditary issues are able to be predicted and or diagnosed. Sequencing of the canine genome, DNA tests, metabolic testing including blood tests and urine testing; plus, phenotypic examinations such as radiographs, ultrasound, and CERF or OFA eye registry exams by a Board Certified Veterinary Ophthalmologist have advanced the science of breed related health and behavioral problems. This book will provide veterinarians, researchers, pet owners and breeders with a comprehensive guide to all the known problems veterinarians and dog owners should consider during pet selection and throughout each life stage of our canine friends.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4PVuBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Frequency Switching Power Supplies: Theory and Design","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9jcfAQAAIAAJ&dq=High+Frequency+Switching+Power+Supplies:+Theory+and+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Live With Autism and Asperger Syndrome: Practical Strategies for Parents and Professionals","description":"This accessible introduction to caring for a child with autism is an ideal resource for the families of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders as well as for the professionals who work with them.

Horror! But on a closer study I realized that the apparition was only a flannel gas helmet. . . . What an age since 1914!  In Undertones of War, one of the finest autobiographies to come out of World War I, the acclaimed poet Edmund Blunden records his devastating experiences in combat. After enlisting at the age of twenty, he took part in the disastrous battles at the Somme, Ypres, and Passchendaele, describing them as  murder, not only to the troops but to their singing faiths and hopes.  All the horrors of trench warfare, all the absurdity and feeble attempts to make sense of the fighting, all the strangeness of observing war as a writer of being simultaneously soldier and poet pervade Blunden s memoir. In steely-eyed prose as richly allusive as any poetry, he tells of the endurance and despair found among the men of his battalion, including the harrowing acts of bravery that won him the Military Cross. Now back in print for American readers, the volume includes a selection of Blunden s war poems that unflinchingly juxtapose death in the trenches with the beauty of Flanders s fields. Undertones of War deserves a place on anyone s bookshelf between Siegfried Sassoon s poetry and Robert Graves s Goodbye to All That.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bbk3CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discovering the New Testament: Community and Faith","description":"Varughese combines all the elements believers are looking for in a survey of the New Testament: thorough, sound Biblical scholarship combined with an eye-catching format and writing style that's easy to understand.

Successive popes accorded to Christian warriors willing to participate in the peninsular wars against Islam the same crusading benefits offered to those going to the Holy Land. Joseph F. O'Callaghan clearly demonstrates that any study of the history of the crusades must take a broader view of the Mediterranean to include medieval Spain. Following a chronological overview of crusading in the Iberian peninsula from the late eleventh to the middle of the thirteenth century, O'Callaghan proceeds to the study of warfare, military finance, and the liturgy of reconquest and crusading. He concludes his book with a consideration of the later stages of reconquest and crusade up to and including the fall of Granada in 1492, while noting that the spiritual benefits of crusading bulls were still offered to the Spanish until the Second Vatican Council of 1963. Although the conflict described in this book occurred more than eight hundred years ago, recent events remind the world that the intensity of belief, rhetoric, and action that gave birth to crusade, holy war, and jihad remains a powerful force in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6fPSBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Atlantic salmon","description":"Atlantic Salmon is a cultural icon throughout its North Atlantic range; it is the focus of probably the World s highest profile recreational fishery and is the basis for one of the World s largest aquaculture industries.

In this work he describes how he became knowledgeable about both Native American and white cultural traditions and chronicles his struggles to achieve two years of higher education at the Ypsilanti State Normal School. He also deals with the history of many native peoples throughout the Michigan region (especially the Mackinac Straits), combining information on political, military, and diplomatic matters with legends, personal reminiscences, and a discussion of comparative beliefs and values, and offering insights into the ways that increasing contact between Indians and whites were changing native lifeways. He especially emphasizes traditional hunting, fishing, sugaring, and trapping practices and the seasonal tasks of daily living. Ottawa traditions, according to the author, recall their earlier home on Canada's Ottawa River and how they were deliberately infected by smallpox by the English Canadians after allying themselves with the French. Blackbird finds Biblical parallels with Ottawa and Chippewa accounts of a great flood and a fish which ingests and expels a celebrated prophet. He includes his own oratorical \\"Lamentation\\" on white treatment of the Ottawas, twenty-one moral commandments of the Ottawa and Chippewa, the Ten Commandments and other religious material in the Ottawa and Chippewa language, and a grammar of that language.

This easy-to-understand, down-to-earth book moves beyond parenting theories and techniques to get to the heart of parenting. If parents know how to look within their hearts to find the answers they need, parenting techniques are not necessary. If parents know how to find a loving connection with their children at most times, discipline and consequences are rarely necessary. All parents have it within them to bring out the best in their children. Approaching parents in this way makes parenting a true pleasure instead of the battle and chore it often becomes. Many so-called experts say that raising kids is the toughest job any of us will ever do, but it does not have to be that way. It can be the most joyful thing any of us will ever do. \\"Parenting from the Heart\\" is a must resource for anyone who cares about parenting and raising children.

And so, just four months after he arrived in Vietnam in 1968, he joined the LRPs (Long Range Patrol).The mission of the Lurps, as they were called, was dangerous: Five- or six-man teams were dropped into the dense forest behind enemy lines. They were to observe enemy troop movements and stage ambushes that sometimes ended in fierce firefights. When their mission was over, they called for quick helicopter rescue. Back on base, they debriefed and tried to sleep off the adrenaline. Two days later they were back in the brush. The missions changed, but one goal was always the same-stay alive.In hard-hitting prose, Bill Shanahan, with co-author John Brackin, tells his story of survival behind enemy lines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5I1u0aVIUDYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healthy Parenting: How Your Upbringing Influences the Way You Raise Your Children, and What You Can Do to Make It Better for Them","description":"The best-selling author of Adult Children of Alcoholics offers advice for parents who survived emotional or physical abuse as children and discusses the impact of the past on current behavior.

The predators in these stories range from the urban street life that threatens the security of a very creative child in \\"The Importance of Superheroes,\\" to \\"Enid's Pet,\\" in which a man eating carpet puts a human leech in his proper place. In Tales from a Disturbed Mind the sense of reality in many of the stories often shifts to the point that it s difficult to know just what is real within the minds of the characters.

A richly detailed and absorbing account, it covers the dramatic years between the guerrillas' opening attack in 1980 and President Fernando Belaunde's reluctant decision to send in the military to contain the growing rebellion in late 1982. Covering the strategy, actions, successes, and setbacks of both the government and the rebels, the book shows how the tightly organized insurgency forced itself upon an unwilling society just after the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic regime. One of Peru's most distinguished journalists, Gustavo Gorriti first covered the Shining Path movement for the leading Peruvian newsweekly, Caretas. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and an impressive array of government and Shining Path documents, he weaves his careful research into a vivid portrait of the now-jailed Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman, Belaunde and his generals, and the unfolding drama of the fiercest war fought on Peruvian soil since the Chilean invasion a century before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BeA4CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","description":"Winner of a 2006 Coalition of Visionary Resources (COVR) Award Ever present in art and mythology, animals have made an indelible impression on our psyche.

Dodging minefields in Cambodia, diving into the icy waters outside a Russian bath, Chef Bourdain travels the world over in search of the ultimate meal. The only thing Anthony Bourdain loves as much as cooking is traveling, and A Cook's Tour is the shotgun marriage of his two greatest passions. Inspired by the question, 'What would be the perfect meal?', Anthony sets out on a quest for his culinary holy grail. Our adventurous chef starts out in Japan, where he eats traditional Fugu, a poisonous blowfish which can be prepared only by specially licensed chefs. He then travels to Cambodia, up the mine-studded road to Pailin into autonomous Khmer Rouge territory and to Phnom Penh's Gun Club, where local fare is served up alongside a menu of available firearms. In Saigon, he's treated to a sustaining meal of live Cobra heart before moving on to savor a snack with the Viet Cong in the Mecong Delta. Further west, Kitchen Confidential fans will recognize the Gironde of Tony's youth, the first stop on his European itinerary. And from France, it's on to Portugal, where an entire village has been fattening a pig for months in anticipation of his arrival. And we're only halfway around the globe. . .

The first rocket will take five minutes to hit London. You have six minutes to stop the second. Rudi Graf is an engineer who always dreamed of sending rockets to the moon. But instead, he finds himself working alongside Wernher von Braun, launching V2 rockets at London for the Nazis from a bleak seaside town in occupied Holland. As the SS increases its scrutiny on the project, Graf, an engineer more than a soldier, has to muster all of his willpower to toe the party line. And when rumors of a defector circulate through the German ranks, Graf becomes a prime suspect. Meanwhile, Kay Caton-Walsh, a young English intelligence officer, is living through the turmoil of war. After she and her lover, an RAF officer, are caught in a V2 attack, she volunteers to ship out for newly liberated Belgium. Armed with little more than a slide rule and a few equations, Kay and her colleagues hope to locate and destroy the launch sites. But at this stage in the war it s hard to know who, if anyone, she can trust. As the death toll soars, these twin stories play out against the background of the German missile campaign during the Second World War. And what the reader comes to understand is that Kay s and Graf s destinies are on a collision course.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g7fNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The seven lamps of architecture","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MFwJAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Savarona","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i4UrHAAACAAJ&dq=Savarona&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Middle School Math Course 2 (Scott Foresman-Addison Wesley)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qrp9zgEACAAJ&dq=Middle+School+Math+Course+2+(Scott+Foresman-Addison+Wesley)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christopher Columbus, Mariner","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d9cDvCWoBjwC&dq=Christopher+Columbus,+Mariner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","description":"Details the Bible-based homeschool teaching approach for parents, and discusses Christian education, learning styles, unit studies, bible study, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z1hXJbEUIiMC&dq=The+Heart+of+Wisdom+Teaching+Approach:+Bible+Based+Homeschooling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Nostradamus Factor","description":"Teaches readers how to calculate their own \\"Nostradamus factor\\"--their innate abilities to see into the future, explaining how to use dreams for prophecy, understand the natural predictive cycle, and other tips.

It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet. The story takes place in France, Italy and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 18151838. It begins from just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile) and spans through to the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. An adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy and forgiveness, it focuses on a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty.

American soldiers and native Kachin troops battle Japanese forces behind enemy lines in the Burmese jungles. But during the brutal campaign to gain territory in the unforgiving tropical landscape, Captain Reynolds and his band of special operations soldiers and guerrilla fighters struggle to find self-awareness, and even love, in the midst of the trials of combat. One of the youngest officers to serve in Merrill s Marauders and OSS Detachment 101 precursors to the Green Berets and Central Intelligence Agency author Tom T. Chamales brings an unparalleled level of authentic detail and raw intensity to this work of fiction based on his real-life experience in the jungles of Southeast Asia. Never So Few is  an extraordinary and powerful book,  unflinching in its portrayal of wartime sacrifice and violence (Kirkus Reviews, starred). The basis for the movie starring Frank Sinatra and Steve McQueen, it offers  dramatic, exciting, and concretely detailed accounts of battle action,  and joins the ranks of other classic war novels such as From Here to Eternity and The Naked and the Dead in bringing later generations to the frontlines and into the inner lives of the brave men who served (The New York Times).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W8QjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desegregating the Altar: The Josephites and the Struggle for Black Priests, 1871-1960","description":"Historically, black Americans have affiliated in far greater numbers with certain protestant denominations than with the Roman Catholic church. In analyzing this phenomenon scholars have sometimes alluded to the dearth of black Catholic priest, but non one has adequately explained why the church failed to ordain significant numbers of black clergy until the 1930s. Desegregating the Altar, a broadly based study encompassing Afro-American, Roman catholic, southern, and institutional history, fills that gap by examining the issue through the experience of St. Joseph s Society of the Sacred Heart, or the Josephites, the only American community of Catholic priests devoted exclusively to evangelization of blacks. Drawing on extensive research in the previously closed or unavailable archives of numerous archdioceses, diocese, and religious communities, Stephen J. Ochs shows that, in many cases, Roman catholic authorities purposely excluded Afro-Americans from their seminaries. The conscious pattern of discrimination on the part of numerous bishops and heads of religious institutes stemmed from a number of factors, including the church s weak and vulnerable position in the South and the consequent reluctance of its leaders to challenge local racial norms; the tendency of Roman Catholics to accommodate to the regional and national cultures in which they lived; deep-seated psychosexual fears that black men would be unable to maintain celibacy as priests; and a  missionary approach  to blacks that regarded them as passive children rather than as potential partners and leaders. The Josephites, under the leadership of John R. Slattery, their first superior general (18931903), defied prevailing racist sentiment by admitting blacks into their college and seminary and raising three of them to the priesthood between 1891 and 1907. This action proved so explosive, however, that it helped drive Slattery out of the church and nearly destroyed the Josephite community. In the face of such opposition, Josephite authorities closed their college and seminary to black candidates except for an occasional mulatto. Leadership in the development of a black clergy thereupon passed to missionaries of the Society of the Diving Word. Meanwhile, Afro-American Catholics, led by Professor Thomas Wyatt, refused to allow the Josephites to abandon the filed quietly. They formed the Federated Colored Catholics of America and pressed the Josephites to return to their earlier policies; they also communicated their grievances to the Holy See, which, in turn, quietly pressured the American church to open its seminaries to black candidates. As a result, by 1960, the number of black priests and seminarians in the Josephites and throughout the Catholic church in the United States had increased significantly. Stephen Ochs s study of the Josephites illustrates the tenacity and insidiousness of institutional racism and the tendency of churches to opt for institutional security rather than a prophetic stance in the face of controversial social issues. His book ably demonstrates that the struggle of black Catholics for priests of their own race mirrored the efforts of Afro-Americans throughout American society to achieve racial equality and justice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lrukDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poetry: A Pocket Anthology (Penguin Academics Series) (4th Edition)","description":"The ideal alternative to longer anthologies, this brief, affordable, and diverse collection of fiction, poetry, and drama provides a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the study of literature.

Latinos can see that their sun is rising. Marco Portales knows; his life has been lived under that rising sun. On the beach at Corpus Christi, in class at SUNY-Buffalo, waiting tables in Chicago, traveling to London, teaching at Berkeley, raising a family near NASA headquarters in Houston Portales gives readers a view of the private world and public significance of Latinos. By vividly recreating his parents  generation as well as his own, Marco Portales encourages readers to consider Latino progress since the days of his happy youth during the Eisenhower fifties, years that coalesced into the gradual but steady unfurling of his ethnic consciousness. Working within a traditional Aztec framework of  suns  or days, Portales looks through the window of individual life onto the  morning  (sol naciente) of growing up as a minority member of American society, the  noontime  (sol ardiente) of private adult life and the transmission of identity to a new generation, and the full heat of afternoon (sol radiante), when public business is done and the larger polity is addressed. In the compelling details of a life truly lived and a balanced, lively intellect that articulates itself in a society that often asks people such as him to choose between their American and Mexican identities Portales inscribes himself into his people s experience. At the same time, he remains fully aware and helps raise our awareness that no one person s story can embody and represent the ancestral histories and the great worth and potential of all U.S. Latinos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pEZu-YveTxwC&dq=Latino+Sun,+Rising:+Our+Spanish-Speaking+U.S.+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Larousse Gastronomique: The Encyclopedia of Food, Wine & Cookery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dEXDjwEACAAJ&dq=Larousse+Gastronomique:+The+Encyclopedia+of+Food,+Wine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God in the Trenches: A History of How God Defends Freedom When America Is At War","description":"In \\"God in the Trenches,\\" Spivey, a decorated Marine and military professor, shows when the nation's survival seemed uncertain--even doubtful such as during the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, and the Cold War--fate seemed to turn America's way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WXK0QwAACAAJ&dq=God+in+the+Trenches:+A+History+of+How+God+Defends+Freedom+When+America+Is+At+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Hubert's Stag","description":"As John Donne said, and Hemingway repeated, \\"No man is an island.\\" Sometimes it takes a crisis for people to accept that truth.

By focusing on a campaign located outside the Deep South (led principally by an African-American woman) that attracted an unprecedented level of federal investigation, Levy joins those scholars who are profitably extending our understanding of what the freedom struggle was, how it was organized, and even when and where it was to be found.\\"--Brian Ward, University of Florida \\"Peter Levy's Civil War on Race Street joins a short list of first-rate works . . . that analyze the precise dynamics of protest and resistance during the civil rights era, getting past the sweeping narratives of change coming down from Washington to examine what, when, and how individuals actually built the movement on the ground.\\"--Doug Rossinow, Metropolitan State University Civil War on Race Street, so named because Race Street was the road that divided blacks and whites in Cambridge, Maryland, is a detailed examination of one of the most vibrant locally based struggles for racial equality during the 1960s. Beginning with an overview of Cambridge, particularly its history of racial and class relations, Peter Levy traces the emergence of the modern civil rights movement in this city on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Catalyzed by the arrival of freedom riders in 1962, the movement in Cambridge expanded in 1963 and 1964 under the leadership of Gloria Richardson, one of the most prominent (and one of the few female) civil rights leaders in the nation. In the years after her departure from Cambridge, the movement went into decline until 1967, when it underwent a brief revival that culminated with a riot allegedly incited by black power spokesman H. Rap Brown. In the wake of the riot, blacks and whites in Cambridge sought to rebuild their city and return to a politics of moderation. However, Spiro Agnew, then governor of Maryland, used the riot to advance his political career and the fortunes of the New Right, thereby garnering the attention of the public (as well as Richard Nixon) and achieving the vice-presidency in 1968. At the same time, H. Rap Brown saw his influence and that of the civil rights movement decline. In addition to providing valuable insights into Richardson and Agnew, this study is one of the few to examine a community in a \\"border\\" state. Levy demonstrates that the goals of the movement were not universal, that strategies underwent constant political and social change, and that the impact on the micro level was not as clean and immediate as historians would have us believe.

Levy is associate professor of history at York College of Pennsylvania.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=heRjPgAACAAJ&dq=Civil+War+on+Race+Street:+The+Civil+Rights+Movement+in+Cambridge,+Maryland+(Southern+Dissent)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Pickups","description":"If modern automotive myth is to be believed, then America was built on the backs of a heavy-duty Mack, an International tractor, a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and a Ford F-series pickup.

A theoretical framework will be presented that will use empirical assessments of the number of community (or proactive) programs in place in each agency, degrees of organizational change noted in a three-year review of each department's structure as reported in the LEMAS survey of police departments, the levels of economic inequality present in the jurisdictions that received COP funding, and the ethnic composition of these jurisdictions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3gBgtMoPiw0C&dq=SPSS+for+Windows+Step+by+Step:+A+Simple+Guide+and+Reference,+10.0+Update+(3rd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Canyon Country Wildflowers: Including Arches and Canyonlands National Parks","description":"This easy-to-use guide features: a tough, water-resistant cover and extra-durable binding, made to withstand vigorous field use; detailed descriptions and color photos of more than 200 plants; an introduction to the habitats and ecology the Canyonlands region; a primer on plant characteristics; and a glossary of botanical terms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PoV0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Careers booklet (SDS career explorer)","description":"This is a career exploration and job-finder book for many different fields.

It continues to be seen as a disorganised repository of traditional banalities, while Job and Qohelet are viewed as more exciting texts, in revolt against Proverbs' conventional wisdom. Contradiction in the Book of Proverbs argues that this misleading consensus owes more to scholarly presuppositions than to the content of Proverbs; it sees Proverbs as a challenging work, one that aims to provoke a critical appropriation of wisdom and in which diverse sources have been skilfully brought together by a creative final editor to form a complex unity. Many divergences from the Hebrew in the Greek witness to the translator's discomfort with his spikey, provocative original. Peter Hatton challenges many existing scholarly assumptions and calls for a re-evaluation of the role and significance of Proverbs in relation to the other biblical wisdom books and the whole canon.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=btUYDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weapons and Hope (author of disturbing th universe)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1vl-yAEACAAJ&dq=Weapons+and+Hope+(author+of+disturbing+th+universe)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women Who Hurt Themselves: A Book of Hope and Understanding","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Operation Susannah","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uY8EAAAAMAAJ&dq=Operation+Susannah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The relations between Arabs and Israelites prior to the rise of Islam, (The Schweich lectures)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wJNCAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Notebook at Random","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ic9nQgAACAAJ&dq=A+Notebook+at+Random&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going home","description":"When Morgan Carter's car breaks down 250 miles from his home, he figures his weekend plans are ruined.

He's a Virginian.\\" Early in Hitler's war, Kentucky soldiers dub Owego's author-to-be. Going by jus sanguinis (the right blood), they thus help name this decades-later book. It fills a big gap in Americana by detailing the experience of one line of George Washington's descendants. He had a son--Israel Dean. The author is Israel's great-great-grandson, thus a George Washington VI. The inside story is presented by a descendant who is a party in interest. Important events: A Washington \\"Spoiler\\" Party is slipped int a 1914 Congressional election to the detriment of an unaware George Washington IV. A freak recount is used to take away a county-level treasureship victory from an unaware George Washington V. A Sneak Bill issued to eliminate the villager's power to elect a member of the county board when an unaware George Washington V is holding the elective office authorized by state charter. These books are useful to the research needs of Congress, historians, scholars, librarians, sociologists, lawyers, and students of poliltical motivations based on secret genealogy. The paper writing purporting to be George Washington's will has no witnesses. By virtue of he laws of descent and distribution actual title to George Washington's vast estates passed to his son Israel Dean (Washington), then to Israel's two sons and five daughters. They never got their due. Third parties exploited George Washington's vast estates. The exploiters--political occultists--working through operatives and cut-outs tracked down and played psychological tricks on the Israel Dean descendants. But such dirty tricks left tracks. These books detail some of them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pqeDJwAACAAJ&dq=A+Virginian+in+Yankeeland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","description":"Late one night, two teachers investigate a mysterious flashing light in the sports pavilion, while the rest of the school sleeps.

It covers the vast array of skills needed by today's conductor and will benefit all choir directors who want their choirs to reach a higher level of artistry. This book will be useful on many levels: for the college student studying the child voice and elementary teaching methods; for the teacher beginning to direct choirs in schools, synagogues, churches and communities; for experienced children's choir directors who wish to know more about orchestral repertoire for treble voices, conducting an orchestra, and preparing a children's choir to sing a major work with a professional orchestra. The underlying educational philosophy is sound; the author sees development of musicianship through singing as the primary goal of a children's choir program. This philosophy differs dramatically from the traditional concept of the conductor as all-knowing and the singers as receptacles. An outstanding aspect of the book is how the author leads the reader to an understanding of how to teach musicianship. Developing literacy in the choral setting is a mysterious, amorphous process to many conductors, but the author clearly outlines this important process with practical suggestions, well-documented examples, and a clear reading style which will reach readers on many levels. The comprehensive repertoire, skill-building sheets, and programs for all types of children's choirs will provide teachers with immediate and highly valuable resources.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tRKEwrfj6TYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oceans: The Vast, Mysterious Deep (Earth Works)","description":"Introduces the watery world that covers most of the planet, and discusses the water cycle, the different kinds of underwater environments and the creatures that live in them, and how humans gain from and affect the oceans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OhEGAAAACAAJ&dq=Oceans:+The+Vast,+Mysterious+Deep+(Earth+Works)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Imitating Death","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fZhuAAAAMAAJ&dq=Life+Imitating+Death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medicine Across Cultures: History and Practice of Medicine in Non-Western Cultures (Science Across Cultures: the History of Non-Western Science)","description":"This work deals with the medical knowledge and beliefs of cultures outside of the United States and Europe.

She preserved these early writings in three manuscript notebooks, entitled, with mock solemnity, 'Volume the First', 'Volume the Second', and 'Volume the Third'. Most of these works are short fictions, but Austen also wrote the opening of what could have become a full-length novel, 'Catharine', as well as dramatic sketches, verses, and a few non-fictional pieces. Astonishingly sophisticated and inventive, these writings are now receiving the scholarly attention they deserve. This edition provides a fresh transcription of Austen's manuscripts, with comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, covering the context and publication history of the juvenilia, a chronology of Austen's life and an authoritative textual apparatus. It also prints, for the first time, the copious satirical marginalia that Austen wrote on her copies of Oliver Goldsmith's History of England.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ECk_nAEACAAJ&dq=Juvenilia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fast Forward: Organizational Change in 100 Days","description":"Part II builds on the framework established in part I, examining the different types of change initiatives that are key to the organization's growth: the development of a new strategic plan, the integration of a new acquisition, launching a new venture, establishing a new IT platform, leading an organizational turnaround, and implementing deep cultural change.

This fundamental question deeply divides those who fear that the term oversimplifies grave problems and those who worry that, to effectively address such issues as terrorism and genocide, we must first acknowledge them as evil. Recognizing that the way we approach this dilemma can significantly affect both the harm we suffer and the suffering we inflict, a distinguished group of contributors engages in the debate with this series of timely and original essays. Drawing on Western conceptions of evil from the Middle Ages to the present, these pieces demonstrate that, while it may not be possible to definitively settle moral questions, we are still able and in fact are obligated to make moral arguments and judgments. Using a wide variety of approaches, the authors raise tough questions: Why is so much evil perpetrated in the name of good? Could evil ever be eradicated? How can liberal democratic politics help us strike a balance between the need to pass judgment and the need to remain tolerant? Their insightful answers exemplify how the sometimes rarefied worlds of political theory, philosophy, theology, and history can illuminate pressing contemporary concerns.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MClGQBJx-yoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","description":"In this \\"beautifully written, sharply observed, and heartfelt\\" guide to his hometown (New York Times), legendary New York City journalist Pete Hamill leads us on an unforgettable journey through the city he loves.

Adam Weishaupt of the Illuminati in 1776 believed enlightenment could only be achieved through Lucifer. Marx continued his work. The theories of early Communism apply today to our Democratic Party and organizations like Black Lives Matter and Antifa which have succumbed to Marxist infection and brainwashing. Marx's penchant for destruction and Satanism, his racism, and his employment by rich capitalists, are just some of his characteristics that today's Marxists don't want you to know about. The identity and callous nature of the \\"Satanists\\" behind the Radical Socialist and Communist movements will shock you. We can define \\"Satan\\" as the symbol of \\"the destructive forces forming the antithesis to the Christian God.\\" Communism uses a form of Satanism to take not only souls but also wealth and the control of the labor force and government. With this definition, all Communists, relative to Christian nations, can be labeled \\"Satanists.\\" One doesn't have to be sacrificing animals, babies, or virgins in Demonic rituals chanting \\"Hail Satan\\" and participating in orgies afterward to be a \\"Satanist.\\" However, \\"High Priest\\" Karl Marx demonstrated considerable knowledge about Satanic rituals in his poetry and dramas and rejected \\"the one who ruled from above\\" as he was admittedly destined for hell.SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE THAT KARL MARX WAS A SATANIST001 Marx's Communist Manifesto specifically attacked Christianity to establish a Communist State.002 Marx received letters from his son with the salutation \\"Dear Devil.\\" Marx's wife referred to him as \\"Bishop\\" and \\"High Priest\\"--which is specific to Satanic cults. A letter from his father showed concern that Marx had been possessed by a demon. These letters suggest Marx was a Satanic cult member which was popular at that time.003 Although writing about Satanism doesn't make one a Satanist, Marx demonstrated his extensive knowledge of Satanic rites and wrote a drama about making a pact with the Devil.004 Marx was hired to update Adam Weishaupt's work who was a prominent Illuminati, who were, in turn, occultists.005 Marx wrote extensively that he sided with Satan over God, and had a personal vendetta against God.006 Illuminism dominated Weishaupt's work, which Mark partially plagiarized for his Communist Manifesto. Illuminism states that enlightenment must come through Lucifer.007 Marx's economic theories were proven by history to be patently wrong, but his argument for violent terrorism and revolution resulted in up to 150 million deaths and untold suffering as part of regime change.008 Marx had a motive to detest Christianity, it had forced his family, with a long history of rabbi members, to convert from Judaism to have a chance to succeed in society.009 Marx was an expert in the \\"Heart and Soul\\" of Communism, the art of Dialectical Materialism, that also underlies Satanism as the antithesis of God.010 Marx had close friends who were admittedly Satanists, such as Proudhon and Bakunin, who were in frequent correspondence with him.This book also includes a Communist and sympathizer Blacklist of modern adversaries of the free world and why they made the list. The Blacklist includes lengthy sections on people like Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), John Kerry, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, David Axelrod, Rahm Emanuel, Jesse Jackson, Bobby Rush, Opal Tometi, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, Amy Klobuchar, and Ilhan Omar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WJ2-zQEACAAJ&dq=Was+Karl+Marx+a+satanist%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Llewellyn's New A to Z Horoscope Maker and Interpreter: A Comprehensive Self-Study Course","description":"A comprehensive self-study course.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=71FUJwAACAAJ&dq=Llewellyn%27s+New+A+to+Z+Horoscope+Maker+and+Interpreter:+A+Comprehensive+Self-Study+Course&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reviewing the Arts (Lea's Communication)","description":"Entertainment writers are often faced with the challenge of reviewing an unfamiliar work.

But anyone who s been a believer long enough has likely experienced seasons that feel more mundane or routine, leading to aimlessly skimming a couple of Bible verses or praying the same prayer over and over. In Be Thou My Vision, Jonathan Gibson has created a 31-day liturgical guide designed to provide structure to the daily worship of individuals and families. Each daily reading includes a call to worship, adoration, confession, assurance, creed and catechism, the Gloria Patri, a prayer of illumination, Bible reading, intercessory prayer, and the Lord s Prayer. Designed to be read in 1520 minutes a day, this beautifully produced liturgy will give readers focus and purpose to their daily quiet time while teaching them historical prayers, creeds, and catechisms that point them to Christ.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9eFDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Authentic African Cuisine from Ghana","description":"20th Anniversary Celebration Edition (1997 - 2017) ???Authentic African Cuisine from Ghana is an absolutely brilliant and a must have book. The 1st edition of the book was a great success and it's been out of print for over 10 years, which has created an overwhelming demand for the revised edition. The second edition has easier to read and easy to follow cooking instructions, and updated with professional quality images of some favourite Ghanaian dishes. The book begins with a brief introduction into the history, traditions and culture of Ghana and her people. Ghanaians are fun-loving, cheerful people who are proud of their country and its numerous languages (over 20 major ones and many more dialects), traditions, and standing. The book then goes into the various traditional soups such as the famous groundnut or peanut soup, palm soup. There are stews like kontomereh (spinach) and egusi, okro or okra stew and rice dishes like jollof and kelewele (fried plantains) - delicious. There's also a section for deserts like bofloat. Towards the end of the book, there is a section which gives a list of many Ghanaian festivals and their respective dates of celebration. There is also the Adinkra symbols and the meanings of each symbols. In writing this book, the authors have endeavoured (as much as possible) to stick closely to ingredients and herbs used by Ghanaians in cooking their mouth - watering dishes. But, being conscious that this book will be read by non- Ghanaians and that food preservation will take place throughout the four corners of the globe, the authors have also included, where possible, substitute ingredients which are more readily available in American or European markets. It should be noted that because the African continent is so diverse in culture and traditions there is consequently a wide range of food and different methods and styles of cooking a similar food from one country to the next within Africa. Even within the same country, different ethnic groups will prepare the same dish differently. The term 'African food' is therefore a complete misnomer. Traditionally in Ghana, and indeed in the rest of Africa, girls learn to cook at an early age. A young adult will first go to the local market with the mother to watch how she selects the best of the fresh ingredients for a particular dish, then the child will help with little chores and take instructions from the mother in the kitchen while she cooks. By her mid-teens the child (usually a daughter, but not exclusively so) is a budding good cook herself. This is how mouth-watering Ghanaian foods are passed on from mother to daughter, from one generation to the next, intact and undiluted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kbT4swEACAAJ&dq=Authentic+African+Cuisine+from+Ghana&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Ward of the State","description":"\\"Ward of the State: A Memoir of Foster Care,\\" tells what happened to a little black boy from the inner city of Detroit. This is the story of Karlos Dillard, severely neglected by his mother who often left him and his siblings at home alone for weeks to fend for themselves. Enduring severe neglect and abuse, the boy was removed by the State of Michigan and put into foster care. Karlos was removed from his mother's care just to end up in foster homes that treated him worse. The book is an emotional rollercoaster. Every time Karlos describes the pain he is feeling you will feel the same pain. Whether it be hunger, anger, or being sexually violated. Karlos' use of words makes sure that you aren't just reading the book, you are actually engaged. What is most enticing are the small victories experienced in the story because they give you a break from the horrors of some of the foster homes. Karlos was told he was not loved, he was not wanted and he was nothing but a ward of the State. Karlos had nothing left to look forward to and that almost ended his life, but his hope to find a family that loved him kept him alive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXNUzQEACAAJ&dq=A+Ward+of+the+State&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Active Filter Cookbook, Second Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kSxTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Active+Filter+Cookbook,+Second+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High-speed math self-taught (Cardinal giant)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9vfESgAACAAJ&dq=High-speed+math+self-taught+(Cardinal+giant)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Perspectives on Microsoft Word 2002, Comprehensive (New Perspectives Series.)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=geMBOAAACAAJ&dq=New+Perspectives+on+Microsoft+Word+2002,+Comprehensive+(New+Perspectives+Series.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pictures of Pavanne/The Youth Monopoly (Ace Double H-48)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7dkgAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chronicle of the Seven Sorrows","description":"Chronicle of the Seven Sorrows traces the rise and fall of Pipi Soleil, ?king of the wheelbarrow? at the vegetable market of Fort-de-France, in a tale as lively and magical as the marketplace itself.

After long hard days of laboring in the mines, at the factories and on the farms, we gathered in the evenings not only to the love of God, family, and friends, but to these wonderful foods. As did so many others, our family proudly fought world wars for our new country. And as we prospered and built new lives in America, these were the recipes that fueled our bodies and our spirits. My mother, Mary Harrison DeGraziano, collected these recipes over her entire lifetime from a multitude of loving friends and family. A history of her life and her many friendships can be found in these recipes. Mom had to stop school in the seventh grade, leaving home and working elsewhere to earn and send money back to a large family. Finally Mother ended up in New York City in the 1930's and 40's. In New York City, at a dance one night, she met and about one year later married, my father Peter Frank DeGraziano. When I was young, we moved from Brooklyn, New York to Berwick, Pennsylvania, near Mother's family. Here I grew up. Twelve years later, my parents moved to Goshen, Indiana, then Chicago, Tom's River, New Jersey, Westchester, New York, and then back to Berwick, where Mother lived until her passing. All along the way Mother made many wonderful friends as she collected recipes. Mom often just looked at a recipe with a faraway gaze, recalling warm golden memories of so many deep and special friendships. Now I realize that Mother spent her life not only collecting and preparing these recipes, but, even more importantly, collecting and cherishing her friends. These recipes served to bookmark memories of her many valued friendships. Everywhere Mother went, people greeted her as a life-long friend. She understood people, human needs and dynamics better than most, and people everywhere just flocked to her. I never heard her judge another person. Thank you, Mother, for all your love, guidance, advice, understanding, friendship and these exceptional recipes. Your Son, Thomas S.

Starting with my first club, Sanctuary, and continuing with Mission in Manhattan's East Village and ending with the highly regarded Luna Lounge, this is the first book to cover a part of the New York rock music scene that came after punk, new wave, and no wave. Musicians and bands including Joey Ramone, The Psychedelic Furs, The Jesus And Mary Chain, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, The Sugarcubes, The Sisters Of Mercy, and Killing Joke, among others, would party together at Mission. It was the late 1980s, a time of MTV's \\"120 Minutes,\\" melodic British psychedelic guitar rock, Wax Trax industrial rock records, and a dangerous but exciting Lower East Side. Moving further ahead, my story continues with the sale of the Mission and the opening of Luna Lounge in 1995, possibly the most important venue of its size in New York. Luna was the stage where The Strokes, Interpol, The National, Longwave, stellastarr*, The Bravery, The Hold Steady, and many other bands first performed before friends and early fans of the bands. Also, Luna would host free performances from Marty Willson-Piper (The Church), Black Box Recorder, Sonic Boom, and Kid Rock. This is also a narrative about Elliott Smith as he wrote out his work for the album, XO, while sitting at the Luna Lounge bar and his subsequent launch into stardom. In addition, Luna Lounge was a well known Monday night comedy spot where cutting edge comics worked new material in front of a supportive audience as part of the \\"Eating It\\" comedy series, the room where fans could see, among others, Jon Stewart, Janeane Garofalo, Jeff Garlin, Rob Cordry, Greg Fitzsimmons, Lewis Black, Jim Norton, Lewis C.K., and Marc Maron. Finally, this is the story of the forced closing of Luna Lounge, a victim of the rising real estate values which came as a result of the quality of life initiatives set out by the Republican mayors who have controlled the city for the last twenty years.

Operating under the assumption that people read and write certain ways based upon society s demands, Dinshaw examines gender identity and the effects of a patriarchal society. The focal point of Dinshaw s argument is the idea that the literary text can be seen as the female body while any literary activities upon the text are decidedly male. Through a series of six provocative essays, Dinshaw argues that Chaucer was not only aware that gender is a social construction, but that he self-consciously worked to oppose the dominance of masculinity that a patriarchal society places on texts by creating works in which gender identity and hierarchy were more fluid.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MS5iomdAlowC&dq=Chaucer%27s+Sexual+Poetics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A pricing checklist for small retailers (Management aids)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i0b3xbH96r0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studies of the eighteenth century in Italy","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xy5JAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House of Moses All-Stars","description":"A New York Times Notable Book Here is the story of an all-Jewish basketball team traveling in a hearse through Depression-era America in search of redemption and big money. A hilarious road novel, The House of Moses All-Stars is also a passionate portrayal of a young Jewish man struggling to realize his dreams in a country struggling to recover its ideals. Charley Rosen gives us basketball as a metaphor for life. Aaron Steiner, the protagonist of The House of Moses All-Stars, is a man very close to the edge. The former college basketball star has watched his dreams of being a successful player fall apart, his marriage disintegrate, and his baby die. In desperation he accepts his friend s offer to join a Jewish professional basketball team The House of Moses All-Stars which is traveling on a cross-country tour in a renovated hearse. Aaron s teammates a Communist, a Zionist, a former bank robber, and a red-headed Irishman who passes for a Jew are, like Aaron, trying to escape their own troubled pasts. As the members of this motley crew travel west to California through an anti-Semitic land that disdains and rebuffs them, they discover a nation grappling with social and economic collapse and fear of foreigners, in conflict with its own democratic ideals of tolerance and opportunity.

The winner was James Jefferson Jones, or J3, and he became the perfect president. But how did J3 accomplish such a colossal act of deception? The story of how he fooled the citizens of the United States as a modern-day \\"Wizard of Oz\\" is told by Smitty, a homeless man who is also one of the architects of J3's victory and term in office. What makes this incredible, of course, is that history books, television, and the Internet of the year 2020 say nothing about J3, his election or his service to the nation. Our entire country suffered amnesia and somehow overlooked J3's part in history. This satire of the presidency spans from the time J3 decides to run with Robert \\"Beelzebob\\" Fenster, the richest man in the world, to J3's premature withdrawal from office.

The musical comedy connected airplanes, movies, and tourism, ending spectacularly with chorus girls dancing on the wings of airplanes high above Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Hollywood fantasy capped three decades during which airplanes and movies engendered new expectations and redefined peoples sense of wellbeing, their personal satisfactions, and their interpersonal relations. Wilbur and Orville Wright flew their airplane in 1903, at the same time that filmmakers began to project edited, filmed stories onto large screens. Spectators found entertainment value in both airplane competitions and motion pictures, and movie producers brought the thrill of aviators antics to a rapidly expanding audience. Meanwhile, air shows and competitions attracted large crowds of tourists. Mass tourism grew as a leisuretime activity, stimulated in part by travelogues and feature films. By 1930, the businessmen who envisioned transporting tourists to their destinations by airplane struggled to overcome the movieexaggerated association of flight with danger. Schwartz weaves these threads into a story of human daring and persistence, political intrigue, and international competition. From Wilbur and Orville to Fred and Ginger, Schwartzs narrative follows the fortunes of aviation and movie pioneers and the foundations and growth of Pan American Airways and RKORadio Pictures, the two companies that came together in Flying Down to Rio. By the end of the twentieth century, aviation, movies, and mass tourism had become powerful global industries, contributing to an internationally connected, entertainmentoriented culture. What was once unthinkable had now become expected.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=byD0RR6GBqcC&dq=Flying+Down+to+Rio:+Hollywood,+Tourists,+and+Yankee+Clippers+(Centennial+of+Flight+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Place to Stand (Florida College Annual Lectures (Feb. 1-4, 1999))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ages in Chaos: A Reconstruction of Ancient History from the Exodus to King Akhnaton","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MurxPgAACAAJ&dq=Ages+in+Chaos:+A+Reconstruction+of+Ancient+History+from+the+Exodus+to+King+Akhnaton&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zoonomia; or, The laws of organic life","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CN0TAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Person to person: the problem of being human","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8rJIvwEACAAJ&dq=Person+to+person:+the+problem+of+being+human&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","description":"Sent to Vienna to authenticate a painting, art restorer and occasional spy Gabriel Allon sets out to uncover the truth about a photograph of an unnamed man who had brutalized his mother during the final days of World War II.

Men wage wars of trade for the emeralds which fuel the most powerful sorceries, and the Satyrs sail the high seas ... to stage panty-raids. Beneath it all, the dungeons are the crushed remains of heaven itself. This is Uresia: Grave of Heaven, the acclaimed, eccentric, and basically good-natured fantasy world by S. John Ross. Uresia is a world explored at several zoom-levels, from the broad sweep of kingdoms to a detailed fantasy city to the day-to-day of a remote rural village to the individual troubles and triumphs of specific characters across the grave. Familiar enough to provide firm footing for traditional-fantasy fans (it's a world of warriors, wizards, thieves and vagabonds), but with a warmth & personality entirely its own, with unexpected details around every corner (it's a world where Slimes and haunted snowmen are valid PCs, the \\"common tongue\\" is dangerous in the wrong company, and your campaign is just as likely to visit a sporting arena as the nearby trap-laden ruin).

Women choose to participate actively in outdoors careers, many believing the profession is a level playing field and that it offers alternatives to traditional sporting activities. They enter outdoor learning primarily on the strength of their enthusiasm for leading and teaching in natural environments and assume the field is inclusive, rewarding excellence regardless of age, gender, socioeconomic status, disability, or ethnicity. However, both research and collective experiences in OLEs suggest that many women feel invisible, relegated, marginalized, and undervalued. In response to this marginalization, this Handbook celebrates the richness of knowledge and practices of women practitioners in OLEs. Women scholars and practitioners from numerous fields, such as experiential outdoor education, adventure education, adventure therapy, and gender studies, explore the implications of their research and practice using poignant examples within their own disciplines. These insights emerge from similar life experiences as women and outdoor leaders in the 1970s to the present. Social inequalities still abound in OLEs, and the Handbook ensures that the contributions of women are highlighted as well as the work that needs to be done to make these spaces inclusive. Global in perspective and capacious in content, this one-stop volume is an indispensable reference resource for a diverse range of academics, including students and researchers in the fields of education, psychology, sociology, gender studies, geography, and environment studies, as well as the many outdoors fields.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EZZaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chernobyl and Other Nuclear Accidents (New Perspectives (Raintree))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Quick-Simmering Soups (Better Homes and Gardens(R): Fresh and Simple)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I3pYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Quick-Simmering+Soups+(Better+Homes+and+Gardens(R):+Fresh+and+Simple)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The National Directory of Haunted Places","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Journey : 52 Weeks in Recovery","description":"52 Week Gratitude Journal For Alcohol Addiction Recovery You have done something truly amazing!

This of course, nearly crushes each person's spirit. In one-way or another, each youth is linked to each other (ages between 18 and 21). The novel is primarily concerned with choices in love, in some cases a manifesto about its dangers. At the end it, it must be said, nothing was tolerable but the best. No one was without sin. Four youths [l967-68], while being in the process of growth get stirred up quite a lot, some even lost in the commotion of events, while feelings become nourished and intensified, all aching for love, in their own way. A lesson might well be learned if they can only harness their crying hearts; but first unhappiness has to be conquered (part of the theme and plot). The story has a shy-charm to it, a quick gaiety, and objective tenderness. It is dramatic; it has an exploring inner mind.

Yet sweeping changes were underway. In l958 Congress awarded the new state over 100 million acres to promote economic development. In 1971, it gave Native groups more than 40 million acres to settle land claims and facilitate the building of an 800-mile oil pipeline. Spurred by the newly militant environmental movement, it also began to consider the preservation of Alaska's magnificent scenery and wildlife. Northern Landscapes is an essential guide to Alaska's recent past and to contemporary local and national debates over the future of public lands and resources. It is the first comprehensive examination of the campaign to preserve wild Alaska through the creation of a vast system of parks and wildlife refuges. Drawing on archival sources and interviews, Daniel Nelson traces disputes over resources alongside the politics of the Alaska statehood movement. He provides in-depth coverage of the growth of Alaskan environmental organizations, their partnerships with national groups, and their participation in political campaigns into the 1970s and after. Engagingly written, Northern Landscapes focuses on efforts to persuade public officials to recognize the value of Alaska's mountains, forests, and wildlife. That activity culminated in the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980, which set aside more than 100 million acres, doubling the size of the national park and wildlife refuge systems, and tripling the size of the wilderness preservation system. Arguably the single greatest triumph of environmentalism, ANILCA also set the stage for continuing battles over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Alaska's national forests.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FIEonQAACAAJ&dq=Northern+Landscapes:+The+Struggle+for+Wilderness+Alaska&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Celts (Ancient peoples and places)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sqixxwEACAAJ&dq=The+Celts+(Ancient+peoples+and+places)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Option Market Making: Trading and Risk Analysis for the Financial and Commodity Option Markets","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mosaic: Perspectives on Investing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=73y8AAAACAAJ&dq=Mosaic:+Perspectives+on+Investing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Structured Credit Products: Credit Derivatives and Synthetic Securitization","description":"Updated coverage of structured credit products with in-depth coverage of the latest developments Structured credit products are one of today's fastest growing investment and risk management mechanisms, and a focus of innovation and creativity in the capital markets.

Initially receiving mixed reviews, the stage show would enjoy a short life, but the subsequent film would steadily build a cult student following, filling hundreds of cinemas on a weekly basis, and gaining huge video sales. Now, in the 25th anniversary of the making of the infamous movie starring Tim Curry, Richard O'Brien, Susan Sarandon, Meat Loaf and Barry Bostwick, we find out what went on behind the scenes from those who were there. This celebration of Transylvanian proportions brings the true fan completely up to date, interviewing the main stars of stage and screen productions, describing how each evolved, the good times, the squabbles, the tantrums, the jealously and the greed as Rocky Horror made a special piece of history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_QccAQAAIAAJ&dq=Rocky+Horror:+From+Concept+to+Cult&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Physics of Angels: Exploring the Realm Where Science and Spirit Meet","description":"Fox, an Episcopal priest, and Sheldrake, a biologist, create a profound and intelligent vision of angels for the next millennium.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X5lIBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Physics+of+Angels:+Exploring+the+Realm+Where+Science+and+Spirit+Meet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","description":"With the baby boom generation came the genre of parenting books that told parents how to teach their kids everything from toilet training to developing self-esteem. Generally the message has been: go easy on your child, but hard on yourself. It is starting to become apparent, especially in the best of families, that giving your kids lots of choices, validating their feelings at great peril to your own and providing \\"enough\\" individual attention for each child is creating a generation of kids over whom we have no control. Cassidy argues that this comes from over-thinking our role as parents. We've pondered every step so much that the juice, the joy, and worst of all, our confidence is gone. The reasons are clear: We have fewer children later in life so we've had more time to ponder. We've grown up just as research on infant and child development has come of age, so there's no shortage of material to think about. As a generation we've prided ourselves on self-improvement and we bring the same zeal to child improvement. We're less likely to live close to our families, and so are more likely to seek out expert solutions. To counter this thinking, Cassidy will suggest keeping the big picture in mind--what kind of people do you really want your kids to be? Honest, kind, cooperative, empathetic? It may mean losing sight of whether enough play dates are scheduled for the week and if you've positively reinforced the latest creative endeavor, but it will bring back your instincts about what is important to your family as a whole, and to your kids to become decent people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7BsjxtGeVygC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paint Contractor's Handbook","description":"Now you can publish perfect Web pages using typefaces that you can provide to your Web site visitors.

Riots- What Really Happened","description":"WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD ONE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW'S 10 BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR The first comprehensive historical biography of Laura Ingalls Wilder, the beloved author of the Little House on the Prairie books Millions of readers of Little House on the Prairie believe they know Laura Ingalls the pioneer girl who survived blizzards and near-starvation on the Great Plains, and the woman who wrote the famous autobiographical books. But the true saga of her life has never been fully told. Now, drawing on unpublished manuscripts, letters, diaries, and land and financial records, Caroline Fraser the editor of the Library of America edition of the Little House series masterfully fills in the gaps in Wilder s biography. Revealing the grown-up story behind the most influential childhood epic of pioneer life, she also chronicles Wilder's tumultuous relationship with her journalist daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, setting the record straight regarding charges of ghostwriting that have swirled around the books. The Little House books, for all the hardships they describe, are paeans to the pioneer spirit, portraying it as triumphant against all odds. But Wilder s real life was harder and grittier than that, a story of relentless struggle, rootlessness, and poverty. It was only in her sixties, after losing nearly everything in the Great Depression, that she turned to children s books, recasting her hardscrabble childhood as a celebratory vision of homesteading and achieving fame and fortune in the process, in one of the most astonishing rags-to-riches episodes in American letters. Spanning nearly a century of epochal change, from the Indian Wars to the Dust Bowl, Wilder s dramatic life provides a unique perspective on American history and our national mythology of self-reliance. With fresh insights and new discoveries, Prairie Fires reveals the complex woman whose classic stories grip us to this day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yoq9DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studying Smart Rev","description":"\\"This brilliant book should be required reading for every student going off to college. . . .

One features a young female sleuth, a college beauty queen, professional jealousies, and a neat conclusion. The other is a tragedy caused by evil social forces, in which a web of lies works insidiously to entangle Sidonia, who is a publisher of suppressed books and the narrator's wife.A brilliantly stylish tour de force in which the bright, sarcastic comedy of one tale sharply contrasts with the dark, elegiac bitterness of the other, Two Murders in My Double Life confirms Skvorecky's reputation as one of our most versatile, engaging, and compassionate writers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9jYXCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Class Room Teacher - Volume 2 (Volume 2)","description":"Examines the issues of music instruction in urban schools and provides political, philosophical, and practical approaches to music education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vUoJAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Class+Room+Teacher+-+Volume+2+(Volume+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the enclosure (Avon science fiction/15073)","description":"Includes entries for maps and atlases.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2YdF-nGJ95UC&dq=In+the+enclosure+(Avon+science+fiction/15073)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muay Thai: The Most Distinguished Art of Fighting","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DRaQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Muay+Thai:+The+Most+Distinguished+Art+of+Fighting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New International Webster's Student Dictionary","description":"-- 85,000 Entries -- 1,000 Illustrations, Maps, Charts and Tables -- Hundreds of Synonym Lists -- Clear, Understandable Pronunciation Guide -- Clear and Precise Definitions","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IJVtpzW1uSsC&dq=The+New+International+Webster%27s+Student+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Forger","description":"In Nazi Germany, 20-year-old graphic artist Cioma Sch?nhaus found a unique outlet for his talent: he forged documents for people fleeing the Reich, ultimately helping to save hundreds of lives.

Instead, the cavalry met the gathered strength of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors, who did not run as expected but turned the battle toward the soldiers. White Bull charged again and again, fighting until the last soldier was dead. The battle was Custer's Last Stand, and white Bull was later referred to as the warrior who killed Custer In 1932 White Bull related his life story to Stanley Vestal, who corroborated the details, from other sources and prepared this biography. \\"All that I told him is straight and true,\\" said White Bull.

Alongside current events and classified ads, publishers began running comic strips, sports sections, women s pages, and Sunday magazines. Newspapers  lavish illustrations, colorful dialogue, and sensational stories seemed to reproduce city life on the page. Yet as Julia Guarneri reveals, newspapers did not simply report on cities; they also helped to build them. Metropolitan sections and civic campaigns crafted cohesive identities for sprawling metropolises. Real estate sections boosted the suburbs, expanding metropolitan areas while maintaining cities  roles as economic and information hubs. Advice columns and advertisements helped assimilate migrants and immigrants to a class-conscious, consumerist, and cosmopolitan urban culture. Newsprint Metropolis offers a tour of American newspapers in their most creative and vital decades. It traces newspapers  evolution into highly commercial, mass-produced media, and assesses what was gained and lost as national syndicates began providing more of Americans  news. Case studies of Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, and Milwaukee illuminate the intertwined histories of newspapers and the cities they served. In an era when the American press is under attack, Newsprint Metropolis reminds us how papers once hosted public conversations and nurtured collective identities in cities across America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fPglEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+World+on+Sunday+:+Graphic+Art+in+Joseph+Pulitzer%27s+Newspaper+(1898+-+1911)&hl=&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},I=["disabled"],E={key:0},P={key:1};function x(s,t,i,u,r,a){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[t[1]||(t[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,I)):c("",!0)])}const J=d(B,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-0cbe4c44"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/31.md","filePath":"drive/31.md"}'),q={name:"drive/31.md"},D=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(t,i)=>(e(),o("div",null,[w(J)]))}});export{H as __pageData,D as default};
