It's a fairly old book so I was concerned that I wouldn't find it. I think this is the best relationship book I've ever read and I've read a lot. All relationships, not just marraige."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"Alan Lay McGinnis is a genius! In this book he gives 5 ways to deepen relationships, 5 ways to cultivate intimacy, 2 ways to handle negative emotions, and much more. He also discusses in great detail what one should do if a relationship goes bad. Each of his points are supported by expert opinions and previous cases he has had as a shrink.

I still continue to recommend it to others when relationship issues arise."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"I believe that if the entire world read this book we would be a happier, healthier, friendlier, more supportive, more understanding and a more tolerant planet. I think this book should be required reading in schools!This book is as applicable today as it was when it was written over 20 years ago. Maybe even more so. Even if you think you have the right approach to people and relationships and even if you feel all your relationships are healthy... you could learn from this book. I guarantee there are things in this book that you have not thought of.I love this book and I highly recommend it because I believe it will benefit you and make you a better person. It had a great impact on me. I intend to read it annually.The author gives ideas on how to deepen friendships. These include: 1) Assign top priority to your relationships 2)Dare to talk about affection 3)Learn the gesturs of love (i.e appreciating someone offering help and graciously accepting this help) AND 4) CREATE SPACE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP (in other words don't CONTROL, don't strangle ~ let them grow and breathe!!!The author also gives pointers on cultivating intimacy. He suggests that you 1) Be liberal with praise 2) Learn to LISTEN (such as asking questions the other will enjoy answering, get the other to talk about themselves and dispensing advice SPARINGLY) 3) Use your body to demonstrate warmth AND 4) Talk freely about your feelings (Dare to need the other person and let them feel that and benefit from it)A quote from the book that I especially like is: &quot;Don't stop expressing needs because of occasional disappointment - you'll end up bedding down with disappointment as your constant companion.&quot;You will also find ideas on how to handle negative feelings w/o destroying the relationship; how to disagree and understand at the same time and alternative methods of ventilating your anger.Another quote I appreciate: &quot;If you dish it out - you have to take it&quot; !!!!!Other interesting subjects in this book are: 1) The art of creative forgiveness 2) Eros - It's power and problems and 3) Loyalty, an essential ingredient.The author writes in an easy to read fashion and backs up his suggestions and ideas with many quotes from people far and near, young and old and from other books. If you have not read this book yet... do so now. I suspect that you will find it as wonderful and helpful as I did.

Having been read and re-read over the years, it is one of the most worn out books I own and definitely one of the most valuable.This book not only tells you how to get great friends but how to be a great friend and how to take the friendships you have to a deeper and more meaningful level.

There are stories in &quot;The Friendship Factor&quot; that have stayed with me for 15 years and are as powerful as any lecture, advice or sermon I've heard."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"This continues to be one of my all-time favorite books. Everyone should read it at least once. I pick it up and read it every couple of years and always get as much or more out of it than the first time I read it 25 years ago. There are no \\"mind games\\" here - just plain, simple, practical information that makes you think about the people in your life and how you treat them. I cannot even guess how many copies I have given to family and friends over the years. At any given time I have multiple copies in my den just waiting for me to give them away.

Do you want your relationships to be deeper and more meaningful? If you are ready and willing to take a look at yourself and the way you interact with people with the intention of strengthening and deepening your relationships, I haven't found a better book one could start with. Alan McGinnis must be a fantastic counselor. If he were nearby, I would pay whatever it would cost to spend hours discussing relationships and life decisions with him, just for the benefit of his insight. There is great wisdom and practical advice to be found in the pages of this little book. It's written in a warm, friendly tone and not filled with psycho-babble, but with real-life examples from McGinnis' experience as a counselor. Read it. Then read it again. And don't stop reading it. As you do this, make a conscious effort to put the clearly stated principles into action. The result: You WILL see your relationships with people grow in depth and warmth, and you WILL become a more lovable person."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"I am writing this review because I firmly believe that my life will be incomplete without friends.

I found some of the short stories to be really heartwarming and strong.After reading this book, I have some self motivation to become a better person and a better friend. In some sense, I think this book gave me a lot of personal growth. I subsequently became a better person and I think I am more sensitive now than before.

It is a real privaledge to be able to learn from Alan McGinnis the keys to good friendships.

It has a clear message flow that Friendship is the intensity of the love that leaves behind trails of sweet memories to cherish the core of life giving a whole new meaning to it. The enigma of friendship strengthens with the bonds of relationships so unique which is unselfish, intimate, pure and beautiful. Learning to appreciate, speak out on issues, Listening, confide and sharing secrets, meeting of wavelengths and such deeper corners are focused for a caring friendly relationship with the people you love most. The Art of Forgiveness is one chapter which is very thought oriented that helps change Attitude to bring about a difference to be friendly. Friendship hurts as of many reasons but the author 'Allan' reveals the tact and provide clues for enjoying joys of Friendship."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"This book is written by a Christian layman, and is full of references to God and Jesus throughout the book. In my opinion, working with oneself with regards to any issue, should never be based on any religion of any kind. It should be independent of any religious belief.The book talks a lot about love as the key to build friendships, like Jesus did. \\"love and be loved again\\". His rules to achieve deeper relationships are:1. Assign top priority to your relationships2. Cultivate transparency (be open and honest)3. Dare to talk about your affection4. Learn the gesture of love5. Create space in your relationshipsThe book has a naive and unprofessional approach to the topic. While the author is aware of the fact that too much emotion, care, interest, help, kindness and so on could challenge the relationship, he does not give it much attention, and he even says that too much is better than too little, which is not always true.It does not provide a way to get closer to the people you care for. There is nothing in this book, which is not already common knowlegde. Everything in the book is basic. It could go as a sweet and funny Christian book about friendships in general. But it is not a professional book about how to go from a regular friendship to a deep and close friendship."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"I rated this book this high because it had many one liner quotes that will help me daily.

He didn't clarify whether he was referring to levels of intimacy in friendship between two men, two women, a woman and a man, a married couple, or a rabbi, a priest, and a nun. Since love has a spiritual element, it can be beautiful to be all-inclusive, viewing love on a spectrum, but this seemed more to be a case of not-very-well-thought-out information and ideas. I wanted more depth and clarity in an exploration of the topic of friendship than this book delivered."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"I've read this book years ago and I've been recently looking for a new book on the subject being that I'm in a new country and may be here for some years. (I've moved from all of my old friends) Anyways, there's this reviewer Hansen (something or other) who's given this book a 1 star. He's given the book a pretty accurate review.

I say real, because I have been enjoying wine (red, mostly) for the better part of eighteen years. However, I have never gotten more serious than having a very limited knowledge of grapes and particular blends. For example, I knew of Cabernet Sauvignon, the regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy, Chardonnay, and eventually came to hear of Merlot. Six years ago, I saw Cabernet Franc in a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, and was excited there was another grape of which I had not heard. Soon after that, it was Shiraz. Then something happened in the last six months - perhaps it was tiring of drinking cheap wine (Charles Shaw) - I decided to spend the extra money and branch out. I started talking to sommeliers at restaurants and stores, asking questions, and while I have only grazed the surface on what there is to know about the breathtaking enormity of the world of wine, my knowledge has increased notably.Part of the reason for that is this little book. I picked it up at a retailer (sorry Amazon!) because I noticed it on the shelf and it had a very inexpensive price tag. Flipping through the pages, I realized this had some good information in it - enough at first glance to justify spending a small sum.That small sum has paid dividends. While the title is pretentious, the book itself is not. It begins by introducing us to the world of wine, describing what wine is, the grapes that are used to make wine, different wine styles, and then gets more specific, describing specific wines: dry white wine; semi-sweet white wine; pink wine; dry red wine; sparkling wine; sweet wine; and fortified wine. While the descriptions of each are brief, they do an excellent job of covering the essentials.From there the book moves into \\"How to Taste\\", and unlocks the mysteries of what we are supposed to look for in wine. Most people that want to seem like they know what they are doing in a restaurant merely embarrass themselves. For example, they sniff the cork instead of squeezing it, or slush the wine around in the glass when poured for the initial taste as if they are trying to set a speed record. This section tells us how to do it more properly. It also discusses tastes, aromas, flavors, and textures. What is an example of a \\"chewy\\" wine? Cabernet Sauvignon, because it is dry, full bodied, and strong, with a smooth beginning that (if the wine is of good quality) explodes on the palate with perhaps four or five distinct flavors, and then finishes rough. Chewy refers to it being full bodied. Heavy in the mouth.There is a very instructive and well-organized section on wines by grape type. Each major grape (every grape in the world isn't listed - if it were, it would fill the whole book) is listed, and is characterized with this information: Usual wine style; Intensity; Aromas/Flavors; Acidity; Texture; Tannin; Wood; Foods; Cooking styles; and the Principal Regions that wine is grown in.The above hardly sounds like something useful to a Sommelier, does it? But that's only the first 30 pages. After that is where the real fun begins. All of the areas of production are covered exhaustively for such a small tome (e.g., the U.S. France, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Italy, Spain, etc.). There is a section on ordering wine in the restaurant, then combing wine with food, and finally how to buy.I love this book. It is an excellent introduction."},{"Title":"The Sommelier's Guide to Wine: A Primer for Selecting, Serving, and Savoring Wine (Sommelier's Guide to Wine: Everything You Need to Know for Selecting)","review":"I picked up this book because of the size and texture of the cover.

A brief introduction and glossary enhance this unique volume, yet the bulk its pages are devoted to specific ammunitions with each shell accompanied by a black-and-white photograph as well as scale measurements, brief commentary, dimensions, and a listing of where they were most often used. Civil War Heavy Explosive Ordnance is a truly impressive and invaluable resource for Civil War historians and military history buffs."},{"Title":"Civil War Heavy Explosive Ordnance: A Guide to Large Artillery Projectiles, Torpedoes, and Mines","review":"CIVIL WAR HEAVY EXPLOSIVE ORDANCE, by well-known collector JACK BELL, presents an in-depth study of Civil War heavy artillery projectiles, mines and torpedoes. His lifelong association with the CW artillery fraternity provided access to public and private collections containing heretofore-unknown examples of heavy munitions. The author's meticulous research uncovered buried and previously overlooked information and provided important technical and geographic information vital for the in-depth study of the use of heavy explosive ordnance in the war. The result is a highly documented reference source that closes a thirty-year information gap, and significantly advances the state of knowledge about the development and deployment during the war.CIVIL WAR HEAVY EXPLOSIVE ORDANCE is a necessary tool for the serious artillery collector yet provides interesting reading for the student of general Civil War history. The book contains over 1000 clear photographs and multiple views of the 360 projectiles and 22 torpedoes and mines. Jack Bell's presentation is lucid and while professionally technical is delivered in an extremely readable style."},{"Title":"Civil War Heavy Explosive Ordnance: A Guide to Large Artillery Projectiles, Torpedoes, and Mines","review":"Jack Bell's \\"Civil War Heavy Explosive Ordnance\\" is a superb black and white photographic catalog of ammunition for heavy artillery (4\\" and larger.) It is the natural companion to Olmstead, Stark and Tucker's \\"The Big Guns.\\" The book is geared more toward the collector than as a technical historical reference, but still can fill the latter role in many ways. While a picture might not be worth a full thousand words, it certainly helps.The first 470 pages contain introductory text, a glossary, and the catalog of heavy ordnance. The next 26 pages contain a photographic catalog of torpedoes (mines.) Thirty pages of appendices follow, and the book ends with a bibliography and index.The heavy ordnance is divided into two sections: large smoothbore projectiles, and rifled projectiles. The smoothbore section is subdivided into: shot, shell and case shot; canister; and grape. Rifled projectiles are then subdivided into twenty-seven major types and one miscellaneous group.The general form of each entry is a brief introduction of a page or several pages about the type (Archer, Hotchkiss, Dyer, etc.) and then the following pages contain one to three images of each size and type of projectile of that type. When three images of a given projectile are provided they are viewed straight on from top, bottom, and side. Some images of shell or case are half sections. Entries below each set of photographs provide diameter, length, weight, gun, sabot, fuze, rifling, rarity, provenance, and comments.My quibbles with this work are minor. Some of the recessed spaces and contour relief are difficult or impossible to interpret with a 90-degree angle view and no shadows. Case shot appears to have been under represented. Projectile counts and burst charges (known or estimated) are largely omitted.Although the text introductory sections for each type are short, they provide some answers to long standing puzzles. For example the Archer projectiles are finally attributed to the correct Archer, Dr. Robert Archer. The Mullane has been renamed the \\"Tennessee\\" and attributed to the correct actual designer, Capt. Lardner Gibbon.The appendices are also particularly useful. There is a list of missing and unaccounted for rounds in Appendix A, a list of rifling types by caliber in Appendix B, as well as the detailed review of rifled sabot systems in Appendix C.Lamentably, this book (like \\"The Big Guns\\") is not on many Civil War site bookstore shelves, although I did see one at the naval museum in Columbus, Georgia."},{"Title":"Civil War Heavy Explosive Ordnance: A Guide to Large Artillery Projectiles, Torpedoes, and Mines","review":"It has been a long awaited moment in my 40+ years of experience in dealing with artillery projectiles of the American Civil War to see a book of this caliber in print. It is the most comprehensive guide or research tool for those with an interest in this field. It is appropriate for the novice and the more proficient.Mr. Bell, along with a multitude of hours doing research and the aide of his peers, was able to compile an impressive array of photographs (350+) and information for the reader.The book references shells from 4&quot; and up; including round balls, projectiles, torpedoes, land mines, and a chapter on sabot designs.I highly recommend Mr. Bell's book to those who want to expand their knowledge of Civil War heavy artillery."},{"Title":"ANSYS Tutorial (Release 7.0)","review":"This manual will allow you to easily learn the majority of the available resources of ANSYS.

Llosa has a powerful sense of the absurd."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"This is the second novel I've read by MVL.It's not the tour de force that CONVERSATION IN THE CATHEDRAL is.DEATH is easier to read and more straightforward.While CONVERSATION takes place largely in Lima and routinely crosses class and racial boundaries,DEATH is narrower.It is , unsurprisingly set largely in the Andes and focuses primarily on the highland Indian culture.To some degree ,the novel revolves around Corporal Lituma and his de facto sidekick, Private(I assume)Carreno.Lituma is a decent enough sort who isn't exactly thrilled to be assigned to the mountain mining town of Naccos.He doesn't speak Quechua and can't really bond with the natives who treat him as a bit of a joke.He is preoccupied with the disappearance of three local men and knows perfectly well the locals aren't telling him what happened.This is the time of the Shining Path insurrection and he knows if they get a hold of him , he will die a brutal death.So not only is he in a permanent state of anxiety, he's offended.He is paid peanuts and harms no one.So it seems ridiculous that the only people who may take him seriously are guerrillas who want to kill him because he is a class enemy.During the day , he gets to talk to the local witch and her weird husband who runs a cantina where the miners get blind drunk.At night, he is entertained by Carreno's tale of romance.Carreno has in the past supplemented his civil guard income working as a body guard for criminals.One day one of the criminals starts beating a woman in some kind of SM ritual and Carreno shoots him dead , falls in love and takes off with the woman ,who abandons him.Carreno narrates this tale and tells it in his sleep.Alternating between boredom, fascination and amusement, Lituma continually listens to this tale.(Naccos is a pretty dull place).MVL interweaves several narrative threads.There is Carreno's story, Litumas observations, the witches story and a number of anecdotes dealing with the Shining Path murdering class enemies.You don't even have to be human to be a class enemy.At, one point the guerrillas slaughter a group of essentially tame vicunas because they sense they are capitalist tools.I'm being flip but this is a disturbing, chilling sequence.Near the end Lituma learns what happened to the three men who disappeared and wishes he hadn't.This is a rich , fascinating novel and a pretty quick read."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"For me, the strength of this book is more Llosa's writing than the plot(s). The book centers on three related stories: a murder mystery, a love story and the atrocities of the Senderistas (Shining Path). The stories are each compelling although there are a few meandering paths along the way, such as character development for individuals who die a few pages later. That said, Llosa's writing is amazing: I would read his grocery list. In this book, he adeptly moves between current and past events, first and third person, all within the same paragraph. His descriptions of the Andes and its people are vibrant. Overall, a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Great book, well written, a mixture of the heart of darkness and apocalypse now. After reading this book had to re read a heart of darkness, the tales are the same, each interesting, and enjoyable to read. Not a cheerful book, but very very good."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"\\"Death in the Andes: A Novel\\" is a challenging story, meshing timelines and speakers, but its message is clear: getting rich on the backs of others while trying to appease the gods are elements that stir tragedy.

The style has tones of Jose Saramago and Gabriel Garcia Marquez."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Llosa does the unimaginable with the novel--suspense on every page, and yet the story is truly a piece of art. How does he do it? With cliffhangers on every page, and emotional blackmail all over the place. And despite this, the writing stays simple. Llosa doesn't need long words or long sentences. His elegant writing and innovative use of interspersed story will keep you spellbound from start to finish."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"This brillant work allows readers to dive into Peru's recent history head first.

In the end, the story makes sense, and I was deeply affected by it."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Reading Death in the Andes was a roller coaster for me. There were parts of the book that absolutely captivated me and then there were also parts that kind of put me to sleep. There were parts that I felt so immersed in the book that I dreamed about it that night, which has never happened to me before in reading a book. But then there were times when I did not feel immersed at all in the book and I wanted to put it down because I felt like I was not interested at all. The language in this book though is simply amazing. Some of the descriptions allowed me to picture it perfectly in my head.

It has make me understand the culture of one part of my country, it reveals it and makes it easy to analyze it. The book is horrific but we have to remember that the plot is set on the worst days of terrorism in Peru. Excellent !"},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Not the characters in this narrative! It's the author's intellectual integrity that becomes \\"Lost in the Andes\\" (the title in English translation) of this short novel published in Spain rather than Peru. I can't remember a well-written novel in any language that has disgusted and outraged me as thoroughly as this one. Yes, it's a piece of craft, a compelling narrative written in beautiful Spanish. But it's also a dishonest self-exoneration, replete with cheap literary tricks and outright deceptions, and an arrogantly contumacious depiction of the indigenous culture of Quechua-speaking Peruvian villagers. It verges on pure propaganda for the interests of global capitalist \\"development\\" at the cost of the poor, already the most victimized people by conquest and colonialism on Earth. It's a brilliant, hateful book, all the more hateful in English because most of its North America readers will have no idea what's at stake in it.First I'd better make my position clear, concerning Peru's \\"Shining Path\\" insurrectionary movement, which provides the context of this narrative. I do not in any way support or defend Sendero Luminoso. I don't approve their ideological fanaticism, nor do I condone their ruthlessness. Founded on \\"Maoist\\" extremism, they had every potential of duplicating the genocidal atrocities of Pol Pot if they'd succeeded in their revolution. Their analysis of the history of Peru - a blood-soaked horror from Pisarro to the present - was fundamentally correct; no historian would dispute most of it. Their rage against the oligarchy of wealth in Peru and the perpetual exploitation of that country by international capitalism was fully justified. But everything they derived from that analysis and that rage was insane. The portrayal of their inflamed cruelty in this novel is not inaccurate. They were indeed murderous. The problem is that \\"the other side\\" was equally or even more murderous, ruthless, unscrupulous, and without the hint of an excuse provided by history. According to the 2003 report by the NGO Human Rights Watch, the deaths and disappearances in the class warfare in Peru between 1980 and 2000 numbered just under 70,000; Sendero Luminoso was held culpable for only 46% of those crimes, with the military and rightwing militias guilty of the larger half.In Vargas Llosa's novel, the Senderistas are a diffuse guerrilla network. They 'control' the countryside and descend on villages, work parties, and travelers at will. They include women and children as well as hard-eyed men in ski masks. Vargas inserts two full chapters in the novel solely to depict their insensate violence; in the first chapter, the Senderistas stop a bus, kidnap and slaughter two travelers - a young French couple charmingly 'in love' and innocent as babes. In the other chapter, the Senderistas capture, try, and execute a well-known environmentalist who has worked diligently on projects of reforestation, whom the guerrillas denounce as an unwitting 'running dog' of imperialism. However, these two chapters play no role in the overall narration. They are extraneous, and the style of their interpolation is blatantly propagandistic. Those ski masks, for instance! Ski masks were first worn chiefly by pro-regime military and militia personnel, around 1981. By the time of the fictitious events narrated in this novel, the countryside was just as terrorized by rightwing militias, called \\"rondas\\", as by Senderistas, yet no mention of the rondas appears in Vargas's narrative. The rondistas were evry whit as sadistic as the Senderistas; in 1983, for example, rightwingers stoned, set fire to, and eventaully shot a local opponent in the town square of the town of Lucanamarca. The first documented massacre of civilians by the Sendero Luminoso was a reprisal for the violence of the rondistas. Yet in 1991, those ronda death squads were 'legitimized' by President Alberto Fujimori, as Committees for Self Defense.Onward to the story: Corporal Lituma, an officer of the Guardia Civil, the national police, is assigned to 'protect' a highway-building party working in Naccos, a decaying mining town in the high Andes, populated by 'serruchos' - mountain people of indigenous Quechuan language and culture. His only aide is his young adjutant Carre&ntilde;o, a serrucho who has spent years in the lowland cities. The two are fearsomely isolated, distrusted by the villagers and the construction workers, certain that one day they will be attacked and slain by the shadowy Senderistas who have them surrounded. Three men have 'disappeared' from the village in recent weeks, and the plot of the novel focuses on Corporal Lituma's obsession with uncovering the truth about their fates. The presumption, of course, is that they were victims of the Shining Path. At the risk of spoiling the mystery, I have to state that the truth will be far more bizarre. The Senderistas never descend on Naccos. Meanwhile, huddled in their shack/office, the two policemen spend their evenings talking about ... what else? ... women! Carre&ntilde;o confesses the goofy/grizzly tale of his love for Mercedes, a prostitute from Lituma's own home town. It's a tale of comic escapades with bittersweet interludes. The two narratives - Lituma's efforts to solve the mystery of the three disappearances and Carre&ntilde;o's raunchy romance - are interwoven quite artfully. There's nothing wrong with Mario Vargas Llosa's literary performance, but there may be something seriously wrong, in an ethical sense, with his usage of semi-pornographic humor to counterpoise his essayism, his use of sex to palliate his political message.There's a history behind the writing of this novel. In 1984, Vargas was assigned by the President Belaunde Terry to a commission to study the massacre of eight journalists by villagers in the Andean community of Uchuraccay. The resultant report was highly controversial, and many Peruvians were inflammed at Vargas Llosa. The writer's efforts at self-exculpation resulted in two novels fictionalizing the massacre: \\"&iquest;Quien mat&oacute; a Palomino Molero?\\" and \\"Lituma en los Andes\\". Vargas has used the surname 'Lituma' in several of his novels, by the way, and in \\"Death in the Andes\\", Lituma plainly stand in for the sensibilities of his author. Lituma despises the Andean villagers - the serruchos - who he sees as incomprehensibly superstitious, backward, depraved, xenophobic, bloody-minded, sexually degenerate. They and their accursed mountains are the obstacles to progress, symbolized by the highway that will never get built. Unfortunately, Lituma's fear and loathing of the Andean villagers exactly reflects the attitudes of Vargas Llosa, a man who chooses to live in London and to pontificate about 'progress' for Peru. By all accounts, Vargas Llosa really does regard the indigenous peoples of the Andes as more an 'economic problem' than as a cultural treasure. The future Peru he envisions has no place for economically inefficient villagers. And so, the portrayal of Andean culture in this novel is unremittingly derogatory. Those \\"indios\\", we are told, have always been inhumane idolators; even their Inca and pre-Inca ancestors were blood-drenched sacrificers of human flesh. Vargas inserts another character in the novel, in a single chapter, to lecture the reader on the gory history of the Incas; that character is a hippyish Danish ethnologist (with an incongruously Swedish surname) staying with the engineers at a mine a day's journey from Naccos. Lituma visits the mine to write a report, meets the ethnologist, and catches a hint from him about the mystery of the three disappearances. It's a clumsy device, however. The Dane is almost a \\"deus ex machina\\". He's there only to build Vargas's case against the indigenous peoples.Does any of this justify my one-star rating of the novel? From a literary viewpoint, NO! That rating is my gut reaction to the writer's odious 'neoliberalism'. Vargas Llosa is a marvelous story-teller. I like him much better when he's funny, self-satirical rather than self-justifying."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"I went on vacation to Peru a few years ago. I visited the ruins, saw all the modern sights, and ate a ton of (super delicious) food. But I guess you could do any of those things on any number of vacations, right? What I think really made my vacation extra cool was having a much more well-rounded perspective of Peru, the people I met, and the somewhat odd history/relationship Latin America has had with leftist guerilla forces. These are all topics you'll encounter in the book, which go deeper than the articles you read in Lonely Planet Peru or things like that.In terms of the book on its own: it's a great book. The story-telling, word usage, and sense of foreboding that permeate the novel really draw you in. The usage of the supernatural (I use that term to describe our Western point of view) really pushes the novel forward, and allows you to look more closely at the characters and their internal truths. I know that some reviews tell you this is a mystery or whodunit-type book, and I'm not sure I would agree. Certainly there's a sense of unraveling the mystery about what it's going on, but there's so much more than that. To just say this is a mystery is really to short-sell the novel. There are also some who to criticize the novel for being too vulgar or crass -- arguments that do hold some water. But when you read the novel, fully understand what's going on, get a complete picture of the situation these people are in, then the word usage is appropriate. You wouldn't expect to watch a movie about the war in Afghanistan and not hear more than a few profanities, would you?Just so you know, I feel like a lot of Mario Vargas Llosa's writings are really one step ahead of me the whole way. Because there are so many elements to the novel, it doesn't feel super linear to me. It isn't just a protagonist versus an antagonist. This book feels more like Man v Nature, Self, Man, Technology... everything. I think with some other books, you can see where the novel is going... you can tell maybe this one character is not the best, or you can detect what the outcome might be. I don't feel that way about this book.If you're a fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, you'll like this book. If you're a fan of MVL's, you'll like this book. If you're a fan of books in general, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"This is a great book, and a good intro to Peruvian literature and culture. I found the subject very depressing- but in a 'think beyond what you see' kind of way. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Vargas Llosa is a great writer, with a fantastic routine, able to throw offenjoyable and moving stuff even when not in top form. So I cannot say I did notenjoy a lot in this book (even if it does not measure up to The Conversation in the Cathedral or theWar of the End of the World), but found some serious weaknesses. First, this isVargas Llosa's first literary creation after the failed presidential bid inPeru. This makes it is hard not to read as sour grapes: Peru did not elect me,well, it is an irrational, atavistic country anyway. Second, despite themystery story form, hardly any surprises are coming. From the very beginning,Lituma is pondering the same suspicion aboutthe three disappearances and the role ofthe diabolic innkeeper couple. Theend just brings more and more confirmation. The very simpleparallel love story of the young civil guard is saved from banality only by the human touch the writer can lend it."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"One of Llosa's easier reads and yet still satisfying. Having traveled to Peru last year, the novel resonated for me in its depiction of modern Peru. Even though much has changed since the 90s (when the book takes place) much has remained the same in the Andes in particular it seems."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"This book is a portrait of violence, of it's culturule roots and the circumstances that can bring it out of normal human beings. The story is located in the surreal atmosphere of the Peruen Andes. A Simple good hearted police man Litome (whom we've met in Aunt Hulia ) is investigatin a series of mysterious disappearences, and finds himself in a quest after the origins of human evil. His finding are horrific. This book is not easy to read, but it is a very good one and deeply recommended."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"In an effort to learn more about Peru before a trip, I bought this book: BAD IDEA. From the tourists who are taken off a bus by Shining Path guerrillas and stoned to death, to the descriptions of various human sacrifices to ward off the devil, this is not a travel book. Then again, it shouldn't be classified as one. With dialogue that is occasionally reminiscent of Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman, this is a surreal portrait of Peru - beautiful and yet horrifying."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"This is a good book. It is not quite as good as Who killed Palomino Molero? by the same author. This is the sequel and as often happens does not exactly live up to the original."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"This is a very unsettling book. The way it is written contributes to this. At times, conversations are layered into story telling so the reader is kept uncertain of who's speaking. This echoes the uncertainty of the times the people in the book are experiencing. The harsh conditions of the Andes, with its thin air, dried vegetation, freezing nights and burning sun serve as a backdrop for the gripping story of cruelty, death, politics and sorcery. Colonel Lituma is driven to find the fate of three people who have disappeared from the camp. He knows he probably doesn't really want to know what happened, but he has to investegate to satisfy his curiosity. I was completely under the spell of this book and will be looking to read more of this author."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Lituma and Tomasito are stationed at Naccos,representing the rule of law in an increasingly lawless Andes, as the new mountain highway is laid. The Senderistas control the region through murder fear and terror, backed up by their inane revolutionary rethoric and kangaroo 'peoples courts'. Three of the highway workers disappear. Have the Senderistas murdered them or have they joined them? As Lituma investigates he delves into another possibility, linked to Andean witchcraft, superstitions and spirit Gods....A complex tale extremely well told, although it does fall away towards the last third.Llosa links the ancient and modern Peru; a land built on blood and death either political or sacrificial.Interwoven are the story of Tomasito's lost love and the atrocities commited in the region.If you're new to Llosa, you may find his 'time lines' perplexing where events past and present are written seamlessly together, but this is easy to pick up on as Llosa's writing is so good.Llosa is extremely readable.When reading this book I was struck by the similarities with the present day Taliban conflict in Afghanistan; same scenery,same brutalities same victims the only difference being the Trojan horse used ('Peoples Republic' 'Islamic Republic' 'Fascism' 'Communism') in order for man to justify his psychopathic behaviours.A powerful book"},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Death in the Andes is not an easy read and will not qualify as your easy & interesting read. This is because there are just too many characters that get introduced into the plot all of a sudden.The interactions between corporal Lituma and his deputy Tomas with a backdrop of remote Andean mountains and villages is the probably the only interesting part of the book. Vargas is able to skillfully shuffle between the past and the present.This is a very small book, but I am struggling to finish it only because it seems to lack the allure that will keep me hooked late in the night."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Death in the Andes is a haunting book about the violent civil upheaval in Peru. I couldn't shake bad dreams about Pishtacos weeks after I read the book because of its' closeness to reality. Despite this, I recommend it. It reads like anthropology and history as it elucidates religious beliefs, politics, and viewpoints from different groups of people in Peru."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"I love the way Vargas Llosa interweaves several narratives into one cohesive work. I found Lituma's injection into Carreno's love story bothersome--his comments were arrogant and unneeded. Perhaps it added to his characterization, but it took away from the love story. The love story is predictable, but beautifully written. The rest of the book is unsettling and full of suspense. Overall a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Interesting enough to finish but I'm not sure if that would have been the case were I not going to Peru in November. I often augment my travels by reading a novel set in the country that I'm visiting and written by an author from that country. Research led me to Mario Vargas Llosa, apparently the preeminent Peruvian novelist, and his book \\"Death in the Andes\\". This particular title was available in the library so I thought I'd take a chance. The novel provides a good overview of the mountainous landscape and the various people who inhabited them. Although I didn't find this a particularly compelling read I stuck with it in hopes of learning something about the place and culture prior to my arrival. I learned that Peru is an ancient and varied culture that has been influenced by empires as old as the Quechua, the Inca the Spanish. I'll have to read a more current novel to garner any other insight as the plot of this murder mystery, couched in spiritual mysticism, infused with a love story, does not lend itself to attracting tourism (the fate of the tourist in the novel was not very encouraging ). I&iexcl;m four weeks away from my departure so I'll try another of Llosa's novels before I head out. If anyone has a better recommendation let me know."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"This is a stunning novel. It provides a great picture of the fear brought to the highlands by Shining Path, and it reveals a very foreign superstitious psyche that some cling to. It's a great read, though beware. It gets quite violent and vulgar.To get the most out of the book, read some background on Peru from a travel guide like the one from Lonely Planet. I read this novel five years ago and missed much of what I got this time as I read it along with various other texts in preparation for a trip to Peru."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Llosa moves the novel along in two ways; first through the core of the novel, the investigation of the missing men and through the interactions of the two investigators. The governmental instability constantly looms over the two, and somethimes it is easily forgotten. This all kept me intrigued, from the intensity of the rebels to the juxtapositions of the investigators. His characterizations and the interactions are incredible, and one can even see this book as a political allegory. There are, however, many incidents that Llosa's style is so vibid and I wished he wasn't as good a writer as he is. Due to my schedule I had to read the novel in pieces but if I can I would love to have read it in tighter sittings. I gave it a four because he mentions some points that didn't translate well, although his use of symbolism and deception is excellent. A very good read."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"seldom have i read such a stupid and pointless book! in addition it is crude and vulgar. save your money and time."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"i like writing books of south american writers, but this one is not very organized, story is some parts very strong but then weak in other parts.The author has tried to give a super natural taste to that , but i think he could abbreviate the book a lotany way what is the problem with sexuality in south america , seems that it is a big issue there."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Death in the Andes is a story of brutality and fear and ignorance. The language is often coarse and vulgar. The ending is especially disturbing. Were it not for the remarkable writing of Mario Vargas Llosa, I might have put this unsettling story aside. But Mario Vargas Llosa is a captivating story teller and I found myself wanting to know more and more about his characters that inhabit the harsh mountains of Peru.The reader encounters alternating viewpoints and layered conversations that intermingle the present and the past, forcing the reader to remain alert. Death in the Andes is structurally a mystery story in which two soldiers assigned to a barren outpost investigate the disappearance of three men. The brutal Shining Path terrorists (the Senderistas) are the natural suspect, but Corporal Lituma also mistrusts both the townspeople (largely traditional Indians) and the construction work crew building a highway across the mountains. Initially, he has little patience for talk of the pishtacos, vampire-like humans that sucked the blood and ate the melted the fat of their victims.There are stories within stories. Young French tourists are stoned to death, rather than shot, to save bullets, and to permit others to take part in the killing. In fascination we listen to a lonely young man describe his improbable love of a prostitute. We witness a village turning upon itself and selecting victims for the Senderistas. We meet an aged, repulsive woman who in her youth helped kill a pishtacos. We gain a nebulous understanding as to why Peruvians and foreigners involved in re-forestation programs and nature preserves become prime targets for assassination.I have already begun to read Death in the Andes again and I am searching for more writings by Mario Vargas Llosa. Although I found his portrait of contemporary Peru to be unsettling, disturbing, and haunting, Death in the Andes will appeal to the reader on many levels. It is a memorable lesson in history, in cultural conflict, and in man's inhumanity."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"Mario Vargas Llosa does an excellent job in capturing many of the dilemnas and controversies which face modern Peru in &quot;Death in the Andes&quot;. He does an masterful job in presenting the military, insurgents, (Sendero Luminoso), and also the native peasants and farmers of the country. The reader really feels the emotions and experiences of the characters in the story. The violence, brutality and pain of life of many in Peru comes across clearly in this tale. Vargas Llosa weaves the narratives of three characters and also experiments with shifting between different periods of time during the course of the novel. His writing style in this work is very straightforward and clear. The book reads quite quickly and easily. If one enjoys the work of Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez or a great story in general, they will enjoy &quot;Death in the Andes&quot;."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"In Death in the Andes, Vargas Llosa weaves a tale that is neither simple nor pat. He reveals truths about human nature: their complexities and frailities in stressful circumstances. People alone in the mountains; people who have lost hope turn to beliefs as old as those same hills and become something horrible. They turn on their neighbors and kill them at the behest of people all too willing to use them for their own ends. The terrucos, serruchos, apus, and pishtacos which liter his story surround the reader in a vast world one cannot explain away as being the rantings of mountain people. Vargas Llosa places the reader into this mysterious world, and it is not always a comfortable one. The Shining Path scenes in this book are, in themselves, enough to make one turn away. But it is worth the read, as simply a lever to pry open that world which I can never really know, even though I've pedaled a bike in the backcountry, and had people yell that I was a &quot;pishtaco&quot; or one who steals the flesh from another to sell, I am not of Peru. Vargas Llosa took me as far I could ever go."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"DEATH IN THE ANDES is a suspenseful and explosive story about the political and social landscape of Peru in the 1990's. Corporal Lituma and his deputy Tomas are assigned to a remote area of the Andes to oversee a road crew. When three men are reported missing, everyone becomes edgy. Lituma sets out to solve the mystery, but soon finds himself overrun with more questions than answers.Told in a mosaic of voices, from Lituma to two hapless French tourists to the proprietor of the local cantina, the real mystery is the Peruvian people and their survival in the harsh terrain of the Andes amid guerrillas, poverty, political uncertainty, and superstition. Llosa delivers this story with an unflinching honesty that will keep you turning pages, horrified and yet unable to turn away."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"The protagonists are two civil guards alone in a small mining town threatened by guerrillas, and the loss of work. The town is the home of a couple with a Dionysian bent, and an apparent belief in rituals over a 1000 years old. Plot lines include the disappearance of 3 people, the past infatuation of one of the guards, and the guerrilla movement. What the book is really about is the poverty and degradation of the people, and the apparent hopelessness. Vargas writes about this obliquely, so as not to overwhelm the reader, while getting the point across. While I liked the book, I didn't fully appreciate the Dinonysian aspect, I guess, which was a major drawback for me. Vargas uses an interesting technique of seamlessly switching between voice and time, and back, without confusing the reader."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"I read &quot;Death in the Andes&quot;(Lituma en los Andes) a novella written by the peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa, three years ago when it just came out in spanish. I don't remember the details very well of this story about how the peruvian terrorist group Sendero Luminoso(Shining Path) affects deeply the lives of a heterogeneous group of people:Tourists, white people, incas, rich people, poor people, even a witch. But the feeling that I had after reading it is still in me. That feeling of desolation, of terror,the coldness of the mountain, the humidity of the land, and above all, the eternal waiting for something horrible to happen. Like living with a Damocles sword over your head. As you might well know, in good literature, it isn't only the details that counts."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"It's a scary world out there, but it's worth knowing about it. Llosa painted it in new colours which I didn't even know existed. On ever page I waited to be killed, and by the middle I wasn't affriad of death. What a book!"},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"This is the first book I have read by the author in particular, and of Peru in General. While the book is full of amazing insights into Peruvian culture, I could not help seeing that the almost unlimited potential for violence described here is universal, and applies where ever human beings are assembled.The peasants of the Andes are in constant fear for their lives, either by starvation, in the hands of the rebels, the government or the evil spirits.Their ancient traditions, which kept their lives tolerable in past times, are disintigrated, leaving them drunk and desperate.Just like peasants and poor people almost everywhere, they are helpless and have no control what so ever about their destiny. From this condition, emerges violence that is at first shocking, and then, as the book progresses, looses some of its initial horror and becomes almost acceptable.This book is highly recommended, although it may be noted that people with weak stomachs may not be able to handle it."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"I just purchased this again since I always seem to give my copy to friends. But I don't mind that this is the 4th or 5th time that I've ended up buying it for someone else.Vargas Llosa is able to weave plotlines and timelines with such a light touch that at times you have to pay attention closely or you'll miss the transition. That he is able to combine so many interesting elements from a terrible crime story and the mystery unraveling before the inspectors and how that all ties to elements seemingly intrinsic to the nature of the region is quite a feat. That he combines so many seemingly irrelevant elements into an amazing tale of murder, investigation, poverty, politics, love, longing and loss while making the experience UNIQUELY Peruvian is a singular talent.In my humble opinion, this is Vargas Llosa's best work, which is saying something."},{"Title":"Death in the Andes","review":"As a work of fiction, I found this book to be incredibly enjoyable to read. I love the mixture of horror and comedy in the book. It shows two totally different aspects of human beings which is what life is really like.My one caveat about the book is that the author may lead one to believe that all the horrors in Peru were caused by the Shinning Path rebels. However, international groups estimate at least half of the deaths were caused by the government and other right wing paramilitary groups. This aspect of Peru's history is absent here."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"A great read for anyone who is fascinated by tales of King Arthur's round table, the pursuit of the Holy Grail or the defeat of honour and goodness told through Tennyson's lofty style. It sure beats the language and concerns of much of what passes for modern culture."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"I first read Idylls of the King some 50 years ago and immediately fell in love with the lyrical narrative. All these years, I have carried the image of Arthur's departure on the barge.

That still moves me."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Since all reviews of different editions are lumped together, this review is to tell what is in the edition whose Publisher is CreateSpace (June 11, 2012), 348 pages. This is a print on demand book - just the text of the Idylls of the King, and a generic cover. No additional information whatsoever. It's 10 inches by 8 inches, unnecessarily big - achieved by a lot of extra white space. The Table of Contents lists the \\"Dedication\\" and \\"The Coming of Arthur\\" as one entry titled \\"The Round Table\\". Otherwise it appears to be correct and readable. However, I think I will buy the Penguin edition instead and toss this one."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"The greatness of Tennyson's epic poems lie in the careful mix of life and legend. We are drawn in by stories of great heroism and power, with clashing steel and gallant oaths. But we also are forced to explore and consider very normal things about life; being worn down by constant nagging, suspicious spouses, temper tantrums, and tired old men. As a result, the \\"epic\\" is also easy to relate to, without losing the grandeur of its time and deeds.I cannot recommend this highly enough to people who want to know how chivalry may be recaptured in our world."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"This book is certainly a classic in all regards.

I did find this book interesting and very useful for my research into the Arthurian Legends but would not recommend it for casual reading."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"This \\"edition\\" does not even have the lines broken--at all. This is poetry, not prose, Amazon."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Beset by misogyny and Tennyson's unavoidable issues with the way he felt his society was headed for hell in a hand basket, IDYLLS OF THE KING still remains his most gorgeously affective work. Breathing life and passion into every stanza, Tennyson brought true emotionalism to this work of genius, and it is impossible to read it without being affected in some way, and coming away from it a changed person. It is perhaps helpful to be aware of the greater works in the Arthurian oeuvre (TRISTAN AND ISOLDE, MORTE D'ARTHUR, the works of Chretien de Troyes etc.) but such is certainly not imperative to a fulfilling Tennyson experience - his ideas and imagery ring loud and true in the beguiling landscape of his poetry.There are problems: Tennyson was staunchly misogynistic and apparently can't help but infuse his work with these ideals, and his fervent belief that a country without a strong moral center cannot stand is so strong expressed that almost every stanza seems to revolve around this point. Yet, whether one agrees with Tennyson or not, one cannot deny the great artistry and power of the poetry, and the way such ideas are expressed. The keening tone and wistfulness of expression is unavoidable in any reading, lending the work a sharp frisson of bittersweet beauty that is unmatched by anything else Tennyson ever wrote, or anything else in the canon of English literature.Absolutely gorgeous."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Let me make two points about the February 5, 2004 Penguin edition. First, while the text retains the line breaks, which is essential for poetry, and damning for the other (free) version I tried, the layout proved difficult to read on my iPod. You may want to look at the sample chapter before you buy it, just to see if you can endure this particular layout. Second, and more importantly, this edition lacks a table of contents completely. That is, not only does it not let you jump from section to section from a single location, it does not have the location to start with, and that is very poor. Combined, these make for heavy weather. The prospect of a long search, paging through hundreds of screens (or wildly sliding the location bar), hunting down passages gives me shudders, and makes me regret this purchase.But such was my experience. Perhaps you may find that this edition plays better on an actual Kindle, or on beefier device (an iPad, or a computer). In any event, be careful and good luck. Ciao."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"This is the story about Arthur and the tales of Camelot. Obviously. But for those of you who don't know more than what you've seen on TV or the movies, read this book. Read about Balin and Balan, read about Elaine, read about Guenivere. It's so much more fulfilling to search them out and to find them, than to have someone splash their character on a screen for you. My favorite stanza in the entire book is when Arthur talks about commitment. Commitment to his cause, to life, to God, to everything: &quot;Arthur sat Crown'd on the dais, and his warriors cried, 'Be thou the king, and we will work thy will Who love thee.' Then the King in low deep tones, And simple words of great authority, Bound them by so strait vows to his own self That when they rose, knighted from kneeling, some Were pale as at the passing of a ghost, Some flushe'd, and others dazed, as one who wakes Half--blinded at the coming of a light.&quot;Awesome isn't it?"},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"The General Books LLC edition is a terrible edition of Idylls of the King. I guess the first clue for me should have been the name on the cover - Alfred Tennyson Tennyson?? How about Alfred Lord Tennyson. Also, the price was ridiculous, especially considering this edition isn't even broken up by idylls and the idylls themselves aren't broken the way Tennyson intended. That's what I get for buying a book in a hurry and not taking the time to see what else was available. I've since bought a Penguin edition and it is MUCH better. It is in the format Tennyson intended and many of the archaic words Tennyson used are defined in the back of the book. The only positive things I can say about this edition is the binding seems to be good quality and the pages are made of good stock. But, worth $32?? Nope"},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Tennyson had a life-long interest in the Arthurian legend, and based many of his works on it. Idylls of the King is his longest and most ambitious work, and it is truly brilliant. Though I disagree with his retelling of the birth of Arthur, that is overshadowed by the rest. It doesn't rhyme, which is totally irrelevant. The language is easy enough, and dificult word-meanings are given at the back in the highly informative notes. 10 on 10, buy it!"},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Alfred Lord Tennyson impresses the reader with his unique talent of writing poetry. He writes a series of poems based on myths, legends, epics and so on to produce a work so skillfully written, one's eyes could be glued to the book in marvel at the fine imagery he creates to tell his story. Much of his poems are based upon King Arthur's period of time. His representaion of the era accentuates a period in time when he was named Poet Laruette. His skill and passion for writing captures the minds of those who seek love as well for those who strive for adventure. As this book has a wide selction of tales to tell, one of my all-time favorite poems for some reason is, Lady of Shallott. Tennyson's sharp use of words inspired many artists that turned is words of imagery into a painting. After reading this book, try browsing the web or search through art books to find what faomous paintings there are that were influenced by Tennyson. This book I would highly recommend to those who especially enjoy reading poetry, for Tennyson is one of the most well-known and most talented poets the world has yet to know."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Almost as if the tales were not a myth, this book speaks of King Arthur and all of his adventures in the greatest of detail. The format is rather poetical and if you don't know what anon means, I don't suggest you read it. But if you want to read about Knig Arthur in this most chivilrous language, you will not be disappointed. Just don't give up easy. It can be a hard read, but it is entertaining."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Tennyson uses beautiful and poignant verse to paint the Arthurian world. This was my first time actually reading the tales of King Arthur (although, I had heard some of them before), and I was enchanted.

It was the perfect introduction to authentic Arthurian tales and to this form of writing."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Here is an inexpensive way to acquire the 10,000 line free verse poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson that pretty much sums up the Arthur legends from beginning to end.

And why, oh why, do you say that this great work is by \\"Alfred Tennyson?\\" I think you forgot the Lord.Alfred, Lord Tennyson is the greatest and a genius of the English language."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"If Malory's &quot;Le Morte D'Arthur&quot; is the backbone of Arthurian literature, Tennyson's &quot;Idylls&quot; are its flesh and blood. In this extraordinary epic poem, Tennyson has transformed Malory's automatons to living and breathing characters, and infuses the legend of King Arthur with passionate intensity that had hitherto been absent. In addition to this, for the first time King Arthur's story, told in its immensity, becomes something more than a dry cataloguing of events or an excuse to have knights and derring-do: underlying &quot;Idylls of the King&quot; is a vision of tragedy and destiny only vaguely hinted at in Malory.Admittedly, this is not the easiest thing in the world to read, but simply reading major parts is worth it, without necessarily following the story of Tristram or other such details. Most interesting in this poem is the relationship between Guinevere and Lancelot, which is complicated and sometimes dark. Tennyson's characters are complex beings, complete with inner shadows and desires which sometimes conflict with the ideals put forth by Arthur's &quot;Table Round.&quot;Since it is after all Tennyson, the language is breathtaking, though one familiar with his other poetry might be slightly regretful, as I was, that it occasionally lacks the power of his other poems. Perhaps this is to be expected, given the length: and since it is Tennyson, less powerful than his other work is still marvelous.Some may be irritated by Tennyson's moralistic streak, which is hard to ignore, as well as the distinct parallels with Christianity which the poet introduces from time to time. The idea that women somehow embody all sin certainly makes an appearance here, as Guinevere is sometimes portrayed almost as evil incarnate.Nonetheless, with its almost mystical undertones, beautiful language and psychological complexity, &quot;Idylls of the King&quot; is worth checking out, whether you are a fan of King Arthur or Tennyson; it is an epic which combines emotion and the magical, life and the legendary."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Based primarily on Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur,\\" Tennyson's \\"Idylls of the King\\" is an epic poem comprising twelve loosely connected episodes narrating the adventures and romances of the knights of Camelot. Even in the Victorian era King Arthur had a secure place in the popular imagination, so Tennyson's poem, published in sections over roughly a fifteen-year period, was warmly received. Because it is bookended by dedications to Prince Albert and Queen Victoria, whom Tennyson perhaps viewed as quasi-Arthurian figures just as Virgil exalted Augustus Caesar, it carries the authority of an accepted British cultural document.Tennyson recasts the individual stories of the knights in his own poetic vision, and in some instances invents his own anecdotes or contributes his own details, merging chivalric imagery with post-Romantic lyrical beauty. As an Arthurian medium, Tennyson's verse is much more readable than Malory's cumbersome prose (a forgivable style owing to Malory's time, but difficult to appreciate nowadays unless you have a taste for the archaic). As irresistibly dazzling as a hyperbole like \\"The wood is nigh as full of thieves as leaves\\" is, there is much more to the \\"Idylls\\" than linguistic elegance.Arthur is nearly a Christ-figure, and his knights are not unlike the apostles: \\"[F]ollow the Christ, the King,/Live pure, speak true, right wrong, follow the King--/Else, wherefore born?\\" the idealistic Gareth rhetorically asks his mother just before journeying to Camelot to fulfill his dream of joining the Round Table. Knighthood is a mission in life, a devotion to the service of God and the king (or King, to use the Christian allegory). In the Arthurian milieu, knights represent the highest, most virtuous ideal of mankind, though in practice they occasionally fail, falter, and face moral dilemmas that help to build character. Such conflicts also compel the poem, for an infallible knight hardly makes for interesting reading.To be sent on a quest is not a chore but an honor of which a knight must be deemed worthy by Arthur. Prove yourself inept, and he won't even send you to the McDonald's drive-thru to pick him up a Big Mac. Whether rescuing a lady from a castle guarded by evil knights (Gareth), delivering a diamond as a prize to the winner of a joust (Gawain), searching for the Holy Grail (Galahad), or even properly disposing of the sword Excalibur upon Arthur's death (Bedivere), a knight is expected to obey and succeed.The vicissitudes of love often pose ethical challenges for the knights and provide the most memorable scenes of the poem, as adultery, jealousy, and betrayal set the stage for turbulent drama. The illicit affair of Lancelot and Guinevere, Arthur's wife, the tragic story of Elaine, the peasant girl who pledges her love to Lancelot, the punishment meted out to Tristram by his uncle Mark for the seduction of Isolt, and Pelleas's amorous pursuit of the hellion Ettarre, are the essence of legend.The tale that somehow haunts me the most is that of Merlin and Vivien, which ominously takes place in a forest just before a storm. The petulant Vivien disparages Arthur's knights and tries to coax a love spell out of the ancient but apparently still libidinous wizard; having achieved her objective as the storm breaks, she runs away from the beguiled and sleeping magician as the uttered word \\"fool\\" echoes through the trees--a very poetic representation of lust subduing and fleeing wisdom."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"This lengthy poem about King Arthur's court is written in grand epic style, in the spirit of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and Paradise Lost, and drawing on these and other great epics. Tennyson follows many of the traditional epic conventions here--the epic similes, the epic quests, etc. But this work is not wholly an epic, it is rather more of a Romance. The book is divided into various sections, each dealing with a knight (or knights) of King Arthur's court. The adventures they encounter are various and only remotely connected, but there is a back story to each. Something is going on behind the scenes. The first part of the book deals with the rise of Arthur, and of the glory of his kingdom. The second part focuses on the gradual decline of his influence, and culminates with the King's discovery of Lancelot and Guinevere's affair.This is one of my favorite Arthurian romances. Tennyson's verse is beautiful and vivid, and his story is both compelling and easy to follow. No study of English Romanticism would be complete without Tennyson, and this is one of his finest works."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"The eloquence of several previous reviewers is proof enough of this volume's poetic power. And while I agree with the hesitation of many over the staunch Victorian morality which infuses the poetry, I find myself admiring it all the same, without necessarily agreeing with it. Here is a man's deeply felt vision, a statement of his times, drawing upon the lush sweep of the English Romantics & tempered by the frowning propriety of his own world. It's a complex & delicate balance, which should collapse of its own paradoxical weight ... and yet, the fusion works superbly, resulting in some of the most stirring & beautiful narrative poetry ever written. Tennyson's lyric gift is rich, evocative & fluent. In addition, he brings remarkable psychological nuance & insight to his work. In many ways, it's a summation of his age, a farewell to an older world whose values are worth remembering & preserving, as a darker age dawns. And in the end, above all else, it's tremendously readable! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"For Tennyson, the Arthurian legend was an evolving love affair that lasted throughout the poet's life, and the \\"Idylls of the King\\" is the ultimate offspring of that enchanted love. Composed of a dozen individual yet interlinked story-poems, the Idylls span the whole of Malory's opus from Arthur's glorious rise to power to his fog-shrouded and mysterious death, \\"lest one good custom should corrupt the world.\\" But Tennyson humanizes Malory's stories and infuses the whole with an almost Shakespearean aura of tragedy, redefining many of the legendary tales with a new level of gravitas unmatched before or since. The Idylls include:* The Coming of Arthur, introducing the Age of Camelot* Gareth and Lynette, a variation of the popular \\"Fair Unknown\\" theme and one of Arhturiana's most beloved stories as well as perhaps the one which most perfectly embodies the golden values of chivalry* The Marriage of Geraint, taken from the works of Chretien De Troyes, who called the titular knight \\"Erec\\"* Geraint and Enid, a lovely tale of marital trust* Balin and Balan, one of the grimmest and bloodiest of all Arthurian tales, about the struggle between decency and monstrousness within us all* Merlin and Vivien, the sorcerer's swan song, and the most believable portrayal of the amoral Vivien, too often given a pass by other writers, which I've seen* Lancelot and Elaine, a tale better known as \\"The Lady of Shalott,\\"in which Tennyson's love for the magnificent yet benighted Lancelot of the Lake shines through* The Holy Grail, narrated by Sir Percivale, and the most powerful depiction of the Grail Quest there is* Pelleas and Ettarre, one of my favorite Arthurian tales from Malory and elsewhere, though Tennyson's retelling is a major downer that foreshadows the coming collapse of King Arthur's utopia, and features a Sir Pelleas both nobler and darker than Malory's abused but redeemed knight* The Last Tournament, a bleak but serendipitious version of the Tristram (Tristan) saga, and which brings the Pelleas story to an ugly close* Guinevere, focuses on the discovery of her adultery with Lancelot and the ensuing breakup of Camelot, culminating in a heartrending dialogue between King Arthur and his fallen Queen* The Passing of Arthur, the climactic book of the whole saga, in which King Arthur confronts the traitor Modred, strikes with mighty Excalibur one last time, and Sir Bedivere delivers the King's sword up to the Lady of the LakeTaken as a whole, the Idylls are perhaps the greatest artistic achievement in all of Arthurian literature. They are not the whole story however, and in fact Tennyson seems to assume his reader is already intimately familiar with Malory's book, so I would recommend newcomers to the legend do their homework first. The Idylls do have a strong, pervasive Christian backbone, much to Tennyson's credit, which automatically puts his work on a far higher moral plane than Bradley's \\"Mists of Avalon\\" and some other contemporary versions of the story. Moreover, Tennyson does not shy away from the full weight of Guinevere's sin; what she does to both Arthur and Lancelot--and hence to all of Camelot--is awful. But charges of misogyny are unfounded; both the poet and Arthur himself--as illustrated in the King's moving last words to his estranged wife in the nunnery to which she has fled--hold out hope for the Queen's salvation, and therefore unavoidably so does the reader. Ultimately, Tennyson's vision of glorious quests, thundering tournaments, Christian valor, doomed love and a hard destiny is perhaps the most heartfelt and stirring of all Arthurian literature, and certainly the perfect companion piece to Malory's own immortal magnum opus. Beautiful, timeless, and endlessly inspiring, the Idylls will entertain and enlighten us for generations to come."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"&quot;Idylls of the King&quot; provides an outline of the story of Malory's &quot;La Morte Darthur&quot; in a brief, verse style that may actually make the book a good primer on Arthurian tales. Though he helps himself generously from Malory's text, Tennyson adds plenty of his own unique lines and seems to place a greater emphasis on the themes of loyalty and betrayal than Malory. It is by no means simply Malory in verse, as there are many alterations made to highlight certain values more than Malory. The two tales of &quot;Geraint&quot; come from the Mabinogion. The end-notes are a bit confusing and unwieldy but serve to preserve the flow of Tennyson's poetry. It's a wonderful introduction to traditional Arthurian legend."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Tennyson's poetic version of Arthurian legend is inspiring and beautifully cadenced. If you are unfamiliar with the foundational tales of the Round Table this may not be the version to start out with...particularly if you also don't read poetry very often. If, however, you are familiar with Arthur, Guinevere, Galahad, and the rest of the Table, Tennyson's interpretation of the tales as a cautionary illustration of the impossible futility of human ideals juxtaposed with human frailty is moving. Feminists may find the focus on Guinevere's culpability in the destruction of the ideal difficult to stomach, but when viewed as a tale of its time (ie. 19th century) the contrasts between the Victorian Camulodian ideal and the 20th and 21st century interpretations of the legend are intriguing."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Although this is one of the best piece of Arthurian literature available to us today, it is certainly not for the casual fan more familiar with &quot;Once and Future King&quot; and the like. The poetry format is somewhat difficult to read, and requires a fair amount of patience to get through the entire book.Honestly, if not for a class I was reading it for, I probably would not have been able to finish it. I would recommend it, but only to the more sophisticated and well-read fans of King Arthur."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"Idylls of the king is a harder read but the expirience is well worth it. Tennyson's language creates a vivid image in the mind of the reader. I would not expect someone without knowledge of King Arthur to like this book. But doing some background info is worth it just to read Tennyson's masterpiece. The mood set by Tennyson is quite captivating. As opposed th Lancelot and Guinevere's affair being in secret, Tennyson sets it up as a point of tension between knights. The story shows many qualities associated with chivalry but also shows what things a knight can do to disgrace himself (ex. Balin) If you do not think you want to read this whole book at least read the Idyll of Guinevere. The true character of Arthur is displayed as he forgives Guinevere before going off to die. Also this Idyll gives a new prospective to the relationship of Lancelot and the queen. Once again, it is a great book but do not jump right into it unprepared."},{"Title":"Idylls of the King","review":"this is the one book I would bring with me. Tennyson's poetry is simple enough to be understood, but challenging enough to stretch your mind. I take a copy with me to conventions and read it when the lectures get boring.There are ten &quot;idylls,&quot; or chapter-length poems. The meter is regular but there is no rhyme. The language is old-fashioned, but modern enough to read with only a rare glance at a dictionary. Each idyll focuses on a major event: the seduction of Merlin by Vivien, the death of Elaine the lily maid, Arthur's discovery of Guenivere's betrayal, and so forth. There is enough action in each idyll to keep the story moving.Tennyson's characters show both a nobility I wish I had and a human frailty I understand. The idyll on Guenivere is my favorite. Tennyson conveys the tragedy of a marriage broken by adultery so movingly that I feel as though I were there, and yet he leaves the reader with a profound sense of hope. When I read it, I feel stronger and wiser, ready to fight a dragon or enemy knight, or find a true and lasting love."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I can only limit my reveiw because I do not want to give away anything.

Jacen seems to have changed every perspective of his views, but we can chalk that up to his \\"learning\\" by Vergere's hands. Danni seems to be abl to do and know every from one side of science to another. also, she shot Jacen down about 4 years ago, and now likes him, after he's away and tortured. i didn't like them together in destiny's way, cause i love tenel ka, but she's growing on me. including saba was a great idea, we haven't heard anything from her in a while. the one thing the new jedi order has disappointed me in is wedge, kyp, gavin, and corran. they need to be included more. Some books they are center figures, then they aren't mentioned. In destiny's way, the major character of ackbar is brought back, and then he isn't mentioned. that's not cool. new characters are introduced, but not enough time is spent on each. i find i don't want to learn new characters as much because NJO kills them off so quickly. ganner had grown and become a favorite, but then they kill him off in traitor. however, this new imperial female captain seems interesting. the book back cover is misleading, as the living planet is never mentioned. i really enjoyed seeing the remnant metioned again. Admiral pelleaon has always been a favorite, and this is a time his character is finally done justice. the empire will really strengthen and unite the newly formed galactic alliance. that's one of the small problems i have with the book, this new galatic alliance thing. in destiny's way, omas says he's thinking about changing the name, maybe. by this book, its all with the changed. not cool, blindsiding the reader.

There were moments in the preceding fourteen novels where my enthusiasm for the New Jedi Order flagged, but here a deep sense of fatigue started to set in. I don't know why Force Heretic is the only part of this overall story deemed worthy of getting a full trilogy, when authors such as Greg Keyes, Aaron Allston, and Michael Stackpole were limited to duologies. Additionally, this book is on the long side for a Star Wars book, clocking in at a little over 400 pages, and to pile insult onto injury, the authors decided to ignore the convention of having chapter breaks in their story and instead made it a huge wall of text divided into four parts. This really got under my skin as the pace slowed and every scene seemed to get the same amount of attention: no ramping up for the exciting parts or slowing down for characterization.On the positive side, Mr. Williams and Mr. Dix show a deep knowledge of prior stories from the Expanded Universe and are able to weave many older elements into the New Jedi Order timeframe. For instance, the Yevetha from the Black Fleet Crisis make a reappearance in the context of the Vong invasion and provide an interesting insight into how the Vong would collide with cultures already opposed to the New Republic (essentially, as they collide with any other). The Imperial Remnant, led by Admiral Pellaeon, plays a key role as the Skywalkers open new negotiations. A mixture of smaller elements are woven in as well: kudos for this, as it adds consistency to the universe.The story has three major plotlines: a group led by Luke visits the Imperial Remnant, another group led by the Solos heads out to restore communications across the galaxy and pay diplomatic visits, and Nom Anor finds a new role as an outcast on the Vong capital world (terraformed Coruscant). Luke is driven to find Zonama Sekot, the sentient planet he learned of in Destiny's Way which may be key to solving the Vong's absence in the Force and making peace in the galaxy. Zonama Sekot is an intriguing, left-field plot device that is introduced to give the New Republic a solution to the war they are apparently still losing, despite the major victory at Ebaq 9 in the last story. The problem with Zonama Sekot in this story is painfully little changes: Luke's quest will have to await the next books. They do have a well-written engagement with the Imperial Remnant and watching Pellaeon corral the reticent Moffs into line is entertaining.The Solo storyline barely registered on me: there's some diplomacy, some action, we find out what happened to the Yevetha, but there's just not much there. Tahiri accompanies them and is warring with her dual nature after her torture at the hands of the Vong many books earlier. It strikes me oddly that this problem took a year or two of in-universe time to surface, but perhaps the residual effects of the Myrkr mission in Star by Star have fostered it. Anyway, a few moments of interest there helps a bit. The third storyline is better, with Nom Anor crafting himself a new identity in the underworld, although it also does not advance terribly far in Remnant.I'm baffled why Force Heretic required three books. I can understand padding it out from Del Rey's point-of-view but why pick this particular story of the many under the New Jedi Order umbrella? With judicious editing and better pacing, there are some serviceable ideas here, and I do appreciate the authors' embrace of prior Star Wars stories, but beyond that this really bogs down the end of the New Jedi Order and makes getting to The Unifying Force feel a long way away."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"Two letters describe this book. P UThis book stunk.So many of the other Star Wars Expanded Universe books have been so good - but this is another in a long string of stinkers. Hardly any character development, not much in the way of story line - I have a hard time seeing how this ever got printed. Only one badly wriiten battle scene, and in trying to cover every character in the universe, this managed to do very little to build on the history or lore of any.I already have the rest of the New Jedi Order series, so I will finish them up, so I wont be surprised by who dies, or hooks up with whoever, etc... But I cant wait to get through these, and hopefully on to better writing, better stories, and NO MORE FREAKING VONG. These are the worst bad guys in the history of the franchise.I almost get the feeling, someone read the Yevethan stories and thought, \\"What a great idea, why not drag out 10 or 15 or 20 of these, instead of the 2 or 3 that might have been interesting!\\"I guess at least (in this series, not this book) they havent been afraid to kill some main characters, including one of the best loved aliens of all time, Chewbacca. Chewy had a long run, starting much further back than we would have guessed, and I guess his time had come. I look ahead to Refugee and Reunion without much hope of anything, except continuing to draw breath long enough for them to be over, and the dim hope the last 2 book in the NJO are better than the almost 2 dozen preceeding loads of steaming bovine fecal matter."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I was surprised this book got so many bad reviews. I for one like the direction Dix and Williams are taking the New Jedi Order series. Their entry is a trilogy about the search for Zonama Sekot, the living planet. This first book follows the team as they enter Imperial space and fight off the Vong. Also, Han, Leia, and Jania go scouting the New Republic for systems that lost contact with the main government. Both are slower plot lines and allow the story to really develop. However, my favorite part of the book is all the attention paid to Nom Anor. His story of meeting the Shamed Ones and the Jedi heresy is the third major plot line of the book and really reveals more about his character. Of course, we see Nom Anor scheming to get back into power, but also some glimmers of other feelings. Overall, I'm glad the series is getting away from the major battles of the Vong war and allowing the characters to take these side quests."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"This is a great first book to the Force Heretic trilogy.

Every book of major importance would be followed by a book of equal unimportance.Star by Star (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 9)was followed byDark Journey (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 10), and nowDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14)is followed by Remnant, the first book in Sean Williams and Shane Dix's Force Heretic trilogy (and 15th book overall in the NJO series).After winning a resounding victory against the Yuuzhan Vong and finally putting the invaders on the defensive, the heroes of that conflict are sent to...check on some communications outages. Seriously, this is the best they could do with characters like Han, Leia, and Jaina Solo? At least Luke, Mara, and Jacen have a somewhat more important task - heading to the Unknown Regions to locate the living planet of Zonama Sekot (ofRogue Planet (Star Wars)fame), which may hold the key to defeating the Yuuzhan Vong forever.The Solo storyline seems totally unimportant, other than to establish a conflict with Tahiri, who had previously undergone physical and psychological torture at the hands of the Vong shapers. I always thought the consequences of that action were underdeveloped, and it looks like Williams and Dix are correcting that oversight. The Skywalker storyline is slightly more important in that it finally draws the Imperial Remnant into the fight against the Vong. There is also a sub-plot involving Nom Anor's fall from grace on the planet formerly known as Coruscant.Perhaps the Force Heretic series just takes some warming up, but I wasn't terribly impressed with Remnant. Aside from a few skirmishes with Yuuzhan Vong forces, the greater conflict is largely neglected in favor of these two smaller quests. Hopefully the series will get back on track soon.PS - And whatever happened to the so-called Rebellion from the Enemy Lines series anyway? Are we supposed to forget about that?"},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The suspense is evident in several instances through the first stage of this mission and a familar enemy along with a stange alien will make their presence felt.On the other side of the (not the MLS champion L.A.) Galaxy, Luke is leading another expedition to the Unknown Regions with a stop at the Imperial Remnant. Surprise, surprise, they too will meet with a familar enemy. Political intrigue and a very Latin Americanesque approach by the Grand Admiral typify the reaction of the Empire to the unwanted visitors.Along the way, we see the continued struggles of Tahiri as well as the development of the young Jedi. There is some repetition of information worked into the story in the form of informing new protoganists of what is happening. However, if you haven't read previous books, you will really miss out on much of the storyline."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"The last trilogy of the New Jedi Order, Force Heretic I: Remnant is book 15 in the series. With their first strong victory over the Yuuzhan Vong in the near past, the New Republic changes its color and mission to become the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, or simply the Galactic Alliance.In this novel, I especially enjoyed the romances between Danni and Jacen -he needs something to bind him to the universe except philosophy- as well as the romance between Jagged Fel and Jaina, who needs positive reinforcement to keep her from the Dark Side of the Force. On the other hand, Tahiri has an intriguing storyline as she fights the mental brainwashing the Yuuzhan Vong implemented before Anakin Solo's death and the other personality that keeps creeping into her consciousness. The story should become pretty interesting trying to tie up these loose ends by the end of the trilogy.This book is about average for the New Jedi Order Series but the storyline has a few slow places. Though a rough start for the Williams/Dix team, I am confident the pacing will pick up in the second novel.Want more reviews, visit:http://www.oddworldz.com/thehallow"},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"whoever originally came up with the ideal for this series was brilliant. 15 books later and fans like me still are clamoring for more. unfortunately, the original excitement is slowing down. this book has luke, mara and jacen looking for the only known living planet that may have repelled the yuuhzan vong years ago. instead they run into the yuuhzan fighting their own enemy the empire. choices, choices.meanwhile, han, leia and jania are off on a diplomatic mission to several worlds to find out why all communications have been lost. they go wandering is there a planet left? have the yuuhzan struck again? this book is building up to a climatic ending and i see that it has two more parts so i hope the story eventually picks up a little more steam that it has so far. but for all star wars fans it has enough interest to read it. just not enough to break your neck to go and buy it."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"'The New Jedi Order' series has begun to shift gears. The Galactic Alliance, formerly the New Republic, has managed to halt the advance of the Vong for the moment. Now they need to figure out how to decisively defeat the enemy and reclaim the conquered areas of the galaxy.To that end, Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade-Skywalker, Jacen Solo, and other Jedi head to the unknown regions to find the mythical planet Zonama Sekot. Fans of Star Wars novels will recognized this from 'Rogue Planet,' the prequel novel by Greg Bear. At first, I thought this was a bad move. Personally, I thought 'Rogue Planet' was the worst of the prequel novels, so I hated the thought of this direction for the series.Fortunately, this novel of the 'Force Heretic Trilogy' never gets there. Luke and company stop in the Imperial Remnant, looking for guidance into the Unknown Regions of space. Upon their arrival, they discover a Vong fleet attacking the Imperial homeworld of Bastion. Luke and his companions are drawn into the conflict with the ultimate hope of brining the Empire into their struggle with the Vong.Meanwhile, Han Solo and Princess Leia set off on their own mission. Their goal is to re-establish contact with worlds that have not been heard from since the invasion began. They bring along their daughter, Jaina, and the Chiss Squadron under the command of Jag Fel. This storyline is full of intrigue and their first stop brings instant trouble and mystery.This is a decent beginning to the series. I still do not like the idea of bringing Zonama Sekot back into the Star Wars universe, but I trust Williams and Dix will do it well. Anyone who has read 'Rogue Planet' knows that Sekot repelled a Vong invasion from the Prequel era, which explains the Galactic Alliance's interest. The end of 'Remnant' foreshadows the direction of the rest of the trilogy, and it looks promising.It was good to see Grand Admiral Palleaon in action again. It was also nice to see storm troopers and tie fighters again in a Star Wars novel. The novel dragged a bit in places, but otherwise was an entertaining read. For those new to the series, this novel does a good job of summing up how the characters have gotten to this point of the series. However, I still recommend reading the entire 'New Jedi Order' series from the beginning. I'm looking forward to reading the second and third novels of the series."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I liked this book for the most part, but there are things that could have made it better. I would have liked alot more scenes with Jaina and Jag. Danni and Jacen get on my nerves. What about Tenal Ka? In previous books, didn't she have feelings for Jacen? Why isn't she brought into the picture? I also don't really like the way that Tahiri is having the psychological problems. She's proved herself strong in the other books, why have her break down now? Truthfully, I wish Aron Allston was writing this trilogy. He's been, by far, my favorite Star Wars novelist. Especially the Wraith Squadron series."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"This was the first of the NJO series that I just couldn't finish. I kept putting the book down. The authors couldn't keep my attention. I guess I'll have to force myself to re-read it, if I'm going to endure their next books. Maybe this would have been better if only one author had worked on it, rather than the tag team of Williams and Dix.I noticed there were some parts that I really enjoyed, like the story about the slave transport in the prologue, and the Imperial Remnant. There were other parts, like the story about Nom Anor and the Shamed that weren't very interesting, nor were they plausible. I just wish they were able to write the rest of the book with as much passion as they put into the prologue. Maybe this reflects the strength or weakness of the authors? Perhaps they each wrote different parts of the book, rather than collaborating on the entire novel?I bought the book based on the teaser about Luke and Mara searching for Zonama Sekot. I wish I had opened to the last page to read that, even at the end of the book, Luke has not found the \\"force\\" planet. You get to read the next one or two or ten books to find out what happens.Argh! I've followed the NJO series from the beginning. I don't mind waiting, but this is a new low. If you're going to tease us like this, at least let him find the planet, even if it takes another book to flesh out the story. I realize that maybe this isn't the author's fault. Perhaps I should get mad at the editor or publisher. Still, after 400 pages you expect that some part of the teaser will be resolved!!I can understand stretching out the Vong story for 10 or 15 books, although my patience is starting to wear thin. However, trying to write 2-3 books about the subplot of Luke and the force planet, or Nom Anor and the Shamed Ones just won't work. There just isn't enough there to keep you entertained.If the original trilogy had been done like this, \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" would have been written as a series of 10 books... the back cover would have a teaser about the destruction of the Death Star, and the last page would end with \\"Luke Skywalker turned off his targetting computer and trusted in the Force. Would he be able to destroy the Death Star? Whatever it took, he was going to do it. THE END\\""},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"While I love the Star Wars series of novels, this latest is really lacking in comparison with the earlier releases. (To be honest, in my opinion, none have matched the level set by Stackpole in the beginning of the NJO.) For most of the book, the characters are wooden, as the authors relate large amounts of the previous installments to explain the current emotional states of the characters and the political status of the galaxy. Almost nothing new happens in the first half, and if you've read the earlier books, it reads like a re-run.There are two separate missions that are followed, plus the exploits of the persistent Nom Anor. The first of these (arbitrarily chosen) has Luke, Mara, Jacen, and some others trying to find a lead on the location of Zonama Sekot (the world from Rogue Planet). To do this, they journey to the Imperial Remnant to ask for information. Of course, they get embroiled in combat, as the Empire finally decides to fight the Yuuzhan Vong. That is really the only development in this entire novel, and the only part that kept me interested.The second mission has Han, Leia, Jaina, Tahiri, and Jag, plus some not-so-noteworthies, investigating the breaks in communication to old members of the New Republic. In this, we see an end to the Yevetha (from a pre-NJO terrible set of books) and some really boring scenes of the small force wiping out a minor group of Yuuzhan Vong. We get a lot of focus on Tahiri, as Jag is suspicious of her, and she is apparently dealing with the resurfacing after-effects of the Yuuzhan Vong attempt to shape her MANY novels ago. There is an attempt to breed mystery and suspense, but it flops badly (again, Stackpole leads the way in such intrigue and action).In the third thread, Nom Anor on Yuuzhantar (Coruscant) links up with a group of shamed ones and hides from the real members of their society. Again, there is little accomplished in this vein of the story, though it seems that perhaps Nom Anor is the Force Heretic of the title, and not NECESSARILY Tahiri Veila, though it could be both.So, as I mentioned earlier, there is little to no development of any of the characters. There are no new characters introduced who are worth any mention. I did like the confrontation of Pellaeon with the Moff Council near the end, but other than that this novel is really below par for the series. Succeeding the good inroads made two novels ago, with Traitor, after a repetitious series of similar stories, we are given THIS. Also, the setup of this book has no chapter divisions, simply break lines where the story line switches. Not really unacceptable, but certainly noticeable. Also, it seems that during the writing, the authors would hook onto a juicy long word, and use it three or more times in a few pages, then never use it again. If you read it, you'll see what I mean. Overall very poor writing. And considering that this is among the longest of the series (400+), I had hoped for good things to happen, not to get a lot of fluff."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"It's far more interesting to read a book by a guy who knows how to capture your interest and create a great story (that makes you want to stay up reading it rather than get some much-needed sleep), than it is to read hundreds of minute detail-references to previous Star Wars novels to prove that the author has been following along with the franchise.These guys know their Star Wars Expanded Universe extremely well, and it shows that they have done their research. The dialogue for Han Solo especially is often very good.BUT... that's the extent of the positive aspects of this book - and the whole &quot;Force Heretic&quot; trilogy.The problem is that these guys seem to be trying to stretch this story into as many pages - and books - as humanly possible!The whole &quot;Force Heretic&quot; trilogy could have easily been one book. And it would have made for a far more engaging story!What I hated most about it was that they repeat certain phrases all the time! Phrases like, &quot;You have to admire their...&quot; were used on nearly every single character in the book! How realistic is that? And there are at least two or three other phrases that are abused in the same way.But the worst problem with this book is that I didn't care at all for the characters. I was so caught up in the bad writing that I didn't care at all about Tahiri's torment with her alter-ego, not did I care even slightly about Luke and the gang's mission to find Zonama Sekot. In fact, I found the whole &quot;living planet&quot; scenario to be more like a bad episode of Star Trek than a major story-line in a Star Wars novel. It just didn't seem very &quot;George Lucas&quot; to me. Sure, you have that kind of thing in Marvel comics, and in other Sci-Fi material, but Star Wars is supposed to be &quot;Fantasy&quot; not &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; in my opinion.Anyways, suffice it to say that this entire trilogy by Sean Williams &amp; Shane Dix is complete rubbish and brings the entire &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series to an all-time low!The only book from the series that I would compare with these (in terms of being able to skip it entirely without missing anything at all) would be &quot;Dark Journey&quot; about Jaina's near fall to the dark side.If you haven't read the trilogy yet, do yourself a favor and skip it. There are plenty of reviews that summarize it well enough for you to get the jist without having to suffer through the poor writing style of these clowns."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I was waiting for the book. The aftermath of the downfall of Tsvong Lah and how the enemy would regroup. Nothing. I plot and undetstanding what their goals are is unclear. Why are Mara and Luke stikcking around in a fight witha slaveship when they could be off in the unknow regions for the last month?? Poor Ben will never get to see his scatterbrained parents that way...I would like to see Jaina and Jag develop or die away and I wish someone would come along for Kyp, just like they did for Lando. It is definately a one step forward two step back novel..I would have been really mad if I had had to pay for hardcover on this."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"It is important to remember that when reading Remnant, you are reading book 1 of a trilogy as well as book 15 of a series. There have been complaints about the wrapping up of surprises in the book, but take in mind that this is all groundwork for the rest of the respective journey for our characters. Jacen, Luke and Co's journey to the Unknown would not work without the framework given here, and Im sure Saba will be integral to that part of the storyline. I was worried where they were taking her character as she has been a consistant point in the series. Jacen has developed into a well rounded character, taking in the lessons from Vergere, but also from those around him. Palleon makes the point with his observations of Jacen. The return of the Grand Admiral is one of the strongest points of the book, esp when one takes into account his character arc throughout the EU.The story line regarding Han, Leia, Jaina and Jag, and Tahiri is also important groundwork. The authors, while far from the best the Expanded Universe has used, bring in a mix of past worlds and challanges. The description of Han's feelings of returning to the Yevetha is well played, as is Jaina's desire to stay on the front lines. Jag is slighty off character, but as his relationship with Jaina progresses, it would make sense. Even the strongest of male leads turns out of habit when women are int he picture in a romantic sense. Tahiri's story should show good results by book 3. But bear in mind, it may take that long to develop the arc.As for the Nom Anor story line, this is a must. The quote at the beginning of the book shows how important this is to the overall NJO picture, and this is bound to play a major part in the internal strength and in its exploitation of the Vong.Overall, while not the best book in the NJO, Remnant is a good introduction to set the stage for the final act of an interesting series. Character development over a 19 book series is difficult at best, but the NJO has expanded on some wonderful characters, as well as introduced many new ones. Bringing back enemies of old, and not just the Empire, has connected the NJO to the rest of the pre-Vong Star Wars universe, and showed a truly Galactic struggle. A good read, and a must read for the rest for the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"The difference between reading this book and gouging out my eyes is slimThe Galactic Alliance is still in the nascent stages. Cal Omas sends Han, Leia, Jaina, and Jag off on their merry way to get communications back with disconnected planets. Meanwhile, Luke, Mara, Saba, Jacen, and Danni head out to the Imperial Remnant to finally drag them into the Galactic Alliance and to research on this living planet thing that apparently Vergere talked about last book.NOTE: Based on audiobook and novel.I had this crazy dream not too long ago. I don't really remember what was happening or what I was doing, but I remember one crazy thought: that Sean Williams always has to have one ridiculously over powered Marty Stu in his novels. Somehow, that thought stayed with me when I woke up, and, as I was listening to this book, I had to agree. In The Force Unleashed, it was Starkiller. Here, I would lay my bets on Jacen Solo.But relating dreams and picking at Marty Stus, although fun for me, do not a review make.This book was painful. From characters to story to plot to writing to pacing, there was so much pain, I begged for mercy. Fortunately, the Force granted me the audiobook, which spared me the horribly boring Nom Anor scenes (what was the point of them honestly?) and the rather unimportant, dull Han/Leia \\"touring the galaxy\\" subplot.This book is just dull. Stupid in places and dull.We start out where Luke chastises Random Jedi #67 for wanting to press the advantage on the Yuuzhan Vong while the Yuuzhan Vong have been defeated. Of course, this is bad because Luke says it is bad, and when Luke says it is bad, IT IS BAD. Oh, and because of that aggression and genocide stuff that I thought had been resolved in last book, but apparently, the authors did not hit each other up on email to pass that bit along. Because why bother with continuity when you can drive the same plot point into the ground until people want to throw bricks at you. After RJ#67 has been soundly defeated by Jedi Master Luke, he happily walks off, never to be seen again.Bye, RJ#67! It was great knowing you!Next up, let's have a meeting with Cal Omas, Releqy A'kla (daughter of the deceased Elegos A'kla), Leia, Luke, Mara...and that's about it. I don't know about you, but this meeting feels a little...er, partisan, shall we say? Towards, I dunno, the Skywalker-Solo clan? Glad to see that our most powerful mafia--I mean!--Jedi family has SO MUCH influence on the government! NOT!The meeting that ensues is boring. It's boring and so obviously the setup for the next two books, it's sad. It's also sad to see supposedly \\"wise and pacifist\\" Releqy get a knock down from resident know-it-all, Leia, about peace. \\"Peace at any cost is not peace\\". I'd think a pacifist would know that, Leia. In fact, she should be the one saying that, not YOU.So off our heroes split, along random lines just because, what the hey, let's throw together the supposed Sword of the Jedi, Jaina, into stupid diplomatic missions and not out in the battlefield where her skills could be used. Let's toss Tahiri with Leia and Han, when she previously went on a mission with Luke and Mara. And just to up the angst, let's bring along Jagged Fel. Sounds like a great party.Luke and Mara beg and plead and sacrifice the never-present Ben Skywalker to the drama queen, Saba Sebatyne, who is whining and complaining about killing her people and she can't go because *GASP* she might kill others. Oh, please, stop acting like a three-year-old who dropped her ice cream on the ground. You are a freaking Jedi Master. Act like it. To round out the group, Luke and Mara bring Jacen and Danni.Oh, Danni, Danni, Danni...how much do I loathe you! From being way too young to do the job you have (weird Star Wars ages be damned!) to switching ALMOST OVERNIGHT from being an astronomer to a xenobiologist WITH NO PROBLEMS to stampeding over the previous relationship between Jacen and Tenel Ka, to being a FREAKING JEDI, you, Danni, have far overstayed your welcome in this galaxy. You are the next one that deserves to be on the chopping block. In fact, I hope by sacrificing your sorry corpse, we can bring back Anakin from the dead.At this point, the audiobook is kind to me. It completely removes the Leia/Han mission and those strange sections where Nom Anor, who is still NOT DEAD, mopes around Yuuzhan'tar and incites heresy in the Shamed Ones. I do have a few memories of these, and I'll summarize. The Leia/Han mission was forgettable, but I do miss the Tahiri character growth (though, why did it take so long for her to finally have to come to terms with her Vong-forming?). As for the Nom Anor stuff...no tears shed here!So our heroes jump to Imperial space, and OH NO! They jumped right into a Yuuzhan Vong-Imperial battle! Good thing our heroes with one X-Wing and the Jade Shadow are there, so they can save the day and all those Imperial lives! But then, nasty, evil, doing his job Keten tries to get them to be boarded. OH NO!! How could you do that to our precious, omnipotent Jedi! Mara tries to get them to come on board, so that *GIGGLES* she can use a Jedi Mind Trick, but apparently Keten is not that stupid of an Imperial (there aren't many in that boat!). \\"I'd sooner stick my head in a drive tube than take my chances with your Jedi Mind Tricks.\\" (Can I please stick my head in a drive tube instead of reading this book? PLEASE?!)No worries! A good female Imperial captain (because all female Imperials are good and sensible and all Imperials that side with our heroes will ALWAYS make sure they aren't boarded according to rules!) comes on and puts Keten in his place. Shame on him for doing his job and obeying the rules! Oh, right, our heroes are above the rules! Silly me!Our heroes are then paraded in front of a wide range of Imperials. We have stupid, fat Imperials that Jacen is able to wriggle his nose at and convince to do what the heroes planned, we have good Imperials that like our heroes and do whatever they want with little convincing (like Paelleon), and we have angry Imperials. What a diverse place Imperial space is!There is a little tension when Paelleon might be dead, but no worries, because he can do everything from inside a bacta tank! So Paelleon and the heroes plan up a nice Yuuzhan Vong battle, and Jacen wants his Deus Ex Machinas, I mean, the YVH droids to help out. LULZ. OH NO! It looks like the Yuuzhan Vong aren't falling for the trap...oh, whew! No worries, they did! Thank God they behave exactly how we stereotype them too. It would be too hard to have our heroes have to come up with a Plan B on the fly.Of course the heroes win (frak, does Paelleon make a stirring speech, though to the retreating Yuuzhan Vong), and of course, the Imperials gladly join the Alliance, with only ONE of their members having a second thought. Because, of COURSE, the Imperials are easily persuaded to join when you have the awesomeness of the Jacen with them. And we close with some giggles and hints at how Danni and Jacen LIKE each other because what Star Wars book is complete without some young adult reject Romantic Plotlines?So, yeah, I didn't like this book, I thought the characters, minus Tahiri and occassionally Paelleon, went from meh to terrible. The Imperial story wasn't bad, but I can't believe that only one Imperial would protest about joining the Galactic Alliance. It was a shame that Luke didn't actually get any closer to finding Zonoma Sekot, which feels like a HUGE Deus Ex Machina for the entire series. I understand why Leia and Han went on their mission, but I really think it wasn't worth my time, and the same with the Nom Anor plot. The writing is rather pedestrian and boring, occasionally filled with really stupid similes (such as \\"Flennick's features went from startlingly purple to deathly white in the time it would have taken light to cross the room\\"--talk about unwieldy!!). Overall, this book is a huge disappointment, and I do not recommend reading it AT ALL.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"Of all the New Jedi Order books I've read, I must say this is by far the worst.Where to begin? Well, the plot itself isn't really that bad - Luke and company go to find Zenoma Sekot, while Leia, Han and the others go to round up support for the Galactic Alliance - as I said, not bad. Even this has problems though. Based on the occurences in the novel, the Yuuzhan Vong are obviously expending a fair amount of resources to defeat possible attackers on their borders - and what is the Alliance doing while this is going on? Nothing. No offense, but after scoring a huge victory in Destiny's Way, the Alliance appears to be back to the New Republic's way of sitting there and doing nothing until they are attacked. The logistics just didn't make sense to me, and it wouldn't have been that difficult to include a new section devoted to say Wedge or Cal Omas or even Admiral Ackbar.As the plot is really the work of LucasArts though, and not of the writers themselves, any failings in the overall story department can be forgiven. What really made the book dissapointing for me was the writing style of the authors.In my opinion writing teams rarely work, as authors simply have different views, goals, opinions and thoughts - combining the work of two authors into a single book (or set of books) is a bad idea, in my mind. This is just the start of the problems however.Firstly, there were no chapters in the book. I can't understand the purpose of this besides forcing the reader to see the &quot;Part&quot; that they are currently reading as a single collection of actions and thoughts - which they really weren't. The lack of spacing between the four sections (not to mention a long prologue and longer epilogue) was offsetting to me, and I missed the deliberate pacing of chapters that all the other New Jedi Order books have. Heck, most books have them. As I said, unless it was some failed attempt at novel artistry, there was no point to it, and just aggravated me.Secondly, the book went far too much in spurts and stops. Almost useless portions of the plot would be given huge amounts of space, while the conclusions to battles and character depth were rushed, barely mentioned, or forgotten altogether. While I did enjoy the burgeoning love relationships between Jag and Jaina and Jacen and Danni (though I still believe Jacen and Tenel Ka should be together), nothing else really seemed all that well done to me, almost as though the writers were looking to find a niche in the story where their talents could shine.Thirdly, I found it nearly impossible to follow the flow of the writers words. A paragraph of character thought, for example, would follow normally through a pattern of logic, then suddenly, the character would arrive at a totally different conclusion than I would have ever thought of, or what I thought Williams and Dix were leading me towards. It felt as though the two writers were either confused in the writing of the book, or still attempting to discover their characters and those characters' place in the novel. A prime example (on a larger scale) is with Saba, who, from the prologue, I thought was going to be a main character throughout, but eventually only showed up in any importance at the very end, once again, like the writers just weren't sure what they wanted to do with the characters. For such an important area of the arc plot (ie. finding Zenoma Sekot and possibly dooming the Yuuzhan Vong), it was dissapointing to see the writers meander their way through.Lastly, the imprecise battle tactics. I had absolutely NO understanding of what was going on during the space battles. None whatsoever. It was really quite sad that the only description of the battles was &quot;The Empire was winning,&quot; or &quot;they were on their heels&quot; (those aren't real quotes obviously). It really hurt the book on the whole, as it was practically a nail in the coffin.I have several other points which also bothered me, but there is a word limit to this review and there's no real point in going on, as anyone reading this will get my point. I didn't enjoy the book at all. I'm almost certainly going to skip over the next two novels as well and pick up with The Final Prophecy, in the hopes of some restoration of the series before Dix and Williams completely destroy it. No offense intended."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I generally agree with a lot that's been already said. My biggest criticism with this book is that the author's bring aspects from some of the worst books in the expanded univers. Who cares about Zonoma Sekot. Rogue Planet was terrible. We get a return of the Yevetha from the horrible Blackfleet Crisis trilogy. The only good thing about this is that the Yevetha are now dead so we'll never have to deal with them again. The books ends with Han and Leia heading off to Bakura. Maybe someone should remind the authors what a terrible book Truce at Bakura was. What's next? We'll run into Callista on Ansion? Or better yet, Mimban. This book also has a few inconsistancies. Maybe I missed something, but I thought Jag and Jaina's relationship was at the serious stage. This book gives them an ambiguous, more-than-friends kind of feel. I agree with some of the other reviewers regarding their opinions of Danni. She needs to be fleshed out, killed or stuck in some lab where she won't bother us. Overall this book was alright, but it doesn't hold a candle to many of the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"Following the events of NJO: Destiny's Way, the heroes of the Star Wars universe go on separate missions to find a way to keep pushing back the Vong invasion. I will not go into great detail for those who have not read the book, but the basic storyline revolves around the Solo twins, Jag Fel, Tahira and their respective mission personel. First I wish to state that I was a bit dubious about the Force Heretic trilogy. Destiny's Way did not reach my expectations for the series, but Force Heretic: Remnant pleasantly surprised me. It is the longest of the soft cover NJO books, in fact, it's probably the second longest of all the NJO books, but its exceedingly well written. Williams and Dix have a great grasp on the characters, and though the storyline moves quickly and is fluid, character development and emotion are not in any way compromised. It was good to see characters like Jaina and Admiral Pelleon written true to their previous characteristics. The Pelleon in Destiny's Way was a fat complacent old man, in Remnant, Pelleon has returned to the personality given to him by Zahn's books. In Destiny's Way, Jaina had taken on the characteristics of a cyborg which did not reflect the changes that had taken place within her during Allston's NJO books. The NJO characters who seemed to have been growing stale in Destiny's Way are rejuvenated by Remnant. It is a superior NJO book and clearly in the top five books of the series. I would definitely recommend this book to any NJO fans, and I look forward to the next 2 installments of this trilogy. The only complaint I have, is that important characters like Wedge Antilles, Lando Calrissia, Lowbacca and a few others do not show up in the pages of this book. However, this is understandable because of the directions Williams and Dix are taking the NJO in."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"Warning: This review will contain spoilers.

To start with, the cover art for both this book and the others in the Force Heretic trilogy is beautiful and the synopsis on the back is certainly very intriguing.Unfortunately, and much to my dismay, both the cover and the summary are very deceiving in terms of what actually happens in Remnant.The plot is broken into three separate stories: Luke, Mara, Jacen, Danni, Saba, and Tekli looking for Zonama Sekot; Leia, Han, Jaina, Jag, Tahiri, and the Twin Sun Squadron venturing into regions of the galaxy that have been cut off from the rest of the universe via communication problems early in the war; and Nom Anor joining a Jedi faction on Yuuzhan'tar in hopes that he can overthrow Overlord Shimrra and regain his previous position of power.First and foremost is Luke's quest for Zonama Sekot. This is the story that is advertised on the back of the book and the story that should make up most of the book. However, what is advertised on the back of the book, the search for Zonama Sekot, isn't exactly what the reader gets. Instead, this story line focuses on Luke and friends stumbling into a battle between the Imperial Remnant and the Yuuzhan Vong. While the battle and interactions between the Imperials and Skywalker's team were well written, it was a bit disappointing to not get what the back of the book promised.On the note of the Yuuzhan Vong attacking the Imperial Remnant, it seemed a bit coincidental that Luke and friends just happened to stumble into the heat of things just as the battle was turning the favour of the Yuuzhan Vong. Coincidence seems to be a rather large part of the Star Wars universe, but I think some authors get a bit carried away with it. A lot of this book seemed based on coincidence.For a more favourable comment towards the Luke/Imperial Remnant plot, the interactions between the Imperials and Luke's team were, in my opinion, very well done. It was nice to see the familiar face of Pallaeon enter the NJO scene once again, even if he was in a bacta tank throughout most of his appearance. His interactions with Jacen especially stood out as well written and thought out. The Grand Admiral seemed a bit off in the last book he appeared in, but he was back to the leader we all know and love in Remnant.The plot regarding the Solos and their various friends seemed unimportant in the grand scheme of things. It struck me that the authors were just giving the Solos something to do. Perhaps this story line will gain importance as the trilogy continues. While learning about what happened to the Yevetha during the Yuuzhan Vong war was certainly interesting, at this point, the Solo plot seemed more like filler than an actual, relevant story line.And then there was Tahiri.The whole point of the Solo quest seemed to be introducing the conflict with Tahiri. I'm torn between what to think about this new conflict. Tahiri's shaping took place over five books ago, during Edge of Victory I: Conquest. Since then, it appeared that she moved on, only running into an emotional obstacle when her more-than-friend Anakin Solo was killed by the Yuuzhan Vong in Star by Star. In the books that followed, Tahiri seemed to accept the fact that her best friend (and probably more) had become one with the Force and, having fulfilled her purpose, moved out of the spotlight. To bring her back into the limelight struck me as a bit, well, unnecessary. I mean, I personally like the Tahiri as a character, but, at the end of the day, she is just a minor character. It seems a bit random to bring her up out of the blue to become the main conflict and point of the Solo story line. Regardless, I'm interested to see where this Tahiri issue goes. Perhaps it will end up playing a key role in ending the NJO, even if bringing it up now seems sudden and a tad unnecessary.The third and final plot line is the story of Nom Anor and his involvement in the Jeedai heresy movement. To me, this is where Williams and Dix really shine. They do a fine job of portraying the Yuuzhan Vong characters and culture. They allow the reader to look deeper into the Yuuzhan Vong and see them as a race with culture and customs and not just as the bad guys of the New Jedi Order. Nom Anor has, so far, been one of the few constants of the Yuuzhan Vong, making an appearance and playing a role in more or less every NJO book. He made some character advancements in Remnant, even going as far as to show a shred of compassion (however selfish his motives were). Yet, he remained the Nom Anor we've come to know and, to an extent, love. He remained focused on his goal of overthrowing Shimrra and ensured that every action brought him one step closer to achieving that goal. Some may complain that focusing on Nom Anor and his plot for power was unnecessary, but I feel that, as a character that has appeared in almost all of the NJO novels, the Executor was long due for a chance in the spotlight to build in character and become deeper than just being the bad guy. My only complaint here is that there wasn't enough time spent on developing this story line.Williams and Dix have obviously done their research and know a great deal about the Star Wars galaxy. That much is obvious. It was nice to see references made to earlier books and events, which not only enhanced the story, but also served as a reminder or the other events that have place in the Galaxy Far Far Away up to this point. However, I highly doubt the tale told in Remnant will ever be remembered as being highly significant in the Star Wars timeline. There just isn't enough important substance to the book. Most of it ends up seeming like filler more than significant story.To the authors' credit, they don't have a bad writing style. Their refusal to use chapters was really annoying, as it makes finding a good stopping point significantly difficult. But, other than that, I have few complaints. Though it wasn't the best writing in the NJO, it was easy enough to understand and flowed well enough...even if the authors had the tendency to randomly switch perspectives just when the story line was getting interesting.This was hardly the best book in the New Jedi Order so far, but it also wasn't the worst. The writing style wasn't bad and the parts of the plot that were significant (and not just filler) could have some interesting conclusions. However, Remnant seemed more like a teaser trailer for what is to come in the later books than a novel on its own. Not horrible, but also not amazingly good."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I've read some of the reviews previously published. I would agree that the storyline shows promise. I am, however, disappointed with the authors. It appears that over time, each author wishes to make his own stamp on the series (e.g., death of Anakin Skywalker), but in doing so, fails to adequately maintain the character developments from previous books. This book keeps some of the spirit of older books, but not quite enough. Interestingly enough, it seems that the authors have made the most effort to develop characters who will be eliminated, while continuing characters without much personality. Vergere, for example, showed much promise, demonstratng a possibly far more complex view of the \\"force,\\" but was then killed off rather then developed more fully. Also, as noted by another, Danni continues to never really develop beyond Jacen's love interest. She deserves more. Tahiri seems to be the same. I hope this long buildup of deep seated issues is not just \\"solved\\" or explained away in a single page two books later. Then again, Anakin, Vergere and Ganner were killed off just as they started developing into complex personas (a fate spared Jacen and Jaina, so far), so I would not be surprised if any of the other interesting NJO characters receive the same fate shortly after they evolve past the limited intellects of the writers. But as one reviewer put it, at least now we can hope again."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I enjoyed the basic plot of the story and I liked the mystery that surrounded several of the characters. Also, I enjoyed the freshness of the new and novel ways in how some of the problems faced were solved. I did feel like, however, I was reading one of the Rogue novels because there was so much detail on the space fights. So much detail in fact that the main plot is forgotten or lost. Old information was repeated and basically the book felt like a lot of small stories put hapzardly together. Over all, I do not think this was one of the best Star Wars books I have read except for certain bits and pieces."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I am a big fan of this series but I am a more than a little dissapointed in this latest edition. While the events and dialogue are quite what one would expect from this series the book is bland over all. There are a few new characters but none of them are introduced in such a way as the reader is really interested in what happens to them or what actions or roles they end up playing in this book. Sadly this edition to the New Jedi Order series reads more like a newspaper article than anything else. It starts out strong but ends with a blah. While there is, of course, a major event at the end of the book the dramatic build up is poor and the conclusion totally expected. Mysteries introduced in the novel turn out to have dull solutions or are unacceptably followed up. It's a build up then and a let down with the beginning much better than the end. The reader feels no Hurrah's for the heros at the end of this one. At best the reader mearly feels like he knows what happened after the last book and is caught up to speed on current events."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"This probably isn't the correct forum through which to do this, but what the hell... I just wanted to say thanks to everyone that has offered some feedback here. It's always nice to get feedback, both good and bad, and always interesting to check out the diverse opinions of the readers. Sean and I knew from the outset that we would never be able to please everyone that read these books, so the extremely negative reviews we have received here really doesn't surprise or discourage me. It is impossible to please everyone all of the time--especially when talking about the broad fan base that Star Wars has! I mean, even Star By Star had its decriers, and to me this was a fantastic book--if not the best of the series so far. So, again, thanks for all comments offered. To those that did like Remnant, I hope the trilogy continues to please; to those that didn't like it, I hope the next 2 books go some way toward changing your opinion about us as writers in general! But if you choose never again to read any of our work, then this is, of course, your prerogative. God knows I have come across writers in the past who simply didn't do it for me, and to this day I haven't been able to pick up another of their books; therefore it seems only fitting that there are readers out there that feel the same about my own work! :-)As for the star rating I have given, well I would have personally preferred not to give one at all, being as I am one of the authors and therefore somewhat biased. But of course, this is kind of necessary when doing these reviews, so I have given it a 4 out of 5. It's not my favourite of the trilogy, but personally (and I hope I don't come across as conceited here) I still think it holds up pretty well... :-)Happy reading, all..."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"Well after Destiny's Way this book seemed to take forever to hit the shelves!

By far the worst SW-EU noel series (and of course the longest). I only read this series because I started reading the Legacy of The Force series that came after the NJO and those books kept referencing back to things that happened during the Vong war that I didn't know about... so I read the NJO series... almost every book in this 19 book series was boring, poorly written, predictable and incredibly dry. I would only recommend reading this series if you are just DYING to know what went down in the war word-for-word.

When their forces collide with the Imperial Remnant, the retreating Remnant encounters what used to be its worst enemy - Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, traveling in his wife and fellow Jedi Master Mara Jade's starship (with nephew Jedi Knight Jacen Solo also aboard) toward the fabled sentient planet Zonama Sekot in search of a way to defeat the Vong.This complex novel is the first Star Wars book I've read since Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy, in which Leia Organa Solo's twin children Jacen and Jaina were born. Without the timeline and book list in its front, I'm sure I would have been lost; and even with that to aid me, I still had a bit of trouble sorting out the vast cast of characters and comprehending references to previous events (especially those relating to the death of the third Solo offspring, Anakin). However, this is a book meant to be read by fans following a series. So I cannot hold my difficulties against its authors, and I must in fact compliment them on making things as easy for me as they did.With that said, this is a well-paced, exciting story. The Yuuzhan Vong are a fascinating people, and the relationships among the familiar Star Wars characters (especially Leia and Han) have developed over the years with believable complexity. I'm not sure I want to go looking for all the books in the series now, but I've enjoyed reading this one. It is satisfying to read a media tie-in novel that allows its characters to grow, change, and even suffer wrenching losses, instead of being essentially the same at the story's end. My compliments to whoever approves the Star Wars saga's written continuation!--Nina M. Osier, author of &quot;Love, Jimmy: A Maine Veteran's Longest Battle&quot;"},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"The only book i liked in The New Jedi Order series was the first book by Salvatore, Vector Prime. Since then the series has failed to hold my interest, with its lack of focus and coherent plotline. Too many things are going on, and at a length of 15, the series needs to reach some kind of conclusion.Unfortunately the books in this series have become indistinguishable from each other. There is the usual New Republic politics, the Yuuzhan Vong making some gains, and our heroes making desperate stands, barely managing to hold off total destruction.If you want to read really good Star Wars fiction, read Timothy Zahn's books. There are 5 that I'm aware of. Zahn's exciting plot, discussion of Jedi power limitations, and intriguing characters (Grand Admiral Thrawn etc.) make it worth your time.Stop wasting your time with this series!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I hate to say it but after finishing this latest installment of the New Jedi Order I kind of felt a bad taste in my mouth. Borrowing that famous line from the Star Wars films, \\"I have a bad feeling on how this series is going to end.\\" In this installment The Vong have attacked the imperial remnant thus forcing what is left of the Empire to forge a union with the Galactic Alliance AKA the New Republic though it has now been destroyed by the Vong. The storyline was good overall with high risk missions taking place in order to force the Vong back and retreat. There were a few elements however which I didn't' like in this book. One being what I call the kiddy factor. As I have stated in other reviews concerning past SW novels at times writers are reluctant to give an adult oriented account of what is going on and thus over does with sugar coating in order to make it more palpable to young readers. Most of the time however SW writers work in the kiddy factor well without making it too apparent but in this case it was front and center. I mean come on, couldn't we have a few deaths when undertaking those high risk missions? I know there has been two major deaths since this series started and some fans went overboard with their condemnations but hey people that's life; eventually Characters do die off. In Remnant I would have liked to see Saba get snuffed out or even Danny but no chance. Even Pellieion survives though he is in a baccta tank for most of the novel. Sure there were deaths during the attack of Bastion, but again it was too sugar coated unlike the earlier novels in the series where you truly felt for the victims. Second is the dumbbing of the enemy. You would think a war culture like the Vong would have tuned into the fact that their foe is using some type of gizmo to confuse the war coordinators. The G.A.M was first used in book 11 and now has been used again. You would think the Vong would suspect that something is a miss. I did however in the end give it four stars for I did like the ending especially the drama where Pellieon addresses the moffs. I did feel though that the good guys this time round were a bit too smug and one dimensional. As well the reintroduction of the living planet Zonoma Sekut leads me to believe that the ending of the series will be stupid though I pray I am wrong. Zonoma Sekut was a boring plot line in \\"Rogue Planet\\" and I can't see for the life of me why this series would travel down that path. I hope at least there will be a huge bloody battle in the end. There are now just four books left in the NJO series concerning the Vong; its exciting to see what happens but I hope it will be a realistic ending and not disintegrate into tripe. This book contains 3 CDs and along with the reading are sound effects and music from all five SW films. Next in line is \\"Tatooine Ghost\\" Have fun fans."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"Overall, this book was lacking in plot development and characterization. In fact, the plot was just lame. And there was no characterization to speak of. I admit, it must be difficult to keep two seperate story plots developing, but the way the book was constructed was messy. The battle scenes were boring, the relationship between Jag and Jaina--while less painful than previous versions--is still out of place in a story about a war (and both characters are incosistent in their actions and dialouge.)Speaking of out of place, the new development with Tahiri was just weak. After Anakin's death, her character seemed to drop out of the limelight, but this attmept to bring focus to her is clumsy and over-done.Its unlikely that the style of writing will change before Refugee comes out, but one can hope that the authors will at least attmept to make things more exciting--and more consistent with the storylines laid forth by previous authors.Overall, I enjoy the NJO series very much, but this book was a disappointment--especially after such great novels such as Destiny's Way, Dark Journey, and Traitor."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"All in all, a good follow-up to Destiny's Way. The story moves along relatively well, but some of the characters seem to be, well, out of character- notably Jagged Fel. Jag has always been portrayed as extremely confident, capable, and intelligent, as well as having a healthy dose of ego: he's a charismatic leader. In Remnant, he's unsure of himself, quicker to take orders than give them, and doesn't seem to have much drive. This was a real disappointment for me, as Jag is one of my favorite characters. The book also hints that the &quot;friendly&quot; relationship between Jag and Jaina is still in the friendly stage, but in Destiny's Way it is implied that their relationship is more physical. It's a small thing, I know, but it's the little incontinuities like this that keep me from giving a full 5 stars to this book. I do like the shape that Jacen's character is starting to take, and I like the direction that the story line is moving along. The tide has turned and we can allow ourselves to hope once again, and so as long as the authors of the EU don't toss us anymore curves (i.e. deaths of major characters, massive losses in battle), Star Wars fans may actually be satisfied with the way this series ends."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"In \\"Remnant,\\" the New Republic is no longer. It is now the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. Our heroes travel the galaxy to recruit new members. Luke, Mara, Danni Quee, and Jacen head off to the Imperial Remnant with the ultimate goal of finding Zonama Sekot. Leia, Han, Jaina, Tahiri, and Jag meet with the Fia.This was a difficult book for me to get into. At first, it appeared to be Tahiri's story. Something mysterious is happening to her regarding visions, fainting, and the Yuuzhan Vong. We don't know what it is, but there is foreboding. I think I should be on the edge of my seat wanting to know more, but I feel nothing. Maybe it's not the author's fault. Her story has never gripped me.General Pallaeon makes an appearance. He has always been the most respectable Imperial. I was happy to see his return, but his performance was beyond believable. Barely out of a coma, he could still maintain command over the battle -- evaluating tactics, giving orders . . . all while fully immersed in a bacta tank!Leia and Han decide on their course based on a mysterious message. They get captured but find their way out only to *leave their daughter in battle* in pursuit of an unidentified person based only on the word of Tahiri. They argue with the unidentified person only to agree to go where that person directed. Why, oh why? They would risk everyone and everything based on nothing but unverified unknowns for no apparent reason? They are seasoned rebels: a smuggler, a politician. Never have I seen them be so rash.Aside from the plot points, there were scenes that were difficult to visualize. I actually read and re-read passages to make sure I didn't miss anything, but I couldn't tell if the characters were in a creature, behind the creature, exactly how the creatures were laid out, what the scenes looked like. There were times I could only get a general feel for what was happening.Some things I liked: Jacen and Danni Quee finally let their guard down just a little. That is a romance I have been hoping for. Jag and Jaina get to see a little more of each other. Luke and Mara are together. They've always made a good team.Nom Anor is on the run, discovering Shamed Ones in hiding who worship the Jedi. He becomes one of them, all the while scheming to regain his power. I am not a huge fan of Nom Anor, but this is an interesting subplot.\\"Remnant\\" definitely feels like part of a trilogy. It would not stand on its own. Hopefully, the next two books will make it worth reading."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"After a very long pause in the publication of new material in the New Jedi Order series, Sean Williams and Shane Dix bring us the first chapter of the Force Heretic trilogy, Remnant.Aptly titled, most of this novel takes place in the Imperial Remnant, who has fallen under attack by the Yuuzhan Vong, and is very nearly destroyed. A large amount of the novel also revolves around Nom Anor, as he struggles for survival in the under levels of Yuuzhan'tar, previously known as Coruscant.Overall impressions of this novel are quite positive. Though not necessarily as memorable as many of the other books in this series, it stands very well as not only a single novel, but doesn't fall victim to the trilogy effect. The book actually has one of the most satisfying endings of the New Jedi Order.The first notion that this book may be a slightly different read than normal is the lack of chapters. The story is divided into four parts, no doubt the result of having two authors working on it. We can assume that both authors wrote two parts.However, this novel doesn't fall prey to many of the traps that others in the series has similarly not been able to avoid. There are no annoying repetitions of various terms or phrases, no scenes that simply don't make sense, with the exception maybe of Tahiri's dream scenes.Unfortunately, the book is not completely without fault. There is very little humor, and rarely will the reader more than grin at some clich&eacute; line, or an inside joke. The space battles are adequate, but lack the vivaciousness of other NJO novels.Though the Expanded Universe has not always followed the movies, or George Lucas's explicit word, it was especially disheartening to read that C-3PO was built by Cybot Galactica, when we know he was, in fact, assembled by Anakin Skywalker from spare parts. While an explanation probably exists, this reviewer has yet to see it.Tahiri's scenes were quite odd, and if they continue in the same manner throughout this trilogy, it will be a frustrating series. However, it is a good possibility that Tahiri is the Force Heretic that the series title implies.Other than those small problems, there are no major issues with this novel. Despite not being an exceptionally memorable book, Remnant holds up quite well. After reading this book, the titles Refugee and Reunion, the two remaining chapters in this series, become obvious, and we can look forward to a decent series."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"this book trilogy is amazing i love how shane dix and sean williams make this awesome trilogy of books for the new jedi order book series this book trilogy = the best of the best and its even on pare with lord of the rings and harry potter and narnia"},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I am stuck in a terrible position.

If you're looking forward to a lot more books in this series that is good. If you were looking forward to finding out what happens next you will be disappointed. Another problem is with the lack of consistency form book to book with the main characters. Traitor ended with Jacen changing from wimp to super jedi. Then he turns back into a wimp again. Why is that? Why give him something like Vongsense in one book and not have him use in the next one? Is it just impossible to write him as well as in Traitor? Also I really like Jana in the trickster role so why get away from it? I also like her in the military role so it bothers me when you have 2 people trading places as Twin leader. I wanted her to have more responsibility with the promotion, not less. I really like what the authors do with Tahiri, Norm Anor, and the part with the Empire is really great.

Thats possibly why the book is so long with such a short plot... But overall I love starwars books and trust me as long as it was, just like every StarWars book ive read, (going on 20), its enjoyable... when you read a starwars book, you can't be so critical, you have to enjoy it...Specifically in this book, I found Tahiri's religous outburst with the Yuzhanvong idle (Yun Yammka) quite disturbing... But facinating. Nom Anor the once great Executor lives now in the pits of Coruscant, you almost feel sympathy for the monster. You find the remnant acctually listening to Jacen, the boy has skill, plus Jacen seems to be attracted to Danni Quee. Anakins been dead, obviously. Many jedi are unacounted for in this book, even mentioned, Corran Horn, and Kyle Katarn many others.... I just want to see them in action.. Anyone who hasn't followed starwars probebly doesn't understand what i am saying... what i am saying is that for a hardcore fan, read this book, its not the best, but its decent...Try not to be critical and just enjoy ...."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"Not one of the best, but brought back tons of emotions...A great great book. I was sincerely hoping that we could have an improvement of continuity and dialogue over what Jon Williams did in Destiny's Way. Although it doesn't have the impact of a Star By Star, it is a great tale and what I consider a turning point in the NJO series. It pulls from everything in the entire history of the saga. Fans of the movies will see the Empire and automatically be interested, but then be shocked to see this isn't the Empire they remember. Long time SW novel fans will hear Bakura and their interest will peak immensely. Romances are developing at a very nice and heartwarming pace with Jag and Jaina, as well as Jacen and Danni. Although there is a lack of some familar faces(Lowbacca, Tenel Ka, etc), the twists and turns with Tahiri's fall and the return of the Ryn more than makes up for it. To top it off, the beginning of the quest for the now legendary, both in the saga and real life as well, Zonoma Sekot is looking to be amazing. Sean Williams and Shane Dix did a superb job, and I hope the rest of the last of the series continues to grow at this pace."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"It is a good continuation of the NJO story line. The Solo twins continue to grow and develop relationships with other characters. The Tahiri sub-plot kept me going and wondering what is going to happen to her. I can't wait until the next two books come out!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"First of all, I have to ask, what happened to Tesar? Saba implies that he might be dead when she's mourning BarabI. I hope not, he has become one of my fav new Jedi. The plots with Saba, Tahiri, &amp; Nom Anor are great in this book and have me looking forward to the next one. Will Tahiri make peace with herself &amp; bring peace to the galaxy &amp; the Vong through the Shamed Ones? I also enjoyed the gentleman soldier, Grand Admiral Pellaeon being back &amp; at last getting to fight on the right side. What I didn't like about this book was that it felt like it was reviewing a lot of the time. Let's face it folks, if you haven't been reading NJO so far, you're not going to start this far into the series, so 1/3 of the book doesn't need to be devoted to catching us up to speed! It felt like Jacen's &amp; Jaina's personal growth slipped back to where they were 1 or 2 books ago and the same can be said for Jaina &amp; Jag's relationship(who I love together!) On a personal note, I really don't care for the relationship that is forming for Danni. Her personality has never been developed that well and she keeps getting thrown from one situation to the next even though she is constantly saying she doesn't know anything about being a Jedi or whatever else they are asking her to do. Either take the time to fully develope her or get her to the sidelines where she belongs and bring some old favs back into the limelight. By the way, I agree with some of the other reviewers that it would be nice to see Wedge, Lando, Corran, Tenel Ka, etc. but remember that no one author can possibly fit all the characters in one book ( though T. Zahn might come close!) Overall, this book fits with the rest of this series, 1 or 2 moments of greatness, enjoyable, but never as good as I hope it will be. Anyway, here's to wishing for Refugee!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"This book was a wonderful start to a new star wars trilogy. Remnant had some great plot, and left me with a sense to pick up the next book and continue the adventure. Luke, Mara, Jacen, Saba, and Danni head to find Zonama Sekot, but run into some interesting trouble that requires help from an old enemy. Han and Leia argue about thier adventures and get into trouble like always. While Nom Anor is planning to be the top dog of the Vong. All in all this book was interesting and one of the top reads of the series. I enjoyed it tremendously and can't wait to continue and see how this trilogy finishes."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"very good book. I'll make this review short and sweet, the writers, as everyone have said, brought back all the characters in a new light, brightter than ever. I can't wait for the next two, the anticipation of Zonama Sekot is nerveracking. Personally, the person who said they need to kill Danni is wrong, she is one of the crusial links in the books. I would like to see an appearance of Kyle Katarn, seeing as I've played Jedi Knight and Jedi Outcast. Great book"},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"While I am refusing to BUY any SW book that comes on the time line after SBS, I was able to get the Abridged Audio Tapes of these three books, and have now listen to the tapes of all 3 books and read books 1 and 2. I had seldom seen authors slammed so harshly since Children of the Jedi, Planet of Twilight, Crystal Star and the Black Fleet Crisis books. On the time line years 12 through 17 were a time of mostly very bad books.I have now finished the FH trilogy abridged audio books. Up front I must say that the Audio book editor must have agreed with many of the negative reviews. It seems that a lot of the stuff that miffed the some readers was deleted from the audio. I will disagree with some reviewers in that this first book is the most interesting of the 3. In book 2, you can just read the Bakura story and not miss anything. Then it switches, and in book 3 you need only read sentient planet story line.The Skywalker stuff was the most heavily deleted. I am not sure we can blame the authors. There has been a tendency for writers to \\"get rid\\" of Luke on some meaningless, boring mission. He has gotten to powerful, especially when teamed with Mara. So Luke is often written as if he is insanely stupid and self indulgent. In short, they may have been ordered to include Luke, since this is the Adventures of Luke Skywalker, but get him out of the way of the plot.After editing the books to fit into 2 hours of audio, we are left with a real good, fast paced story. In FHII, the story that is left after editing is almost entirely the Bakura story. Again, the end result is a vast improvement over the original the unabridged story.I therefore praise and highly recommend the audio versions of this trilogy for those who like to listen while they drive, like me. (PS the big complaint with Shatterpoint is the long boring parts also. But they edited that down to a 6 hour audio book and it is awesome!)Big disconnect between the Book jacket-cover and the actual story. Those who have noted this disconnect in other reviews are correct.How have we advanced the story? Is a sentient planet going to come to the rescue? Will Jacen continue on his slide into complete stupidity? Will Jaina regain any meaningful place in conflict? Will Luke and Mara continue to be written out of the important stuff? Where is Kyp? Where is Corran Horn? Will Tahiri evolve into a new life form? Will the alliance with Pellaeon last? Stay tuned.I have generally been displeased with much that has been the NJO. The \\"Prequel\\" books are another matter. I have liked them all so far. I especially liked Tatooine Ghost, a new addition to the Classic Era, which ties us back to the Prequel Era. The disconnect has two explanations, Laziness or willful misrepresentation. Only the Del Rey people know for sure. Shatterpoint, which is a 6 hour audio, book is tremendous. All is not mediocrity in the EU, just here in NJO."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I won't run back over the plot; other people have written better synopses than I could. I just feel compelled to moan over the downward turn this promising series has taken.Honestly, I never finished the book. I meant to, but set it down one day and found several weeks later I still haven't actually read the last hundred pages. I don't really feel like I can, but will eventually because after jumping on this ride, I have to stay on until the end. I never liked Nom Anor, or all the time devoted to dealing with his every move. I found his earliest movements here interesting, but they quickly became drawn out and redundant. I am furious over the romance brewing between Jacen and Danni. Tenel Ka is much stronger a woman and character than Danni, and Tenel has been dumped by the series like a flat tire. Tahiri I have always liked. But while I see some potential for her latest problems, I fear they are nothing but a red herring and are bordering on ridiculous after all this time. They also withheld too much info to be fair to the reader. Saba and her distress over the accidental killing of her people is sad, yes, but where have I heard that before? A common theme in the SW universe. The teams and their missions made me yawn. And Han and Leia deserve so much better than this! Williams and Dix should never work together again. And to think that they were responsible for THREE books!!!!! I wish Troy Denning could have taken the helm after Star By Star and never let it go."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"In what is the 1st book of a three novel arc towards the tail end of the New Jedi Order series, the title 'Remnant' refers to those bad guys we love: The Imperial Remnant. Yes, Grand Admiral Palleon and his forces while very briefly, (and I mean briefly) were touched upon during this whole Yuzhan Vong war have finally arrived on the scene.But it seems that they are only now willing to put what's left of the Empire on the line as the Vong have bombarded the Imperial home planet of Bastion and driven the Empire into chaos. With the different Moffs vying for power and a means to their own agenda, only Admiral Palleon (after suffering an almost fatal wound) takes the time to listen to Jacen Solo and comes to the conclusion that the only the only way the Empire will continue is if allies itself with the newly formed Galactic Alliance (previously the New Republic).It is this climatic battle at the end of this novel with the Imperial Navy and a trickery scheme that the Jedi have hatched that send the Vong a serious message that makes this book worthwhile.At slightly over 400 pages, I found the 1st half of this novel overly wordy and a few new story threads that were more or less very generic.There was what now seems to be the requisite rendezvous of forbidden love between Jaina Solo and Jag Fel, the new secret mission of Han and Leia, and the examining of the galaxy of Luke and Mara. While there is indeed some substance here that drives the overall story forward, it stills seems like a lot of fluff material to get to 400 pages.The other redeeming quality of this book is the further adventures of Nom Anor and his quest to return to his once powerful spot amongst his brethren. But being the master manipulator that he is, he chooses to use the Shamed Ones and their heresy teachings of the Jedi to advance. His portions of the novel were scattered here and there and made the 1st half of the novel tolerable as they were fun to read. His scheming invites the reader to turn the page one more time to see what he will do next and makes me anxious for book two.But hopefully book two will be slightly tighter move at a faster pace.Oh and did I forget to mention Jedi Tahiri now has some new curse that seems to be plaguing her sub-conscious. Hope this develops into something worthwhile; otherwise it's just a gimmick plotline with no merit."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"The New jedi order has been an extremely exciting twist to Star Wars Saga, In the Star Wars Saga We have seen them develop the laws of the Universe and the foundations for the force, delved into the history of a civilization, got to know some of its colorful personalities as well as the evolution of the force and then the rebirth of the Jedi's. In the New Jedi Order we have so far 14 books all of them fantastic in their own right(Including the Death of Annakin)They have been fast paced and engrossing. The character development has been incredible. An example of this is how quickly we fell in love with the Annakin character and how outraged we were when he was killed. Annakins Death was important because it showed us all too clearly that in Lucas' new vision even the good guys are vulnerable. We no longer can go through the books knowing our heros' will survive to the next book and therefore each book is more exciting than the next. That is until we reach book 15, what a disappointment. You would assume that with all this character and plot development that we would not need to be bogged down by so much unecessary fluff. The writing is slow and hardly captivating. The previous books have been hard to put down yet this book was hard to pick up. I read it as if was a school text book knowing I had to get finnish in order to get to the second book in the series. I did this praying that the plot which is solid would be better written and more captivating. To those die hard fans it is a must read(like homework)Hopefully, the writers will get it together and take a solid plot, strong characters, 15 books with momentum and write a book worthy of the series."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"I can't even believe people would give a good rating to this book.

It is primarily about a small group of Jedi helping the Imperial Remnant fight off Yuzhan-Vong.In general this book, like many others in the series, suffers from a drastic drop in quality about half way through. There are major pieces of the story that seem obviously to have been written with a &quot;let's just get this done attitude:&quot; Events start to be summarized with little detail and there is a strong sense that plot developments were created ad-hoc by the writters, with little editing. The writing is unspectacular at best. Among the annoying aspects is that the perspective of any of the older generation of characters is never taken, and their roles are unnecessarily small. Some of the attempts at dramatic build-ups are complete failures, unenhanced by frequent &quot;!&quot; insertions.Within the context of the New Jedi Order, I would rank this book similarly to Destiny's Way and far below Star by Star, Traitor, and Enemy Lines."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"This book and the 2 that follow are easily the 3 worst books in the series.

These are some of the weakest books of the series, and found them just barely enjoyable and then only because I enjoy the Star Wars milieu so much. The basic problem is that they make very little sense. After reading the whole series I still have no idea who the &quot;force heretic&quot; the title refers to is. And I have only the foggiest idea why the characters think the quest for Zonama Sekot is important. While we're on the subject, the characters are poorly drawn and their actions make little sense. The whole thing is so weak that the books just aren't a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"In the previous New Jedi Order novel, \\"Destiny's Way\\", the Galactic Alliance (nee' New Republic) earned its first major victory against the Yuuzhan Vong in this horrific, genocidal war. With peripheral assistance from the Imperial Remnant and a brilliant plan devised by the legendary Admiral Ackbar, the Alliance eschewed using a dangerous biological weapon in favor of a carefully devised conventional warfare trap. As a result, a huge Vong strike force, led by the evil Warmaster Tsavong Lah, was wiped out in the vicious battle of Ebaq 9. The casualties included Lah's own death and the reputation of executor Nom Anor, who championed the assault in the first place. These events, at the conclusion of \\"Destiny's Way\\" gave hope to the Star Wars reader that it may actually be possible to win this war against the Yuuzhan Vong.\\"Remnant\\" the first book of the \\"Force Heretic Trilogy\\" continues the progress of its predecessor while still reminding the reader, in horrifying fashion, of the monumental threat still posed by the Vong. Now that the Vong have taking over the galactic homeworld of Coruscant, among numerous other planets, and have recently suffered the devastating loss at Ebaq 9, the alien invaders have decided hold steady and regroup. Only on a few occasions is a strike force sent on an offensive mission. Those missions, however, are not for occupation or conversion. They are for complete annihilation. Using slave ship technology, the Vong capture between thousands to millions of 'slaves' while leaving the planets in smoldering ruins. In the midst of a diplomatic mission to strengthen ties with the Imperial Remnant, the Jedi encounter the latest Vong annihilation strike, aimed at the Imperial core world of Bastion.\\"Remnant\\" focuses on a two-pronged mission by the Alliance and Jedi to reconstruct the infrastructure that will be necessary for governing the post-war galaxy and to search for a mythical 'living' planet called Zonama Sekot that may hold the key to ending this war. This is easily one of the more enjoyable New Jedi Order novels in terms of subject matter. It continues develop the relationships with Imperial Remnant and Grand Admiral Pealleon (an underground fan favorite in my mind). It also spends some time growing evolution of Jaina and Jacen Solo in mature young adults and their relations with others, Jag Fel and Danni Quee to name a few. There is also a great deal of exposition of the Yuuzhan Vong Shamed One's heretic underground. This form of heresy, which Nom Anor had sworn to eradicate, provides the means by which he can continue to survive following his failure in the previous novel.The only negative aspect of this book is the author's seeming unwillingness to use a chapter structure to the book. \\"Remnant\\" is broken down into just four large sections that, over the course of 400 pages, can be quite ponderous. There are a number of breaks throughout the sections, but no real chapter breaks. The previous time this technique was used was in \\"Shield of Lies\\" the second book of the Black Fleet Crisis series. That was an unmitigated failure. It's a risk to use this type of format, and it can only be successful if the subject matter is worthwhile. Fortunately with \\"Remnant\\" it is."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"This book overall is entertaining but two out of three of the different plots drag on. Those two plots are good mind you but they could be much shorter.the most interesting plot is Nom Anor's plot to regain power after the Ebaq 9 incedent (which Warmaster Tsavong Lah perished in ) and in the underbelly of Yuuzan'tar (the shaped Curuscant) he runs across a group of the shamed ones. He has a idea that perhaps he can use the shamed ones and \\"Jeedai\\" to regain his power among the Vong. His preaching's about the \\"Jeedai\\" are the most interesting plot in the entire book. Luke Decides to search for the legendary Zonema Sekot (which according to the late Vergere repelled a Vong attack once) and With him are Mara Jade-Skywalker, Jacen Solo, Danni Quee, Saba Sebytine and Tekli. Though his first move is to get the empire to join the Galactic Alliance (you get to see Pelleion again). Han, Leia, Jaina, Jag Fel, Tahari (who seems to be having personality relapses from when she was shaped by the Vong ) decide to explore the regions that they do not now if they have been deystroyed by the Vong , this is the boringest plot of three plots.

The Williams-Dix team does an excellent job with the material. My biggest complaint about the book is that there are no chapters! The book is divided into &quot;parts,&quot; but within each part there are no chapters. NJO books are already hard enough to put down, taking out clear chapter breaks just makes it more difficult.I agree with another reviewer that Jag's characterization, and his relationship with Jaina, seem a bit off...but I think Mara's characterization far exceeds the ditz of Destiny's Way, and i'm more than willing to make that trade off.I felt this book was better than Destiny's Way, especially in its characterizations of key characters. The treatment of the storyline was well done and engaging.This book is another reason to start reading the New Jedi Order.

They are probably the type that like to hear C3PO being called Golden Rod or something of the like because it was done in the movies.. Please, let that end there, the point of the books is to broaden the star wars universe. Now onto the book, the characters were rather unusual unto themselves. But I enjoyed the change, I really dislike the fact that they cant seem to see the changes or even expect them some 30+ years after the trilogy. The book had feeling, which the Star Wars Universe had been lacking since about the 7th book in the NJO. Asside from Luke, Jacen, Mara and the whole gang, I can clearly say that the one who stole the show, was Admiral Gilad Palleon. Here is the empire portrayed as a military unit instead as the evil beings they are ussually portrayed in. You can tell that the Admiral care for his soldiers as well as the citizens that he has swore to protect. He has life unlike in any of the other books. I have truly found a new hero with in the Star Wars universe, and his name is Admiral Gilad Palleon. He alone carries the book eventhough he does not get the attention of someone of his importance. I hope the authors of the whole Force Heretic books keep using him.

It's the first book of a trilogy that will set the stage for the grand finale: Greg Keyes' The Final Prophecy.Remnant's plot folows the &quot;stage coach&quot; approach: small groups of our favorite heros, attempt to save the day by enduring long and lonely treks through the wilderness (of space), facing diverse dangers and hostile natives while forging unexpected if reluctant alliances. (Star Wars EU fans will be reminded of T. Jahn's Specter of the Past / Vision of the Future duology.)One group, led by Luke, Mara and Jacen is heading for the Unknown Regions, with planned stops in the Imperial and Chiss sectors, on a search for Zonama Sekot, the living planet of the Annakin/Obiwan novel Rogue Plannet.Another group, led by Han, Leia, Jacen and (my personal favorite) Jag Fel, is heading to the opposite direction, on the more mundane, yet equally dangerous mission of re-establishing contact with the various fragments of the scattered New Republic.I will not give any more of the storyline away, even though, unfortunatelly, there really isn't much to give away. Nothing really new or unnexpected happens in this book. The two groups go through the usual ambushes, betrayals, &quot;surprises&quot; and their assorted personal demons with casual efficiency and their trademarked resilience.Which, however, is not to say that this novel is not worth reading - in fact, quite the opposite, because unlike the confused and frustrating Destiny's Way, Remnant is both entertaining as well as detailed and consistent with the Star Wars universe:- All major and minor characters used are accurately depicted - indeed almost every character is carefully developed further, in a subtle and natural manner. Their relationships are cultivated as well: Jaina &amp; Jag, Jacen &amp; (??) - I will not give it away! Remnant has the richest cast in a long while.- The NJO story arc surges forward. A LOT of threads are picked up and masterfully woven together, both from the NJO and the older novels: the Empire, the Chiss, the Yvetha (remember them?!), the now fugitive Nom Anor, the ... - no more spoilers!- The SW Expanded Universe is taken very seriously . It feels as if (finally) someone read all the books and then took good long look at the galactic map, asked all the nagging questions (like &quot;I wonder what the Ssi-Ruuk think about this whole situation&quot;) and only THEN finalized the story - EVERYTHING is consistent and familiar, making the book a very entertaining read for the Star Wars fans.So, in the end, my main criticism is only that the book is predictable. Nothing unreasonable happens. Having been told what our heros have set out to do, we can more-or-less count on them to accomplish it and we are reduced to enjoying the action, like a Hollywood blockbuster that grossed $500M at the box office but neven quite got the Academy nomination. Better than the three star rating, but a bit short of four too."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"This book was a mixed bag.The bad: Tahiri. Someone needs to tell Shelley Shapiro (the editor of the series) about the importance of foreshadowing. For Tahiri's mental problems to suddenly come out of the blue a year after Anakin's death makes no sense. In Enemy lines--the duology after Star By Star--she was fine, she was strong. Aned why must we be subjected to her when she no longer really has a role to play. Her function in this story was to serve as Anakin's girlfriend, but he's gone and she should also vanish from the page. Unfortunately, it appears we're stuck with the little basket-case.This is why we're stuck with her: she's a kid. The uberkinden--superkid--triumverate was broken up with Anakin's death, but now it appears that the triumverate has been restored with the addition of Tahiri to join Jacen and Jaina. This series has concentrated on the uberkinden way, while all characters over the age of twenty are treated as cardboard cut-outs. Additionally, these \\"old\\" characters have had their brains sucked out of their craniums and they stumble through the series like morons.The character who has been associated with the worst character assassination has been Luke Skywalker. Here is a man who has killed millions of humans in the name of political idealism all without thinking about the morality of doing so. Now the Vong come on the scene, and Luke is paralyzed by doubt and indeciciveness. But then Luke had to be paralyzed by doubt so that this series could drag on and on and on. At one point, a Del Rey marketing flunky said in an interview--which has since been removed from their SW site--that they initally wanted to release 8 books a year. This would have lead to quality control going right out the window, a casualty of corporate greed and would have lead to books being churned out of dubious quality.The Nom Anor subplot was extremely boring. The only thing I want to read about is the Vong being utterly wiped out. I care not about their society.The Good: The Empire. Williams and Dix captured Pellaeon's character perfectly, along with the moffs, most notably Moff Flemnic. \\"The Empire will always strike back.\\" The only thing that disappointed me was seeing Chimaera sustain heavy damage."},{"Title":"Star Wars Njo Force Heretic Remnant 1 (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 1)","review":"so I'm looking forward to the next two books now. Space battles galore and all the characters act in character the entire book. For those of you who wondered where the Jade Shadow went, it's back (yay!). This book prominently features all the old favorites (Luke, Han, Leia, and even Pellaeon) plus all the new favs (Jaina, Jacen, Jag, Saba, etc.). There was an even balance struck between these sets of characters, better than any previously written. (*spoilers past this point*) My favorite part is the developing story of Tahiri... just enough clues were dropped to be interesting, but not give everything away. It looks promising. Only two complaints: 1- if Jaina is the Sword of the Jedi, why are they shuffling her off on some peripheral diplomatic escort (even if it is her mother's mission)? and 2- What's with Jacen and Danni?!? No offense to a well-written character or anything, but Tenel Ka runs circles around Danni. I sincerely hope that they bring Tenel Ka back soon. Hopefully in the next book. Other than that, a good read (and a good size too).

Based off of Philippians, they state that Christians must be of one mind in their philosophy of music. They assume that music is a language by quoting several well-known musicians. They claim that music is a universal and spiritual language.Garlock and Woetzel proceed to explain the significance of music in the life of the believer. They argue that music contains great influence and can either conflict or reinforce the spiritual lives of Christians. Through the several examples in the Scriptures, they state that God should be the Christian's song and that music is part of God's nature. They also say that Christians should listen to secular music. Throughout the book, they attempt to give the reader a type of formula that will enable the reader to discern what is good and reject what is evil, whether the music is considered secular or not.Through the journey of the book, the two authors educate the reader about the associations of rock music, and define rock by its beat, repetition, and loud volume. They discuss the purpose of several rock artists in order to further their point about the evils of rock music. They also briefly discuss the topic of associations in music. Through a portion of the story of Saul and David, they claim that music has three effects on listeners: physically, mentally, and spiritually. They dissect the music into three parts: melody, harmony, and rhythm. They then claim that the melody specifically affects the spirit, the harmony specifically affects the mind, and the rhythm specifically affects the body. They claim that rock music, \\"be it secular or sacred, is sensual\\" (68). They discuss how and why music can spiritually destroy or nurture the Christian. They present their view of what \\"order in music and the Christian life\\" should be with the following diagram:o First: Spirit --> ' Melody --> ' Dominanto Second: Mind --> ' Harmony --> ' Secondaryo Last: Body --> ' Rhythm --> ' ControlledGarlock and Woetzel also briefly discuss Country music specifically, saying that it is \\"designed to entertain, satisfy, and please the world\\" (145).Most of the book deals largely with the issues of rock music. Several chapters, however, discuss what is pleasing in the sight of the Lord by looking at music in the Bible. They talk about music as it relates to the church, evangelism, praise, messages, audiences, and the Christian's response, among others. They also discuss the elements in music that honor Christ, including issues of loudness in relation to the Christian's body as a temple of the Holy Spirit. Garlock and Woetzel conclude by giving several main elements in sacred music that please God: unity, praise, thanksgiving, and power. Within the discussion of these elements the authors state that improvising is the opposite of unity, thus it cannot be considered sacred. Lastly, they state some traits which the Christian musician should possess in order to play sacred music.MY APPRAISAL:Garlock and Woetzel use a syllogism to prove one of their foundational points. The syllogism they use, however, has two serious problems: first, it is a logical fallacy called Hasty Generalization, and second is that the syllogism contains four terms, rather than only three (syllogisms can only have three terms to even be considered a syllogism). Unfortunately, this one mistake undermines much of the argument in the book, despite some good points. The fallacious syllogism is as follows:\\"Since music is an emotional language,and since some emotions are wrong for the child of God,then some music is wrong for the Christian\\" (3).The authors do a good job by saying that music needs to be dealt with and thought about in the lives of Christians, and that there needs to be a balance. Ironically however, I do not believe they give a good balance. They make the \\"test to discern proper music in the lives of Christians\\" a simple 1-2-3 step process.Their thought-processes and arguments in much of the book are illogical and weak. For instance, they base their argument that the melody affects the spirit off of Ephesians 5:18-19. The use of these two verses is taken out of context to help support their point. Their argument that harmony affects the mind is based solely on their statement that it takes training to be able to harmonize well and correctly. To support their statement that rhythm affects the body, the authors use a made-up allegory from John 7:38, which states, \\"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\\"In a positive light, Music in the Balance makes opportunity for readers to give thought to the subject of music for the Christian. They present a vast amount of Scripture in each chapter and assign a memory verse for each chapter.In conclusion, Garlock and Woetzel make a lot of claims for their arguments that need to be proven, but they fail to do so. They lack definitions of used terms, proof of their premises, logic, and correct use and interpretation of several Scripture passages which they use to support key points. They underestimate the power that lyrics have with music, saying that they are unimportant, which I do not believe to be true at all. It is for all these reasons and more that I cannot recommend Garlock and Woetzels book Music in the Balance.TABLE OF CONTENTS:Preface .............................................................................................. xiiChapter 1: Why Study Music in the Life of the Christian? .................................... 1- Music: A Language- Music Taste or Preference- Music: An issue- What is Our ResponsibilityChapter 2: New Life--New Music What God's Word Says About Music ................ 13- Rock, the Most Popular Form of Music Today- All Things NewChapter 3: Rock, Right or Wrong? ............................................................... 25- A Closer Look at Rock- The Message of a MediumChapter 4: Music Makes Its Mark ............................................................... 39- A Disobedient King- Three Effects of MusicChapter 5: Order in Music Offers Harmony in Life .......................................... 55- Music's Effects Applied- As in Life, so in MusicChapter 6: Music Builds and Music Destroys ................................................. 69- The Importance of Hearing- Music on the Mayflower- Selfishness, Rebellion, Idolatry- Be StillChapter 7: The Music Sets the Mood ........................................................... 87- Worldliness in Music- Style or an Extension of Philosophy?Chapter 8: \\"Unto the Lord\\" ...................................................................... 101- A Changing Sound- A Discerning People- An Unlikely Alliance- The Purpose for Music Then--In the Word- The Purpose for Music Now--In the Church- Praise unto the Lord is GoodChapter 9: Instruments of Praise ............................................................... 115- In the Image of God- Words for Praise or Words to PleaseChapter 10: Music Notifies Joshua and Moses ............................................... 131- The Sound Becomes the Messenger- The Contemporary Sound- Country Music- Powerful but PowerlessChapter 11: Elements of Christ-honoring Music ............................................. 151- Solomon's Temple Dedication: Background- First Element: Unity- Second Element: Praise and ThanksgivingChapter 12: Elements of Christ-honoring Music, Continued .............................. 167- Third Element: Power- Musicians Empowered by God- Sacred Music as Ministry or Entertainment- Music with Power for EvilChapter 13: In Conclusion ...................................................................... 181- \\"The Medium Is the Message\\"- Consider the ApproachNotes ............................................................................................... 187Bibliography ...................................................................................... 199"},{"Title":"NAKED BLACK GIANT LEAVING LOW RIVER","review":"01.

My overall review is positive.But few things which I didn't like are :1. Author keeps talking about the \\"Magic Formula\\" over and over again as if it is some wizardry. If he had kept a professional tone and just explained the concepts, it would have left a much better impression than sounding so cheesy.2. I call it incomplete, because he should have dedicated a chapter on how you would use the \\"Magic Formula\\" starting from what you do after you see the 30 stocks. He could have walked us through buying those and probably monitoring how they are doing instead of holding the losers and winners blindly for a year.3. Finally, the 30 stocks that were shown to me from the website, 3 were very shady and even almost falling into penny stock land with major drops in prices. I would have loved it if next to your picks you provide commentary on how they really fit the magic formula.Overall still a good read, I think."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I really like how he explained the topic by putting it in story form (I have the audio CD), and he simplifies the topics with real life illustrations spoken in a manner that teenagers and adults could relate to.I think this should be required reading in our families (like Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad or Dale Carnegie's Win Friends and Influence People) as it would help our nation to grow strong with solid foundational knowledge.Whether you are \\"smarted than the average bear\\" or if you are currently failing in the stock market this book will take you to the next level. It is Warren Buffett level thinking. It gets an A+ in my book."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This review pertains to the Audiobook CD.It was extremely simplistic and devoid of material information. If you know absolutely nothing about investing, and you are a teenager, it might be a useful story to listen to. But for anyone else I recommend you don't waste your time.The audio CD makes really big claims (about unhelpful other sources of information are, and how superior this simple strategy is) but then fails to provide any substantial amount of information. There seems to be an \\"unabridged version\\" which might have some meatier information, but this CD was extremely wordy to make a simple point.There were perhaps just a few bullet points:you want to compare companies by their earnings yield or % earnings per dollars invested.you should expect to earn a greater return than low-risk investments, such as held-to-maturity treasury bonds.you should be careful because some companies destroy value when they expand.earnings can be volatile.prices of stocks can be extremely volatile.The first point and last point are his main points. Obviously, you want to buy a company you think will continue to have solid earnings, but whose price has sunk during market volatility, and hence you get a bargain. You look at a company's earnings yield, to tell whether it is a bargain or not. Does it get a 10% return on capital while another stock gets only a 2% return on capital?The story he uses is really long and lame for anyone older than 18. (again: the unabridged version might be meatier, as might the book)One big thing he doesn't expound upon is what time frame are you looking at, for earnings? Presumably last 4 quarters.Others prefer to go upon analysts' expected earnings for next year. I haven't figured out how much more reliable using those figures are than past earnings, but I hope I can figure that out.Some other reviewers of the book talk about EBIT. The audio CD doesn't go into different measures of earnings (dividends vs NI vs EBIT vs EBITDA) or dollars invested (common stock value vs enterprise value). The audiobook also doesn't explain why some high-growth company's have extremely poor earnings yields (like Amazon) which is b/c people are anticipating/speculating that at some point in the future it (after it has established so much market-share and well-developed products and product-spaces and infrastructure) it will be able churn out big earnings. Clearly, he advocates finding companies that are \\"bargains\\". However, he doesn't warn you about \\"value traps\\", where a company occasionally has rapidly declining earnings, but the company is a bargain based on past earnings. Good examples would be a company whose few patents have expired, its mineral resources have been depleted, or its technological product line is at a dead-end (1990s' wordprocessors or CRT monitors, for example) without a modern successor.Back to the issue of growth stocks, there is always the hope that the company's assets (tangible and intangible, book and non-book) can far outlive their book depreciation expenses which dock earnings in their periods of rapid growth. For example, Google, according to one article expenses all its software R&D; costs the year it incurs them, instead of capitalizing them as assets and depreciating them over time. This potentially means that future earnings might benefit from software product segments that have greatly reduced future development/maintenance costs. If competitive pressure is too great than this may never actually happen, and the company might always struggle to make earnings.The risk of growth stocks is that there is much speculation about how much future earnings the rapidly growing company might be able to churn out in the future. This is not so easy, b/c sometimes competitive pressure forces margins to stay ultra-low or even force them to become unsustainable. I am still looking for a good book that will explain all these nuances in greater detail. I am starting to chew on Damodaran's books and the Wiley CFA series, as well as some Buffet books, and I recommend others to likewise."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I have read plenty of books that would help you with your future but this is the one I would recomend over all others.

I found the book very amusing and easy to read. Greenblatt presents his audience a magic formula to beat the stock market and backs his statements with backtests compared to the S&P500.; His magic formula systematically beats the S&P; benchmark in the backtest timeframes. Above that all he offers the results of his formule for free on his website, a long stock listing of ticker symbols.At the end of the book the author gives you the formula (although it's not that easy to copy his formula and achieve the result listings on his website).I have not traded the results of the magic formula myself but I have done some backtestings on the stocks recommended by the magic formula. My original plan was to add an indicator to rank the stocks I would buy or to add a stop-loss to improve the backtest results. After having done a lot of backtests, I didn't find anything to materially improve the results from picking random stocks from the listings. So in case you'd follow this formula, I suggest you just pick random stocks from the magic formula results. Most people I know using this formula are still achieving positive returns, even after the market crash of 2008.PS: There is a yahoo group devoted to this book with a lot of people following the magic formula.

This book is very simple to understand and for some more advanced investors, it may be too simple. But, I personally like simplicity because I think that people tend to complicate things too much.

If you need complicated calculations to convince yourself that something is a good deal, then it probably is not. If most of the mutual fund managers followed Mr. Greenblatt's value investing philosophy, they would do much better than average.

This formula will enable you to beat the market and professional managers by a wide margin the low-risk way.

Joel Greenblatt, the founder of Gotham Capital, has an average of annualised returns of 40% for over 20 years. So, everything he says should be taken seriously.

This book, all 140 or so pages of it, is essentially a plug for a new website based on a simple formula that, the author claims, will help you significantly beat the market over time. As has been said by previous reviewers, the book presents only one very basic principle of investing, and then proceeds to repeat it over and over.I label this book somewhat misleading simply because, well, its a book. I for one read books for information, but this, by and large, is a piece of advertising aimed at getting you to the website. Sure, there's that one formula, the \\"magic formula\\" (which, essentially, says that you buy companies with a combination of good earnings yield and high return on capital), but other than that there is actually very little investment advice. Instead there is a sort of patronizing explanation which may be suitable for teens, but shouldn't really impress an adult (unless that adult knows nothing about investing in the market). Thank heaven I didn't pay for this piece of advertising (I got it from the library).That having been said, the book has its merits. It is, after all, a very small book. What should you expect from a book so small? Anyone seeking to gain a knowledge of investing from a puny little book like this has to be a bit off anyway. I guess I can agree with the thesis that the book delivers what it promises. That one piece of advice (and really, that's all there is), is very sound, and certainly can help an investor (as basic as it is).The website is actually a huge plus--I've checked it out and can say that I'll at least take it's results into account when I'm choosing my investments. I even think the formula could work over time. Again, I guess my primary objection with this book is that you're essentially buying a masked piece of advertising bent on selling you a new investment website, which is free \\"for now\\" (as the book hastens to point out).

Based on a 17 year study, you have to ask yourself what it will take for you to believe in the formula.If you have a good $10-$20K+ laying around that you can invest for 20+ years and can stick it out during what may be several consecutive years of low performance for stocks \\"chosen by the secret formula\\", this may be a good plan for you. It is suggested that those who don't stick it out, don't have faith in the formula. Whose going to care if the book was wrong 20 years from now, will you or the author even be around? Only time will tell with stocks.Grade: C+"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"the book aims to identify value stocks, ie cheap stocks in a portfolio, that will outperform the markets over a 3 - 5 year period. Value is identified by finding stocks wit a high e/p or ROC.However, as he admits, these measures don't always work, and many stocks will look cheap by these measures but actually be fairly valued for other reasons depending on the stock, its industry or its future prospects.Mr Greenblatt gets around the problem by recommending rolling purchases to attain a portfolio of around up to 30 stocks. For someone with small capital this is over diversification. What is needed is to take the lists generated by his method, and then identify a smaller portfolio of stocks with higher overall probability of success. An average investor should not have more than 5-10 stocks, and its been shown that a veyr large poirtfolio doesn't necessarily provide lower risk ir better returns.Overall a good place to start with modern value investment, although In would also consider the david dreman book on contrarian investing."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"The author introduced a stock picking method at the beginning... stuffed barely relevant, or almost irrelevant, information in the body of the book (I would suggest you to skip them all)... and return to the stock picking method at the final chapter.

The author explains that the numbers behind the track record can be found in the appendix, but I did not find anything.It is my understanding that the back-tested investment returns quoted in the book required turning over the portfolios every month for the time frame noted. The impact of transaction costs and taxes would take their toll over time.In regards to real life investing, the author recommends a much longer holding period, ie one year. If a stock no longer meets the criteria, then wait for over one year to sell your winners and before one year is up to sell your losers. This investment advice does not match what was followed to generate the back-tested investment returns quoted in the book.All in all, a good book. I wholeheartedly agree the investment discipline detailed in the book will serve investors well over time. However, I just believe the investment returns quoted are a little misleading."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Even a magic formula fails once it is exposed, just like Benjamin Grahm's formula.

I have viewed magic formula offerings with negative PE's. Good and sustainable growth comes from earnings that are consistant and not based on one time events. When a company is dropped from the list what does that indicate?Was it dropped because of a fundamental shorfall or because of evaluation? When does a company of great consistant value become a bargin in the marketplace? When Mr. Market is driven by fear, fear of the unknown and reduces the value to unreasonable levels or because the potential for return of capital is overlooked. The true value of a company is only the return it can produce; the assets it has that can be liquidated or accquired by willing investors. The magic formula offered to us by Mr. Greenblatt is a viable alternative to various market stratiges but it must be applied by spreading the risk and thus requires a large capital outlay.

Greenblatt's formula for investing is simple and makes perfect sense.

Prior to the Internet, obtaining the kind of information that the book references was available only through brokerage reports, ValueLine, and other pricey subscription services. With the internet, a host of powerful financial and screening tools are available to anybody who has patience and a few minutes a week.The highlights of the book include:(1) The magic forumla is simply buying good businesses at cheap prices.(2) To determine what is a good businesses, use RETURN ON CAPITAL which is given later as EBIT/NET WORKING CAPITAL + NET FIXED ASSETS. EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) is used instead of regular earnings to eliminate the influence of different debt structures and tax rates. NWC+NFA are used in the denominator instead of total assets in an ROA (return on assets) calculation or equity in an ROE (return on equity) calculation. This calculation is a bit more complex than ROA or ROE formulas, but it's more accurate.(3) To determine what are cheap prices, use EBIT/ENTERPRISE VALUE. EBIT once again eliminates debt and tax differences; ENTERPRISE VALUE is market capitalization plus net debt (since a buyer of the whole business acquires the liability side, too).(4) These two screens do a remarkably effective job at uncovering stocks that do well over time.(5) If you do additional analysis of companies that the magic formula ranks highly, you can easily tolerate holding only 5-8 stock positions. But if you simply run the formula and invest accordingly, a diversified portfolio of 20-30 names is better suited over time for most investors.(6) The magic formula does a great job in 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year time intervals.(7) The key to success with the formula -- or with any investment guideline -- is sticking with the formula long enough to allow it to work. Anybody buying value stocks from 1998-2000 knows how hard it can be to keep doing what you know is right when month after month and year after year the P&L; sheet runs against you. But the Tech Wreck made the value buyers of 1998-2000 very prescient as they have enjoyed 6 good years in a row.(8) The formula tends to uncover many small-cap stocks since that is where most mispricings occur. This is a plus for small investors since they can move in and out of small-cap stocks in sufficient size for them, but large institutions can't. The formula also identifies legitimate and quality small-cap stocks, as opposed to the speculative Bulletin Board and Pink Sheet nonsense that many people buy in lieu of true small-cap investments.The book is easy reading and written with humorous anecdotes and stories from Greenblatt's family. The references to youngsters might cause some to want to skip ahead to the meat-and-potatoes section of the book, but for those who are not financially savvy these sections provide useful illumination of basic finance and business concepts.The important thing that one takes away from \\"The Little Book\\" is, like O'Shaugnessey's \\"What Works On Wall Street\\", a few simple screens can eliminate scores of weak-performing companies. The latter focused on price-sales and price-earnings metrics; \\"The Little Book\\" looks at revised measures of profitability and valuation. The most important thing in both books, however, is that investors have to be comfortable with the investment strategy and the stocks they produce and be willing to give them time to succeed, as opposed to bailing out the first time friends or dinner party guests say they are nuts for not daytrading or playing tech stocks."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"After reading the Wall Street Journal review, I rushed to order the book through Amazon. While I thought the book made sense and wasn't a bad read, it didn't live up to the review. Worse though was the website. The website is too simple and lacks a lot of important information. Whereas in the book, Greenblatt states that one should rank the stocks according to a combined factor of e/p and return on capital, the website doesn't provide any such rankings. (The order of the returned stocks is alphabetical.) Moreover, the website doesn't provide the actual number for the return on capital. As another reviewer wrote, what happens if after two years Greenblatt starts charging fees for the service. Perhaps this is why the website is so limited. It could end up having a free portion and a premium pay service.In regards to the book, a major problem I had was Greenblatt espousing the long-term passive investment approach and then out of nowhere, in his instructions, states that one should sell after one year. I understand that one doesn't want to sell before one year due to short-term capital gains, but why is he preaching that your holdings should be sold after one year? Greenblatt doesn't get into this.In sum, this is truly a book you could browse through at a bookstore to get its message. (And don't get me wrong, it does have an important message.) It's nice to have concepts explained in a clear, succinct manner, but it's even better to be a little more comprehensive. This applies to both the book and the website!"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"In an engaging and succinct way, Greenblat succeeds in laying out the cornerstones for \\"value investing\\". Influence from Graham's style of investing is obvious. It is puzzling as to why the book has so much publicity and recommendations from every investment newsletter or magazine this reviewer reads (perhaps because the author has made tons of friends in this community). While the information presented in this book is not exactly groundbreaking, the novelty of the discussion certainly stands out (though sometimes repetitive). There is of course, a \\"magic formula\\", and its website which will give you ideas for picking stocks. However a portfolio of 25-30 stocks is recommended. Either you have to really well off to get this going (in which case you probably won't read this book) or will end up buying miniscule amount of shares (and trading commissions will eat up your gains). Plus, the author cautions the reader that the approach may need 2-3 years at least to bear fruit. The author clearly admits (refreshingly) that there is no real way to know if the approach will be as successful as it has been shown to be historically. Overall, an engaging, easy to read book, with valuable information for the very novice investor. And for the experienced investor, the approach may provide another check mark before investing in any stock. An excellent read. Not necessarily, a must-have. But for the price, worth it."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This little book is a complete gem. It gets it's message across in a clear and humorous manner, never dull. It is a quick and fun read, and also presents a solid investment strategy. He proposes an investing \\"magic formula\\" based on two factors: return on captal and earnings yield. Of course, you can measure these factors in different ways. This is a solid value investing strategy, and it's presented with convincing evidence of success.The measures chosen in the book are the following :For Return on Capital : EBIT/(Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets)This is chosen over the more commonly used ratios of return on equity (ROE) or return on assets (ROA). EBIT allows them to view and compare the operating earnings of different companies without the distortion s arising from differences in tax rates and debt levels. For each company, it was then possible to compare actual earnings from operations (EBIT) to the cost of the assets used to produce those earnings (tangible capital employed).Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets was used in place of total assets or equity because Net working capital has to fund it's receivables and inventory (excess cash not needed to conduct the business was excluded from the calculation) but does not have to lay out money for it's payables, as these are affectively an interest-free loan (short-term interest-bearing debt was excluded form current liabilities for this calculation). In addition to working capital requirements, a company must also fund the purchase of fixed assets necessary to conduct it's business, such as real estate, plant, and equipment. The depricated net cost of these fixed assets was then added to the net working capital requirements already calculated to arrive at an estimate for tangible capital employed.For Earnings Yield : EBIT / Enterprise ValueMeasured by calculating the ratio of pre-tax operating earnings (EBIT) to enterprise value (market value of equity* + net interest-bearing debt). This was used rather than the more common P/E or E/P for several reasons. The basic idea is to figure out how much a business earns relative to the purchase price of the business. Enterprise value used instead of merely the price of equity because enterprise value takes intoaccount both the price paid for an equity stake in a buisness as well as the debt financing used by a copay to help generate operating earnings.Near the end of the book, he promotes giving back some of what you have earned - something that greats like Warren Buffett practice. He's a good man, who has written a good book. He also says that if you are very comfortable with your choices, that five to seven stocks near the top of the screen are good enough to invest in - you don't need to choose 30 stocks as the magic formula espouses. He has built a nice screening site specifically tailored to the formula - magicformulainvesting.comWith other general screening tools and sites, you can use ROA minimum at 25%. From that result, screen for lowest P/E ratios. Eliminate all utility and financial stocks. Eliminate all foreign companies from the list. Remove all stocks with less than P/E of 5 (indicates the previous year being unusual in some way.)This one can be read in a day or two easily (I read it twice in three days). It's a good one to add to your collection at home, or just check it out from the local library, which is what I did. I love books that have high value / time read ratio - and this was one of those books."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I don't know much about investing but was intrigued by this concept.

Making and losing money is very emotional and people get pretty worked up about it. Furthermore, Greenblatt sets out in this book to boil a successful stock investment strategy down to something simple enough and short enough to be read by a child. It's a recipe that invites criticism from people of varied investment skill levels.First off, there is merit to any criticism of a math-driven investment strategy that is derived by determing that it would have worked well had it been applied in the past. Second, the point that this strategy actually is quite difficult to implement yon your own without Greenblatt's website (which may or may not remain free or in existence in the future) is also true.That said, this book trancends those very real problems in its accomplshment of its stated goal. To begin with, this book can be read and understood by fairly young kids, which is impressive (you try explaining the absract world of investments to young folks, trust me, it's hard). More than that, however, the investment strategy Greenblatt lays out in this book is fundamentally sound. Furthermore, Greenblatt's convincing argument around the idea that you need to stick with this strategy (or any other for that matter) through good times and bad is an important idea lost on most investors these days.The flaws keep this book from being five stars, but its good attributes weigh far more heavily. Recommended reading."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This book is a mixed bag. First of all, it's written in a style designed to appeal to 5th graders, including vomit jokes and etc. I don't mind that he simplifies things. His explanation of why return on equity is important was good. But the jokes and style are so juvenile that it becomes boring at best. This book is very small and short, and his ideas are very simple. The whole book could be easily condensed into a 10 page essay. I like his idea of looking for stocks with high earnings per share and high return on equity. But this works only as a preliminary screen. If you go to the &lt;magicformulainvesting> website and use his screen to come up with stocks, you better examine each stock carefully before buying, because some of them are real duds. There might be one-time events that have pumped up those numbers temporarily. Or, sometimes a stock has good earnings and ROE, but zero growth potential. Your money is just going to sit there. THERE ARE NO MAGIC FORMULAS FOR INVESTING. Don't listen to the hype. His approach is valuable as a starting point, but there are many other important factors that need to be considered before investing your hard-earned money in a company."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Here's my 2 cents as an average investor who has read a handful of investment books and taken some stock investing classes at Morningstar.com:When a hedge fund investor who has achieved 40% annualized returns over the past 20 years who is an Ivy League business school professor offers investment advice, I read his book and think about it carefully. Particularly since it is written up in Smart Money magazine and is enthusiastically introduced by personal finance guru Andrew Tobias.\\"The Little Book That Beats the Market\\" serves 2 major purposes: The first is to introduce the stock market beginner to a few basics of value investing, particularly the concepts of earnings yield and looking for bargains. He does a fabulous job of doing this in a way a kid would understand with analogies including a school yard entrepreneur starting a gum selling business and \\"Mr. Market\\" a wildly moody guy who offers different prices for the business on different days depending on his mood.The second is to introduce investors (beginner or otherwise) to the magic formula which tweaks the earnings yield and bargain hunting to try to find good companies at bargain prices. Greenblatt not only provides the formula, but his results from working with it for 17 years (1988 to 2004). As table 7.1 (p. 61) shows, over the entire 17 years, Greenblatt's ahead 22.9%, compared to the market average of 11.7%. There are 2 years where Greenblatt was down (1990 and 2002), compared to 4 years where the market was down.Will the formula work over the next 17 years? No one knows! But IMHO as an average investor, it seems like a good idea to take good companies, screen them for price, buy a portfolio of 20 to 30 of them (if you can afford to buy this much stock!), hold them a year, and do this over time. If nothing else, you're diversified with a longer time horizon than a day trader. Now if everyone utilized the magic formula it would backfire, as everyone would be buying many of the same stocks increasing the prices. Greenblatt says the beauty of the formula is that since it involves faith in it and long-term patience to ride out the down years, many people won't stick with it.There seems to be a third purpose of the book, which is to tell jokes and anecdotes. Some are relevant to his point and funny, but most seem like filler. About 10 to 20% of this 155 page book could have been edited out with no loss of content what-so-ever. Referring back to the gems between the jokes can be difficult as there is no index and the chapters have no titles, making the table of contents pointless. As Jack Hough writes in Smart Money magazine, \\"the basics of the magic formula take Greenblatt a mere half-dozen pages or so to outline. You can summarize them in, say, a bad haiku: Purchase low-priced shares/of high-return companies/hold for one year.\\""},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"There are a few real gems of advice here. The most repeated is... \\"Most people have no business investing in individual stocks on their own!\\" Right after that comes, \\"If your stockbroker is like the vast majority, he or she has no idea how to help you!\\" (Note: I have nothing against brokers, it's just they're professional buyers and not advisors.) The last gem IHMO is \\"So how would you fix the public school system? You might fire bad teachers, pay more for good teachers, remove bad principals, and close bad schools. [Sadly,] with public schools, this rarely happens.\\"Otherwise, there's no reason to buy and read this book as I'm going to tell you everything it says in but 2 sentences. First, go to Magic Formula Investing dot Com (the site is free) and buy a half dozen recommended stocks every 2-3 months until you have 20-30 of them. Then, review and sell anything no longer on the list in order to replace (and expect to replace all of your portfolio every year).The Web site / formula attempts to find cheap companies that earn a lot of money. This seems reasonable, but what's missing is why the company's cheap (say, they're being sued) or why the company's making money (was it dumb luck or skill). In other words, there's no hint of any risk measurement or any real financial research. The key problem with simply chasing higher returns is that you'll always end up with overly risky securities (both for the returns being made as well as your temperament). The author claims the Magic formula will beat the market (which currently sucks as a benchmark) - again with no mention of whether that this may be done at a much greater risk to losing all of your money (something easy to do) - within any three years. BUT, calculations show it has lost over the last three years (losing, in fact, a whopping 29%).This seems like the worst investment book I've ever read (providing only what people want to hear - it's easy). Using this system, you should sadly expect to get burned. I'm only now doing the due dilligence of a deeper Internet search and it seems just about every blog/site testing the Greenblat's magic formula has shown it to underperform the market. BTW, who is the Greenblat? He is an original protege of Mike Milken who is well known for his role in the development of junk bonds and getting jailed for racketeering and securities fraud. No surprise."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"In some ways, the average investor is like a man looking for the right combination to get at the riches in a vault. Unlocking the market's treasures - knowing which stocks to buy and sell - is a difficult mystery seemingly beyond his powers.Joel Greenblatt is the founder and managing partner of a private investment firm called Gotham Capital. Since its inception in 1985, Gotham, with Greenblatt at the helm, has compiled one of the most astounding track records in the history of investing. He's earned annualized returns of 40% since 1985.That's a truly ridiculous track record. Basically, a $10,000 investment in 1985 comes back as nearly $12 million by the end of 2004!Greenblatt is one of the all-time greats, even though, strangely, he is not all that well known among casual investors. Certainly, his fame is nowhere near Warren Buffett's or Peter Lynch's. Yet his record speaks for itself. Clearly, here is a man worth listening to.He's already written a good book on investing titled You Can Be a Stock Market Genius. Despite its clownish title, this was an important contribution to the investment literature, as it dealt with special situations - such as spinoffs - and showed how and why such investments often worked out. It fleshed out, and brought to a wider audience, a set of strategic options previously known only to Wall Street insiders and certain enthusiasts.Well, Greenblatt has done it again. In The Little Book That Beats the Market, Greenblatt divulges his own magic formula - a strategy that has, over the last 17 years, returned 30.8%, versus 12.4% for the S&P; 500.The basic goal of Greenblatt's screen is to find good companies at bargain prices. To do that, Greenblatt relies on two basic ideas - both concepts used by value- minded investors for decades. Greenblatt puts his screen to the thousands of stocks on the market today and ranks them, highest to lowest.As Greenblatt writes, \\"If you stick to buying good companies (ones that have a high return on capital) and to buying those companies only at bargain prices (at prices that give you a high earnings yield), you can end up systematically buying many of the good companies that crazy Mr. Market has decided to literally give away.\\" This is a remarkable result. Greenblatt has added yet another tool to the investor's tool kit.It requires patience to stick with Greenblatt's idea, something else the average investor doesn't have a lot of - and that's being charitable. As Greenblatt readily noted, the magic formula doesn't work every year. There are times when it will lag the market. But this is a good thing, in a way, because such underperformance will tax most investors' patience and they will abandon the formula before it really has a chance to work its magic.Review by a writer for Agora Financial, publisher of economic and financial analysis includingFinancial Reckoning Day Fallout: Surviving Today's Global Depression,The New Empire of Debt: The Rise and Fall of an Epic Financial Bubble, andI.O.U.S.A.: One Nation. Under Stress. In Debt."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"1. The best equation is buying good companies with high rates of return on the capital and high earnings yields.2. Margin of safety assumes the investor can not know the future; therefore, the best opportunity is to buy the stock of a good company, at discount. The optimum discount pricing for buying is near or below liquidation price. Graham identified prices at this level, as, \\"unreasonable prices\\". Most, investors shy away from seizing the opportunity at discount prices fearing greater valuation losses due to some undiscovered information, they are not aware.3. Buying stock is equivalent to owning a percentage of the company. Knowing the value of the company and having confidence the future value of the company will appreciate validates the buying price of the stock. Otherwise, he will invest his money into bonds and gain a fixed interest income.4. Investors have a hard time at making predictions. For some time after the great depression stock investment was considered risky.5. Suppose, you own a company and that company is making a profit. The business valuations are known and you decide to sale part of the company as stock. The stock price can be easily computed. The stock price is equal to the business valuation divided by the number of stock. The stock price, at this point is deterministic. The company continues to operate and report profits. The profits are reflected on the income statement. However, the price of the stock fluctuates randomly away from the price too earnings, it initially started. The price swings vary, at times people are paying out outrageous price; and at other times missing bargain prices. But should you care that the price is fluctuation wildly? No. You don't care, about the causes, for the price fluctuation, only that price fluctuated!6. You want to know the valuation of the business and using this valuation will predict the stock's value and support price to buy and sale. Buying high earning stock at bargain price allows you to earn income from dividend payments with relative without price dropping out.7. The equation equals buying stocks with high earnings and high return on capital; these stocks come from good companies and are bargain priced.8. How do we choose good companies at bargain prices? Find 30 stocks with the equation criteria for your portfolio. In one case study, the stocks performed 30% returns for 17 years. Choose companies through a ranking system. Companies with high rates of return on the capital and high earnings yields are ranked highest. Companies with good brand name can perform against competitors, who want a portion of the profits. Companies with a high return on capital are likely to achieve an advantage of kind. Eliminate companies that earn ordinary or poor returns on capital. Readjust your portfolio every three years according to rank. The equation works better than market averages and did not lose money. Don't buy and sell short term because the chances are high that you will lose, instead, invest long-term. Do be afraid of losing clients during short term drops in the valuation of the portfolio, instead, have confidence the equation will work long term.9. If we know how a group of stock high earnings and high capital returns perform on the average, we gain greater confidence of how they will perform in the future. However, short term price fluctuation will not reveal any future pattern. You will have to be patient. The equation is a long-term performer and eventually outperforms the competition significantly. The equation will work in the long-term.10. Look for companies you believe will be able to continue in business for many years and companies that should be able to grow their earnings over time."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I really like the simplicity of the formula. For someone who invests and believes in the value approach this book makes sense. There are some good valuations used for buying undervalued stocks. But queezy isnt even the word I could use about using last years #s for future earnings. That just screems yikes!Also, I didnt like the fact he has a website that just spits out companies without showing the rankings OR how the company got on the list in the first place! I cross referenced some of his stocks on the list to inputting the companies #'s in his formula (the formula used in the Appendix ... which I really do like IF you know where to find the info on the Balance Sheet and Income Statements) and they werent even close!!But as for the formula itself I personally believe its worthy enough to at least consider. Unfortunately, its going to take a good 5 years for me to update this review. But as for now I would trust it only as far as how much money you are willing to invest into \\"speculating\\" and even then do your own calculations instead of blindly going by the website. BUT if you insist on taking someone elses word instead of doing your own homework I would almost insist that you use S&P;'s 5 star. It has a proven (emphasis on that word) track record of beating the average.***UPDATE 12/13/09********First off I still do not like the idea of his spitting out companies on his website.I have been investing for about 10 years. I have always been a value investor and while I dont follow this book exactly I have begun to incorporate its basic formula into part of my existing investing strategy formula and I must say I feel very confident in adding them. With any luck maybe some of you will read my book in 20 years or so. :DI have expanded on this basic idea to include bank and utilities if I see the value in them. Why limit yourself to just fields outside of utilities and financials after all? I also dont like the 1 year rule so kept the original golden rule of 50% or 2 years whatever comes first.So I have bumped this from 3 stars to 4. I would give it 5 but I feel its restrictive in what you can invest in and sorry but I gotta dock him for the website as well."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and started tracking 24 recommended stocks in February. The formula was working quite well until August when it lost all gains and some of the principal but I have confidence that this basket of stocks will rebound by year's end."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Many have criticized this book as being simplistic. And it is. That's because it's really a very simple concept that has been around for a while. That is, that buying a basket of undervalued stocks will provide better returns than the market average. The system presented here is just a refinement of the low P/E approach that has been tested in many studies and that has been proven to work.I believe the reason it is presented in such a simplistic manner is that it's meant to be accessible to novice investors and people who simply want to earn higher returns than an index fund without having to invest a lot of time and effort into it. Though that's not to say that more experienced investors won't benefit from reading it also.Another criticism is that the author stresses that you must have faith in the method to be successful. Some have misrepresented this to suggest that you are asked to blindly believe in the method. This is far from the truth. There is plenty of data presented and nothing about this method conflicts with common sense or with other studies. What the author is saying is that you need to fully accept and understand the rationale of the method and not be shaken by periods of under-performance."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"\\"The Little Book that Beats the Market\\" by Joel Greenblatt is a humorous book for individual investors, that talks about a simple, value-based and scientific way to buy and sell stocks. The author discusses a magic formula that he claims has enabled him to average 40% returns over 20 years. This formula ranks stocks by combining the best result of two numbers: Return on Capital and Earnings Yield (inverse of the more popular P/E ratio).Furthermore, the author provides a link to his site, where buyers of the book can easily scout for stocks using the magic formula and he suggests that investors can make money using his formula, as long as they follow a couple of simple rules like holding on to a stock for exactly 1 year (no more and no less) and staying away from foreign stocks.This book is a casual read - in fact, the author wrote it so one can read it in bed and/or to their kids. After every chapter (there are 13 of them), he bullet-points a summary of what was discussed. The material and depth in this book is just as simple as the style of writing. Often times, it over simplifies things and tries to convince the reader that this method of investing works, but over a period of time.Personally, I liked the book. I tend to stay away from books and prefer magazines and publications for their current information, but I could not stop myself from reading this book quickly and eagerly. It is exciting, a little insightful and educational to say the least and the author managed to drive his point home. Many readers will find it ordinary, and read it with skepticism (as they should), but in the end, it gives you a valuable tool to mine for stocks. At the end of the day, thats what I like!-- Faisal LaljeeFor more reviews and information, please visit http://StocksandBlogs.com"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This book provided me with a good read in under an hour (yes!, you can finish the book in half an hour, but I'm a slow reader). Joel writes with great concision and he manages to get his message across clearly despite his humour, which admittedly, can be corny at times.Fundamentally, I think the book stands solidly as an investment guide since his argument to use the Magic Formula is predicated on empirically tested data which he & his team have validated. If you're a beginning investor or someone unfamiliar with financial fundamentals, this book is serves as an excellent primer. The reason I'm unable to give this book 5 stars is b/c executing his magic formula is much more difficult than he makes it out to be. One of the most understated points in this book is the diversification element. If one were to 'blindly' follow his screen without diversifying, one could potentially walk into an investment nightmare.One of the stocks that were recommended from his site using this formula is Pinnacle Airlines, a regional carrier. While the fundamental financials of Pinnacle look appealing, if you didn't do the research to know that the company's entire business is threatened by its sole customer contract with Northwest Airlines, who is currently in bankruptcy, you might make the mistake of putting a significant amount of money into an otherwise uncertain business. I think Joel should have really stressed the diversification element further to give readers a sense for the uncertainty in following his formulas. Additionally, while the overall returns from the portfolios might yield 20.0%+ returns, I'm betting that a large portion of those returns were captured by only a handful of stocks, while the rest performed in line or worse than the overall market - again, an explanation of diversification would help here.In fairness, he does indicate that the methodology requires an investment in 20-30 stocks, but he doesn't explain why this is so important. Clearly, doing so would detract from the importance of the magic formula, but the explanation of diversification is truly needed, esp. for ppl who are unfamiliar with modern portfolio theory."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Whether or not this book's \\"magic formula\\" delivers the results that author Joel Greenblatt promises, the book itself presents a lucid, simple explanation of investing in the stock market. Unlike many who write about investing in stocks and offer formulas for success, Greenblatt is remarkably honest in his discussion of the difficulty of beating the market and remarkably modest in his claims (although perhaps not quite as restrained in referring to his Web site). We find that the chief merit of this bestseller is not its formula for success (which derives from guru Benjamin Graham's value approach), but rather its clear, step-by-step introduction to the fundamentals of investing for novices. The author makes the market understandable to a child. That is quite an achievement."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This books greatest insight is not that it gives the formula to rank companies but that it gives a simple investment philosophy. The heart of the little book is that you stick with this philosophy over a long time horizon. The book does not promise short term gains (i.e. gains within 3 years), what it does is explain why the philosophy will work in the long term and gives evidence that can be confirmed by independent sources (some articles on the web have confirmed his findings). The biggest flaw of the book is that it does not give a real world example of how to calculate the earnings yield and return on capital and since these values are not based purely from values on a financial statement the independent investor will be stuck with his Greenblatt's website to find companies; the website is free for now."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Some investors, like Warren Buffet, have been able to overcome their emotional bias and consistently outperform everyone else. Not me.I concluded long ago that the only way to take emotion out of my 401(K) and IRA investment decisions was to stop trying to beat the stock market. So I invested everything in a stock market index fund, which ensures that my returns will at least equal the market's. This was the only way I could take my emotions out of the equation. With this approach, I couldn't chase hot stocks, trade excessively, or sell at the wrong time. The problem with this method is that it is boring and emotionally unsatisfying (see, those psychologists were right; my emotions trump rational investment judgment every time).Then I found a small book that presented me with a sensible alternative. The Little Book that Beats the Market by Joel Greenblatt lays out a systematic, logical formula that uses common sense in combination with a stock's price-to-earnings ratio and return on capital. He even has a web site that does the calculations automatically. Although initially skeptical of the book's claims, I was reassured when my nephew (he's a mathematical wizard and PhD candidate) could find nothing wrong with the book's methods or conclusions.The experts say that people hate to lose more than they like to win. This fear of regret causes us to hold on to losers too long and sell winners too early. We tend to hold on to losing investments hoping that they will come back. The contrary is true of winning stocks. Fearing a downturn and wanting to lock in profits, we tend to sell stocks or funds too early and miss out on future gains.So what I'm going to do is take a little bit of my retirement savings out of that boring index fund and invest in a few stocks using Mr. Greenblatt's formula. I figure that utilizing this trading strategy will get my emotions under control so that I can concentrate on more important things, like cheering the White Sox on to another championship."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I started following the value investing techniques promoted in this book a year ago and my portfolio so far is far trailing the market index. My negative experience aside, the book is a big disappointment, because the dozen or so chapters have little to do with how you can beat the market. Instead, some instructions, which direct you to his website, are left in the back pages. The main text is simply the author's attempt at writing a poorly written fairy tale. My other beef is the \\"real-world\\" results in the book aren't real trading results, but simulated numbers. As people with trading experience know, such results usually do not hold up at all in real-life trading, when you put real money (esp. your own money) on the line.BTW, Greenblatt didn't make his 40% annual returns using this value investing approach preached in this book. Reports indicate he made money doing what hedge fund pros call \\"special situations\\" investing, which is discussed in his other book but is much harder (almost impossible?) for small investors to follow."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Joel Greenblatt's book is the kind of information that the scientific world and the practitioner as well are looking for for. In the more often than not irrational world of the stockmarket governed by 100 something parameters here we have a master that distilles (the)two essential parameters out of the balance sheets and proves their value over time. To use EBIT/NTA and EBIT/EV as a measure to rank stocks was such a compelling idea that I did this immediately with my 50+ stockportfolio on a spreadsheet. That created some surprises for me and helped me to understand why some stock are doing better than others. A neat method to make you supicious about possible losers. If I buy new stock, I now have a better handle to select those that will likely improve the pool incrementally.As a starting point Joel listed a selection of stock on his website, that fit the magic formula.The book is so nicely written, that I continued with Joel G's other \\"You can be a Genius in the Stockmarket\\", another impressive document of his street smartness.

Part two: EBIT/Enterprise Value;Enterprise Value is: Market Capitalization + Preferred Stock + Outstanding Debt-Cash-Cash Equivalents.;Current Assets are Assets you use in a year(mainly Cash); Current Liabilities are what you gotta pay off in a year; Fixed Assets are \\"Hard\\" Assets that you use to help run your business; Accumulated Depretiation is the rate of wear and tear of your machines.3.

But really, though a sophisticate might criticize this book for its simplicity and commonsensical approach to investing, it must be praised for the one key thing it *doesn't* do--which is to say, it doesn't advocate any wild, unsubstantiated, supposedly proprietary schemes for amassing an overnight fortune. And I say that as someone who has devoted a large portion of the past three years to investigating the genre, and the self-help industry as a whole.Thus, yes, this book may be little more than a primer, but many of us eventually learn--at the worst possible moment--that we're surprisingly naive in matters of finance, and could use a dose of unadorned clarity like that presented by Greenblatt.

Many readers are enjoying it because(1) he gives very simple explanations on how to evaluate a company that is currently underpriced (via calculating earnings yield and return on assets) and(2) he appears to be making a stock selection system easy-to-use by providing a website that uses his \\"magic formula\\". (Of course, if you can purchase anything lower than its real value you should be able to make money.) Everyone wants the \\"magic formula\\" that will make us rich, like everyone would like to win the lottery.But unless you are a math person who can decipher and calculate his \\"real\\" two factors (given on page 138) and you can afford his database (which other reviewers say cost $70,000 a year) you have to go to his website for his daily stock selections.Now some reviewers say this is a gifthorse. It may be a Trojan horse. Why? Well, if lots of people go to the website for the same stocks, the stock prices will rapidly change, making the earnings yield factor change. So the FIRST investors on his site get the benefit of the lower price. Like Martha Stewart, the first to know will benefit; others lose out. So you gotta know your stuff if you are an individual investor, and be careful to buy at the price at which the magic formula recommends you buy.Secondly, anyone who wants to altruistically share their investing secrets should give enough information so that these results can be tested by others, i.e. identify the database and how it was used, such that others can test and reaffirm his results. As some quantitative reviewers have pointed out, his results are not easily duplicable. So if the experts can't duplicate the results, should the normal investor just blindly accept them?Now why did Greenblatt write the book? Is it just a customer-paid enticement to go to his website, where, either through later charging for services, front-running his website investors, or through selling ads, he makes money?Or is he truly an altruist? After all, he does suggest some good ways to charitably invest the grand earnings you are going to make, such as in our school system (pp.128-130), and his comments are very astute there.Altruist or wiley salesperson? I don't know. But I do know that few things in life are free, and Greenblatt's apparent history of desiring to make a lot of money does not make me think he has suddenly turned into Gandhi.I have to hand it to him, though. He certainly has made a stir ! So buy the book and assess for yourself..heck, it's only about 10 bucks!"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"What would you say if I told you that an author had released a book claiming that he had discovered a two-step formula that would absolutely trounce the stock market?Would you laugh? Probably. You might even say &#34;It can't possibly be that easy!&#34; And the thing is, normally, you'd be right. There are so many books and services selling the snake oil of easy stock market wealth that you'd be wise to ignore them.And that should be that. Except ... except that unlike the Wade Cooks of the world, the author happens to be an investor whose fund has grown at a compound rate of 40% over the last two decades. That's the equivalent of turning $1 into $800. Not even Warren Buffett has achieved that over any 20-year period (though Berkshire Hathaway has averaged a still-bodacious 22% over its history). Not only that, but this book is based on the same core values that the author has used to seek out stocks during his investing career.So Joel Greenblatt's new book, The Little Book That Beats the Market, is better than your run-of-the-mill &#34;get rich quick&#34; entry. Were that the extent of its utility, I wouldn't be wasting your time. Instead, this is a book that should be read by anyone serious about investing. And the shocking thing is, unlike the hard-to-grasp intricacies of the Benjamin Graham value-investing classics, this is a quick, entertaining read.Greenblatt's goal was to write a book that would describe to his young children what he does for a living. Basically, his investing methods are based upon two elements: pre-tax earnings yield (the percent of the stock's price that comprises current earnings) and return on capital. Shove every company above a certain size into the transmogrifier, and it generates a list ranking companies on the combination of those attributes. Investing in the top 30 companies on these lists each year has generated an average annual return of 30.8% over the last 17 years.Of course, here is where you say exactly what I said when I first read the book. &#34;But this is data-mining, right?&#34; It's pretty easy to go back in time and try a bunch of various elements until you show one that offers awesome returns, including things like investing each year on April 22 in the top 77 stocks that don't have 'e' in their names. And you'd be right, except for two things. First, and foremost, these are the only two elements that Greenblatt tried. Second, the two data points used are imminently defensible as reasonable measurements for potential investments: How much do they make? And how much do they cost?As Greenblatt notes in the book, one of the great things about the formula is that occasionally it doesn't work.Oh, you want me to explain why that could possibly be good? Well, one of the most hallowed truths in investing is that something that works all of the time will immediately be rendered neutral by the market. A company cannot be priced at $1 per share while earning $17. Not for long. For those who might think that Greenblatt immediately renders his magic forumla useless by writing about it, take heart. In an age of attention spans measured in seconds rather than years, the formula's occasional failure means that many investors won't stick with it."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This is a great book to read. Greenblatt has a great sense of humor (uncommon on this type of book) and knows how to teach concepts in a simple and entertaining matter.

I don't care if you're a beginner or a pro: you're going to love this book."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This book contains a tested systematic approach to stock market investing that most people can implement on their own.As I write this review, there are already 266 reviews of Joel Greenblatt's \\"The Little Book...\\" on Amazon. Why bother? One reason is that since first published in 2005, Greenblatt's investment accomplishments have become even more widely appreciated, giving added credibility to his advice. For example, he is featured as one of the \\"Hedge Fund Market Wizards\\" in Jack Schwager's recently published book of the same nameHedge Fund Market Wizards(please see my review of that book). Additionally, at present returns on traditional savings accounts are very close to zero and the US Treasury Note yields a mere 1.7 percent. Any of us who envisioned living in retirement from the interest on our savings were sadly mistaken. Greenblatt's investment system as presented in this book may be one of very few, or the only, approach that is likely to generate low-risk investment results that might really help savers and seniors meet their previous expectations.The writing style is clear and simple. The author explains investment terms like return on capital and earnings yield in a conversational tone without condescention. He uses a couple of example fantasy businesses in an entertaining manner to illustrate the concepts. As the book progresses, he uses these basic examples as the foundation for more advanced concepts (not complex, but necessary). Necessary for what? For the reader to believe in the investment system that Greenblatt presents in the book to a degree that the reader will stick to the system without variance for a period of years in order to enjoy the benefits that accrue to long-term investors (think Buffett, Rogers, Graham, Bogle, Templeton).I urge you to read the book review by \\"Value Investor\\" on these pages. He lays out the reasons why this system is very likely to perform well over a period of years. In a nutshell, it is likely to work because the author has done extensive testing of the system, uses it as the basis for his own hedge fund's portfolio management, and because it takes considerable patience and fortitude to follow (traits not found in excess on Wall Street).One aspect that I really appreciate is the author's willingness to concede that many investors want a higher degree of involvement in selecting the stocks for their portfolios. They may be uncomfortable following a more mechanical system. He addresses this issue by giving clear guidance on how one may still follow the system even with the addition of an element of personal discretion, depending on the investor's level of expertise, time commitment and available capital.Finally, the author maintains a free website (now for 7+ years) to aid investors with portfolio selection. This is a high value service in my opinion.I highly recommend this book to any saver or investor, or speculator or trader for that matter, who wishes to increase their returns on investment and improve their overall portfolio performance. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Simple, clear, and entertaining explanation of the key points of value investing.

This book explains the 'value philosophy' wonderfully. It is easy to read and does not require prior knowledge except for common sense about business.I have deducted a star in its rating because the book is quite repetitive (even though it is short), and it was originally written for the author's children so the language is also rather playful.I would recommend this book to beginners as well as experienced investors. If you're a beginner then starting with this book is a really good idea and then move on to read Warren Buffett's letters to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Phil Fisher's 'Common stocks and uncommon profits', and if you're really dedicated then Ben Graham's 'Security Analysis'.PS: This review is for the 2006 edition."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"For the average, small fry investor, this is the best investing book since the Intelligent Investor. It is one of the only books that gives you a quantifiable and systematic way of evaluating the quality and price of a company, and it then also teaches you how to manage your portfolio in a way that, while not avoiding volatility, significantly lowers the odds of your blowing yourself up. In some respects, the book is even better than the Intelligent Investor, since the writing is clearer and it goes straight to the heart of what people want to learn when reading a book from a professional investor: how do we make money in stocks?At times, the examples and writing seem almost childish, but this is done to make the average reader feel comfortable with the subject matter. Despite the occasionally simplistic language, the lessons in this book are profound for small, retail investors looking to do significantly better than average in stocks."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Well worth a read and a good start for the beginning or intermediate investor who wants to beat the market over time."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Well, most of the time the strategy presented in this little book will beat the market according to the author, Joel Greenblatt. We found this book to be a very easy read with an easy to understand concept for individual stock investing. At times the author practically apologizes for the simplicity of the strategy, which is really not necessary. Although, with an abundance of highly complicated books and strategies on the market it is understandable why these apologies were made and equally refreshing to read a book that is so straightforward and takes investors back to the basics of stock picking. In spite of the fact that it is a few years old, this book is a must read for anyone who is now utilizing or is considering utilizing individual stocks in his investment portfolio. The author's \\"magic formula\\" for investing removes all of the emotion from picking stocks for a portfolio, which makes it perfect for people who don't believe in hunches.

For beginners, following the strategy outlined in the book should offer excellent investment returns.For more experienced investors, the \\"Magic Formula\\" makes a great initial screen. Using the \\"Magic Formula\\" results, you have a list of promising investments to research.

With that being said, The Little Book That Beat the Market is the first book I have felt compelled to review on Amazon (of course, I am not really going out on a limb recommending a book that legendary investor Michael Price describes as \\"One of the most important investment books of the last 50 years.\\")Professor Greenblatt's first book, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius, is widely regarded as the seminal text on special situations investing and the strategies contained in the book are employed by multiple hedge funds and investment professional. While I recommend Stock Market Genius to anyone who has the time and desire to analyze stocks in detail (at least 3 hours a week) I highly recommend The Little Book That Beat the Market to ALL investors of ALL ages and to ANYONE who wants to understand how businesses create value.The beauty of the Little Book is a follows:1) It is simple2) It works3) Most investment professionals cannot follow the Little Book's strategy and that makes this strategy one of the only instances where small investors have a HUGE advantage over professionals.4) The people who have recommended this book are some of the most successful investors in the history of Wall Street (myself excluded, maybe someday!)1) It is SimpleWhile some of the reviews on Amazon have argued that the Little Book is too simply, I completely disagree. The reason this book is great is that it takes a very complicated subject matter (investment success) and makes it simple and easy to understand. Bottom line, I don't really care if something is difficult or easy, if I can use it to make money I like it. The fact that the Little Book works AND it is easy, is really the best of both worlds.2) It WorksThe actual results of the Little Book describe in the book are astonishing. While I agree with others that reproducing the exact results of Professor Greenblatt's study is difficult for non-professionals, using Compustats real-time database gets remarkably close to the results described in the book and detailed on his web site.However, what I find to be more valuable than the results themselves is Professor Greenblatt's explanation on why the formula works. Yes, everyone wants to buy cheap stocks but understanding how to distinguish between which cheap stocks are just cheap and which are good businesses worth owning is critical to investment success. While these concepts might not be entirely new (Warren Buffett writes about them annually), never before have I seen them described so completely and simply in one place.3) Most Professionals Can't Follow StrategyMost investors (especially hedge funds) are monitored closely on yearly, quarterly and monthly performance. For a hedge fund, having stable monthly numbers is considered critical to attracting new capital and preventing redemptions. Despite the fact that the Magic Formula has excellent long-term performance (30% annually over 17 years) the monthly volatility (down 5 out of every 12 months on average) makes it impossible for most hedge funds and professional investors to follow strictly without fear of investor redemptions. As a hedge fund manager I plan on incorporating the concepts of the Little Book into my investing but I am establishing a fund for my children that will invest strictly based on Professor Greenblatt's Magic Formula.4) Recommended by Highly Successful InvestorsAs I stated above, I am not really putting myself out on a limb recommending a book written by Professor Greenblatt (his 20 year track record of 40% annual returns speaks for itself) and endorsed by Michael Price, Andrew Tobias, Professor Bruce Greenwald, Michael Steinhardt, the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times.With that being said, I highly recommend The Little Book that Beat the Market and believe it is a great read for anyone interested in investing and business. FYI, other investing books I highly recommend are The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America edited by Lawrence Cunningham; The Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Graham; Margin of Safety by Seth A. Klarman; Value Investing with the Masters by Kirk Kazanjian and Money Ball by Michael Lewis."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Joel Greenblatt's Little Book That Beats the Market (John Wiley, just released; $19.95), offers what the author says is a \\"magic formula\\" for success in the stock market. Such a phrase may arouse your skepticism, as it did mine, but let's look into the claim.Joel Greenblatt founded and is a managing partner of Gotham Capital, a hedge fund that, according to reports, achieved a 50% annualized return [before payment of an incentive allocation] during the ten years (1985-1995) that it was open to outside investors. This kind of record certainly merits attention. Greenblatt, it's safe to say, has gotten rich.Greenblatt's formula is based on only two measures: earnings yield and return on capital. These numbers are not hard to obtain. Greenblatt defines earnings yield as EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) divided by enterprise value. Enterprise value equals a company's stock market capitalization plus debt plus preferred shares minus cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Return on capital he defines as EBIT divided by the sum of net fixed assets (total assets minus depreciation to date) plus net working capital (current assets minus current liabilities).One weakness of Greenblatt's presentation is the use of earnings as a measure. I prefer to look at a company's free cash flow (after subtraction of capital expenditures) rather than EBIT. Earnings are susceptible to a greater degree of manipulation than cash flow.Second, the book does little to elucidate the qualitative measures that go into Greenblatt's investment process. Which businesses have a sustainable advantage? How do you identify growth? On the other hand, Greenblatt lays out a testable hypothesis--a real merit.If you are interested in pursuing Greenblatt's idea's further, I recommend you visit his Website on MagicFormulaInvesting. At that site, you define a minimum capitalization size and a target number of stocks for your portfolio. The magic formula spits out a suggested investment set. A good number of the selections at present are in the areas of pharmaceuticals and technology.Greenblatt presents some impressive numbers illustrating the back-tested historical results of his approach. These are, as the saying goes, no guarantee of future performance. The more money that follows Greenblatt's approach, the less it will return, over time. However, since Greenblatt's approach has a rational basis, you might also see a more rational allocation of capital to investments, which could reduce their volatility. By the same token, one rarely sees bargains anymore of the sort that Benjamin Graham outlined in Security Analysis (1st ed., 1934)--whereby companies could be bought for less than their net current assets--and the market is better for it. In that sense, financial theory is right in predicating that there is no \\"money machine\\" that markets--that is to say, competing investors--will not seek to arbitrage away.(The author of this review, Andy Szabo, is founder of MindBodyForce.com)"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I won't repeat what other reviewers have said. This book is a quick read, with a breezy tone, and in some simple ways helps to explain value investing, but...A few problems that the author dismisses without any discussion.1. Backtesting. Most backtested stock market systems don't work in the forward direction for very long. A good example is the Motley Fool's Foolish Four model, based on the Dow Dividend model. Backtested it looked great! But when a large number of people started to follow the model, it's performance approached mediocre. This makes sense. Wall Street is nothing but efficient. Any strategy that works will quickly be copied by tens of thousands of players, and this can quickly ruin a system. That's why hedge funds that use \\"black box\\" models don't publish the models.And since Greenblatt tells the reader that the system only works over a three year period, it would be at least three years before one could tell the system wasn't working.I would predict that the system will produce diminishing returns over the next ten years, proportionate to how many copies of the book that the author sells. Ironic that the richer that Greenblatt gets, the poorer his followers will get.2. Trading costs: Greenblatt completely ignores trading costs and taxes in his analysis. If you follow his advice and buy 30 stocks, you would pay $779 in round-trip commissions at E-trade (or $600 if you had more than $50,000). That's about 1.5% a year in trading costs on $50,000 invested, or about 3% a year on $25,000. Or almost 8% on $10,000! That's a big expense drag, especially if the system doesn't outperform by as much as it claims to.And taxes. If you do this strategy in a taxable account, you would incur another 15% to 25% hit in the form of capital gains taxes and state taxes, depending where you live. Thus the cost of the strategy could add up to as much as 33% a year in a state like New York or California. Again, very hard to make money this way, unless the strategy beats the market by 100% as it claims. (Of course, in a tax-deferred retirement account, this would not be a problem.)The alternative, investing and holding a diversified by asset type group of index funds, would have a yearly cost of less than 0.3 % a year, and would generate little or no taxes until sold many years later.3. Being hostage to his website, which is carefully labeled \\"free for now.\\" Because his formulas don't translate well to free financial sites, the user of this system will have to depend on the generosity and fairness of the author. What if you start to use them system, and two years from now the site becomes an expensive pay site? That just adds another expense, and each expense becomes a drag on performance.4. Dubious endorsements. So what if the publishers got rave reviews from famous investors? This doesn't mean that the book has any merit. I'd like to ask each of those investors if they plan on replacing their own investing style with the author's system.5. No analysis of risk-adjusted returns. A basic principle of investing is that you get paid for risk taken. Thus small stocks, which are riskier, tend to return more over time. Riskless assets such as treasury bill will tend to yield low returns.I'd like to see risk-adjusted performance data. For instance, what is the Sharpe ratio of the stocks picked by his system? What are the standard deviations? What are the beta's? If the system really is good, then it should look good on a risk-adjusted basis. The interested reader might want to take a look at William Bernstein's excellent The Four Pillars of Investing : Lessons for Building a Winning Portfolio if they want a thorough understanding of risk and return.I'd also like to see a better attitude from Mr. Greenblatt on his website. Amazon reviewers are a serious, thoughtful group for the most part, and perhaps responding to some of the issues raised in an open way would help readers and potential readers of his book to understand it better.I guess I'd like to conclude by reminding everyone of the standard investment disclaimer...\\"Past performance does not guarantee future performance in any way.\\""},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"After reading all the reviews here that span the entire range from totally worthless to the best investment book ever written, I felt compelled to add this. I work on my own investments full time, have read over 25 related books including the classics, and always felt there was still a big void where the average investor was concerned... the one targeted by what I feel are unscrupulous marketing campaigns to separate them from their money. As one example, David Swensen, the Yale Chief Investment Officer in charge of the Yale endowment, recently wrote: \\"The mutual-fund industry sits at the center of a massive market failure. The asymmetry between sophisticated institutional providers of investment management services and unsophisticated individual consumers results in a monumental transfer of wealth from individual to institution.\\"Greenblatt is a very experienced and successful long-term investor who knows what he is doing in this profession. He did not write this book for his peers. If you are managing money, you have your own methods, and if successful you are not about to change them. That's not Greenblatt's intent. His intent is clearly to try to brush away some of the excessive complexity and confusion and outright fraud that has been foisted on the general investing public ever since Modern Finance rose to prominence and investment firms' marketing departments, not their investment results, became their sales drivers.What Greenblatt has accomplished in just over 100 pages is:1) An understandable explanation of what one useful way to identify a quality business is (ROIC)2) An easy way to identify how to buy such a company at a good price3) How to manage a real portfolio with this strategy4) How to remove emotion and poor judgment from the investor's actions5) A short introduction to the statistical historical performance of this strategy, mentioning the typical pitfalls of data mining and backtesting and how he avoided themNone of these topics, especially the more technical ones, are treated in such detail that the intended reader would be confused or turned off by it. This could certainly be seen as a negative for some (but a positive for most, I would venture). It might be better to have these in gory detail in an appendix or on the web site. Here's hoping such information appears, and this is the only reason I did not give the book 5 stars.I would especially like to highlight the importance of 3) and 4) listed above. It's one thing to come up with a list of stock picks. It's entirely another thing to translate that to managing a portfolio where buy and sell decisions need to be made. Eliminating emotion and judgment (which, for most investors, are usually their biggest causes of failure) is a very important part of this strategy and is the reason behind buying all the stocks (no analysis allowed) and the strict one-year hold period. Sure, it would be great to let your winners run and losers be cut, but that introduces judgment, and most investors will fail if so.When reading these reviews, the reader should firmly keep in mind who the intended audience is. It's not the investing professional, not the quant, not the day trader. It's your average person of average intelligence who wants to do better at investing their assets than the other options that are practical for them (most of which are rather poor). This is the first book I have ever read that gives this average person the confidence to do that through specific methods that are easy to follow. I plan on giving a copy to at least half a dozen family members and encouraging them to use the method."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Whether or not you intend to invest in the market, Greenblatt's book is a great read -- easy to read with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor. If you do invest in the market, it's got some good ideas, but there is a problem that one other reviewer already noted with Greenblatt's Magic Formula. (I wanted to abbreviate it as MF hereafter, but realized that could have other connotations. So please forgive the repetition.)When I went to Greenblatt's web site and got a list of stocks that the Magic Formula indicates should have above average returns, 24 out of 25 had Returns on Invested Capital (ROIC) of >100%, and the other one had 75-100% listed. These seemed outrageous, even wrong, to me at first. And like the other reviewer, I wondered what was going on.Some thought and a conversation with a friend who is a (very good) retired CPA solved the mystery. Some industries, notably software, require very little capital, especially if they rent their equipment, space, etc. Their real capital (not counted in the Magic Formula) is their people. With very little monetary capital on their balance sheets, they can have a ROIC that is well over 100%. But that is not a good indicator of their ability to grow since their real capital, excellent people, are in limited supply.So the Magic Formula is biased toward industries like software that have low capital requirements, and away from heavy manufacturing industries with their high capital requirements. And during the period 1987-2004 that Greenblatt uses to verify the efficacy of the Magic Formula, software (and probably other service type industries that have low capital requirements) did much better than heavy manufacturing. This puts his comparison to market averages, like the S&P500; into question. If as I suspect, the Magic Formula had a significant bias toward certain industries, a better comparison would have been to a market average weighted according to industry, with the weights equal to the proportion of Greenblatt's portfolio in each industry.There also is a bias against companies that are viewed as growth companies since they will rank far down the list on earnings yield (basically the inverse of P/E) -- the second component of the Magic Formula. That doesn't seem to be much of a problem and may be one reason for the Magic Formula's success. It tends to pick contrarian stocks.This isn't to say that the Magic Formula won't work, just that the comparison to broad market averages is probably not a good indicator of how well it works. I may still use the Magic Formula to help me find stocks to consider investing in, but I think it may be dangerous to blindly trust the Magic Formula as the book suggests since low capital industries might underperform in the future."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"\\"Catablast\\" (Dec 4 2005 reviewer) didn't read the appendix. Greenblatt employs subtle, non-standard definitions for return on capital and earnings yield. For anyone seeking a better definition of intrinsic value, this is the interesting part.I skimmed quickly through the body of the book, and have been mulling over that appendix ever since. The book was worth the purchase price just for that.Greenblatt's associated stock screening website, mentioned in the book, has a few problems, but is still worth using.For example, in early January 2005, the site listed CBS Corporation as a good pick. However, their reported ROC and EY were way, way off. I wrote them to point this out. No reply, but CBS disappeared from the site less than a week later. During that time there was no change in the CBS price or financial information, so the only conclusion is that they realized the error.It was more an effort of omission than commission, most likely. Their list depends upon accurate information from Compustat. After a spinoff, particularly a reverse spinoff like CBS, data services like Compustat occasionally report inaccurately for a while. Garbage in, garbage out.This does not make the formula wrong. It means that, before investing, you should double-check the data upon which the formula's results are based."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"To make such claims of outperformance without verifiable proof is irresponsible. I was looking to backtest this strategy, but after reading the book and checking the website I am unable to back into either EBIT/EV (which should be very easy) or ROC (also very simple). There is simply not enough detail to match the calculations on the site (which is based on the book). They claim to be using Compustat's point in time database which I have access to. Are they using twelve month trailing numbers, projected numbers, most recent quarter, or something else? Perhaps there is a transform applied to the ratios, we just do not know. There are not answers to these questions in the book anywhere.Example:Take Callwave (CALL) today (12/12/05) which is on the sites list as being recommended today. CALL has a Earnings Yield of 16% as calculated by Greenblatt's site. The little book describes EV = Market Value of Equity Including preferred + Net interest bearing debt. Though most in the industry also subtract off cash, it turns out that I am unable to reproduce their numbers either way.Since CALL does not have debt or preferred stock or minority interest then EV should = Market Value = 104.64. To get an Earnings Yield of 16% EBIT must be 16.74.(If you subtract off cash EV = 104.64-61.9 = 42.74, so for a 16% EY EBIT must = 6.84)According to COMPUSTAT (period ending 9/05):Trailing 12 months EBIT = 8.5Most recent Quarterly EBIT = 1.8Most recent year-end EBIT = 9.5Added Notes: The book's web site [...] mentions this review. Instead of responding to this note why not just provide specific step by step calculations. Why not start with CALL and show us on your website which data items you use and the calculations. I would think this is in the interest of all, especially if this 'magic' formula is so easy. Then others like myself with equally high quality data can validate your results.Skip this one and read Benjamin Graham."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"The author has created a very simple factor model that only looks at two variables. Nothing wrong with that - in backtesting, simplicity is your friend. Unfortunately, it also makes it far easier for others to duplicate. Greenblatt sites the excellent work done by Robert Haugen in the area of factor modelling. Indeed, it was excellent, right up until he published it. Then it went to hell. And Haugen's work was far more difficult to replicate, but nonetheless lots of hedge funds did just that.Greenblatt says his model is different, though, because it isn't likely to be copied by the pros because the approach underperforms for extended periods of time. This is a nice try, but it won't stop most hedge funds. They will likely blend the strategy with other non-correlated approaches and thus create a smooth return pattern. Most managers know that any strategy worth persuing is going to have stale periods.He also says that the model is out of reach of many of the pros because it gets its best returns from stocks too small for the big boys to touch. In mutual fund terms, sure, but what will kill this are, again, the hedge funds, and there are lots and lots of small hedge funds that can easily buy stock with $100 million market caps.Sadly (from the money manager's point of view) we live in a more efficient world where backtests, particularly ones thrown out there in a catchy book, will prove to be mere phantoms.One other gripe: it would have been nice to see more data. We really don't get anything but annual returns. No examples of actual trades or stocks are given.I do applaud the author for using a writing style that demystifies. Much of the prose in this area is intentionally abstruse and wooden."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This fine little book is a significant contribution to the market philosophy known as Value Investing, but unlike other value investing books, Prof. Greenblatt offers readers a simple yet effective formula for finding good companies and great prices, he also demonstrates the 'most satisfactory' (as Ben Graham might have put it) historical returns that this 'magic formula' yielded over the last 17 years. His methodology is sound, to be sure, though one quibble here is that some of the stocks thrown back using his screen are clearly one-hit wonders: specialty pharamceutical companies whose future earnings are surely questionable.However, the beauty of Prof. Greenblatt's formula is that it can be scaled up or down in terms of diversification as a 'hedge against ignorance' (as Mr Buffett might say). While still relying upon the magic formula, more sophisticated investors can take a more active, focused approach to their 'magic' portfolio, screening out likely dogs while remaining true to the overall strategy. Contrariwise, less sophisticated investors are advised to diversify broadly to hedge against the dogs in their portfolios.The key to the approach, as with all value investing approaches, is time, time, time. Patience and discipline are the first virtues of value investing, and must be practiced with jesuitical commitment for this strategy to work. Buffett and Graham didn't make billions day trading, and neither will magic formula devotees. But you must be patient grasshoppers! Highly recommended read.(to underscore the importance of patience in this approach, I thought it interesting to note that only 2 of the top 50 cos on a Goldblatt's screen I ran were rated '2' or above for timeliness in the Valueline investment survey; and 27 of the 50 weren't rated at all, owing to the fact that they were microcaps.)"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"It's not that long of a book, ~150 pages. Make sure you read the whole thing though, including the appendix. I'm reading various reviews criticizing how Greenblatt ignores transaction fees and taxes, that his strategy is the same as Morningstar, and that this is merely backtesting. None of these are true. He addresses these issues clearly.1) For investors with little capital, to avoid piling up high transaction fees, use a broker with an annual or monthly flat trading fee, such as foliofn.com. Not to promote the site or anything (it was mentioned in the book), but $19.95/mo. or $199/yr. for unlimited window trades seems within reason for almost all investors.2) Effects of taxes are significantly reduced by employing Greenblatt's indicated method of selling losers 3 days before 1 year to maximize deductions and selling winners 3 days after 1 year to minimize capital gains taxes.It is important for everyone to consider the effects of taxes on investments, but to defend Greenblatt in his failure to write a \\"Complete Guide to Investment Taxes,\\" I'd say that was not the purpose of this book. The purpose was to endow on willing readers a basic understanding of value investing with clear, simple examples and provide a sample strategy that can actually be successfully employed.3) The measures that characterize degrees of bargain and quality/profitability for companies are beefed up in the Appendix and on the web site, maintaining the basic idea with a more accurate and applicable formula to today's publicly traded companies. So, P/E and ROIC, being somewhat overly simplistic, are not actually the measures used for their screening engine. Rather, the measures are expanded to include such factors as debt, assets, etc...4) You will have to take his word for it, but Greenblatt clearly states that the approach was devised from the ground-up, i.e. not from backtesting and data mining. In fact, he strongly condemns these practices throughout his book.Please read the book before writing reviews."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I normally wouldn't shell out $20 for such a small book, but I loved Greenblatt's \\"You Can Be A Stock Market Genius,\\" so I decided to give this one a go.\\"The Little Book\\" is a fast read. Most people will finish it in under two hours, and if you were to simply read the sections on the actual \\"magic formula,\\" it would take about 20 minutes. But this doesn't mean that it's bad info--on the contrary, sometimes the simplest techniques are the most effective, whether it be in investing or life in general. Grenblatt's strategy of focusing on cheap companies that are earning high returns on invested capital makes sense intuitively, and if his numbers are right, the hypothetical returns on his system are outrageously high. Perhaps the best part of this book is that the stocks it points out can be just a starting point for further investigation. I have certain things I like to see in stocks, and I like the idea of further screening the \\"magic formula\\" stocks based on my own parameters.The only reason why I gave this four stars instead of five is that the tone sometimes borders on patronizingly simplistic. While I recognize that Greenblatt wanted to write a book that a sixth grader could understand, that didn't necessarily mean that he had to write the book as though sixth graders were his target market. His style, which could probably best be termed \\"stream-of-kvetchingness,\\" was endearing at first but grew grating and patronizing as I progressed through the book.

Here is one such strategy that is simply presented and appears to have merit. Is it difficult? You will need discipline, patience, and capital. The corny title of this book reminds us that in an earlier book, YOU CAN BE A STOCK MARKET GENIUS (1997) Greenblatt gave an insightful look at achieving superior returns by investing in corporate spin-off stocks. Here Greenblatt takes on the entire market using a computer screen that ranks companies on the basis of their before tax earnings yield and their return on capital. Why these two measures? A company's earnings yield tells us if the earnings on a per share basis divided by the share price is a high or low percentage. High is better because it means we are getting more earnings for the price we are paying for the shares. Return on capital tells us if the company's investment in developing its business is justified by the percentage return they get on their investment. Again high is better. A combination of these two factors creates a powerful company. And over time powerful companies are usually good stocks.Earnings yield and return on capital percentages change continually. For this reason there are no stock lists in this book. Readers are invited to the author's website to run their own screen currently at no charge. It is a very easy screen to use and integral to my four star rating.Here are some concerns: Many investors will find it difficult to follow the author's recommendation to buy 20 to 30 individual stocks. This is especially true if they are diversifying their investments with bonds, REITS, or non-U.S. holdings. The recommended holding period for the portfolio is a year. Then the process begins again. Conventional wisdom (if there is such a thing) suggests that investors let their winners run - but not here. The strategy is long term not the portfolio. But a 100% turnover of the portfolio raises the issue of transaction costs (although a low, fee-based brokerage account might neatly resolve this). Greenblatt's computer screen may not offer the sector diversification most investors will want, so more information and selection criteria (hunches and guesses?) will be needed to produce the final portfolio. Utility and financial sectors appear to be excluded from the portfolio selection process for reasons that are a bit vague ( see pp. 136,138 ). Perhaps these sectors are too regulated to produce the kind of profits and growth being sought or maybe it is their policy of paying high dividends - distributing the gains - that makes them less appealing."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This great little book offers readers a simple formula (borrowed from Ben Graham) for finding good undervalued companies at great prices. As with all value investing approaches, one must have time, patience and discipline. Greenblatt repeatedly emphasizes the need to stick with his formula for an extended period of time, 3-5 years, because it will not be profitable every year. Over a 17 year period, average return was 30.8% annually (vs S&P; 500's 12.4%). The formula's worst year was a loss of 4%. According to Greenblat, most money managers do not want to take the risk of underperforming their peers and the possibility of short term underperformance will keep institutional investors away.The formula has 2 components: The company must have a high return on capital (ROIC, i.e. good company), and the stock must have a high earnings yield (E/P ratio, i.e. cheap stock). Investors are advised to diversify broadly (20-30 stocks) to hedge against the dogs in their portfolio. Every year, you are advised to sell winners just after one year and losers just before, to get the best tax rate. The formula's success relies on averages over time and over a large group of stocks. You get the magic formula companies from Greenblatt's web site, which is free at this time, or you can get from other online sources the numbers required to meet the formula. The editor of Kiplinger financial magazine has written favorably about this book. There was another favorable review in AAII magazine.Many of the recommended stocks are micro caps. Since I did not have any micro caps in my portfolio, I decided to put a small portion of my money (3% of my total portfolio) to test this stategy. I bought 5 stocks on 1/9/06 (EGY, JAKK, FORD, ISSC, CALL) and 7 stocks on 3/6/06 (KG, GBEL, INTX, IVII, LII, PNCL, PWEI).Update: On 5/9/06 bought PLAY, WLDA, VPHM, RAIL, WON, UNTD, KFY. On 7/9/06 bought SCC, ALDA, DLX, MTEX, ORCT, ELOS. On 9/19/16 bought ASPV, BVF, CVCO, WNR, LRW, OVTI. All stocks of equal dollar value. Total return as of 9/22/07 was 21% vs. 16% for the S&P.;Update 2: On 1/07 bought VRGY, CAW, CRYP EPIQ. On 3/07 bought FCX, FDG, LRCX, TCK, BBSI. On 5/07 bought BPT, GNI, FTO, IVAC, PPD, AVCI. On 7/07 bought DPZ, PBT, VALU, ICFI. On 9/07 bought VPHM, RDYN, USMO, FTD. On 10/07 bought PCU, AXCA, GIB, DLX.

In a relatively short space of time the author gives a solid background to the market and a common sense rule for picking stocks. While he emphasizes the need to have faith in the method and not to lose hope, it would seem that this is true of any method out there. The difference with this authors approach is that he has the track record to back up his approach. As he also implies in the book, the problem is not in applying the method, it is that we are all basically a lazy bunch who want to get rich with the least amount of effort.

He read this book and then forced me to read it as well. I am glad I did because it was easy to follow and made me excited about investing my money into avenues that will provide much higher yields that 5 to 8% a year.The author wrote this book for his middle school children to help them understand investing in the adult world so to speak- Well he did a phenomenal job and published it for the rest of us-A good pick for beginner investors or people who would like to invest their money in stocks and funds with little background in the field.

That book is the best on the subject of investing I've ever read, but this time around, Mr. Greenblatt finds his original aim and delivers a wonderful tome for the beginning investor. The early chapters of the book in which stocks and the market are explained with real-world examples (a kid who sells bubble gum at school) merit five stars, but the book loses some ground when it goes into the infamous Magic Formula that Mr. Greenblatt has concocted.

It provides a good introduction to value investing and is much easier to grasp than philosophies of Graham, Fisher, and Buffett. Consequently, it may be a bit too dumbed-down for some, but he plainly states who his audience is in the intro and book dustcover. If you have read \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" or Greenblatt's earlier book, you might want to just read the last 25 pages and you'll get all the real content. He appears to have done the research to prove his strategy works for both large and small cap stocks independent of biases usually attributed to proofs of such theories.Greenblatt uses his own version of the earnings yield and return on capital formulas, and excludes financial, utility, and ADR equity.

By reading the words \\"magic formula\\" they expected to see the holy grail... even after the author makes clear that there is no such thing.The words \\"magic formula\\" is simply a literary device to brilliantly explain some very simple principles in terms that even an 11yr old can understand and enjoy, but above all become interested enough to start getting financially educated at an early age and to apply it, and not only after hitting 50.Also, I cannot believe at all that the author is trying to promote his website; it's a ridiculous suggestion. The free service is there available, sure; to help. But anyone who understands even remotely the principles behind the \\"magic formula\\" can easily, more or less, replicate the exact same principles from many other free sources.Of course, some work will be required, and that too is what the author highlights: \\"There ain't no tooth fairy\\"! If you think there is, this book is not for you, as he 'reluctantly' explodes that myth. This is my first review ever; I read lots and I am a long time investor. But, this is a first investment book that has stirred me up to this level to recommend it so publicly: Not really for the benefit of the old hands, but for you to do your CHILDREN a favour (and so to yourself also), and get them to read this book or better yet, read it with them! Perhaps they'll start applying its principles by the time they are 15, so when they are 35 yrs old, they will be comfortable millionaires and will gladly look after you.

What he has to say is commonsense, something that is in pathetically short supply these days. Often times the simpler way to do things is the best. After studying the market for 20 years it is clear to me that the best approach for most investors is diversified indexing. I am willing to trust Mr. Greenblatt's approach with a small portion of my portfolio, which I will monitor for the next 2-3 years. His track record speaks for itself. Like indexing, this is an approach that does not need to be watched daily; all stocks are held for one year, give or take a couple business days."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"My husband is a savvy investor and found this book informative - he learned something new.He also bought one for a friend."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Easy read and a couple free websites to help you double check your investment strategies.

Strangely enough, the very first LINK under 'Business Headlines' is for Dollar Rent a Car. It is NOT a business story about Dollar Car Rental, but rather takes you directly to the Dollar Rent a Car website. So much for no ads.

With surplus funds in hand, opportunities often arise; wherein, good businesses may be purchased at steep discounts from their liquidation value.This book is excellent for a reader studying investments for the first time. The general rule in investment analysis is todo quality research. Quality research includes reading financialnewspapers, magazines, \\"The Economist\\" , television businessdocumentaries and obtaining financial statements from thecompanies you identify for investment purposes. Some peoplefind out quality information by joining an investment clubor doing internet research on Motley Fool.comGenerally speaking, the best ranked stocks will perform well. More details are on magicformula.com. Companies with the highest return on capital and the highest yield formulas work best, according to the author. As a general rule, never invest in astock on a \\"hot tip\\" or a call from a broker where you have nothad the chance to investigate the stock thoroughly. By the timea broker calls, the insiders have already driven the priceupward perhaps beyond the midpoint to a topping out.By the time you buy the stock at the closing price, the levelling out process has begun and the price may even dip to reflect asaturated demand .In my own experience, there are other ways to make moneyin the stock market.Way 1: This involves analyzing the stocks on Motley Fool. comThis website has the top 50 stocks ranked by rate ofreturn over recent time horizons.Way 2: Requires researching the top 5 or 10 mutual fundsin the past decade and investing in the funds withdouble digit returns. These funds are listed in theyearly almanacs.

The first is the use of the name \\"Magic Formula\\". So, what grade level is this written for? There are no magic formulas or we would all be rich. I find it difficult to tell how this Magic Formula differs substantially from Dogs of the Dow or from using P/E ratios or from any of numerous other such formulae.Second, the book makes a huge point of believing in the plan and remaining dedicated to it through thick and thin no matter what. You have to *believe* that you are going to win. You must remain committed even in the face of losses. Isn't that what compulsive gamblers do until they go broke? Faith in this formula will not necessarily make it work.Third, proving that the Magic Formula works by applying it to historical databases is suspect. Such proofs have been used many times in the past for various schemes. They usually have severe flaws in them such as leaving out companies that did not survive to the present.... companies that would have left you broke had you invested in them. You have to be very cautious with such proofs.Fourth, you *must* use the book's web site in order to make use of this hazy \\"magic formula\\". Right now it is free. But years down the road, while you are still being commited to your investment scheme, is a fee going to suddenly appear?It could be OK, but it just sounds fishy to me."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This book delivers on its promise to providing a magic formula for investing.

He approaches his audience not as 12 year olds, but as 8 year olds with learning disabilities and a corny sense of humor. His constant reference to his MAGIC FORMULA is incredibly annoying and misleading. It's not particularly magical, and there's nary a formula. And basing his entire case on 17 years worth of data analysis is pretty weak, too. There's a lot of hand-waving.But for all the belly-aching over the lack of rigorous specifics from other reviewers, rest assured Greenblatt's numerical analysis is actually right. After looking at Compustat and trying to replicate his results, I roughly got his numbers.Begrudgingly, I have to admit that for all the book's flaws with its childish approach and the expectation that we should take his numbers as given and its short-shrifted logic, Greenblatt's value-based approach to investing still shines through. He does a good job of emphasizing some hallmarks of value investing -- patience, discipline, and focusing on cheap assets. And his inappropriately named \\"magic formula\\" does highlight stocks that many investors would view as \\"value.\\" So, despite his complete lack of specifics on virtually every topic in the book, what he does offer is still valid. And his website is free and does exactly what he says it will do.I truly despise and resent the last chapter -- \\"what will you do with all of the millions you haven't made yet?\\" It's inappropriate to speculate on unmade money that isn't his. But then to go a step further and have a professor of all people suggest we should be giving money to education just stinks of self-interest. And then to go even further and condemn public education because of teacher unions and its anti-capitalist and bureaucratic approach as hopeless is a horrendous way to end a book, even if he is completely right.True, there's a lot of fluff in this book.

Could be that I have read one too many investing books, but it may be a good starting place if you are not familiar with the market or investing as it does mention the two tennants of good investing: Good returns on capital and buying earnings on the cheap. It also gives a good story to to teach novices the reasons behind his points.However, for the more advanced investors, I think the book may be a little too simplistic when it comes to describing purchasing earnings on the cheap. IMO, a major flaw in the book. It seems to describe a method where a good earnings yield (upside down P/E ratio) means that a stock is cheap. However, this is not always the case depending on the stock, its industry or its future prospects, amoung a lot of things. IMO, it still does not give a difinitive answer as to what is cheap and I don't believe there is one easy way. Thus the reason stock prices fluctuate so readily. The author claims that by carring a 30 stock diversified portfolio may get you around this error. This may be the case.

We can not wait for 3 years...2) As the book suggested, you need to invest in 20 - 30 stocks.

He also did not present directions on how he actually computed any of the data as other reviewers have stated. He also forcefully states a couple of times that you are not a financial expert and he is and so you should not trouble yourself with trying to figure out the formula, just trust it. He even tells you not *not* look at and analyze annual reports for companies. All of this caused me to ask what his *real* method for beating the market is.You must first realize that *he* is trying to beat the market. He doesn't care about helping *you* beat the market. The only way to actually make money in the stock market is to figure out how to take it from others and absolutely no other way. He most likely used a number of data mining techniques to find the formula that looked the best. Once he had that, he concocts a plausible reason for believing the formula and then he publishes it along with the good data sets while leaving out the bad data sets. Voila! Instant success.So, here is his real method for beating the market.There is one formula to use and it will predict the *same* set of stocks to purchase for everyone who uses it! Since he told you not to look at annual reports you have to wait for the information to be made available from other sources. However, he will use the annual reports to figure out which companies will be predicted by the formula *prior* to you having access to the same information and he will purchase them.The predictable result? Because his formula says which stocks to buy the price *will* go up because everyone who is using his formula will drive the price up! He then takes his profits and waits for the next cycle.This is basic strategy folks, create a demand where is isn't one knowing that it will collapse because it is just than, an artificial demand. You just have to be quicker (and I am sure he is) than the collapse which might be 1 month at best. You will purchase and still be holding them when the price bubble collapses and you, the user of his formula will lose because you are expecting the price to continue rising.

I purchased this book believing it would satisfy at least one of these requirements.

He ranks his picks based on earnings yield (basically inverse of P/E) and Return on Assets. So you are taking companies that, based on the most recent financial reports, are making a lot of money compared to assets and, for whatever reason, are cheap compared to those earnings (Thanks to \\"Mr. Market\\").The book is written for someone who has very little knowledge of the stock market, which was Greenblatt's primary goal (he had some criticism that his previous book \\"You Can Be a Stock Market genius\\" was too difficult). However, if you are a more saavy investor you will still find the book intriguing. There are more detailed explanations of his formula in the appendix section and also the FAQ section of the website (I highly recommend you read through this).Greenblatt answers his critics who worry about the backtesting by stating that he did not search through many different formulas until he \\"found one that worked\\". In fact, this was the very first formula he tried. Why did he try it? Because this mirrors the approach he uses when he puts together his hedge funds (he has a 40% average return). Interestingly, there was an article in Barron's recently which stated that the formula held up when tested by an independent researcher using the same database.The website is truly a gift. In addition to his simple ranking system, he applies some proprietary calculations (again see the FAQ section of the website). He also talks about concerns regarding the future of the website in the FAQ section. You can use a simple stock screener (there are many available online) to run your own screen using Greenblatt's basic principles (Again read the FAQ section the website - he suggests that you try this. This is also a key reason why he stresses the importance of UNDERSTANDING the formula in his book). I did this 3 months ago and the companies generated from this screen, as a whole, are beating the market. The bottom line is that I think there is too much focus on Greenblatt's website rather then on the book and the principles.In the book (and in interviews about the book), Greenblatt states that if you take the time to do some additional research, you can improve the performance of the formula. However this is certainly not necessary. I have personally used some techniques to refine the list generated by his website (I try to wean out the companies that are mismanaging the revenue). Over the past 3 months, I've been able to return about 20%. Thank you Mr. Greenblatt.Finally, Mr. Greenblatt finally had a chance to meet Buffett personally (along with some of Greenblatt's Columbia business students). Obviously, the book/formula was inspired by Buffett. When asked about the book, Buffett stated \\"Terrific book. Buying great businesses at cheap prices. Doesn't it seem so simple?\\""},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"What do you get when you mix a strong marketing plan, a well known and successful hedge fund manager, and 100 pages of investing platitudes?Answer: Greenblatt's new book.I hate to be so harsh on the book, because I think Greenblatt's intentions are good.So let me correct myself: If you are under the age of 12 and know diddley squat about how stocks work, buy this book.You'll learn a lot.Now, if you have even a rudimentary knowledge of stock picking -- save your money.Greenblatt says two important things in this book then repeats himself for 100 + pages.All you need to know you could have gotten for free at Morningstar: buy companies with high ROC (return on assets or \\"ROA\\") and high earnings yield (inverse of P/E ratio -- the E/P ratio)."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"If you bought the original, no need to buy this new little book that \\"still\\" beats the market. Same magic formula, but, have to say sound and profitable simple formula as explained step by step in the book as follows:1. Screen and sort companies from higher to lower by return on capital (EBIT/Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Asset).2. from the resulting list of high return on capital screen and sort again, but now for Earnings Yield (EBIT/Enterprise Value).3. Buy the 20 to 30 of the top-ranked companies obtained from the 2nd step.4. Sell each stock after holding it for a year. For taxable purpose sell winners after holding them for few days more than one year and sell losers after holding them a few days less than a year.5. Use the proceeds from the sales to replace the sold companies with an equal number using step 1 and 2. Continue with this process for many years.Let me share, that this formula still works in the Mexican market where I have used it, just with a small adjust or clarification for the selling step (maybe I misunderstood the statement sell each stock...), no doubt to sell the loser without hesitation, but, just before selling the winners stocks, I perform the screen & sort of steps 1 & 2, if the winners stocks already held one year are still in the top ranked companies I kept them and avoid having unnecessary trading costs."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I am not one who likes to spend inordinate amounts of time writing reviews on websites; however, the fact that (currently) 62 of 75 people find the review of this book from Tiffany S. Haugen helpful disturbs me. It disturbs me because that review is full of inaccuracies and smells a little self serving.The first and most obvious question is what is the reviewer's relationship to Professor Robert Haugen, whose securities analysis techniques she so feverishly promotes (note the last name similarity).Anyway, on to the debunking:- 1st sentence of the review says that Greenblatt uses two factors to select stocks: earnings on investment (EBIT) and return on assets (ROA). 1st, last time I checked, EBIT stood for Earnings Before Interest & Taxes, not earnings on investment (earnings on invested capital maybe??). The bigger goof is the fact that Greenblatt does give two stock picking factors. They are Return on Capital (EBIT / Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets) and Earnings Yield (EBIT / Enterprise Value). Basically with 12 seconds of review of the appendix to The Little Book, the reviewer could have accurately related the two factors and she missed them both.- 2nd paragraph she states that the Appendix notes where Greenblatt got his idea from: \\"from analyzing real data on the internet provided by Professor Robert Haugen at his website\\". This is a complete falsehood if not a flat out lie intended to deceive the reader. The appendix states a number of things, mostly a reasonably detailed explanation of the calculations used in the formula. It certainly does not state that Greenblatt analyzed real data at the professor's website and used it to come up with this formula.This is the reviewer's opinion stated as if it were written by Greenblatt himself. Greenblat states on numerous occasions that the Formula sprouted from his real world investing style. A style that it is commonly known produced outsized annual average returns (40%+) for many years, making him a very rich man.The mention of Professor Haugen is really a positive one. Greenblatt states that \\"some of the best work done to date on sophisticated factor models\\" was by Professor Haugen.The main point of the mention of Professor Haugen in the Appendix was that his results from analyzing 71 factors (rather than 2) were excellent, and comparable to the Magic Formula; however, they were not quite as good, required much, much more analysis, and required trading individual stocks every month, thereby increasing transaction costs tremendously and espousing a trading strategy.She also states that by analyzing so many factors, the Haugen method will not be subject to the extreme price volatility that Greenblatt's factors will give you. This makes it completely obvious that she did not read the book. One of Greenblatt's major points is that, while the Magic Formula will underperform for periods of time (like any method), it has never had a negative return over any rolling three year period in the 17 years reviewed. That seems to fly in the face of the volatility arguement.- In her last paragraph she says that if Greenblatt really wanted to help you he would have shown you how to access the databases he uses. Again, she didn't read the book. Greenblatt states that the database he uses is very expensive (I believe $70K annually) and for that reason he provides the Magic Formula stocks on his website (FREE). The man is not trying to take your money. Look into him a little and you will find he is one of the most generous rich guys around.Trust me, read the book (thoroughly), and you will see that this reviewer has no intention of giving an honest assessment of this book. In my opinion, she simply wants to promote Professor Haugen and use enough big words, inaccuracies and (in my opinion again) flat out lies to make readers believe she knows what she is talking about.It is clear she has not read the book (skimmed it at best) and has no business writing a review of it.Not intending to be meanspirited, but I believe this book gives small investors with little time to analyze stocks a leg up. If the review in question causes one person (who might have purchased it and benefited from it) not to buy it and learn from it, that would be a shame.JMHO."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Of course everyone says \\"buy low, sell high.\\" But why is to so hard to do? Close to impossible if you look at the track record of the money management industry.Consider this: Peter Lynch, one of the great investors of our time, ran the Magellan Fund for (I think) about 13 years. During this period the fund had a positive return in every single calendar year. Despite that, more than half the investors during this period of time lost money investing in the fund! How could that be? Lack of a long term perspective, and chasing the latest fad. Most of us succumb to this disease.So what has Joel done that is brilliant, useful, and simple?He has provided the \\"magic formula\\" that allows one to buy good companies at distressed prices provided we are willing to stick with the strategy for 3-5 years, preferably longer, and build a diversified portfolio.Buying low P/E stocks is a strategy that many fund managers swear by. There are others who prefer business that have a high Return on Assets. So far nothing new.But Joel has combined these two metrics in a simple manner which is brilliant. And to top of it, the homework is presented on the website (currently free).Yes the book is written simplistically to perhaps appeal to a broader audience. But the insight and methodology is profound.I have nothing to do with Joel and had never heard of him till I read the review of the book in the Wall Street Journal.But I believe that this is an exraordinary book for any investor looking to \\"do it right\\". All they need is perseverance.Verinder"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Joel Greenblatt has done a great service to investors with this book. The additional section explains why the system hasn't worked as well as many expected in recent years, during a turbulent market. In this book he also explains why a hedging strategy of shorting the most over-valued stocks based on his magic formula and buying the most under-valued stocks also doesn't work and should be avoided. Even if an investor doesn't completely follow the system, understanding the logic of the system should help investors to make better investment decisions."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I have set up a yahoo group for anyone interested in further discussion:http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/magicformulainvesting/The book is a great read, and I like its spirit of making investing easy for everyone, but the devil is in the details.A few questions arise:1. Has anyone reproduced the backtesting results independently?2. I haven't found any stock screens that have the capability to screen for ebit/(net working capital + net fixed assets) or ebit/enterprise value. While he does offer a custom service that does this screen, I would not like to depend on it. Has anyone found an alternate screen which can be set up to screen for his ratios?3. The author suggests screening for ROA and P/E on commercial screening services since his ratios aren't available. Does this really produce stocks with the same characteristics?Absent independent verification, and a means to implement this approach independant of the author's own service, readers should approach this book's \\"magic formula\\" with caution."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I have no experience in the stock market - I am in biomedical sciences. From a scientific perspective, this book would not pass the scrutiny of peer-review. On the positive side, Greenblatt has a hypothesis: two independent measures in combination should identify the best stock deals, and therefore allow the development of simple formula that produces better results than the market average. To prove his hypothesis, he used a retrospective analysis of market data. In some ways, this approach is similar to that in \\"What Works on Wall Street: A Guide to the Best-Performing Investment Strategies of All Time\\" by James P. O'Shaughnessy, but it is different in the specific parameters used. Now, in a scientific paper it is crucial to provide enough detail that enables others to reproduce the experiment. This appears to be a major drawback of Greenblatt's study. Another important aspect is related to the statistical analysis. You may wish to read the critique written by \\"Martian Bachelor\\" on Oct 3, 2000 about O'Shaughnessy's book. The very same applies to Greenblatt's. He gives nice averages, but fails to mention the associated standard deviation. In other words, whereas the magic formula in principle works, it will not necessarily produce good results on any individual stock. Greenblatt must have recognized this, and recommends to develop a portfolio of about 30 stocks for those amateur investors, who cannot further analyze the stocks identified by the formula. It is noteworthy that the cost of trading the stocks is not calculated into the performance of the investment strategy. Small investors will have the worst return because of the few shares they will be able to afford at each transaction. A key feature of the strategy is that you sell your winning stocks after a year. Well... I would probably run the magic formula at that time, and if it still identifies that stock as a good buy, I would not sell it. It makes no sense under those circumstances.Several concerns were raised by other reviewers, and I must agree with them: 1) The statistics that you need for using the magic formula are not easily found, especially not in a timely manner. Even if you can gain access to them, you may have to have a subscription to an expensive publication and its online edition. For small investors, again, this would eat up the proceeds. 2) The results of the magicformulainvesting.com website were not reproducible by some reviewers. Part of this may stem from the insufficient description of the method that was used by Greenblatt's statistical analysis. 3) Under the circumstances, one needs to rely on the service provided by magicformulainvesting.com. As the Author points out, it is \\"currently\\" a free service. Now, I guess after you established that it works for you (i.e., in a few years), you will be willing to pay the fee that will be introduced. Depending on the fee, this may still be a bargain compared to what you would need to shell out for a subscription to Value Line or Investor's Business Daily (which may not have the data properly processed anyway). Hence, the book can be viewed as an advertisement for a currently free website. The website will be proof that the formula works, and if it does, it will become a pay-for-service investment website. I think it is a fair strategy, and if this investment strategy works, Greenblatt deserves the money both for intellectual property, and providing the number crunching service.For the novice investor, the book is definitely insufficient, and I would strongly recommend Jason Kelly's \\"The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing\\". This will help with the mechanics of trading using online discount brokers, such as Ameritrade. (The book also gives additional insight.)Having read this, you may wonder, why on Earth did I give 5 stars to such an iffy book? Well, simply put: I enjoyed reading it! Greenblatt has an excellent sense of humor. Even if the formula does not work, the book's wit is worth the reading. I would also say that it would be a good read for kids to understand the basics of the stock market. In all honesty, I am not sure why Greenblatt chose the corny title to the book and the strategy. One cannot really seriously take something that is called \\"magicformula\\". I guess, a refined version of this will be \\"silverbulletformulainvesting.com\\" (hey, I should have this as a registered trademark and domain name!!!). Maybe there is a purpose in this: to limit the crowd using the strategy. If one reads the rationale, one must conclude that it actually makes sense, regardless of the corny and funny name given to it. For the brave investors out there: Come in if you dare! And especially if you have a sense of humor..."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"The good. It's short with a few basics on value investing.

It's not that hard to beat the market. The DOW was down .5% last year. Not too hard to beat that if you have good value fundamentals.The biggest problem I have with this book is that it asks you to rely on a formula you can't reproduce yourself (unless you have access to masses of financial data and the ability to manipulate it.) To use his \\"formula\\" you basically go to his website and plug in a couple of numbers to generate a list. His list. I also have a suspicion that at some point your going to have to pay a fee to use the site.

I bought it in early 2007 and put it into practice immediately. Didn't work. The supposedly great companies selling at discount (i.e. companies with high ROIC and high Return over Enterprise Value), sank so deep into red that they are reemerging only now, if at all, three years later.In the second edition, to Greenblatt's credit, he admits (albeit sheepishly) that his formula investing doesn't really work. No more talk of Random Walk Spoiled or whatever. The value theory proposed by Greenblatt is indeed tidy and appears sound, and seem (according to Greenblatt) to fair well in repeated backtests. Only that it doesn't work in practice.And, so, Greenblatt has now set up a mutual fund that seeks to implement the proposed formula investing method. See: formulainvestingfunds dot com. Maybe it'll work now; but you need at least USD10,000 (initial sum) to participate in it. Should you buy this book and try to work the formula, you'll be competing with the fund's full-time analysts, prospecting for the same treasures. Good luck doing it!Bottom-line: Save your money. Buy Random Walk or Winning the Loser's Game or Value Averaging, instead. (If you are ambitious, get Pat Dorsey's Five Rules.)

Perhaps a better phrase would be \\"sensible investing that, over time, cannot lose.\\"I also liked that even though Greenblatt is utterly excited and at times almost childishly promotional about his strategy, he stops short of any promises about what the economic picture might look like in the future.

The books major theme is that investing is a difficult proposition yet that it can be done successfully if one finds and dedicates himself to a sound investing strategy. Just such a strategy is the described by the author.The essence of the strategy is to buy good companies at bargain prices (where a good company is defined as one that has high returns on investment and where a bargain price is defined as a price whose ratio to earnings per share is low). The idea is that stocks with a low ratio of price to earnings per share are undervalued and that in time the market will recognize and correct this. Furthermore, the fact that the stocks considered are those of good companies is a way to help make sure that the stock is truly undervalued.The strategy is simple enough and the case in favor of it is hard to argue against.

There will also be people who will see losses while the stock market is looking good. But his point was that in the long term the averages work in your favour.

My intention was more to critique the book than to learn anything from it.I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this book, and I'd rate it an excellent introduction to value investing for beginning investors. I'm still not completely sold that his 'magic formula' will consistently generate the type of returns he talks about, but I will admit the underlying philosophy of the formula is sound (with the one drawback that it could lead you to buy some cyclical companies just as they hit their cyclical earnings peak - the wrong time to buy such companies).But this book does more than provide a 'magic formula' - it provides a good, easy to read, easy to understand description of important concepts such as return on invested capital. This is why I think it's a good read for a beginning investor.It's unlikely that an experienced investor will learn much from this book, but I definately think a beginner who's interested in value investing will benefit from the small time investment (only 2 hours or so) required to read this short book."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to modern value investing principles.

Remember that patience is a virtue! This formula does not work overnight."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"There are a few real gems of advice here. The most repeated is... \\"Most people have no business investing in individual stocks on their own!\\" Right after that comes, \\"If your stockbroker is like the vast majority, he or she has no idea how to help you!\\" (Note: I have nothing against brokers, it's just they're professional buyers and not advisors.) The last gem IHMO is \\"So how would you fix the public school system? You might fire bad teachers, pay more for good teachers, remove bad principals, and close bad schools.

First, go to [...] (the site is free) and buy a half dozen recommended stocks every 2-3 months until you have 20-30 of them. Then, review and sell anything no longer on the list in order to replace (and expect to replace all of your portfolio every year).The [...] formula attempts to find cheap companies that earn a lot of money. This seems reasonable, but what's missing is why the company's cheap (say, they're being sued) or why the company's making money (was it dumb luck or skill). In other words, there's no hint of any risk measurement or any real financial research. The key problem with simply chasing higher returns is that you'll always end up with overly risky securities (both for the returns being made as well as your temperament). The author claims the Magic formula will beat the market (which currently sucks as a benchmark) - again with no mention of whether that this may be done at a much greater risk to losing all of your money (something easy to do) - within any three years. BUT, calculations show it has lost over the last three years (losing, in fact, a whopping 29%).This seems like the worst investment book I've ever read (providing only what people want to hear - it's easy). Using this system, you should sadly expect to get burned. I'm only now doing the due dilligence of a deeper Internet search and it seems just about every blog/site testing the Greenblat's magic formula has shown it to underperform the market. BTW, who is Joel Greenblatt? He is an original protege of Mike Milken who is well known for his role in the development of junk bonds and getting jailed for racketeering and securities fraud. No surprise."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This guy can't be serious. The recommended investment strategy boils down to 1) read my book 2) consult my website 3) blindly follow my recommendations. There is no way to replicate the results on your own. Actually, there's no way even to understand _exactly_ how the results are achieved. (Adjustments for 'excess' cash? Really? How is that derived?)I don't doubt the author has achieved great results himself - but the book is little more than a fairy tale."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I didn't want to buy this book because it could be read in 2 and a half hours at the book store. The book is about 150 pages and about 5 of them are worth reading. If you just read the appendix you can save yourself a lot of time because that is the whole book. The rest of the book is the author trying to be cute and telling stupid stories.The author says if you buy stocks with high earnings yields and return on capital you will beat the market. However, he uses EBIT/enterprise value for the earnings yield. I don't know why he doesn't use free cash flow instead of EBIT. The author also tells you to turnover 100% of your portfolio each year, but ignores taxes when he shows the results for his \\"magic formula.\\" He also ignores transaction costs (especially important for those that have small sums of money or don't use a discount broker).If his magic formula works then it works and it is hard to argue with facts.

This book is geared for beginners, and is perfect in that regard, as it explains the rationale simply before explaining the method.As for more experienced investors, while the approach is mechanical and takes the fun out of picking the selections, the absence of emotional bias helps eliminate mistakes. It also provides a target - if you pick your own stocks and you're not earning these kinds of returns, it might be time to reexamine your approach or recognize that a mechanical method may be better for you. I suspect a lot of investors of middling experience may use the magic formula supplemented by their own picks, or as a screen for further evaluation.In any case, I believe most investors will benefit at least to some degree by reading this book."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This presents a modernization of Benjamin Graham's formula for picking a *portfolio* of stocks (not single stocks --that requires forecasting) based on historical data. It is proven to make money, although it will under-perform the market average at least some of the time, which *will* cause many to abandon it at such times.If you know nothing of B. Graham or formulas, don't worry. Here is plenty of elementary yet intelligent discussion for novices about stock market formulas in general, businesses, and what to look for in a stock, yet it is concise and told in a friendly way. That's what I like about this book: all the obvious questions were asked for me, and then answered. It discusses from different angles what makes a company profitable, competition, under what conditions do the prospects for competition look good or poor, etc.Two-star bashers: It is a fact that most professional money managers do worse than the market average. I am already inundated with free investment advice and I don't need yours. I find this book much more useful."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This book is simply proof that quant investing works. The negative reviewers knock Greenblatt and accuse him of wanting to just serve himself.....I guess he hasn't done well enough(40+% a year!)and needs some more pocket change. I can guarantee you that he isn't running his website to make a killing!! The site is free. I have personally compounded at 38.22% for the last 6 years for my taxable account using my own 4 factor screen. I know I'm in good company since my screen generates very similar results when compared to Greenblatt's. Important: Don't just by a stock at or near it's 52wk high even if the p/e is low! You won't get as big a return and you may be buying near the top. I buy when all valuations are good but the stock hasn't made it's move yet. The psychology of the chart is extremely important. Greenblatt doesn't get into that but you and I both know he uses some basic technical analysis before buying a stock. The timing of each purchase is critical to compounding at higher than normal rates. Putting the odds in your favor to begin with by screening for the right kind businesses is where you must start. Don't over diversify by industry groups. You may find the best values in certain groups...why bring in the losers just to be diversified. Don't be in just one sector, at least 3. Do own at least 5 stocks and I think no more than 20. I feel more comfortable with 20. If you have the nerve and confidence to overweight a position then you may do very well. Of course it can go the other way so be confident that the stock has a high probability of going up! Some industries are rarely worth owning while others are not cyclical. Greenblatts book is so fresh and empowering. This is a truly mystical book, look behind it's apparent \\"simplicity\\" and you will find revelation. I think a lot of money managers may find this book threatening because it does reveal that \\"common folk\\" can actually do quite well for themselves. Many academics and management proffesionals want you to beleive that the market is a great mystery and only \\"qualified\\" proffesionals should handle your money.....don't accept average or below average returns, read this book and learn. Paper trade at first, then go out and beat the pants off the S&P 500!"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"My jaw dropped a third of the way through the book when the author says that he tested his \\"magic formula\\" over a 17 year period beginning in 1988. Seventeen years?! That's a long time in one's life, but statistically speaking, seventeen years is an insufficient amount of data. Numerous studies using the Compustat database going back 50 years shows that formulas that work well in some decades do not work well in others. Greenblatt should have devised his formula using this 17 year period (1988-2004), and then tested the formula in an out of sample period, such as 1950-1987. Would it have worked as well in the out of sample time period? Maybe, maybe not. Greenblatt doesn't tell us. Major flaw."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I read the book back in January and have been following along with the formula that was described. I agree with many of the reviewers in that even though the book says you don't have to do any additional research, just use the formula, I would use the book with caution. Historical Success or Depressed Stocks don't necessarily equate to future gains. In tracking my stocks based on the formula I have lost $6,200 (including $300 in commissions) on $29,000 put in. Even though it's been a tough 6 months, this is a 22% loss when the Dow is up slightly, the S&P; 500 is flat, and the NASDAQ is down about 8%. Luckily I bailed out of some of them early before they really plunged (take a peek at the PLAY, FORD, or SGTL charts to get a good idea...all on the list in the early part of the year). Just doing a little more investigation into any of them would yield that they did well in the past for a reason, they are also depressed for a reason and that doesn't necessarily equate to making a reasonable purchase.Use caution and do some additional research regardless of what the book says (Cheap doesn't necessarily equate to Value). As someone just looking for a long term steady investment strategy, it's still hard to beat an Old Fashioned Index Fund."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I am 16. I received this book for my birthday from my grandfather. About one year ago, I started investing with a $1,000 portfolio. The best thing I can say about it is that I haven't LOST any money. However, I haven't really gained any money. I'm about $30 in the green. I red this short 150 page book in a couple of hours and I can't wait to get started with the methods.The book is excellent for the first 70 pages or so, but then it starts getting redundant. The author uses good analogies to explain return on capital, earnings and so on. It seems after about 70-80 pages, everything is repeated in different words. I could tell while reading the second half that my attention was ebbing away.Although the book explains basically why the \\"magic formula\\" works, someone with intermediate investing knowledge would just need a few select pages out of the 150 page book to understand the magic formula and how it works.For fun, I started a paper trading account at www.simustock.com and bought an equal dollar amount of 25 of the stocks that www.magicformulainvesting.com churned out. I am going to watch it for a while. One interesting point that I would like to make is approximately half of the stocks that the formula picked were down for the day (which was the last fiscal day of the year) and about half were up. You don't have to know much about the stock market to know that almost everything goes down on the last trading day of a year. Heck, all of the stock I watch were down!I rate this book a 4 out of 5 because although it is easy reading and a good explanation of certain important terms in the stock market, it is somewhat redundant, and I don't recommend it for an experienced trader.

Those reviews are wrong. A lot of investors (especially the professional ones) like to think that investing is very complicated, requiring lots of hard work for which they earn extra degree-of-difficulty points. This book explains a very important principle in an understandable way and then tells you how to generate very high returns with it. Most professionals cannot mentally accept the possibility that a principle/strategy understandable by millions and available on Amazon for under $14 could outperform all the hard work and keen insights that they are paid big bucks for. Naturally, they write a poo-poo review and then go back to throwing their darts.The principle in this book works. If you can internalize it, you will be ahead of 90% of the crowd."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"As some reviewer already pointed, Greenblatt did not disclose the standard deviation of all the mean returns in his study and quoted in his book. This could a big problem to someone who may choose to follow his magic formula. In other words, a wide or wild range of returns could still show a higher than average mean return. The question could be - do you have the stomach watching your portfolio value going down by 60% in one year and then going up by 80% the next year?"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"It's difficult to rate an investment advice book without actually taking the advice and seeing how successful it is.

This didn't happen - after a quick registration process, I was rewarded with a complete list of companies. I was so relieved that the book didn't turn out to be a 100-plus page ad for the site.I'll come back in a few years and tell you how it all worked."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Greenblatt missed a wonderful opportunity to explain why picking stocks that have high returns on capital and buying them at low valuations works: it's NOT because this strategy \\"fails\\" some of the time, thereby weeding out impatient investors who would otherwise render the strategy too efficient to create excess returns. The reason this approach works is because if you buy companies that have many opportunities to reinvest capital at returns greater than their cost of capital, they will create wealth. Period. The stock price will ultimately reflect this wealth creation regardless of how many people utilize this \\"strategy.\\" The way to make money buying stocks is to identify good businesses--and to not overpay for them. I think this is the message that Greenblatt may have been trying to send, but he got so caught up with data-mining-type explanations for why this approach works that he failed to connect the dots: the fundamentals of the business will eventually end up reflected in the stock price."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"The \\"Little Book That Beats the Market\\" is a short, digestible book that outlines Joel Greenblatt's \\"magical formula investing\\" theory.What is the magical formula? Comprised of two simple metrics (return on capital and earnings yield), the magical formula is an investment-screening tool designed to identify companies with better than average earning power that are for sale at a lower than average price (i.e. ones that present a \\"value\\" buying opportunity). The formula is in many ways a distillation of the teachings of Benjamin Graham (whose ideas influenced Warren Buffet) into a more populist and palatable form.To determine what companies are better than average, Mr. Greenblatt uses a \\"return on capital\\" metric. To gauge attractiveness of price, Greenblatt looks at \\"earning yield\\". The Appendix of the book outlines how it is he calculates both of these metrics. The magic formula then screens for the 20-30 stocks that have the highest ranking, when you look at all the stocks combined return on capital and earnings yield. If these concepts are new to you, Greenblatt goes so far as to even show the results of this screen on an ongoing basis on his Magic Formula website.For a more experienced investor, for someone who has read books on investing (and particularly those on value investing-Margin of Safety: Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor,The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing. A Book of Practical Counsel (Revised Edition),The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America, Second Edition,Value Investing: Tools and Techniques for Intelligent Investment, even Joel Greenblatt'sYou Can Be a Stock Market Genius: Uncover the Secret Hiding Places of Stock Market Profits), this book will not seem the best of use of time. This is an \\"introduction to investing\\" type book. Which is not to say, the ideas of this book are not important, but only that for the more experienced students of investing, this review combined with a look at Greenblatt's Magic Formula website and maybe the Appendix of this book would be enough to get the essence of the \\"Little Book\\" without having to read it in its entirety.Mr. Greenblatt's investing concept of \\"magic formula investing\\" while simple has held up well over time. Why? The formula's difficulty is not in its construction, but rather in its implementation. What makes the prevalence of these value opportunities possible is the very human nature and institutional constraints that make them difficult to implement.To help with this, Mr. Greenblatt and colleagues have now made their investment theory \\"investable\\" through either self-directed or professionally managed accounts. The funds have been available since 2009. The verdict? They are up until now beating the market. For an introduction to a simple but effective investment approach that seems to perform well over time, this book- readable in an afternoon's sitting- is worth a glance. For more experienced investors, spending thirty minutes on the Internet will probably get you to the same place."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This is indeed a little book, and it could easily be littler. If you skip to the 14th chapter, which is at the very end, you finally find the real meat. His method seems plausible enough and he has supposedly tested it historically. In a nutshell he tells you to buy 5 to 7 low PE, high ROA stocks every 3 or 4 months for one year. Then, after about a year (less for losers, more for winners,taking advantage of capital gain rules), sell that group of stocks and pick an equal number of similar replacements. He's even done the statistical work by listing appropriate choices on his updated free website. Now, you don't even have to get the book, eh? That is, unless you want to know where to find appropriate stocks or why his method is historically a wining method."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"The good thing about this book is that it teaches value investing, which is the only investing style that works in the long run. To his credit the author does pay homage to those who came before him-- namely Ben Graham, and like Graham he formulates a magic investing formula to identify stocks that have the potential to beat the market. The magic formula emphasizes stocks that have both a high return on capital and a high earnings yield. That is the book in a nut-shell.The magic formula will lead investors to stocks the market has temporarily placed on sale. However, there are a number of caveats to be aware of and additional research is required before blindly buying the stocks identified by the formula. The book provides a solid argument for self-directed investing and a framework for doing so. The trick, as always, is how to apply the wisdom found in the book and having the guts to stick with it even in periods of underperformance."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I'm a former Wall Street trader, so I know a few things about the world of finance and stock trading. That said, the information in this book is crucial for investors looking to make long-term gains in the stock market.

I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This brief text is a good read for the novice investor who wants to learn more about equity valuation. Basically, it distills the drivers of stock values into two components: return on assets and earnings yield. Buy stocks with strong numbers in both of these categories and, over time, you will outperform the market. Only problem with this approach is that stock values are based on expectations of FUTURE performance. Stocks often have high earnings yields today because professional stock pickers expect their finances to degrade in the future. Forecasting future performance is what is most important. The author fails to stress this concept.For the novice investor, the author is able to explain some of the more fundamental concepts of equity valuation in a straightforward manner. Yet, this text would be only one of a several books someone should read before trading individual stocks instead of purchasing mutual funds."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Really enjoyed the audiobook version of this one. Listened to it twice.Mr. Greenblatt focuses on two variables in evaluating stocks: 1) the earnings-to-price ratio (like the PE ratio, but Earnings/Price rather than Price/Earnings); and 2) the return on investment (e.g. how well has the company's investments done recently?).The approach is to rank companies based on #1 above, then rank all companies based on #2 above. Then combine the rankings and pick the best companies from those. The hypothesis is that this approach will find companies that should generate high returns in the short term but that are also priced at a discount for some reason.The author tested his approach using data from the past 17 years, and found strong support for it. But here, too, is a weakness. In terms of the stock market, 17 years is a very short period of time. To provide strong support for his ideas, he really needs to go back at least 50 or 100 years, in my view.With such limited data to validate his approach, investors should be forewarned that the next 17 years may be different from the last 17 years, and the approach may not always work.Also, the book focuses only on US stocks. For US investors who want to diversify out of the dollar by investing in foreign stocks, this book won't help.That being said, this book is a very solid effort, and a great place to start to learn the value approach to investing. The author introduces the greatest-of-all-time teacher of value investing, Benjamin Graham, and gives a nutshell summary of Graham's ideas."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Pros:Lucid presentation.Plain and simple makes it ideal for the beginners in stock market.Magic formula and his step-by-step are both rational and practical.Cons:If you have an advanced degree like MBA or CPA skip this book.Book doesn't talk about the importance of Cash flowNo discussion regarding General Allocation strategies and Diversification strategies.Comment:He is probably going to write another book carrying his tips and techniques from real life experience. At-least I wish..."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This book was a quick read and was really designed for investors who are completely new to the stock market. Primary concept in the book is to buy companies that have a high return on assets (ROA - this is a fairly good ratio of how good a company is at turning a profit) and low price/earning ratios (P/E - this tells how cheap a company is relative to how much profit a company makes per share). Then reasses your portfolio every year, selling all the previously held stocks and buying all new stocks according to the above formula. Lastly, time your sales to take advantage of the tax code (by selling a few days before you hit the 1 year mark to gain a tax savings, and hold gains for slightly more than a year to minimize the taxes you have to pay on the capital gains.) Repeat over a 30 year period and voila, a retirement nest egg you can live off of for the rest of your life. That is the gist of the book; granted this seems simplistic, but it is solid advice for the long term investor. If you are a trend or short term trader this book will not help you. But if you need some intital advice to get your portfolio started and are interested in investing over the long term than this is a decent book."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"excellent quick read. plan to utilize the technique for there are lots of market inefficiencies that this will exploit. like the book says, it won't work every year but it will outperform the market over the long haul. would not put all my money in this, but will do some."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I love great writers and thinkers who can state complex principles simply. Buying stocks with high return on assets or capital at a high earnings yield (low price) is a sure recipe for success. It is important that we remembers this in investments, and many pros seem to forget it. Still it is no easy task to determine future earnings.I bought Apple computer two years ago because I saw how fast iPods sold at their store on Michigan Ave and how people responded to mine. There was nothing in their financials to indicate that the stock price would rise 700%. I bought Commercial Metals when I saw scrap prices sharply rise, industry consolidation reduce competition, and import competition divert to China. Nothing in their financials would have told be the stock would be up 500% 2 years later. I bought Cooper Tires after 911 because I correctly guessed people would fly less thus drive more and wear out more tires. Nothing in their financials would have told me that the stock would rise 50% in 5 months. Like wise I stayed away from airlines, even before 911, because I saw how flying was becoming a commodity service and an unpleasant experience to be avoided for anyone not in first class.Yes I have bought many dogs but a disciplined stop loss strategy mitigates their damage. I make no claim to be worthy of being compared to a master investor like Greenblatt. While the point of his book is worthwhile, there is more to executing it than you would expect from the simplistic title. There is more adventure to investing than just analyzing past performance and projecting accordingly. The small investor has many more options than the pros like Greeenblatt who must allocate billions of dollars of other people's money."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I enjoyed the content of the book - I would give it 4 stars easy.

However, I read the entire book and then checked out the Magic Formula website. My suggestion to those of you thinking about buying this book is to check out the website first. The author is not responsible for that site, but the stocks listed there, based on his formulas, are extremely disappointing picks, and don't seem to have any relation to the low P/E's he advocates. Greenblatt offers two analytical ratios, but to use these is time-consuming and bothersome. Finally, Greenblatt states repeatedly that you MUST give his technique at least 3 years to work. Repeatedly he says, we must believe! I don't know about you, but I am constitutionally unable to make that kind of commitment, based on reading yet another grandiose stock market promise. Greenblatt is obviously a successful trader, but that doesn't mean his readers, simply by following his technique, will be able to duplicate his success. I'd suggest checking out Lowell Miller's book on dividends, and also Validea.com, which analyzes and ranks stocks based on the methodologies of 7 or 8 gurus ( Dreman, Lynch, O'Neill, O'Shaunessey, Buffett, Motley Fool, plus one or two others .)"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I'm writing this review, not only as a novice investor who has read the book, but as someone who has also applied the principles.

Over the last 3 months since I've used the book/website, I've returned 15% on my stock investments.

He even addresses the \\"mysterious\\" question about his website, future fees and what would happen if he had to close it down.If a stock on the website is purchased by 'many', the price goes up (good for those of us who own it). The stock then falls off the website (it is updated daily, although not first thing in the morning as it indicates, it often is updated in the afternoon). Guess what happens then? There is a new bargain stock to take its place on the website, ready for new investors. Although MANY of the stocks I have purchased off the site (particularly those that began with a yield over 30%) are still on the site 3 months later despite double digit returns. Again, this is coming from someone who has used the site repeatedly for the last 3 months.There are quite a few reviews on this website from people who feel this book/website is \\"beneath\\" them. That the book is a waste of time and too simple. Perhaps these folks should sit down and write a book of their own. Until then (and I'm not holding my breath here), I'm going to support the guru who has already taken me to the next level in terms of investment performance.Finally, it's nice to know a bit more about the man who wrote the book. For instance, is he really out to pull the wool over our eyes? My guess is no. He gave a $2.5 million grant to a struggling New York City school 3 years ago and has continued to work to improve education in the inner-city schools. So he appears to interested in educating teenage/adult investors as well as elementary school children. There is an article regarding this endeavor here:www.newyorkmetro.com/news/businessfinance/15958/I do feel bad about the people who read these negative reviews (and believe them). But then again, not too bad."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This book is targeted to a broader audience than the author's previous book. If you are already a hedge fund manager, you probably won't learn much from it (try You Can be a Stock Market Genius first). For the rest of us, however, it succintly summarizes important concepts in valuing companies and provides a straightforward investment algorithm that should provide superior returns over the long term. He writes in a highly entertaining style that has kept my non-investor friends and family reading. I am grateful to Mr. Greenblatt for sharing his knowledge so freely. He ranks with Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch as one of the great investor/teachers of our time."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Good investing doesn't have to be complicated. If the simplist approach makes money, then why not use it? I think Greenblatt does a good job of explaining how to invest for the long term using a very simple method.

Just because you run some historical numbers, that doesn't mean it's going to work in the future..."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"\\"The Little Book That Beats the Market\\" is thoroughly enjoyable, light reading, but also delivers accurate advice on the time-tested value investing metrics. While the book does review the \\"magic formula\\" (return on capital, earnings yield) first advocated by Graham and Dodd, it is not a magic bullet or Holy Grail: you still have to do the work of screening for these qualities (a chore) and deciding on how often you will time and rebalance a portfolio of securities with these qualities (a rational schedule for market timing is not covered thoroughly). Greenblatt also warns that going the extra step of doing projected income statements and balance sheets will improve your expected returns, while emphasising that even without this step the magic formula works for the long holding period.Greenblatt's narrative style and examples are filled with schmaltz and Borscht-belt shtick, but this is family friendly Catskills comedy that makes a point with the soft shoe transitions. Greenblatt's intention is for this to be family reading on wise investing, and for that alone he deserves six stars (and my heartfelt thanks). This is a wonderful book for teaching pre-teens and teenagers about money and investing and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I read this book and used the web site service in an attempt to earn the returns described in this book with disasterous results. Perhaps I mis-understood the concepts of the book or did not do a good job in weeding out the good picks from the bad picks but nearly all of the companies picked by the magic formula website during my trial lost more than 50% of their value, and a healthy chunk of those magic picks lost 90%. It was a devastating result.No, in summary I was not impressed by the applied results of the magic formula. Seek advice elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This book is about buying value, and value stocks. This means you can sit on these stocks a long time. The author (in a market wizard book) stated \\"Buying good companies at low prices will show a profit. It may take 2 months, or 2 years but eventually you will be right\\"Can you hold on to a losing stock for 2 years hoping it will come back? Not me. I trade maybe holding a stock from 1 to 5 days on average. It it keeps going my way I hold on longer. I cannot hope a cheap stock I bought works out in 2 years. I do not have time to wait or time to keep researching a losing position.So if you are a buy and hold investor and can sit on a loss for years and have tons of time for research then this book may be a good choice for you.From my point of view 2 stars, someone else that invests for the LONG TERM could give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"As the 261st reviewer, I don't have anything original to say. So I'll pick out the parts that interested me the most.a) To Greenblatt's credit, he lays out precisely how professionals think about stocks, in terms of return on capital. This is of course no great secret, but you can read a few shelves of books on value investing before you get to the concept of ROC, much less an author that puts it at the center of the investment universe. Value investors will talk about great businesses, moats, good management, earnings yield, and owner earnings, but all of those pale in comparison with the importance of return on capital. Return on capital is kind of Beyer's speed score as applied to investing, a way to rate all investments according to the same basic measure, whether it's FoMoCo or Docomo. So instead of long \\"checklists\\" or detailed industry knowledge, there's really only one number that matters and determines whether an investment is worth your money or not.b) Amazingly, once you start to think in terms of return on capital, it becomes evident that many companies in the stock market, companies that report earnings and sport large market caps, are in fact destroying capital. They and their shareholders would be better served by closing up shop and returning cash to shareholders. Of course, that will never happen, and many businesses are in fact stuck - sunk capital dictates staying in business, but competitors won't let them earn a profit. This is true of AT&T; and GM and other long-time capital destroyers.c) I don't think even Greenblatt himself has much faith in the magic formula. If this book is compared to \\"You can be a stock market genius,\\" it is apparent that his own investing success was built more on identifying profitable anomalies than following a magic formula, although I'm sure he applied the ROC test to every investment he made, just not in the formulaic fashion found here. Yes, there is a magic formula - and you have to use your judgment.All in all, I recommend taking a half-hour to read this book. Return on capital is one of those essential concepts, like photosynthesis or chiaroscuro, that every educated person should be able to explain should civilization come to an end and all of human knowledge depend on the memory of a few educated individuals. Once you've read this book, you'll be able to pass this test. But it won't make you rich."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"The book's main idea is interesting, but the author does not develop the ideas in detail.

The author emphasizes that the time horizon for his investing philosophy should be at least 3 years. For small investors, the necessary tools to apply his formula are not available elsewhere, so what happens if the website is not available after a year?If I had some assurance that the website would be available, I would give it 5-stars. Without the website, the book is just an interesting theory with no means for a small investor to apply it."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"The Little Book is great reading and educational; however, I found it difficult to make this author's recommendations actionable. Most of the book tells you to follow the \\"magic formula\\", but then tells you that it might not work in the short-term or long-term.

Greenblatt asserts that basically if you pick stocks base on PE and ROA you will beat the market. As Einstein warned, \\"A scientific theory should be as simple as possible, but no simpler\\". The idea that just by looking at 2 variables (Greenblatt also advocates frequent selling and buying of new stocks which is even more ridiculous than the ROA and PE idea) is overly simple. Before anyone tries this strategy I recommend trying it with imaginary money and convincing yourself how ridiculous the idea actually is. I think the appeal to investors may be the length and simplicity of this book which can be very dangerous to their stock portfolio.Greenblatt deserves some praise for his clear writing and simplification of some concepts. This is where the real value of this book lies. One can read books 10 times the length of this and get less practical information. The language is so clear and simple that it would make an ideal gift for a 10 year old interested in investing."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I felt the contents of the book were interesting and probably do work.

He lays out his formulas in a very easy and readable style and supports them with quite a bit of statistical evidence.

I could have bought a used one cheaper (not much, though)."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Nice book to have to refer to from time to time, when you want to remember the basics."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"When it comes to a complex topic such as investing, one book will not suffice.There are some really good books on sound value-investing philosophies (see below). However, many are either a bit abstract for beginners to implement (Graham) or they cover only a subset of topics needed for a beginner (Fisher, Stewart). Greenblatt's book fills that gap quite well.This is one of the rare books that I have come across that explains complex topics to a beginner in simple terms in an actionable way. An excellent contribution by Greenblatt in bringing investment closer to beginners.There are a few issues however.- It may be true that if I do exactly the set of steps that he did in his study, I would get similar results. However, it is not clear that I can exactly replicate his steps. The book does not tell exactly how the 30 stocks were picked for the study. However, it recommends you to pick 5 to 7 stocks every 2 to 3 months from the MagicFormulaInvesting.com site so that you hold an average of 30 stocks after the first year (there are more details - see the book). Suppose I am a really bad picker and always pick the worst stocks from MFI's list. Let us take a boundary case of picking 1 stock every 12 days from his list of top 100 companies with a market cap of 100+million (which still falls within the recommendation) and it happens to be the stock with worst return all the time. What would be my performance? It is not clear that his back-testing study compared such a worst-case scenario with the \\"average\\" portfolio.- It baffles me why the book does not disclose the exact formula - it was sort of like watching a good movie whose ending is left to the \\"imagination of the viewer\\". Maybe a sequel is in works?Knowing the exact formula would help calculate ROC trends for stocks that are good in other dimensions (ones that do not appear on the MFI site). Perhaps, with enough time and motivation, the formula can be correctly reverse-engineered -- harder problems have been solved by motivated groups of individuals. In the meantime, keeping the formula under wraps only promotes guessing by others and wrong guesses are more likely to result in poor investment judgments - having an opposite effect of what the author would desire. I emailed MFI about the formula and other things, but no reply yet.I have access to Compustat Xpressfeed quarterly data through betterinvesting.org. I think the formula used for Earnings yield is SUM(oiadpq of last 4 qtrs)/(price*cshoq+dlcq+dlttq-cheq of most recent qtr) assuming no preferred stocks.And Return on Capital is SUM(oiadpq of last 4 qtrs)/SUM(AvgNetFixedAssets,AvgWkgCapital)Where AvgNetFixedAssets = Avg(ppentq)+Avg(altoq)and AvgWkgCapital = Avg(rectq)+Avg(invtq)+Avg(acoq)-Avg(lcoq)-Avg(apq)-Avg(txpq). The avg is the average at the beginning and end of the 4-qtr period.I checked my numbers with the MFI numbers for about 3 stocks, and they aligned for Earnings yield. However, I do not have as much confidence in my ROC formula since the MFI site gives only a range for ROC.- It seems that MFI recommendation should be filtered with a human judgment that the future (3-4 years) business prospects of the chosen stocks will continue to be bright. Better still, apply as many Philip Fisher's qualitative judgments as possible. The problem is Greenblatt's recommendations are at one end of the spectrum for simplicity and time-intensiveness, while Fisher's recommendations are at the other end.This is not to suggest that you avoid this book. I think it is one of the \\"must-read\\" books on investing despite the points above. I would recommend the following in addition:- The Quest for Value by G. Bennett Stewart- The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America by Lawrence A. Cunningham- Investment Valuation by Aswath Damodaran- Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Philip A. Fisher- The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham- \\"What has worked in investing: Studies of Investment approaches and characteristics associated with exceptional returns\\" by Tweedy Browne- Charlie Munger's talks"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"What you need to know about this book:1) The statistical evidence for the superiority of the method is nearly perfect. Other reviewers' claims of \\"data mining\\" are spurious. The method is shown to (substantially) stochastically dominate any other proven method for beating the market, is shown to do so over a very large sample, and moreover, is shown to work at all market capitalizations, unlike the other market beating methods.2) The method has extremely strong theoretical grounding (being a distillation of the principles of value investing). It can dovetail with the priciple of diversification perfectly well, for those investors not sophisticated or motivated enough to run a more concentrated strategy.3) The method is extremely easy to implement and will hold up even if many people adopt it. Advanced practitioners can improve on it, but will still benefit from the astute(and low effort) narrowing of investment choices to the stocks with the greatest potential.4) It takes very little time to read the book. There is a special chapter at the end of the book targeted at CFAs and MBAs that you quants can use -if you are skeptical and motivated enough- to replicate Greenblatt's results. However, it is not neccessary to understand this chapter to use the method successfully(although I would say it would improve your odds by strengthening your conviction, thus helping you to stick with the strategy).5) Unlike what some of the other reviewers will have you believe, Greenblatt's use of return on capital and earnings yield is not simplistic. The way he calculates these measures and combines them is different from (and more intelligent than) the standard way of doing it, thereby giving them their predictive power.6) The author's awesome record speaks for itself, as does his carefully reasoned and statistically supported approach. Don't preemptively dismiss it because of the cute title and positive media coverage. The (enthusiastic) reviewers in the more trustworthy financial media(i.e. the Financial Times) are much more qualified to judge the quality of this work than the negative reviewers on Amazon. If the negative reviewers were indeed investment-savvy enough to be able to dismiss this work and Greenblatt's record, why would they be buying an investment advice book in the first place?In summary, this book does a good job of showing that the efficient markets hypothesis does not hold in the short term, but tends to in the long term. (This is a finding, by the way, that is roubustly supported by empirical evidence.) The \\"deep value\\" investing method espoused lets you beat market returns with less than market risk by taking advantage of these temporary mispricings. As with most value investing methods, more weight is put on past quantative results instead of future predictions. It is these future predictions, which are notoriously over-dependent on fickle assumptions and prevailing market biases, that have led to the mispricing in the first place. If you pick your own stocks, using Greenblatt's free website, www.magicformulainvesting.com, could save you a lot of time and improve your results. This book explains how the website works and gives you enough confidence in the method so you can use it successfully."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"First let me say that I have no idea how to rate this book, so disregard my 4-star rating. I thought that 3 stars might be shortchanging it, while 5 stars might be overestimating it, so I chose 4 stars somewhat arbitrarily. I don't know if Mr. Greenblatt's method is good or bad, because I have not tried the \\"magic\\" stock picking formula put forth in \\"The Little Book that Beats the Market\\". I would have to try the formula over a period of at least 5 years in order to know if it works as promised, and no one has done that. \\"The Little Book the Beats the Market\\" was published in 2005. So I am in no way advocating Greenblatt's \\"magic formula\\". I am not even a value investor. But I read a lot of trading and investing books, and this one struck me as peculiarly interesting. \\"The Little Book that Beats the Market\\" does not give advice; it provides a formula for choosing stocks that must be followed to the letter. It's gutsy for a reputable investment professional to suggest that any fool can beat the S&P; by a wide margin using a simple formula. Greenblatt has distilled the principles behind his own success in the markets into a stock-picking formula simple enough that anyone can apply it, insisting that the investor hold a large number of stocks over a long period of time to compensate for the wide margin of error inherent in such a simplistic approachJoel Greenblatt is the founder of Gotham Capital hedge fund, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, and former chairman of the board of Alliant Techsystems. His stated intention in \\"The Little Book that Beats the Market\\" is to teach people how to be successful stock market investors by providing a simple method of stock picking that even those pressed for time, unschooled in the markets, and mathematically challenged can apply with consistently good results -better results than most mutual or index funds. There are a lot of stock-picking strategies for value investors, but Greenblatt is neither a buy-and-holder nor a market timer. He advocates turning your portfolio over once a year as you reevaluate your stocks according to his \\"magic formula\\". The odd thing is how simple the \\"magic formula\\" is. You don't have to comb through annual reports or learn to read charts. The formula has only 2 components: The company must have a high return on capital (good company), and the stock must have a high earnings yield (cheap stock). The \\"magic formula\\" ranks stocks according to each of the criteria, adds the ranks together, and the stocks with the lowest numbers (highest ranks) are your picks. That's it.Greenblatt applied his \\"magic formula\\" to 17 years of stocks retroactively and got an average of 30.8% returns annually (as opposed to the S&P; 500's 12.4%). That does not mean it will work that way for the next 17 years. Even assuming other conditions do not change (and they will), if too many investors (or funds) use this formula, these stocks will no longer be bargains, and profits will be lower. Greenblatt repeatedly emphasizes the need to stick with his formula for an extended period of time, 5-20 years, because it will not be profitable every year. Returns during the 17 years tested retroactively ranged from over 70% to minus 4%. That brings me to the second point that I found unusual: You are supposed to choose 20-30 stocks per year using the \\"magic formula\\" and reevaluate every year, selling winners just after one year and losers just before, to get the best tax rate. Why so many stocks? Because many of them will be duds. The \\"magic formula\\" is designed to be idiot-proof, so it is fallible. Its success relies heavily on averages over time and over a sizable group of stocks.Where do you get the numbers required by the magic formula, and how do you find the right stocks among thousands in the marketplace? You can use Greenblatt's web site, which is free at this time, or you can use other online stockpickers to achieve an approximation of the formula. Does Joel Greenblatt use the \\"magic formula\\" to pick his own stocks or those of his clients? No. The formula was created specifically for people with limited knowledge of financial markets who are not skilled at picking individual stocks.As I said, I am not in a position to advocate or oppose Greenblatt's stock-picking-for-the-hoi-polloi approach. Some potential snags to keep in mind: The \\"Little Book\\" says, \\"Investing at that rate for 17 years, $11,000 would have turned into well over $1 million.\\" But how could you buy 20-30 stocks with $11,000? Limited to only $550 per stock, you would have to buy everything in odd lots. When I applied the \\"magic formula\\" (P/E 6-20, ROA >25%, no financials, utilities, or foreign) using Business Week's stock screener, I found that it would cost about $80,000 to buy one lot of each of 30 stocks. Volume may also be a problem. The formula requires that you buy 5-7 top-ranked stocks every 2-3 months. Of my stock screener's top 7 picks, 2 trade on volume under 66,000 per day. Of the top 15, 6 trade on volume under 100,000. Too low for my taste. Can we just choose stocks with more liquidity? Yes, but the \\"magic formula\\" was backtested using the top qualifying stocks taking no account of volume. If you don't use the top picks, your results are not expected to be as good. Greenblatt does give results using only large cap stocks: 22.9%. Not bad. The top 250 qualifying stocks selected from companies with $200 million or greater market capitalization yielded an average 17.9%. So you can see that the farther you get away from using the formula's top picks, the lower the returns. But the top picks may not always be suitable."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"It's always good to read with an open mind and easy to pick out from the reviews those who don't. The positive reviews are correct that this is a quick and interesting read with a simplified view of stock picking. As the negative reviews point out there isn't any easy way to screen stocks other than going to the magicformula.com website, and it also isn't easy to check the results of this investing style for veracity. It will come down to trusting the author and his motives (just because the author made a lot of money doesn't mean you don't want to make more at your expense, and the people who are endorse the book and method (pretty noteworthy folks).I've grown frustrated by the Investors Business Daily methods and Gorilla Trades, which both fuel a lot of short-term speculative trades for occasional success and frequent disaster. I performed a lot better and smoother results when I started watching Jim Cramer on Mad Money, but he too will steer you wrong on trades. Cramer at least admits his bad picks on air (see Dick's Sporting Goods DKS) and has a website, which tracks his performance. IBD will just tell you bought the stock at the incorrect \\"buy point.\\"I picked up this book looking for a consistent and less anxiety producing way to invest. Its buy and hold a year approach is appealing. The two most famous buy and hold strategists are the basis of method, Graham and Buffett. Their styles quadrupled my portfolio in the 1990's without a dot-bomb meltdown that wiped out most. However, Graham's stocks are a rare find, and Buffett rarely gives you direct picks (see Moody's MCO, which he called a \\"no brainer\\" a few years ago). It is interesting to see a lot of the picks on MagicFormula.com top 50 are former IBD 100 stocks that have now sank --eerrr plummetted into despair (BEBE,FORD,AEOS,CMTL and more). Pick carefully you could be asking for pain, but not as much as IBD will give you (see the afore mentioned stocks). As Cramer would say \\"Buy and homework\\" not buy and hold."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Ever since computer databases have become more available and computing time and memory have been cheap, anyone can take investment history and devise a \\"back-tested\\" solution that would have made you a fortune.I don't recall any version of such a scheme that ever held up for long when it was then used to make investments going forward. Why? Conditions change.Mr. Greenblatt's approach uses a 17 year history during one of the strongest bull markets in American investing history to come up with his approach. Will this approach work during a flat or declining market? Who knows?Mr. Greenblatt argues (unpersuasively to my mind) that his approach will continue to work because the method fails to work very consistently over periods of less than three years. That will discourage anyone from using it for very long.The approach is summarized on pages 134 and 135. Basically, you go to his Web site (www.magicformulainvesting.com) and use the data there to pick companies with a low price relative to buy 20-30 stocks over the next year (a few every 3 months). You sell each one a day or so after a year has passed (to get capital gains treatment), and replace it with another stock. You pick a minimum size market cap (he suggests at least $50 million), and you select from among the stocks for companies which traded at the lowest multiple of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) which had the highest ration of EBIT to the sum of net working capital plus net fixed assets in the prior 12 months. The Web site does this for you now for free.Here is another practical problem with the book. You need to have quite a lot of money to start with or trading fees will eat up your capital. Let's say you have $10,000 to start. You will be making 60 trades a year to buy and sell 30 stocks. Assuming you pay on-line commission rates of $10 a trade, that's $600 gone to start. If you pay more for trading the problem is worse. So to be efficient, you will probably have to be able to commit at least $25,000. More is better.I would have been more impressed if the approach (which is a variation on value investing) had included a search for global value. The U.S. stock market is much more expensive now than many other markets. A bargain in an over-priced market may not be such a bargain after all.Mr. Greenblatt does have a nice way of explaining his ideas. Any teenager could follow this book. I suggest that the book's best use is in introducing teenagers to the idea that Mr. Market is way too volatile in setting \\"correct\\" prices, and you can take advantage of that by buying low. Then hand your teenager a copy of The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham to understand how you can find bargains. If that approach seems too complex for your teenager, provide next a copy of John Bogle's Commonsense on Mutual Funds."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I obtained an early copy of the book at the Value Investing Congress held in November. Simply put, this is one of the greatest investment books every written, and Greenblatt is quickly on the way towards picking up where Benjamin Graham left off.In 1981 Joel Greenblatt and Rich Pzena (now managing $1 billion plus) authored a study on \\"How the Small Investor Can Beat the Market.\\" The method: Grahamian net-net stocks.Two decades later, Greenblatt, in his own words, is \\"Buffettized.\\"In one of his lectures at Columbia he made the followimg comparison (the numbers are off, but this still captures the point):Graham-style investing is akin to paying $10 for a company worth $20, but on the way to $15* Pay 50 cents for $1; that dollar is shrinking.Buffett-style investing is akin to paying $10 for a company worth $15, but on the way to $20* Pay 66 cents for $1; that dollar is growing.---In The Little Book That Beats the Market, Greenblatt urges readers to hold a diversified (i.e. collection of around 30 stocks) collection of stocks selected to have:(1) a High Earnings Yield, and(2) a High Return on Invested Capital.Basically, in simpler terms:(1) Investment in the stock stock should provide a high return to the investor (\\"High Earnings Yield\\")(2) Investment the business should provide a high return to the business itself (\\"High Return on Invested Capital\\")===Basically, the accounting Greenblatt used:- The returns are calculated as pre-tax returns on capital.- The numerator is earnings before interest and tax. The denominator is net working capital, plus net fixed assets. Net working capital is current assets less current liabilities. It also appears that net current assets is further reduced by excess cash. Net fixed assets is non-current assets, less goodwill.===(...)"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"As a near novice in most things to do with the stock market, I've been on the lookout for a book that would provide a very simple overview and the best investment strategy. Greenblatt's Little Book That Beats The Market caught my eye, but I was skeptical, having read Andrew Tobias' famous book, The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need. Tobias' book argued that most ordinary investors can't expect to beat the market, and should therefore invest in the stock market as a whole, by investing in a no-load, broad-based index fund with a company like Vanguard. Tobias pointed out in the 2005 edition of The Only Investment Guide that broadly based index funds tracking the whole market outperform 90% of stock managers and often charge much lower fees.But lo, now Tobias, treasurer of the Democratic Party, in the forward he has written to The Little Book That Beats the Market, has stopped singing the virtues of mere broad-based index funds, and has dropped his general skepticism about beating the market as a whole. Tobias tells us Greenblatt knows what he's talking about when Greenblatt claims there is a very easy way to strongly beat the market over the long term. Tobias in the forward to the book even urges Vanguard to set up a market-beating fund based on Greenblatt's \\"magic formula,\\" and writes that the next edition of The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need will steal very liberally from Greenblatt's Little Book That Beats the Market.Greenblatt's book is so clear and easy that most teenagers can understand it. Greenblatt even has a website that allows one for free to instantly find, in terms of his magic formula, the top 25 and top 50 stocks out of some 3,500 on the market. He then has a very simple seven step system (requiring no stock research) showing you how, in a few minutes every few months, you should purchase and sell stocks, in order to get returns that very strongly beat the stock market as a whole. He also offers proof in the book that his magic formula works: he shows for example how using it over the 17 years from 1988 to 2004 would have provided returns of over 30 percent per year on average.If just any fool were pushing this strategy, I'd ignore it. But since Andrew Tobias is supporting it, and since Greenblatt himself has gotten 40% to 50% returns for many years, it looks like his presentation should be taken seriously. (You can't expect 40% to 50% returns with this simple method though; Greenblatt, in his own investing work, only uses the simple \\"magic formula\\" approach to stocks as one of many inputs and does a lot of additional research the average investor has no time for. But Greenblatt's testing of the simple, easy, magic formula presented in The Little Book That Beats The Market suggests it can generate market-thrashing 20% to 30% average annual returns over the long term, still extremely good.)I should comment on some details in the book's appendix, which you won't need to understand to grasp Greenblatt's simple book. An earlier reader-review of the book mistakenly complains that Greenblatt's so-called magic formula is not interesting because it is based on earnings to price ratio (E/P) of companies and the return on assets (ROA) ratio of companies. But if that reviewer had read Greenblatt's book more carefully, he would have seen that Greenblatt's formula does not use E/P and ROA. Instead of E/P, Greenblatt uses earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) divided by Enterprise Value (EV). And instead of ROA, Greenblatt uses EBIT divided by tangible capital employed (\\"tangible capital employed\\" means net working capital plus net fixed assets). Companies that have the best combined rankings in EBIT/EV and EBIT/tangible capital employed are at the top of the magical formula investment rankings of companies.The same reviewer complains that Greenblatt wasted some pages on inessential verbiage and could have compressed his whole message into an even smaller book. Well, there is something to that complaint, but the book is already very short and takes only about two hours to read as is. Even then, when I first picked it up, I found it easy to skim quickly through the entertaining chatty stuff and get to the beef, so it took me perhaps an hour to get through the book and get the gist. I am now rereading it carefully, since I plan to invest using its strategies, though first I intend to look for any expert critical reviews that may have been written of the book. But with people like Tobias strongly backing it, and Greenblatt's brilliant investment track record over the years, I'm gung ho at this point."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"This book is well worth your money. One point the author madethat is especially impressive, is the importance of stickingto your game plan and investment principles for the long runinstead of chasing the latest stock market fad. CONVICTIONIS SUPER-IMPORTANT, especially if the market goes the other way.If the formula consistently work well in any time frame, then everyone will jump on the bandwagon and its performance will bemediocre. It's precisely because the magic formula may notconsistently beat the market in the next one to two years,that it won't attract a cult following, and it should continueto work in the long run. The author claimed the magic formulanever went down in any three year period.The magic formula stresses the importance of analyzingearning data, P/E in the context of debt levels, which isworth emphasizing again and again.Also I don't advise following the formula religiously, do a little research on the stock you buy, make sure its businessprospect is sound. Esepcially be careful of newer companies whoseearning quality and business model may be questionable.Barron has run an article recently that generally validatesthe claims made by Greenbalt.

The average joe who wants to go the next step beyond an index fund, but does not have the time to do the research to make wise stock investments. For those of us who have jobs outside the financial world, have families to take care of, etc.A response to some critics:First, to those who want to \\"verify\\" his results. Greenblatt pays a $70,000 license fee to access the database from which he generates his results. If he handed out the raw data he probably breaks the law. Also, you should check out the FAQ's section of the website: Greenblatt states that he makes a few adjustments to his calculations to account for differing debt levels and tax rates between companies. There are other subtle adjustments to intangible assets (excluded), for \\"excess cash\\", net-working capital, and enterprise value calculation. However, he states that the formula would still work without the adjustments (you may not extract the exact same companies, in order, as he does one his website, but you would still be following the 2 core principles).Second, to those who worry about backtesting. Here is a quote from Greenblatt during a recent interview about his book:\\"The Magic Formula from the book is not something that we fished around for by back tested extensively, using 40 different formulas until something looked like it worked. This is the absolute first thing that we tried, and the inputs approximate how we invest professionally. So when we talked about components for a back test we thought \\"Let's keep it simple. Let's look at what companies do. If we rank them based on earnings yield and return on capital and picked the companies with the best combined ranking of those two factors, how would a portfolio of stocks like that do?\\" That is what we back tested and that was the first thing we tested and that is what I wrote up in the book because it is so simple and obvious.\\"He goes on to compare his book to Jim O'Shaughnnessy's \\"What Works on Wall Street\\"\\"Well number one, he tested dozens of formulas over a long period of time and then picked the ones that worked the best. What we did is we picked a formula based on what we actually do, and we tested it. This was it. This formula ranks stocks in order from best deciles to worse and so it wasn't just picking the top outliers. It was really actually picking what we think goes into making money in the stock market, which is buying good companies when they are cheap, so it was really done somewhat differently.\\"Yes, you will lose a little bit in commissions and taxes (if you use the formula outside of a tax-sheltered account). 30% a year minus a few points still sounds pretty good to me!!The formula allows you to take emotion and irrational judgement out of your stock picking - the reason why so many people fail at it.Thank you Professor Greenblatt!!"},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"Greenblatt advocates buying stocks at a low price using two factors, earnings on investment (EBIT) and return on assets (ROA). He calculates these two numbers for stocks, adds them, and buys the top 20 or so, selling off in a year. This is his \\"magic formula\\". If you can't calculate these numbers, you go to his website and currently get his for free. The rest of his book is fluff, although it may be of use to people who currently have no idea how to select an undervalued stock.The Appendix notes where he got his idea: from analyzing real data posted on the internet provided by Professor Robert Haugen at his website.Haugen has long argued that securities are not fairly priced and that you can beat the market, but using mathematical techniques is not so simple as suggested. Price movements include event, error, and price-driven volatility. For example, rising oil prices affect the price of GM, which gives rise to event-driven volatility. Lower-than-expected earnings for Google leads to a lower price when investors mistakenly think they may perform more poorly in the future, leading to error-driven volatility. Price-driven volatility is investors watching prices alone. The first two factor categories can largely be predicted with a factor model. (See Haugen, The Inefficient Stock Market: What Pays Off and Why. ) Haugen and other factor models typically have 50 ore more factors, so they won't be subject to extreme price volatility that Greenblatt's two factors will give you.Greenblatt has perhaps datamined Haugen returns to select two factors which may perform well, if you can tolerate 2 to 3 years of down returns. Few individuals can psychologically tolerate these losses; most want losses controlled. Unless you are a large investor who can purchase and use databases, your investment is based on blind trust in Greenblatt's selections. (Had he really wanted to help you, he would have told you how to access databases and calculate his factors--note that this is missing from his book--the how to do it!) And you must invest the same day he calculates these factors at the open of the market, since daily price fluctuations will change the list. It is unlikely that the smaller investors--say those with a hundred thousand or less---will be able to timely and in a cost-effective manner invest in and follow their portfolio if they have some other job and the hectic life most of us lead. So unless you fall into the category of a large investor who has money to lose and time to quickly invest and follow your investments, AND you like the idea of quantitative investing, you are better off investing in a quantitatively-controlled no-load investment fund, preferably in a tax-deferred vehicle such as a Keogh or IRA."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I received the book today and read the whole thing in about two hours.

It conveys that by simply selecting stocks that have both a high earnings yield and a high return on capital you will outperform the market. This is a first class exercise in back testing. Thousands of magic rules proved very profitable in hindsight. Somehow, they typically all fell apart going forward. Why is that? Two reasons, the first one is that the market is extremely efficient. Millions of traders study and act upon information every day. Making money above market return on a risk-adjusted basis is extremely difficult. The second reason is a result of the first. The market learns quickly. What generated extra returns yesterday is quickly wiped out today.There's nothing new here. Everyone is onto finding stocks that have attractive valuation relative to their profitability. Additionally, Professor Greenblatt broadcasts this \\"secret\\" to the masses. This demonstrates this rule has run its courses. And, the authors are more interested in making money from this rule off the royalties of this book vs. investing. If they are smart, they are off to a more proprietary concept to generate above market returns.Sound investing boils down to evaluating one's risk tolerance, diversifying your assets accordingly, and investing them efficiently. If you want to know more about this I strongly recommend Burton Malkiels' \\"The Random Walk Guide to Investing.\\"If you are into magic formulas, I recommend the excellent \\"Fortune's Formula\\" by William Poundstone.

However, I think it also provides a fantastic approach to investing that sophisticated investors can incorporate as well.Greenblatt outlines two factors that he believes are the best indicators of future success: Earnings Yield and Return on Equity (he modifies the normal calculations slightly). He makes an excellent argument that these two factors should be foremost in an investors mind and shows how a relative ranking of stocks according to these measures will ensure that there are always stocks that qualify, regardless of the overall market cycle.If you are a beginner, you can use his website to find his recommended stocks and start investing.

I tend to leave money in CDs and mutual funds and forget about it). However, I have done a bit of reading, and know enough to smell BS or something that has the ring of truth.Greenblatt's book is aimed at the very naive (in the sense of not knowing much, not in the sense of being stupid or gullible) investor. That is, the average American who thinks s/he can use \\"common sense\\" and a few hot tips or some \\"expert opinions\\" on TV to pick good stocks. The early chapters are a very, very simple explanation of how the stock market works. Simple enough for a ten-year-old. Then he goes on to explain his \\"magic formula,\\" which might sound like hucksterism, but basically it's a highly simplified version of Benjamin Graham's \\"value investing\\" strategy. (Graham was the guy who taught Warren Buffet.) The idea is basically: Buy high-value companies that are currently priced too low, do this consistently, and most importantly (and the reason why everyone isn't doing it): hang on for years. Greenblatt spends a lot of time emphasizing this: the market goes up and down, and you will see your portfolio go down, sometimes for years consecutively. The only reason following his or any strategy makes sense is if you believe that over the long run, it will perform well with the peaks outweighing the valleys. Most people will be enamored of a strategy until they've been watching all their stocks go down, down, down for two years straight (which is bound to happen now and then) and then they panic, sell, and move to some more promising strategy.Greenblatt shows pretty compelling evidence that value investing does work, and consistently beats the market over a time frame of 5, 10 or 30 years, even with periodic dips and recessions. And he gives step by step instructions on how to pursue this strategy. But the main thing is you have to believe in it enough to stick with it, even during temporary periods where even the market average is beating your results.Also, important caveat: he uses historical information and he explains the principles behind the strategy (i.e., which underly Graham's value investment model) in a simple and clear way, so they really do make sense. But, the stock market is a capricious beast: no one can be sure that for the next thirty years it won't suddenly start behaving in a wildly different manner. So, no guarantees, no matter how much sense anyone's advice seems to make.Greenblatt also glosses over a few things, like fees (even for intermittent stock purchases, the fees can add up), and he barely touches on taxes, which can also take a bite out of your investment. He does mention IRAs, but does not explain them. That's understandable; this is a slim book and going into taxes and retirement funds and exactly where and how to buy stocks would bloat it quickly. But while I think his advice is sound, this book alone doesn't quite give you enough information to run out and start investing. But it will certainly give you a good start. Most importantly, if you take his advice, even if you don't follow his strategy precisely, you'll know better than to try day-trading or other short-term strategies (he tells the reader outright that unless you're a professional business analyst and probably not even then, you should not try to stock-pick on your own), and you'll be ready to commit to investing for the long term."},{"Title":"The Little Book That Beats the Market","review":"I liked this book as it gives one a very simple approach to investing that works - especially in a bull market.

I can, however, clarify a glaring misconception in what Goldblatt wrote in his book.Contrary to what many of the reviewers wrote (especially the negative reviewers), Goldblatt was not insisting that people focus only on Return on Assets and P/E ratio. Goldblatt was also not insisting on a definition of \\"capital\\" (within his concept of \\"return on capital\\")that leads to an over-emphasis on services over manufacturing. He illustrated perfectly his two pieces of investment data in the following ways:First, Return on Capital can be best interpreted as a return on invested capital. If it costs $1 million to build a retail store and that store, within a year, generates $2 million, then the ROC is 100%.Second, his other measure is really a profit-yield per share. You get this measure by taking the amount of profit generated by a firm, dividing it by the number of shares outstanding, and then dividing that by the share price times 100. So, if a company has a $1 million profit and it's selling a million shares for $10 a share, then the profit-yield per share is 10%.These two concepts seem to form the core of value investing in that they discipline a person to invest in the market as if they were buying a business or a partnership share in the business. The relevant question in any such investment is always \\"how much will my partnership share make?\\"All other factors are just risk management.The trick is finding data to generate these statistics.

So when there is no good reason to struggle through 475 pages that are not being enjoyed the barbed review she gets to write at the end seems to be the purpose. I suspect an axe being ground.I have no qualms about a chapter apologizing for digression. That's called irony, and THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE is, in my opinion, a fabulous sarcastic take on American politics during Dunne's thinking life. Yes, time does skip about - this is no easily digested summer reading. Not Faulkner-esque, but it does require some willingness to keep track of characters and what we already know about them. The style is much more like Twain, poking intellectual laugh-out-loud fun at the mighty. There is lots of graphic language, but then the mighty do lots of graphic things, and Dunne's language is not gratuitous but a fair representation of the characters he has drawn. Including a priest who does not indulge himself but knows that most people do and has no compunction about spending time in their company, and describing them aptly.I read for pleasure only, from Faulkner to Oprah Book Club (not many of the latter, admittedly).

I will be reading a lot more by this author."},{"Title":"Red White & Blue","review":"ISBN 0312909659 - There's a Kennedy-esque-ness to this book in some ways, but it's much more a Kennedy-wanna-be. Dunne can't seem to fit all the Kennedy into one family, so spreads it out over two connected clans.Jack Broderick, the narrator, is the son of Hugh, a self-made billionaire who only becomes free to pursue his goals when his wife dies. He has high hopes for his three children - and even before the book begins, the sons have pretty much failed him. Only the daughter comes close, by marrying the president's brother. President Fritz Finn and his family are more the Kennedy-type than the Brodericks, but the two families are close and remain that way even after the death of Jack's sister. With Hollywood connections, lots of money, the fringe \\"revolutionary\\" elements of the 1960s and politics playing an obviously large role, the Kennedy-like images are all there.Bro, Jack's brother, is an unusual priest with a high profile and connections around the world. Jack meets and marries Leah, an outspoken radical Jewish lawyer. She remains his one real love, even after their divorce. After the end of their marriage, Jack finds himself in Vietnam, where he interviews servicemen. Those interviews are later turned into a bestselling book which plays a surprising role in the rest their lives. When Bro and Leah are murdered, the killer and his connection to Jack ties the entire story neatly together.The story skips around so much that it's sometimes hard to tell where you are in the timeline, who is married to who, and who is alive or dead at that point - and it's really hard to care. That a chapter begins with the phrase \\"Let me digress\\" is sort of silly; half of the book or more is the narrator digressing. The language in the book is a little rough, if you're the type who cares, with racial slurs and \\"bad words\\" for parts of the anatomy abounding. Almost everyone seems to have slept with almost everyone else in the book, but it's the 1960s and probably not surprising. Still, rampant sex and swearing will be outweighed by good writing and a good story - sadly, The Red White and Blue has neither.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Beautiful Risk, The","review":"I am a graduate student in counseling and a lay counselor at my church who has read many books on counseling and related issues over the years.

It is both a philisophy of counseling as a Christian and a very good book on both counseling technique and practice.

I would still like to understand how Sharif Sharif, an oil company chemist, apparently a serial rapist, was able to commit multiple rapes, with little punishment, and was deported, not back to Egypt, but to Mexico. The author contends that Sharif committed rapes and murders in Juarez, and then master-minded more from behind bars.The book would have been much improved by background information on the rape cases, and the involvement of his oil-company employers in helping him get off with little or no punishment. The author's speculations and personal opinions were substituted for actual investigation of facts and court records. A two-page tirade about the abnormality of homosexuality and frequent quotes from Colin Wilson don't make up for lack of solid investigative work.The author did have some interesting ideas about how the young women killed were exploited by the factories which employed them, then by their attackers, and then by feminist political groups. I'd go a little further and say that the author joined in and exploited the victims as well, as there are few attempts to accurately reconstruct these women's lives or portray them as real people. There are quotations from other authors, a lot of philosphical ramblings (until you think you are reading an endless freshman comp lit paper), but little compassion, and quite a bit of breathless fascination with Sharif's cunning, charisma, and personal appearance."},{"Title":"Crossing to Kill: The True Story of the Serial-Killer Playground (Virgin True Crime)","review":"A complete mess - all filler and no content.

Some idea of its scope can be had from the fact that the author, in discussing the Egyptian/Muslim background of the serial killer in question (one Sharif Omar), actually touches down in Afghanistan and describes rapes committed by a highly misogynistic set of men called the Taleban. Not so surprising, you might think, but this is in a book first published in 2000. The author's obvious animus against organized religion paid off there, in a sick kinda way, but I wasn't so happy about his attacks on the Catholic church, which has undoubtedly done far more good in the Mexican context than harm. On the other hand, there were some vivid descriptions of Mexican life (and wildlife) and settings and a fascination with the minutiae of human psychology and behavior to set against the strong and even bigoted opinions expressed, and I feel myself attracted almost against my will into a second read. Not only have I never read a true-crime book that explained why jaguars' eyes glow at night, I never imagined it was possible, let alone that it might be relevant to the psychology of serial killing. I'm not sure there's method in the madness of connexions like that but watching them being drawn was sometimes fun."},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"Moliere's &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; is the most humorous play written in any language. It centers around the character Alceste, who has a firm beleif in being brutally honest all the time. The habit of others to speak harshly behind other's backs and hypocritically praise them to their faces drives him to the brink of insanity. It irks him so much that his only wish would be to become a hermit in the mountains. If it weren't for his love of the beautiful Celimene. However, to make things more complicated, she happens to be the queen of duplicitous thought. Alceste hates himself for loving a woman who behaves in the manner that irritates him the most, but cannot bring himself to confront what troubles him. That, paired with the remarkably written exchanges between Alceste, his friend Philinte, the pompous Oronte, and the many social courtiers and French aristocracy make this the ideal story to bring you to tears with laughter. I highly recommend this book to all lovers of theater, humor, and excellent writing. It truly deserves all 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"Donald M. Frame's translations of fourteen Moliere comedies (seven in this volume and another seven in *Tartuffe and Other Plays*) are delightful. Not that Moliere's plays have lacked for translators; some versions have made the comedies leaden and dull, while others have added their own luster to the text in a way that distorts Moliere's intentions. Frame is more faithful to the original text than some earlier translators, while his verse does an admirable job of conveying the comic &quot;thrust&quot; that Moliere must have envisioned.Any translation of this playwright must be compared against the sparkling verse renditions of Richard Wilbur. I personally find Frame to more than hold his own here, and in fact in *The Misanthrope* to do better in giving us the sense of the author stylishly, but without the translator &quot;stealing the spotlight&quot; as much as happens in Wilbur's brilliant version. Frame's version is excellent throughout and augmented by informative introductions and notes"},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"You might not think a play in verse written in the 17th century would be accessible and entertaining today, but this one's hilarious. Somehow the formal rhyming couplets make everything funnier. Get the Donald Frame translation - I've seen some others that weren't nearly as good."},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"Although Moliere is only half a century younger than Shakespeare, he is less hard work - there is no elaborate rhetoric or difficult, metaphysical poetry. dialogue is plain and functional. This, of course, brings him nearer to us, and we are far more likely to meet a Tartuffe, say, in everyday life than a Lear or Hamlet.However, I don't think he's supposed to be this plain. Wood's translation is a nimble, enjoyable read, but in the two translations, from French to English, from metre to prose, something has been lost; maybe not poetry, but certainly language. What we are left with are breezily amusing farces - this is more than enough for me, but makes me wonder why Bloom had him in his canon.'Tartuffe' is the most famous play in this collection. Subject to censorship and interdiction in its time, Wood introduces the play with a preface and two petitions to the King from Moliere. Although they are revealing about Moliere's absolute dependency on the monarch, and the need to flatter culminating in the play's preposterous deus ex machina, they necessarily caricature the play's complexity.Tartuffe the religious hypocrite who tries to bring down the social order, who reveals the aristocracy's own hypocrisy (look at the amount of two-facedness needed to expose him), forces them down to his level, makes blatant the fundamental desires high society would prefer not to acknowledge - sex, food, wealth etc. The true horror of Tartuffe's marriage with Marianne is not that he is a repulsive bigot, but because he is trying to wrest power and means from the nobility (a job already started by the Figaro-like maid). I bet it wasn't really the Tartuffes who hated this play."},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"Moliere said that ' there is no comedy without truth, and no truth without comedy'. And his plays are a scathing and humorous depiction of a simplified, and stylized human nature. Whether it is religious hypocrisy in ' Tartuffe' , miserliness in 'The Miser' or misanthropy in ' The Misantrhope' Moliere often focuses on one quality in order to satirize and society and mankind in general. In the Misanthrope the main character Alceste tells the truth to everyone ( except himself) and in so doing alienates everyone. This is against the advice of his best friend Philinte. At the same time he is in love with the frivolous Celimene who he attempts to change by constantly criticizing. He begs that she retire with him away from the corruption of society but she prefers society to him. The play ends with Philinte and his fiancee trying to persuade Alceste to remain.Moliere writes in a clear, simple direct language and the surface sense of his work is readily understood. His view of human nature is harsh and critical , but redeemed by a comic laughter suggesting we are wiser if we do not take ourselves all that seriously."},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"It is my blief that everyone should read this book. I am a high school senior and find it very insightful. In addition to that, it is also very ammusing. It is an accurate commentary on society."},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"The Misanthrope (1666) is a short play, one that can be read in a single sitting. Moliere's humorous style has weathered the centuries quite well, and footnotes are not needed.The protagonist is the misguided misanthrope, Alceste. His distaste for mankind does have one exception. He is enamored with the attractive, vivacious Celimene, but seemingly so is everyone else including Alceste's chief rival, Oronte, the two marquises, Acaste and Clitandre, and unnamed others in the background.The first scene introduces Philinte, an avowed friend of Alceste, that is unsuccessfully trying to moderate Alceste's adamant refusal to adhere to any social convention, custom, or civility which involves any form of dissimulation or flattery. Philinte argues that Alceste should torment himself a little less about the vices of his period and be more lenient of human nature and foibles. Good sense avoids all extremes. And Philinte questions whether Alceste is perhaps inconsistent in that he applies a different standard to the coquettish Celimene. The more pragmatic Philinte suggests that Celimene's cousin, Eliante, is more sincere and stable, and would be a more compatible choice. With uncompromising honesty Alceste agrees: \\"It is true; my good sense tells me so every day; but good sense does not always rule love.\\"As the play proceeds, Moliere's misanthrope does become increasingly irritable with those about him, but I still found Alceste less mean-spirited than other misanthropes found in literature. Despite his sincere philosophical stance, Alceste remains in his awkward, humorous position relative to Celimene. It proves difficult to be a fully committed misanthrope while in love with a coquette.I am reviewing a Dover Thrift edition reprint of Moliere's famous comedic satire."},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"The Misanthrope is one of the best Moliere's plays but also one of the hardest to play.Why ? The problem, actually, is if that sounds like a drama it's a comedy.One (it might be Gide) used to say that \\"If the Misanthrope is a comedy, and if it is about virtue, then we have to laugh at virtue\\" - but it isn't.Reading the play again two weeks ago, I was amazed to see that the two main characters, Alceste and Philinte, really looked like House and Wilson (yes, those from the show !).What is funny, both in the show and in the play, is neither the insults nor the \\"idealism\\" of both lead characters (that tendancy to think that \\"truth is everything\\") but this little embarrassment to see your best friend in trouble because he doesn't know how to move into our socialized world, and seems to have not the right code nor the good manneers (\\"Please, for Christ's sake !... That's not so important ! Keep cool ! Why don't you try to be just nice and polite, even if you don't really believe what you say ??? You see, that's what we call diplomacy - that sort of thing that avoid wars most of the time\\")Alceste and House are just fantasies : everybody would like to be just like them, telling the truth all the time, as pure as fire, like Jeremiah - but it is just impossible, not in our world - and that gap is funny."},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"Moliere deals with numerous common themes in his short five-act play. The play follows the throes of passion of the main character (Alceste), obsessed with his love for Celimene while being plagued by his need for truth, often at the unsociable expense of bluntness. His friend (Philinte) attempts to dissuade Alceste both in his love for Celimene and his brusque honesty, but fails in both. Aleceste finally ends up retiring to a hermit-esque fate after ironically forgiving Celemine for courting the favor and advances of a number of other admirers, all of whom end up enraged with her flattery and lack of direction. In a brief 52 pages, Moliere pointed debates the virtues of &quot;niceness&quot; and &quot;truth,&quot; two seemingly mutually exclusive virtues, leaving the reader with a provoking but conclusionless sense of indecision."},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"[This review is for the Dover Thrift Edition, based on the 1876 Henri Van Laun translation.]Whenever one comes across comedy from a century or more ago, the \\"comedy\\" part seems lost as it belongs too, much to a different era.Not so with Moliere's \\"The Misanthrope\\". Although written some 350 years ago, it is a funny and clever today as ever (actually, much cleverer today, given the state of today's comedy in comparison).The key is that the characters and situations presented are as common today as in 17th century France. The hypocrites, the sycophants, the two-faced, the flirts, and ofcourse the perpetually morally outraged.It is a rather short play, but immensely funny and well worth the read (the exchange between Alceste and Orontes on the latter's sonnet are hilarious!)."},{"Title":"The Misanthrope and Other Plays","review":"&quot;The Misanthrope&quot; - this is the only play I read.

Real damage was done to the landowners in Ledyard and surrounding communities, and real damage was done to Native Americans across this Country, and this Country's History. Both groups deserve far better treatment, together with a mind that acknowledges the complexity of this issue, and the complexity of any solution.I live about 90 minutes from the casino that is the topic of this book, however I have lived in Connecticut for only 4 years, so I don't claim detailed knowledge. This saga was covered widely in New England so I am somewhat familiar with the history.No one is pleased when they are forced to sell their land against their will, or have the potential buyers reduced to one. Not every person involved with this issue who either held public office or worked for the US Government is; dishonest, a thief, or ignorant to the point of incompetence.What this story is about is greed, an endless supply of opportunists, political shortcuts and short-term thinking, together with a group of landowners who were victimized or at best marginalized by those that should have been protecting their interests. The exception appears be the three local men who held political office, two who were dumped by their electorate for keeping their word, and another who did not bother to run.Jeff Benedict tips his hand before the book begins by stating this book &quot;is must reading for anyone interested in the way today's world really works&quot;. Finally the WORLD is explained by Jeff Benedict. Below is a tough-guy pose of the author, or perhaps it was something he ate. The back of the book is covered with one quote from the text; I guess no one wanted to compete with he who knows how the world works.This is an issue that spans hundreds of years. The Native Americans were consistently cheated, robbed, and exterminated by this country's government. There is no way to give the Tribes back what they were cheated out of, so what solution can possibly satisfy everyone? Those of us around today may not have participated in the wrongs done to these people, or even our ancestors. We are the ones who are here now, so we must deal with these issues. Those that are blessed with bottomless ignorance say to issues like the Native Americans, and people who's ancestors were slaves, &quot;get over it!&quot; How wonderful that delusion of simplicity must be!&quot;On The Rez&quot; by Ian Frazier gives more statistical background on Native Americans in general, and to what degree gaming plays in their economic life, as compared to this work, which failed miserably.This epic of The World's Largest Casino has got to be fascinating, and I look forward to reading several books with different viewpoints.This book has all the depth of a shadow, and the objectivity of The Inquisition. There is a great story waiting to be told, but this book is not it."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"In June 1973, Elizabeth George, the last resident of the tiny, 214-acre Western Pequot Indian Reservation in Ledyard, Connecticut, died, and, according to Author Jeff Benedict, &quot;[f]or the first time since 1683 the reservation was completely unoccupied.&quot; That sounds like the end of a story rather than the beginning, but, in fact, Mrs. George's death set in motion the series of events which Benedict, an energetic journalist, narrates here, including protracted federal court litigation, official recognition of the Pequots, and construction of a huge casino and resort on the reservation. Approximately the first third of this book is devoted to the resolution of the Pequots' claims between 1973 and 1983, which reestablished their presence on an enlarged reservation. The remainder of the book is devoted to the Pequots' construction and operation of Foxwoods, the world's largest casino, with accompanying hotels and resort facilities. Some readers will find this book the story of the righting of a great historical injustice. Others will find it a cautionary tale replete with greed, double-dealing, and, perhaps, fraud and deception. From either perspective, it is hard to put down this book.Several decades ago, the United States commenced a number on behalf of Indian tribes to regain land which had been illegally taken from them. In the 1960s, the basic requirements for an Indian land claim included requirements that the tribe remained in existence, that the tribe had not abandoned its territory, and that the land had been taken from the tribe after 1790 and without approval of the federal government. In 1966, Congress imposed a six-year statute of limitations on these lawsuits, and, in 1972, Congress extended that deadline for five years. In March 1975, Richard &quot;Skip&quot; Hayward, age 26, the eldest grandson of Elizabeth George, who was living in Maryland, but, according to Benedict, &quot;[h]e had been in and out of work since 1969 and steadily unemployed since leaving Connecticut,&quot; decided to return to, in his own words, &quot;rebuild the reservation.&quot; In April, a Maine lawyer specializing in Indian law met with Hayward and thought: &quot;The Haywards were Caucasians, did not speak a word of Pequot, were extremely few in number, and lacked the basic knowledge of the very tribe they claimed to belong to. None of them lived on the reservation. They were without a chief or tribal government.&quot; Nevertheless, according to Benedict: &quot;Property records confirmed with certainty that Connecticut had sold off eight hundred acres of Connecticut land without federal approval&quot; which would give Pequot land claims merit. In August, about 20 members of Hayward's family met near the old Elizabeth George homestead, and, according to Benedict, Hayward explained to them: &quot;To join the litigation, family members first had to join the Pequot tribe and start identifying themselves as American Indians. They need to come together and start acting like a tribe. That meant a tribal constitution had to be drafted, leaders had to be elected, and membership rolls had to be created, in order to show that the tribe was populated. Most importantly, the group had to establish residency on the reservation.&quot; At the end of the meeting, Hayward introduced a constitution which the Maine lawyer had drafted naming the organization the &quot;\`Mashantucket (Western) Pequot Tribe,' being the same organization as that referred to in Connecticut State Legislation as the \`Western Pequot Tribe' of Connecticut.&quot; Benedict reports that &quot;Mashantucket&quot; means &quot;much wooded land, and &quot;oral tradition held that [the Pequots] referred to themselves as \`the Fox people,'&quot; so they later adopted a logo portraying a fox looking into the woods as their symbol. The six-page constitution was ratified by Hayward and nine other individuals, who then elected Hayward as the first &quot;tribal chairman.&quot; Connecticut law permitted each Indian tribe in the State, according to Benedict, &quot;to determine wholly independently who would qualify&quot; as a member of the tribe. The Pequots' by-laws &quot;set a standard that admitted individuals who were \`genealogically recorded as a Western Pequot by the State of Connecticut. Anyone who could trace his or her genealogy to an individual who was identified as a Pequot Indian on the 1910 census was eligible to pay a small fee and join the tribe.&quot; As Benedict reports, a less-than-vigorous application of that rule later created problems for the Pequots.Throughout the book, various opponents outside the tribe condemn Hayward and his group as imposters, and Benedict's revelations about Hayward's lineage may be the most controversial aspect of this book. During an early meeting of the Ledyard landowners sued by the Pequots, one expressed what appeared to be a consensus view: &quot;I know Skip....He's no Indian.&quot; In fact, according to Benedict, Hayward has Indian blood, but everyone involved appears to have assumed, incorrectly, that, because Elizabeth George lived on the Pequot reservation, she was a Pequot. Benedict asserts: &quot;Congress is still empowered to ask for proof of legitimacy from those claiming to be Pequots. And if an investigation determined that the people operating Foxwoods are not really the Pequot tribe, then Congress has a remedy: Amend the 1983 law and revoke the group's federal recognition status.&quot; If that happens, it may be as disruptive as the original recognition of the Pequots and the events that followed.This book is a highly-detailed journalistic treatment of some fascinating historical, legal, and public policy issues, but I have a couple of specific criticisms. First, it inexplicably contains no index, and, given the complexity of the events, I found that very frustrating. Second, although the lengthy bibliography demonstrates Benedict conscientiousness as a reporter, I noticed several factual errors. To note just a few: Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, not 1863; Austin McGuigan served as Connecticut's chief state's attorney, not attorney general; in civil litigation, plaintiffs do not &quot;accuse&quot; defendants of anything, they &quot;allege;&quot; and the New England Patriots' stadium is in &quot;Foxboro,&quot; Massachusetts, not &quot;Foxborough.&quot; Those relatively minor points aside, this story is far from over, and I hope that Benedict will report back to us in due course."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"This is great book that exposes the fraudulent Mashantucket Pequot Tribe as anything but Indians.

I'm glad it exists and that Skip Hayward was successful in his deceptive efforts to build this casino. So I'm biased.Jeff Benedict does an excellent job of explaining the history of Foxwoods and the tribe that formed it. It is, to be sure, not a complete tale, however, as there are clear gaps in the narrative. The \\"founder\\" of Foxwoods, Skip Hayward, clearly has a story to tell about his tribe. It's omission is a glaring one. Benedict explains this by noting that Hayward refused to be interviewed. Even so, I wanted some greater balance in the telling of the tale. It left me curious about the other side of the story.The bottom line is that Benedict does an excellent job of telling the story of Foxwoods conception that rests dirty and unseen beneath the glitz, the profit and the popularity. he tells it in an engaging and persuasive manner.

I defy anyone to believe that the Ledyard Pequots have any right to claim they are a tribe, based on clear criteria described by the Federal Government but never applied in this case.Kudos to Mr. Benedict on this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"The chief problem with this book was the author's tendancy to ignore facts (such as the George family's well documented Pequot ancestry) in an effort to weaken the present-day Pequot's claim. A much more telling arguement is that the Tribal community had disintegrated completely, and that while the Reels and Hayward families were certainly Pequot descendants, the tribal unit no longer existed in any recognizable form. There was, for example, no church, school, or community organization which provided structure or leadership to the community. It is very unlikly that these descendants, most of whom self-identified racially as Black or white, would have gained recognition under the procedures of the BIA, but they were able to do an end run around the rules, and gain official recognition which they certainly did not deserve. The book makes interesting reading to anyone interested in Indian claims, or the current state of affairs with the dozens of &quot;tribes&quot; currently seeking official status"},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"This book has received much publicity because it is a typical anti-establishment narrative. However, the author loses the forest for the trees in his argument about the Pequot's alleged &quot;fraud.&quot;While it may be true that the Pequot tribe in its current form does not have as much Native &quot;pedigree&quot; as some other tribes, that does not necessarily mean that they are being deceitful. Native people were historically forced to assimilate and were made to feel shameful of their lineage and it is thus not surprising that some of them had claimed to be &quot;white&quot; at some parts of their life. This reality in fact adds to the tragedy of native persecution.Moreover, on a factual basis, the descendents of the Pequot tribe started to seek government recognition long before the casino was even an idea (see the concluding chapter of Thomas's book Skull Wars in this regard).What is even more troubling about this book is that it is suggesting a reversal of governmental policy towards Native Americans in terms of compensation for past injustices. In a recent radio interview the author suggested that we should &quot;let bygones be bygones&quot; -- I think the author does not have a full appreciation for the kind of genocide that Native communities have endured. It is easy to say that &quot;well we were not the ones persecuting them then, &quot; but the whole point is that there were clear violations of treaties and other agreements by settler governments that are meant to be valid for time immemorial unless otherwise stated. The US Supreme Court recognized as early as 1905 (in US v. Winans) that a treaty was in fact a right given by Indians to settlers and not vice versa. Indian sovereignty, the court recognized, predated the settlers.Even if there were no treaties (as is the case in British Columbia or Australia), there should still be a recognition of past injustices -- isn't that what Western notions of timeless truth are all about?This book is thus quite myopic in its view of Native American politics, despite the assiduous research about the case in question."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"Jeff Benedict's book &quot;Without Reservation&quot; shows that Indian Tribes are treated like a religion, except they do not have to prove they are a non-profit, tax-exempt organization. Since church groups are controlled by majority rule, the FOXWOODS group was vulnerable to a takeover by Mr. Kenneth M. Reels and his followers. Church takeovers occur all the time, when new members replace old members. Church leaders are replaced and a new pastor is selected. Several years ago, the &quot;CBS 60 Minutes&quot; program broadcast an infamous church takeover in Laguna Beach.A religious sect was led by an Asian-Indian guru. The sect members joined the Laguna Beach Church in great numbers. They overwhelmed the prior church membership and the leadership was changed. In short time, the church building and land was sold at a great profit. The religious sect relocated to Oregon. Amid much controversy, TV Media shined the spotlight on the sect's Guru as he was seen driving around in several of his personally owned 100 Rolls Royces automobiles ($100,000.00 per copy).The sect's guru was eventually returned by the U.S. Federal Government to his native India on the Asian Continent. Meanwhile, Laguna Beach Church members, many elderly, lost their building and land.As pointed out by Jeff Benedict and the &quot;Reader From Fresno, California&quot;, FICTIONAL Indian Tribes can be taken over. There is NO clear definition of an Indian Tribe, because its Indian Membership can change almost daily. At will, the current tribal leadership (&quot;in power today and maybe gone tomorrow&quot;) can add favored members to increase their power.

According to the book &quot;Without Reservation&quot;, Indians can operate illegal slot machines only if slot machines do not fall under state criminal code. However, Governor Davis and nearly one-hundred percent of the CA legislature voted to allow CA Indian Tribes to operate Criminally Illegal Slot Machines. These politicians received millions of dollars in contributions from the CA Indian Tribes. If their vote was not bought, it still looks like it! The CA tribal memberships change almost daily, with members being dis-enrolled to increase the money received by remaining members. The CA Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney say that CA Tribes are sovereign and can be taken over by any group, for example &quot;Oranized Crime&quot;. Their comments indicate that they don't care if NO original CA tribal members remain on the membership rolls!

Some are apparently designed to hype the importance of the cast of characters -- for example, the idea that Susan McCulloch &quot;discovered&quot; Zara Ciscoe Brough on the Hassanamisco Nipmuc reservation in Grafton, Massachusetts, when the reservation there had held an annual Indian fair open to the public since at least the 1920's, with newspaper coverage, etc. The genealogical errors are worse. Benedict attempts to trace the Western or Mashantucket Pequot lineage of the current membership. However, he first states that the paternal-line ancestor of many members, Cyrus George, was &quot;Black,&quot; ignoring that both Cyrus and his parents were on the Connecticut State overseers' reports as Western Pequot regularly through the 19th century. He then states that Martha Hoxie, Cyrus' wife, was possibly Indian, but Narragansett, by misidentifying her mother, Jane Grant, as the same person as Mary Jane Grant. Jane was descended from Betsy and Caroline Wheeler, who also appeared on both Connecticut overseer's reports and Federal census records in the 19th century as Western Pequot. Based on these serious factual errors, he contends that the current tribe has no connection to the historical tribe. His assertions are simply mistaken.

Reviewers prone to play the race card, be it Indian, Black, Asian...are missing the point that every American should be considering. The point is: Our American democracy has been nurturing and expanding the lands of &quot;federally recognized tribes&quot; for decades now, and the reality is that these monarchial sovereign governments are now completely overwhelming the very democracy that gave them birth. [These] are government-to-government issues, - not culture. This is the message I take from Jeff Benedict's recital of facts in &quot;Without Reservation.&quot; This book demonstrates the grim reality of what happens when &quot;sovereign&quot; governments take over large geographic spaces, giving all other U.S. citizens no voice, no mercy, and no democracy. There are currently 558 federally recognized tribes across our country, representing less than 2,000,000 Native Americans, and less than half of those actually live on these &quot;sovereign&quot; government lands. Given the present federal push and rollover, creating monied Tom Tureens, and facilitating tribal government expansion, so well described by Benedict, - just watch in at least 37 states, private property fall away from state and local property tax rolls, [people] such as Skip Hayward assume positions of leadership in newly recognized tribes...and all hell to pay for all cultures, including Native Americans themselves. This is a MUST read! We are a melting pot of equally wonderful and important cultures and races, none having superiority over another. But the real terror is that we are rapidly becoming a democracy being increasingly gutted economically and politically by pseudo-sovereign governments set up by our own federal government. We should all be outraged, not with a single Native American - but with our own federal government's willingness to undermine itself and all citizens in 50 states. No doubt, Jeff Benedict could write similar stories about tribal governments across the country. Thanks for illuminating readers about at least one of them!"},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"This controversial book raises questions about the legitimacy of the claims of Skip Hayward and his family that they are the Pequot Indian Tribe and deserving of the federal recognition that allows them to operate Foxwoods, the world's largest casino, free from government regulation and taxation. The author presents thoroughly researched information, which is well documented. The claims made in the book have stirred up quite a controversy in Connecticut and California. Opponents of the book, and specifically the Tribal representatives, criticize the credibility of the author and the information he presents. However, their focus on minor typos can deter attention from the true issue for only so long. If the claims made by Benedict are not true, then the Tribal Representatives should have no problem turning over the appropriate documentation and genealogical records to prove that they truly are the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and do meet the various requirements of the BIA's review process to determine whether or not they qualify for the benefits afforded them by their status as a Federally recognized tribe.

Some of the information about the road to recognition of the Mashantucket Pequots was known to people in North Stonington who were researching the annexation issue back in 1993. But we were so focused on the immediacy of the impending federal decisions we didn't have the time to pursue those issues nor the talent to put the pieces together as Jeff Benedict has. Our towns were in danger of disappearing before our eyes.Now, in the year 2000, there are about nine other &quot;tribes&quot; in Connecticut trying to jump on the federal recognition/Indian casino bandwagon. Congress and the BIA seem ready and willing to remove lands from state and local control and create these so-called Indian Nations. Hawaii, New York, Virginia , Alaska and elsewhere are all facing Indian recognition issues.The people in &quot;Without Reservation&quot; are real people and they are still faced with many of the same issues addressed in the book. Jeff Benedict said there should be a Congressional investigation into the 1983 Mashantucket Pequot Settlement Act. The leaders of the towns of Ledyard, Preston and North Stonington agree and have recently written to Congress asking for one.The citizens of these towns are also asking Congress for an investigation of the Settlement Act and of the whole Indian Recognition process of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Politics &amp; Government-USA section of petitionOnline.com.If the Mashantuckets have verifiable documentation of their lineage and can explain the discrepancy between the acreage in the text of the Act and the red-outlined Map (which no one has yet been able to locate) then they should be glad to present it in the open forum of a Congressional Hearing to clear away the cloud that hangs over their enterprise and that would be the end of it. Without answers to questions such as Jeff Benedict has raised we're in for a lot of stormy weather.Betty Perkowski"},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"This is a must read book!

The author has documented in extraordinary detail (with his sources identified) how this occurred, including the deception of the US Congress. I live in the town that neighbors Foxwoods and have been living with its effects since it opened. I also have been directly involved in dealing with the &quot;tribe&quot; and I can attest to the accuracy of some of what has been exposed by this book. But even I have been amazed at what the author has discovered and documented. You may hear claims that this book is anti-Indian and even racist, but it is far from it. Indeed it points out how true Native American tribes have not been helped by Indian gaming while this bogus tribe has become incredibly wealthy. This is an absolute must read."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"Dynamite expose on the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe.

At that time, there was only bingo on the reservation. Also, many of the residents of the reservation were not tribal members at all. They were poor people who needed a place to live. Jeff Benedict portrayed this time well, I thought.I was in ninth grade when we moved to Ledyard and am familar with several people mentioned in the book, and their children. Reading this book was reminicient for me, but more so for my husband. A resident of Ledyard for sixteen years, he holds great contempt for what the casino stands for. For him, it is not necessarily a contempt for the Pequots (though I use that term loosely after reading this book) but for what they have done to the landscape of his beloved home town. He used to hike Lantern Hill and appreciate the view. That view is now of the towers of the casino. He also camped at the Lake of Isles Boy Scout reservation and ate at Mr. Pizza. I thought Jeff Benedict did a terrific job describing the landscape as it was then as opposed to how it is now.This book is an expose that was very informative. The annexation fight was happening after we moved from Ledyard, but we vividly remember the signs dotting Route 2. The lines of the annexation spread right to the front door of our close family friends. This leads me to the character of the person I thought was most dispicable in this book -- Jackson King. The fact that he drew that map while he was representing the Ledyard landowners is atonishing! I shouldn't have been suprised when he went to work for the tribe, but I was.I was also suprised by the way I felt about Skip Hayward and Mickey Brown at the end of the book. I guess some would say that his fall from power was karmic, but I did find myself (if only for a second) feeling as if he got a raw deal. He will never have to work again, but he has lost control of what he fought so hard to build. Whether that fight was a clean one is questionable, but he may have to stand by now as his empire runs itself into the ground."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, well written and full of suspense.

This book should be a mandatory read for all Californian lawmakers before they allow any more Indian casinos to open up in our state."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"It is interesting that most of the reviewers of Jeff Benedict's book are from Ledyard CT. That just happens to be the location of the much maligned Connecticut Pequot Casino known as Foxwoods. Could it be that these are non-Indian land owners that were 'burned' by the perfectly legal indigenous land reclaimations?Needless to say these folks are mostly middle-class European-Americans who are angry about land the they seemingly purchased legally with title searches back to the mid 19th century. Unforunately they did not go back far enough to discover previous European-Americans who ILLEGALLY stole this land from the Mashantucket-Pequots (et al).This book is quite politically biased and seems suspicously timed not long after a Italian-American former President and CEO of Foxwoods who was ousted by the tribe with the help of a former New Jersey State Prosecutor famous for de-criminalizing Atlantic City gaming.All this book will do is spark unecessary and frivolous government investigations which will be used to try and knock down legal and morally justified Indian Gaming in this nation.Another example of European-Americans breaking more treaties and stealing more resources from indeginous peoples of America.Just because Jeff did not know Skip Hayward was Indian does not villify the man as a fraud! Many Indian tribes in this nation are run by fractional-blood Indians. Why is that? It's called GENOCIDE! There are not that many full-blooded Indians left due to European-American expansionism from 1600's (Pilgrims) to now.Also the Rhode Island Narrangesset Indians were sworn enemies of the Peqouts and allegedly assisted (to a lesser extent than Uncas) ancient Connecticut 17th century white government (allegedly with Uncas the Mohegan's help) to immorally and illegally (i.e., a non British-crown sanctioned act by Governor Mason) massacre most of the tribe. Many survived the final battle in the Fairfield swamps later resettling BACK in Ledyard area. Therefore the assertion that the land is actually Narraganssett land is ludicrous.HOWEVER, I DO recommend that you read Jeff's book. I only caution you to read it with descernment and not take everything he says as 'gospel'. Especially since no one truly knows his true motivation for writing it except him. Only a small 'special interest group' seem to have a vested interest in the collapse of Indian gaming in Connecticut if not the nation.Chief Massasoit II(The Greater Metacomet)"},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"I read this last night in one sitting.

Twenty years ago this area was woods. But can a group of self proclaimed Indians claim this area and build what has become the largest casino in the world? Yes because they did it.

But for those who have an interest in federal Indian law, Indian gaming, and the genuine history of the tribe, the book is short on substance and grand on generalizations.The book is also laughable in parts for its weak attempt at explaining Indian law to those who know little of it.Benedict makes several slip-ups in his assessment of events, mostly with Skip Hayward's self-identification of himself as Indian. Its begins early on, with his retelling of Hayward's first meeting with then Maine Commissioner of Indian Affairs John Stevens.This is a serious flaw, as Benedict hinges much of his attack on Hawyard and the tribe on members who allegedly referred to themselves as white.There are also problems with Benedict's lack of direct reference to crucial legislation. For instance, Benedict's criticism of the Pequot's view of themselves as a &quot;corporation&quot; is without direct reference to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. A layperson might simply believe Benedict's conclusions about the tribe rather than investigate the legal backdrop to the issues.The book's style and tone are problematic. He never interviewed Hayward nor any tribal member first hand, yet he presents conversations as if they were heard first hand, when in fact they were conducted second hand with disgruntled partners, former employees, and prior contacts, including Hayward's first two wives. Corroboration of key conversations does not seem to prevent Benedict from painting them in a light less favorable to the Pequots.Benedict also employs devices and retorts more familiar to racist, anti-Indian movements than serious journalism. What Benedict claims are privileges afforded to Indian tribes are actually rights. What Benedict claims are rights are actually privileges. Issues such as taxation, regulation, and tribal membership are freely thrown about, giving off the impression that the point Benedict sorely needs his book to make cannot be backed up with real proof so Benedict must rely on double talk and sleight-of-hand to convince the already convinced that the Pequots aren't real.Benedict has a racial fixation, it seems. When a BIA employee comes out to the reservation to survey land to be placed into trust, he makes it a point to say the man is &quot;7/8 Indian.&quot;One might ask why his publisher would not provide copies for review. Academics and legal experts will have serious problems with the book."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"In his recent work, &quot;Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods, the World's Largest Casino,&quot; author Jeff Benedict attacks the Mashantucket Pequot Nation's history, integrity and governmental status in an attempt to undermine their very existence as an Indian nation.The novel is written as a series of vignettes, woven together through the use of fictional dialogue, leaving the impression that Benedict is simply re-constructing a story or connecting the pieces of a puzzle. For example, it represents conversations in quotation marks and locates them all in the present tense. While this technique is useful as a dramatic device, it nonetheless elides the fact that these conversations--overwhelmingly those of characters hostile to the Mashantucket Pequots, including the editorial voice of the author beneath them all--were not recorded. The quotations lend a sense of verbatim to what are either recreated conversations built solely from the memories of those hostile to the Mashantucket Pequots or conversations wholly invented by the author after perusing public documents. Benedict's rhetorical strategy makes for dramatic reading, but it also obscures two important questions: how complete is Benedict's information and more importantly, why is he writing this book now?Benedict's research is highly selective. Many of his interviews are with disgruntled former BIA employees and the ex-wife of former tribal chairman Skip Hayward, hardly unbiased sources. Even more problematically, Benedict spoke to no more than a couple of Mashantucket Pequot tribal members for the book, rendering his work only one-half of a conversation at best. This lopsided approach plays on the two greatest prejudices emerging in the era of Indian nation governmental gaming. First, that some people benefiting from Indian casinos are not really Indian. And second, that some Indian nations have a special relationship with the Federal government that they do not deserve. Of course, both of these prejudices rely on definitions and images of &quot;Indian&quot; that are archaic and manufactured.So why is Benedict writing this story now? The anti-Indian sentiment in Benedict's book clearly touches a nerve in contemporary New England, where two other Indian nations are under review for federal recognition. Lawyers in the local Connecticut towns who are opposing the recognition of the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots and the Eastern Pequots have cited Benedict's book in a petition to U. S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, asking him to abandon the proposed preliminary recognition of the two tribes. Using Benedict's book as &quot;evidence&quot; is a dangerous precedent and clearly a political ploy to call into question the integrity and intentions of all Native people of New England.While Benedict's expose format may be popular and easy to market, it is an inappropriate style for writing about the complexities of American Indian identity and federal acknowledgement. By creating an oversimplified and antagonistic scenario pitting tribal members against non-Indians, the book deliberately overlooks the ways that Foxwoods and other Mashantucket Pequot development projects have benefitted local Indian and Non-Indian communities alike. By novelizing events and simplifying the facts, Benedicts book distracts his readers from the historic social and economic impacts that gaming has brought to Connecticut. As provocative as the topic of this book seems, equating its sketchy research with &quot;evidence&quot; is as irresponsible as equating a tabloid story with investigative journalism."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"In my opinion, Mr. Benedict has written a thorough and well-researched study of the Mashantucket tribe and the effect its casino has had on southeastern CT. Living within five miles of the casino gives me a unique perspective on how the tribe has treated local communities and the general population. I would take issue with anyone who criticizes Mr. Benedict's scholarship in failing to interview tribal members, and I would like to quote the New London (CT) Day, April 28, 2000: &quot;Benedict said that he interviewed 650 people for (the book) but repeated requests to interview tribal members were denied. He gave the tribe copies of his previous books and other examples of his work ... and outlined what he wanted to talk about. He offered to make a presentation before the tribal council. He did all this, he said, before he talked to anyone else. After the election of Kenneth Reels as tribal chairman, ... he was contacted by the tribe's public relations dept. and told him he could interview tribal councilor Michael Thomas. But the interview kept getting cancelled. When (he) traveled to Mashantucket to find that yet another interview was canceled, he gave up trying, he said.&quot; I hope people understand that this has been the modus operandi of this tribe since day one and that the only way ever to write about them seems to be without their consent, an arrogant tactic on their part that precludes any cooperation with the community as a whole.

No competent journalist interested in a fair and accurate treatment of a tribe as controversial as this would consider that an adequate effort. There is a fascinating tale of who these people are, of how they achieved what they have, whether by hook or by crook, of how the money and change in status has affected both them and the region. Unfortunately Mr. Benedict has chosen to take the easy way out and has written a utterly simplistic and superfifical treatment of a far richer and complex story of America today."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"I should declare my interest in that I am an attorney who represents Indian tribes conducting casino gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. I also know Tom Tureen personally, and while I'm not a close friend of his (and have occasionally disagreed with him) I do consider him to be an ethical and moral person, who would never perpetrate a fraud. I know a number of other persons who figure in Mr Benedict's book, such as the former Eastern Area Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Mr Bill Ott, and Mr Bill Wakole, who was fired for pretty much doing his job. Both Ott and Wakole were dedicated federal employees who were not just time-serving bureaucrats, but who took especial pains to see that Indian people got what they were entitled to. I also have been involved in the recognition process for other tribes. The Mashantuckets are deemed to be unusual in the book, because they were recognized by legislation, but that really isn't so unusual, and, in fact, I think it is more proper than the present method of making a group seeking recognition satisfy various criteria, some of dubious validity. When one gets right down to it, the relationship between an Indian tribe and the federal government is a political one, not based upon anthropological or ethnological or genealogical factors. When the invading Europeans met the original inhabitants of the American continent, they didn't read off a check-list of categories such as polity, blood quantum, written historical records, and the like. They entered in agreements with them, and solicited their aid in getting about the newly-discovered territory.There wasn't a lot of paper-pushing back then. In the case of the Mashantuckets, Mr Benedict raises some serious questions, but, on his strongest point, the dearth of genealogical evidence as to the Mashantucket Pequots, there is quite a bit of evidence to the contrary of his confident assertion that Elizabeth George Plouffe, the last Pequot living on the Western Pequot Reservation, was not even of Indian descent. The census records and the reports of the Connecticut Indian commission, contemporary documents, say otherwise. But there is another, rather nasty aspect about Benedict's book: he never comes out and says it directly, but a lot of the problem he has with Chairman Ken Reels and the present Tribal Council arises out of the fact that these persons have dark skin, and are obviously descended from African-Americans. In other words, these &quot;black&quot; Indians really stick in his craw. While this anti-black sentiment, unfortunately, can be seen among some few Native Americans who are only reflecting the anti-black racism of American society, nevertheless, a lot of the present animosity directed against the Mashantucket undoubtedly stems from this. The Connecticut towns and their supporters disavow it, but their whole opposition has taken on a racist, anti-black cast since Mr Reels appeared on the Tribal Council. It is disingenuous to deny it: it's there, it's palpable and it's disgraceful, and it disfigures Mr Benedict's book. I also found horrendous errors in the book, some of them quite basic legal mistakes, which makes me wonder whether Mr Benedict passed his course in Real Property in the law school he claims to be attending. In fact, he gets a number of things so wrong, that it makes me think that he's got a hell of a nerve accusing the Mashantuckets of wholesale fraud when his attempt to show a learned knowledge of Indian law falls so resoundingly flat. Another thing that I found objectionable in the book, and which I would have thought HarperCollins would've edited out, is these gratuitous references to Skip Hayward's alleged spousal abuse. It's hard for me to see what all of this has to do with the fraudulent representations charged to Chairman Hayward by Mr Benedict, even if one would assume, and only for the sake of argument, that they are true. All it is, is a crude smear tactic which, as all such must, ends up in making the author look bad.

His sources are for only eight of the 41 chapters. You call this an expose? He's lifted quotes out of CT newspapers and does not accept their (unintended) bias against Native Americans. Journalists in CT have admitted the Pequots have a closed reservation and lack access to the tribe and its members. Any hope for balanced reporting? Not. You have to be an Indian, historically misrepresented, to really get the twisted picture of Benedict's book... There are plenty of books about the Pequots. Check out their museum. Tribal members are alive and well, living on the reservation. Will Benedict recant his story next year like he did with his last? When do the American Indians get to speak? While Benedict collects his millions for the book and movie rights, there is a new war about Tribal federal recognition and added hostility between the town and tribe. Who was duped?"},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"After reading Jeff Benedict's book Without Reservation, I knew it was all about money and not about the truth. I came to this conclusion with two questions to myself. Is there any one single individual who was involved in the passage of the 1983 Mashantucket Pequot Land Claims Settlement Act that supports Benedict's allegations that Congress was duped? No. Could I identify as a factual matter (not Benedict's opinion) any new and compelling evidence in the book or since its publication that would warrant a Congressional investigations and hearings? No. Apparently Congress doesn't think so either. The fact is, Mr. Benedict wrote a novel that can be best described by his own words. 'The best lies are often times laced with bits of the truth.' I couldn't have said it better myself."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"Has Jeff Benedict no brain? Did he actually research this issue or did he fabricate this story while balancing his checkbook?I have lived in the area my entire life. I have worked for the tribe for six years. I am a descendant of a Pequot. Did Benedict contact me or my family? No. Did I ever see him on the Reservation, inquiring of natives, looking into the Museum and Research Center? No. Is his book correct? No.Benedict uses fallacy to line his pockets with monies from the sales of his book by folks in surrounding towns who are looking for someone to tell them that the Pequots are non-existant and those claiming Pequot heritage are bad.Did Benedict ever consider that the reason Richard &quot;Skip&quot; Hayward reported himself as &quot;white&quot; on his marriage records was because the tribe was not recognized at that time? Probably not.Quite frankly, it seems the only thing that Benedict was thinking about when he researched, wrote, and published this book was himself - laughing all the way to the bank at everyone's emotional expense.Tonight, Benedict will be at the Ledyard High School to talk to the people. I will be in attendance to see how he tells the public about my heritage and how he believes it doesn't exist. Glad to know he is going to tell me about my non-existance.Perhaps Jeff Benedict should change his name to Benedict Arnold, as he is screwing the residents of area towns and making a mockery of native tribes, while fleeing to his cushy pad in Boston, counting the money he gained on a bunch of lies.You are a real piece of work, Benedict.

Well, I read all of Grisham and Benedict is no John Grisham."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"\\"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods, the World's Largest Casino\\" by Jeff Benedict is an absorbing portrait of an extraordinary phenomenon - the emergence from obscurity within the past three decades of the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe and their rapid climb to unparalleled wealth through their Foxwoods Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut. I am sure that many people view these events as a particularly gratifying example of a \\"rags to riches\\" story, given the justifiable sympathy now widely felt towards Native Americans after centuries of betrayal and injustice. However, as someone who has spent most of his adult life as a resident of southeastern Connecticut and who is personally acquainted with some of the people discussed in Benedict's book, I have been long aware that the story of the Pequots and their casino is more complex and perhaps less inspirational than might appear at first glance.\\"Without Reservation\\" raises serious questions about whether the Mashantucket Pequots are who they claim to be, a legitimate tribe of Native Americans. Simply put, are they instead merely opportunists claiming an Indian identity to fraudulently cash in on laws and programs intended to help genuine Native Americans? Some historic tribes in the East after centuries of intermarriage with persons of European and/or African descent and through acculturation with the white society have ceased to exist. According to Benedict's research, Richard \\"Skip\\" Hayward, the leader who formulated and led the supposed resurrection of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in the 1970's, has no traceable Pequot ancestry at all. Benedict contends that Hayward's entire Indian descent comes solely through his great-great-grandfather, a man who identified himself not as a Pequot, but as a Narragansett (ironically, the Narragansetts were one of the tribes who allied themselves with the English during the 17th Century war which destroyed the power of the original Pequot tribe). Records indicate that Hayward had consistently identified himself as being \\"white\\" until the mid-1970's when it suddenly became advantageous to claim he was a Native American to gain possession of the small \\"Western Pequot\\" reservation maintained by the State of Connecticut and to pursue a legal claim against neighboring properties. Benedict further asserts that the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, when granted Federal recognition by a special Act of Congress in 19XX, would have been wholly unable to meet the Bureau of Indian Affairs requirements for such Federal recognition. In his view, many people, sincere in their desire to help Native Americans obtain financial and cultural security, were deceived into supporting a fraudulent cause and unintentionally allowed a small group of imposters to gain extraordinary power by operating a gambling casino shielded from taxation and state regulation. The enormous quantity of dollars flowing through Foxwoods Casino has radically altered the economic structure of the region, for good or ill, and has given the Mashantuckets enormous clout through their frequent and heavy contributions to political parties and elected officials.Hayward as presented in Benedict's book is a fascinating paradox. Is he a charismatic visionary who followed his dream to skillfully lead his people into wealth and independence, or is he a deceptive manipulator who lied and cheated nearly everyone en route to personal riches and influence? The answer supplied by Benedict's book seems to be that Hayward is both. \\"Without Reservation\\" does not stop with Skip Hayward's climb to wealth and power, but continues on through his subsequent fall from tribal leadership, overthrown by other Mashantuckets whose claim of Pequot identity is as suspect as that of Hayward himself. The picture which Benedict paints is one of naked greed and arrogance rising to the top.I am certain that some people will dismiss Benedict's book as being \\"anti-Indian\\", but that is not the case. His contention is that the Mashantucket Pequots are simply not an Indian tribe in any genuine sense of the term, and that they have taken advantage of and have perverted situations created for the benefit of actual Native American peoples. I am equally certain that his claims will be vigorously denounced by the Mashantuckets, and I eagerly look forward to seeing what evidence, if any, can be produced to counter Benedict's arguments.Jeff Benedict has written a book which tells a compelling story, although undoubtedly it will not be the final word on the subject. It is a story skillfully told in a gripping narrative which vividly depicts the actors in the drama: the Mashantuckets, the politicians, the ordinary citizens who woke up to find the world's largest casino springing to life in their rural community, and of course the ever-present lawyers, eager to distort and shade the truth in their roles of advocates (or in their chase of the big bucks)."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"In his well written and well researched book \\"Without Reservation,\\" author Jeff Benedict traces the history of the formation and rise to tremendous wealth of the \\"modern day\\" Western Mashantucket Pequot \\"Indian\\" tribe of southeastern Connecticut. It is the incredible story of a fraud perpetrated upon the taxpayers of our nation. It is the story of how state and federal government officials were duped into believing that a handful of ordinary citizens were the remnants of the ancient Pequot Indian tribe. It is a story of opportunism, greed, and abuse of astronomical proportions. A flawed system designed to help poor tribal members of American Indian tribes is cleverly manipulated to serve a handful of opportunistic and undeserving people. After reading the book, two adjectives come immediately to mind: \\"astonishing\\" and \\"outrageous.\\" A more perfect example of the insanity that is today's Federal Indian Policy cannot be imagined.Attorney Tom Tureen had masterminded Indian land claims against several New England states based on their alleged violations of federal statutes known as the Trade &amp; Intercourse Acts. Among other things, the Acts forbid the purchase of Indian lands without federal approval, but the applicability of the Acts within the 13 original colonies was and is an ongoing unsettled controversy. Under the direction of attorney Tureen, a handful of relatives of the last surviving resident of the 200 acre Pequot reservation, Elizabeth George, decide to form the new tribe in order to join the land claim litigation. To accomplish this \\"They needed to come together and start acting like a tribe,\\" and \\"most importantly, the group had to establish residency on the reservation,\\" writes Benedict. Regardless of the fact that tribal membership was completely foreign to them and that they knew little or nothing about the culture or history of the Pequots, the group proceeded with its charade. Elizabeth George however, the one person upon which the tribe was basing its ancestry, had only a faint connection to Indian ancestry, but to the Narragansett Indians and not the Western Pequots asserts Benedict.The newly manufactured \\"tribe,\\" with the help of Tureen and the Native American Rights Fund (NARF), files a land claim against the state of Connecticut and wins their claim by forcing an out of court settlement. Tureen is quoted in the book as describing these Indian land claims as \\"something we made up\\" and were based on \\"an utterly untested theory.\\" Tureen states, \\"If the Supreme Court ever tested the issue, it would say that the Nonintercourse Act did not apply to any of these tribes. So settlement was critically important to our strategy in all of these cases.\\" Incredibly, against the protestations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs(BIA), Congress ratifies the Pequot land claim settlement without knowing whether or not the people claiming to be the Western Mashantucket Pequot tribe are indeed the genuine descendants of the historic tribe, since the \\"tribe\\" had thus far successfully avoided the BIA's tribal recognition process. The settlement awards the \\"Pequots\\" $900,000 and allows them to expand their reservation to some 2,000 acres. The tribe then proceeds down a road leading from high stakes bingo to the riches of their Foxwoods casino - all made possible by the special laws, perks, and privileges created for Indian tribes by federal Indian policy.Benedict's book is extremely important in that it reveals a controversy regarding an alleged fraud of monumental proportions that demands a just solution. The good news is that Benedict's allegations are readily verifiable. Television news program \\"60 Minutes\\" is reportedly in the process of taping a segment on Benedict's book and the municipalities surrounding the Pequot reservation and its Foxwoods casino are calling for a congressional investigation into the allegations brought forward in \\"Without Reservation.\\" A forthcoming solution may well prove disastrous for the \\"Western Mashantucket Pequots.\\""},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"I was raised in Ledyard, attending school with &quot;members&quot; of the tribe, sitting next to them in classes. I remember Ledyard before the Bingo hall and Mashantucket ownership of Mr. Pizza but I never fully understood the legalities behind it all. Now I do. Some have said this book is too simplified, but thanks to Mr. Benedict, lay-people such as myself can understand how this happened to Ledyard. Finally, someone has given us a clear picture of the complex actions, laws and history behind this turquoise monstrosity in the hills of Connecticut. Incidently, I don't bump into too many people around here who are racist against Indians. What does bother us - and what Mr. Benedict so accurately described - is the sheer recklessness of those who call themselves Mashantuckets. Included in that group, sadly, is their leader who, I would imagine, is an embarassment to the Native American community. Native Americans are a proud and noble people. Benedict documents for those not from 'these parts' how ignoble many of their lifestyles are - including the 'leadership' of the tribe. I for one thought the book was incredibly balanced - Benedict shed much positive light on other tribes, and I actually felt compassion for 'Skip' Hayward and Mickey Brown by the end of the book. That's saying a lot coming from a 'Ledyarder'."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"I am an enrolled member of the Salish &amp; Kootenai Tribes ofthe Flathead Reservation and I highly resent this book...The Indiansdid not make the gambling law in the United States Congress,non-Indians did and all the Pequots did was to take advantage of them.

The &quot;average customer review&quot; of 3-1/2 stars masks individual reviewer ratings, which are almost entirely 5 stars versus 1 star, depending on where readers stand on the highly emotional issue of tribal recognition and Indian casinos.This book rasies some serious flaws in the recognition process that supporters of the Mashantucket Tribe would rather not have come to light. Indeed, there are already calls for a Congressional investigation as a result of Benedict's expose. No wonder some folks rate this book only one star.On the other hand, residents of the host towns surrounding the Mashantucket Pequot reservation (where this book is a best seller) who have confronted first hand the issues Benedict describes, give the book Amazon's highest five star rating.The book reads like a novel but it is by no means fiction. The people Benedict writes about are real and so are the events.

But, without Tom Tureen, the shrewd lawyer in this story, Skip never could have pulled this deal off. Never. It's the classic story of greed, money and power. Unfortunately, it's not about Native Americans. The Haywards are not Indians, they're white. Jeff Benedict says maybe a drop or two of Narrangansett blood, but even if the drop or two is Pequot blood, the Haywards are white, not Indian, and I think the author makes that quite clear by his definition of what constitutes an Indian and what doesn't. It's possible that Skip bought or bribed some Indians to join his ersatz Pequot Tribe as the author points out. And why not; when you've got the benjamins, baby, you can reconstruct any kind of history you wish. He should have at least bought a few with red skin; the picture in the lobby of the new Cultural Center tells the story of the &quot;new Pequots&quot; - white and black and yellow and tan faces, but not a red face, or even a hint of one, in the bunch. The author did his homework; if he missed a point or two as some of the reviewers said, it doesn't detract from the overall truth of the storyline. All of the above having been said, I came away from the book liking Skip Hayward and his Foxwoods Casino and his Cultural Center with its story of the history of the Pequots. He did it right. Skip is the American Dream personified - he made it big and, in a way, he did get even for some of the stuff the Whites pulled on the Indians over the years - even if he's not an Indian."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"Without Reservation is an engaging read for those who have already allied themselves against the Pequots. But for those who have an interest in federal Indian law, Indian gaming, and the genuine history of the tribe, the book is short on substance and grand on generalizations.The book is also laughable in parts for its weak attempt at explaining Indian law to those who know little of it.Benedict makes several slip-ups in his assessment of events, mostly with Skip Hayward's self-identification of himself as Indian. Its begins early on, with his retelling of Hayward's first meeting with then Maine Commissioner of Indian Affairs John Stevens.This is a serious flaw, as Benedict hinges much of his attack on Hawyard and the tribe on members who allegedly referred to themselves as white.There are also problems with Benedict's lack of direct reference to crucial legislation. For instance, Benedict's criticism of the Pequot's view of themselves as a &quot;corporation&quot; is without direct reference to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. A layperson might simply believe Benedict's conclusions about the tribe rather than investigate the legal backdrop to the issues.The book's style and tone are problematic. He never interviewed Hayward nor any tribal member first hand, yet he presents conversations as if they were heard first hand, when in fact they were conducted second hand with disgruntled partners, former employees, and prior contacts, including Hayward's first two wives. Corroboration of key conversations does not seem to prevent Benedict from painting them in a light less favorable to the Pequots.Benedict also employs devices and retorts more familiar to racist, anti-Indian movements than serious journalism. What Benedict claims are privileges afforded to Indian tribes are actually rights. What Benedict claims are rights are actually privileges. Issues such as taxation, regulation, and tribal membership are freely thrown about, giving off the impression that the point Benedict sorely needs his book to make cannot be backed up with real proof so Benedict must rely on double talk and sleight-of-hand to convince the already convinced that the Pequots aren't real.Benedict has a racial fixation, it seems. When a BIA employee comes out to the reservation to survey land to be placed into trust, he makes it a point to say the man is &quot;7/8 Indian.&quot;One might ask why his publisher would not provide copies for review. Academics and legal experts will have serious problems with the book."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"Jeff Benedict, you have done some amazing research in putting your book together. My husband and I, FULL BLOODED NAVAJO INDIANS, even read the bibliography. Completely familiar with government issues, we can see how these non-Indians fell though the cracks to become what they are today. It is embarassing to hear people call themselves American Indian when they are not. Our people have 4 directions, have come through 4 worlds and have 4 sacred mountains, and to that effect, have 4 grandparents contributing to the culture of each of us. Past the 1/4 &quot;blood quantum&quot; one need not be considered a Navajo. The same should be true of all American Indian tribes. If you are 1/16 Indian, you are 15/16 something else. You cannot contribute to our people. You do not know what extreme poverty is like. Your &quot;reservation&quot; is to you a tax-free haven. Whereas ours is also tax free, it is for many a prison of unemployment, alcoholism, abuse and depression. I am not saying that you need to experience these things to be an American Indian, but you do need to understand what many of us come from and live through. I implore Congress to look into the geneology of these people. If these &quot;Pequots&quot; have made a false claim, I hope that they are made to return what they have wrongfully taken."},{"Title":"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino","review":"Mr. Benedict has done it again.

There are excellent sections that address field steady holds and practice shooting required in preparation for hunting, and excellent coverage of the various sights on the market including scopes and electric dot. There is coverage of various celebrity, or near celebrity hunters in pursuit of various types of North American and more exotic African game. All good stories, lots of hardware detail and well defined circumstances of kills. Chapters addressing handgun customizing for hunting, safety and equipment maintenance are all worthwhile.The best way I could explain my reaction to the book is that when I finished, I dragged out all of my handguns that could be considered hunting pieces, to compare them and their sighting systems to what I had just read about in the book.

It is a particularly useful book for those who seek a professional's critical view on issues ranging from the need for better recruitment to improved coordination between civilian and military clandestine activities.Although Hulnick clearly has considerable sympathy for the needs of the intelligence community, this is by no means an uncritical whitewash. On the contrary, it is a thoughtful probing of present and future problems facing US intelligence and policy makers.I would rate this book as one of a handful any serious student of US intelligence should read and own --- to come back to often as a reference volume."},{"Title":"Fixing the Spy Machine: Preparing American Intelligence for the Twenty-First Century","review":"This is an excellent book handicapped by a rather silly title. The author of the book is Arthur Hulnick who after seven years with navel Intelligence had a successful career as an analyst with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He has written a very thoughtful and accurate description of the U.S. Intelligence System and the processes of intelligence production. Of course the book tends to be somewhat CIA centric since Hulnick was a CIA employee, but the book still covers the entire system quit well. Although published in 1999, his book has as much relevance today as it did when it was published.Hulnick provides a very good, if general, account of the processes associated with intelligence analysis and clearly knows what he is talking about. He is also one of the few writers on intelligence to address the issue that the CIA and other intelligence agencies tend to have very poor management and lack management training programs. Although Hulnick devotes some discussion to intelligence reform, the most valuable contribution of his book is his candid discussions of how the U.S. Intelligence System actually works as seen from the viewpoint of someone who was immersed in that system. His careful discussions and observations make good reading for both intelligence professionals and for folks who just wish to know what intelligence is all about. This book would be a good companion to \\"Secret Agencies\\" by Loch K. Johnson and \\"Intelligence from Secrets to Policy\\" by Mark M. Lowenthal (both available at Amazon.com).In reading this book this reviewer noted a certain ambiguity that is common to intelligence professionals of long service in the way Hulnick discussed the intelligence system. On the one hand he is clearly proud of the analytic work he and his colleagues performed and of the very real successes of U.S. Intelligence Community; on the other hand he is clearly dismayed by the numerous and egregious failures of a dysfunctional community with a long history of chronic mismanagement."},{"Title":"Fixing the Spy Machine: Preparing American Intelligence for the Twenty-First Century","review":"Excellent analysis of the problems that have plagued the US intelligence system with cogent policy recommendations.

How the book treats the CIA-FBI relationship, for example, is probably representative of how most CIA insiders feel. The book does not reflect a deep understanding of open sources and tends to accept the common wisdom across the intelligence bureaucracy, that all is &quot;generally okay&quot; and just a bit of change on the margin is necessary. In this respect, it is a good benchmark against which the more daring reformist books may be measured."},{"Title":"Working ourselves to death: The high cost of workaholism, the rewards of recovery","review":"I found this to be the best book that I have read on word addiction.

For Goodis it is all about obsession and failed redemption. And Cassidy's Girl stands alongside THE STREET of NO RETURN and THE BLONDE on the STREET CORNER as one of his masterpieces. David Cassidy is caught between two women. One woman, an alcoholic lost soul emanating good represents a second shot at former greatness. The other woman, voluptuous and iron willed drives his dark lusts, offers him bodily bliss and inevitable doom. Of course, the usual array of bums, losers, rummy philosophers and tender-hearted whores populate this work, giving the book that dreary, broken bottle, rainy sky, desolate and realistic feel of forlorn hope. Goodis is to NOIR what Poe was to horror, that is to say that Goodis transcends genre, concerning himself less with plot and stereotypes of stupid cops, sadistic killers and tough guy PIs but more about revealing the alchemy of the dark desires that drive the human spirit away from happiness and towards self-destruction."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"Jim Cassidy is a bus driver by day and a drunk by night. He becomes convinced that if he leaves his voluptuous tramp of a wife, Mildred, and takes up with the waif-like, angelic Doris, he will at long last be able to escape his hellish existence. But he soon discovers that redemption is not that simple.Cassidy's Girl is about the dark, depressing lives of a group of alcoholics inhabiting a rundown neighborhood bordering the Philadelphia waterfront. It is a no holds barred study of people whose lives are simultaneously fueled and poisoned by alcohol. Goodis describes how this community, of sorts, functions. Acts of friendship alternate with acts of violence. Love and affection coexist side by side with hate and betrayal.Goodis' portrayal of the frustratingly hopeless environment in which the characters find themselves is vivid and expertly drawn. The plot, however, is not as compelling as it might have been. Instead of flowing smoothly, the narrative has a herky-jerky quality with events occurring seemingly at random. That is to say the motivation behind the actions of key characters is many times unclear.Cassidy's plan to rescue Doris and himself is, as you would expect, eventually ruined. But the cause of this ruination is not just fate or inevitability. Cassidy himself makes conscious choices which directly lead to his own defeat.Cassidy's Girl is classic noir. Unapologetically downbeat, it fearlessly explores the ugly, hopeless side of life. Proceed at your own risk."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"This one is easily worth the price of admission. Another pulp classic by David Goodis, one of the few writers who can transcend the mundane and make tales of ordinary fallen heroes seem so intense, so poignant, that you are immediately taken in by their story and made a part of their lives. Acclaimed noir photographer and director Ed Holub (holubfilm@gmail.com) is planning to make a film of this novel, and it's easy to see why--startling opening, astonishing characterizations, and the familiar Goodis touch of angst, eerily appealing violence, and poetic narrative to bring you in and never let go. Buy this book."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"David Goodis' novel, \\"Cassidy's Girl\\" offers a portrayal of lost people in forgotten streets of Philadelphia in the years following WW II. The characters in the story are tormented and fallen. They struggle with alcohol and with their own demons. Goodis portrays them rawly yet with sympathy. The book is as much about atmosphere as about character. The story is set in the bars, tenements, narrow streets of the old Delaware River harbor and waterfront. I am familiar with parts of the Philadelphia that Goodis describes from the time I lived in the city years ago. But many of the places and scenes described in the book had already been lost.The primary character of the book Jim Cassidy, 36, drives a bus between Philadelphia and Easton for a cut-rate company with headquarters on Arch Street. Here is how Goodis introduces Cassidy and the theme of the book at the outset of the novel.\\"The bus made a turn of Market Street, went up through the slashing rain to Arch, went into the depot. Cassidy climbed out, opened the door,stood there to help them down from the bus. He had the habit of studying their faces as they emerged, wondering what their thoughts were, and what their lives were made of. The old women and the girls, the frowning stout men with loose flesh hanging from their jaws, and the young men who gazed dully ahead as though seeing nothing. Cassidy looked at their faces and had an idea he could see the root of their trouble. It was the fact that they were ordinary people and they didn't know what real trouble was. He could tell them. He could damn well tell them.\\"Cassidy spends his evening fighting with his voluptuous but shrewish wife Mildred and drinking at a cheap establishment called Lundy's Place. Earlier in his life, Cassidy had flown planes in WW II and then commercially. When he was blamed falsely for a plane accident, Cassidy's life deteriorated. He squandered his money and ultimately found himself in the Philadelphia tenderloin. When he secures the job as a bus driver, Cassidy gains a small sense of purpose and control that he does not feel otherwise.After a particularly harsh fight with his Mildred, Cassidy learns that she is interested in another patron of Lundy's Place, Haney Kendick. In his turn, Cassidy becomes involved with a young woman, Doris, 27, who is slender and withdrawn and an irredemable alcoholic. As the story develops, Goodis explores which of these women, Mildred or Doris, consitutes \\"Cassidy's Girl\\".The book includes many scenes of violence, heavy drinking, sex, and tragedy. It is also highly introspective as each of the down and out characters has his or her own story. Cassidy is forced to flee when he is accused of causing an accident in driving the bus eerily similar to the accident years earlier with the plane. For all the rage and hopelessness of the characters and the setting, the book comes to a resolution that is slightly less hopeless than is the case in some of Goodis' later novels.Beginning in 1951, Goodis (1917 -- 1967) published a number of paperback noir novels most of which are set in his native Philadelphia. The novels offer a noir portrayal of the city and of the loneliness of urban life. \\"Cassidy's Girl\\" sold over a million copies when it was published in 1951 but was soon forgotten. With the Library of America's recent publications of \\"Down There\\" (Shoot the Piano Player)Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s: The Killer Inside Me / The Talented Mr. Ripley / Pick-up / Down There / The Real Cool Killers (Library of America) (Vol 2)followed by its publication of a volume of five Goodis novels,David Goodis: Five Noir Novels of the 1940s and 50s (Library of America), Goodis dark world has achieved a place in American literature. Readers who come to Goodis through the Library of America volumes will enjoy exploring his other novels, including \\"Cassidy's Girl\\".Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"Goodis novels for $0.99 each on Kindle are a bargain and a much better value than the recent Library of America volume. I read a study years ago that correlated various authors' alcoholism with the drinking habit of their characters. Goodis must have had well-used elbows by the time he wrote this one. It's a good, quick read set in a world where no one is sober for long. The characters are vivid and you know there isn't going to be much in the way of happy endings for them."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"Good prose. Amusing story. This fellow Goodis clearly knew what the battle with demon rum is all about. Likely he or a loved one endured the struggle and faced the bleakness."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"This book is a tough call for me. On the one hand, the plot depends on a 1 in 1 million event that occurs twice (with slight variation). That's a bit much for me to swallow, especially in a genre where a big part of the illusion is the gritty \\"realism\\" of the story. On the other hand, I happen to like this kind of writing:\\"He could see the bottle rising to her lips, and then her lips meeting the lips of the bottle, as though the bottle were something alive, making love to her. . . he saw the bottle as a loathsome, grotesque creature that had lured Doris and captured her and pleasured itself with her, draining the sweet life from her body as it poured its rottenness into her.\\"If this kind of writing is not quite your style, then this is a book to skip. If this leaves you wanting more, then the improbability of the plot should not stop you from diving in."},{"Title":"On Virtue Ethics","review":"I read this book in a philosophy course at Dartmouth, and wrote a 20-page paper on it. For those not familiar, virtue ethics has recently come into fashion as an alternative to both deontological (rule-based) and consequentialist (results-based) ethics.Hursthouse is a big fan of Aristotle (although she does &quot;update&quot; a few of his sexist remarks), and often hearkens back to his discussion of &quot;the virtues,&quot; and the idea that there is no set of rules that can ever properly encompass every situation -- rather, the ideal virtuous agent is someone who is actually _skilled_ at ethics, and simply knows the virtuous thing to do.An example that might help get across the idea of virtue ethics -- take a classic ethical case such as Ayn Rand's example of a man whose wife is very sick and who spends extraordinary amounts of money to save her life. It turns out, however, that he could have spent the same amount of money and saved the lives of ten women he didn't know. The utilitarian says that the lives of ten are more important than the life of one. The virtue ethicist says that the fact that we place the interests of loved ones above the interests of strangers is good -- a vital part of humanity we would not want to sacrifice to some mathematical moral calculation. And who would want to live in a world where we forsake our spouses to save strangers?The book also contains a very interesting chapter on naturalism in ethics. Overall, a very worthwhile read, especially if your entire background in ethics consists of Kant, Bentham, Mill, etc.A note -- this is not the most abstruse philosophy text I've ever read, but I wouldn't suggest approaching it without some sort of academic philosophy background."},{"Title":"On Virtue Ethics","review":"I cannot help but take issue with H. Gintis's uninformed and uncharitable review of this book. The philosophical community regards this work as an important and interesting contribution to the literature in virtue ethics and ethical theory more generally. Certainly, many philosophers disagree with Hursthouse on various points, but this is compatible with believing that it is a philosophically important book.Hursthouse takes pains to make her work readable to those without extensive philosophical training. Although the ideas are philosophically sophisticated, the language is engaging and accessible. It is well worth reading for those who want to know more about one of the great philosophical traditions in ethics."},{"Title":"On Virtue Ethics","review":"This is a really valuable book. A lot of philosophers have been talking for the past twenty years about \\"Virtue Theory\\" as an approach in normative ethics that can rival deontology and utilitarianism for depth, plausibility and coherence. But Hursthouse's book is the first that I'm aware of to attempt a full statement of precisely what it is that makes the approach distinctive. And anyone who's familiar with the work of other philosophers (e.g. Elizabeth Anscombe, John McDowell, Bernard Williams) who've been viewed as the standard-bearers for VT during this period of time will be able to recognize that it's an unqualified success in at least this respect.So, does the book actually make VT seem appealing? Well, there's some excellent stuff on how to distinguish rule-based approaches from character based approaches to ethical evaluation. And there's a wonderfully subtle discussion of precisely how Aristotlelian accounts of the moral significance of a person's motivations differ from those traditionally given by Kantians. There's also some very silly stuff at the end though. Her discussion of the difference between human beings and animals is jaw-droppingly simplistic - really, almost Philistine. Like Foot and McDowell, she fails to register the fact that thousands of very smart people have thought about this subject in zoology, anthropology and biology departments around the world and that it might be at least somewhat worthwhile to take a bit of glance at what they have to say. And at the end she delivers a stunning battery of ad hominems against Bernard Williams for daring to suggest that the Aristotelian notion of a distinctive human function doesn't stand up to careful and impartial scrutiny.Even in these areas, though, what Hursthouse says is far from being out of step with the views propagated by other writers in the VT tradition. If one is left with the slightly disappointing impression that the VT approach might after all be little more than the fetish of a couple of generations of clever, but slightly wooly Oxbridge humanists, it's hard to see how she herself can be blamed for this."},{"Title":"On Virtue Ethics","review":"Another reviewer \\"wouldn't suggest approaching [this book] without some sort of academic philosophy background.\\" I cannot really speak to this - I have an academic philosophy background - but I fear that it obscures how much fun this book is. It is fluent and lucid. I've enjoyed parts enough to read them aloud to friends and family with no background in philosophy, and they seemed to do just fine. I read the bulk of the book on transatlantic flights, and it was compelling enough to block our distractions.To get an idea, hit the \\"surprise me!\\" link under \\"look inside!\\" (What's with all these exclamation points?) Or search on the word 'children'; Hursthouse has interesting things to say about how ways of bringing up children reveal thinking about ethics."},{"Title":"On Virtue Ethics","review":"Much ink has been spilled as part of the revived interest in virtue ethics.

This isn't just a reference book of facts, although if you are researching for an assignment or something you could certainly use this book in that way and I can't think of a better book of facts for doing that.The beauty of this mammoth sized book is that each criminal analysed is written like a short story so what you've really got here is a collection of 865 non fiction short crime stories. I also found it interesting when reading the information boxes on each execution for example James Billington was pretty much the sole executer no matter where the execution took place for the first couple of years before some of his assistants got a bit of work.There are also tables at the back of the book showing the statistics on which crime the death penalty was implemented for, and which country within Great Britain had the most executions. There's also an index of the towns and their executions as well as a calendar so you can compare which day of the year is the most popular for executions. This book is simply excellent. No avid crime fan wether used to reading fiction or non fiction should pass up purchasing this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Encyclopaedia of Executions: The Stories Behind Every Execution in Twentieth Century Britain","review":"This was an ambitious project -- the book covers every execution in Great Britain from 1900 until the death penalty was abolished in 1964. Most of the entries were no longer than a page, and I don't think any ran past four pages. It's the kind of book that you ought to keep on your bedside table or toilet tank for years, taking dips as you feel like it, but as it was a library book I had to read it straight through.I was surprised at how ordinary the murders were. For the most part, it was just the usual assortment of jealous lovers, drunken husbands, robbery-murders and rape-murders. The book actually starts to get boring when you read too many stories straight through because they're almost all the same. The lack of a name index was a major flaw, I feel, although the executions were indexed by the prison they took place in and that was nice.A good book for death penalty buffs and British history buffs, but not to be read too much at once."},{"Title":"The Encyclopaedia of Executions: The Stories Behind Every Execution in Twentieth Century Britain","review":"In 960 pages, this rather hefty tome briefly recounts the 865 judicial hangings that took place in Britain during the twentieth century. There is a tabular record for each execution listing the essential information such as the names of the accused, victim(s) and executioner(s), and also the date of execution and trial. There is also a synopsis of the crime for which the accused was hanged. Obviously, at an average of just over a page for each execution, there is not a wealth of detail and this is not the sort of book where one can get 'lost' in the story. However, the book is still very thorough and provides a pretty decent reference for those interested in the subject. My only quibble is that, for a reference, it is not very well indexed. There is a list of executions by city, which is quite useful, but then there is an entry for each day of the typical calendar year followed by relevant events for specified years. This is certainly an unusual way of indexing things and I cannot think why the author did not include a list indexed by the name of the accused. Perhaps in a subsequent edition?"},{"Title":"Wittgenstein On Rules and Private Language","review":"Like all of Kripke's work, this book makes a wildly original contribution to the subject, and like all of his work, it is pure pleasure to read. Kripke's writing is the perfect mixture of lucidity and profundity. In the book, Kripke interprets the central theme of Wittgenstein's work as an examination of what it means to follow a rule, and Kripke explores this train of thought and examines the consequences. This leads to a new form of skepticism, of which Wittgenstein's private language argument is a consequence.Although Kripke's interpretation seems to have fallen out of favor in many circles, this book is still a classic. Regardless of whether you agree with Kripke's conclusions, this book will make you think deeply."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein On Rules and Private Language","review":"Originally published in 1982, Saul Kripke's Rules and Private Language has become a classic in contemporary analytic philosophy and probably the most notable (if contentious) analysis of Wittgenstein's later work.As noted by Kripke himself, the work is more an elaboration of Kripke's thoughts in reaction to the Philosophical Investigations, than a truly dedicated attempt to uncover Wittgenstein's perspective. In large part as a result of this bold approach, Kripke comments have become both extremely well known and controversial. Readers unfamiliar (or rusty) with Kripke may find the pertinent chapters in Scott Soames' excellent Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 2: The Age of Meaning helpful in preparing for this text.Overall, I recommend this book to readers of analytic philosophy - it is a relatively quick and enjoyable read. Familiarity with the Philosophical Investigations, however, is likely a prerequisite to understanding and appreciating this text."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein On Rules and Private Language","review":"Intro/Background:Kripke opens up this work with something important to say: This book is the culmination of his first reading of Wittgenstein's P.I. and how &quot;it struck to me&quot;. Therefore, Kripke doesn't hold any of these views anymore.Summary:In this book he acts like an attorney in a court room defending a possible interpretation of the &quot;Wittgensteinian paradox&quot;. The paradox, briefly summed up, is the question of whether a past rule determines future usage in a new (set of) problem(s). Another sub-problem is whether the result of a function was the intention of the person who commands/uses the function.The first essay deals with answering the constant questioning by a sceptic that Kripke thinks up. The essay goes down all sorts of various and different pathways. (Kripke takes and examines the &quot;dispositional theory&quot; of intention for example.)Kripke ends somewhere in the second essay with claiming something like: A private language or privately followed rule (in a new way) cannot be followed individually because it has to be agreed upon in the community. Some of Kripke's argument against private language resides in ressurectioning David Hume's argument against a private causation.The argument against individual intention contra another's intention rest on the resonance with the community again. If one person follows one rule, and another person follows some other rule, and if the answers differ, then the correct answer to problem will be the one that is agreed upon. (Kripke doesn't take up the argument against people that are following different rules but arrive at the same answer.)That completes the first two essays. The postscript is interesting but tackles a different issue: The certainty of other minds being like ours. Again, Kripke examines the 'other minds' problem from Kripke's perceived view of Wittgenstein. The postscript is very short and doesn't come to any earth-shattering conclusions but is nevertheless a great thought exercise.Conclusion/Personal Reaction:Loved the book. It is a very unfavorable reading of Wittgenstein's &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;, but in some ways it is the best book on that work. It is incredibly thoughtful and raises important concerns for epistemology and the philosophy of mind.I advise you to have the Wittgenstein's &quot;P.I.&quot; next to you because often Kripke cites propositions that he doesn't quote.Simply put, a must for any fan of Kripke's meager alotment of written work and a must for any fan of Wittgenstein."},{"Title":"Wittgenstein On Rules and Private Language","review":"Saul Kripke is legendary for his contributions to modal logic, philosophy of language and semantic conceptions of truth. He is, as someone once remarked, the Bobby Fisher of contemporary philosophy.This is evident in this book. Kripke argues that the key to understanding Wittgenstein's 'private language argument' in his &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; is found in Wittgenstein's discussion of rule following which comes near the beginning of PI. Though this thesis has been critiqued for its apparent dissimilarity to some other views of Wittgenstein's, it is striking, original and intriguing nonetheless.The radical skepticism inherent in (Kripke's understanding of) the Wittgensteinian paradox is astounding and will lead you to question the very basis of your belief system. Read this book if you're into Hume, Wittgenstein, Berkeley or Kripke--it is, unlike many philosophical works, very easy to understand."},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"Osborne Russell was the real article: a respondent to Ashley's famous advertisement \\"to enterprising young men\\", Russell was one of the few who both survived and wrote about the experience. His life as a trapper was an enviable one, for he both survived and thrived in his nine years in the mountains, and those experiences stood him in good stead for the remainder of his life as a frontiersman in Oregon and California. However, his writings consist primarily of an uninspired travelogue: spend two weeks trapping on this creek, then three weeks on this other creek, then crossed the divide and descended this river to that fort, then spent two weeks trapping that river, etc. There are a few good yarns mixed in and he met many famous people, but you'll find more yarns, better told, and more insights, and better biography, in other books. If you've read a dozen good books about the mountain men, then you should add Russell to your list, but first you should readA Majority of Scoundrels: An Informal History of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, which is fantastic, and alsoAcross the Wide Missouri, equally so, even though they were both written by modern authors. If you want an eyewitness account, then your first stop should beTough Trip Through Paradise, 1878-1879, one of the best books about a mountain man's life by anybody, from anywhen. You'll also want to check outMountain Men and Fur Traders of the Far West: Eighteen Biographical Sketchesto get some more background on some of these characters, and after that, you'll probably want to read more about the likes of Jed Smith, Jim Bridger, John Coulter and Hugh Glass (who came closer than any other man to getting et by a grizzly without actually dying) before you turn to the relatively humdrum life of Osborne Russell. So, to sum it up, I'd trade moccasins with Osborne any day, but there are better tales in store from other mountain men."},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"The trapper's journal by Osbourne Russell during the early to mid 18 hundreds came as a bit of a surprise. First the book is a factual account without any explication of the events more than is necessary. It is not told as an adventure story eg &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; but rather as a journal pure and simple of the travels through the Rockies, mainly Yellowstone, of this young trapper over 9 years in the pay and as a member of Jim Bridger's fur company, around 100 men. The trade was at its peak at this time. As is true of most journals it is full of abbreviations of words because of time constraints eg brot. for brought, staid for stayed etc. This gives the impression of crudity in the writing, or of a man not used to writing but rather writing in only a haphazard fashion. Every reader knows how easy it is to loose all the fine points of writing when it is not practised constantly. The journal is full of place names and directions of travel and a few maps indicating the progress of the trappers. There is some description of the scenery and the Indians of the area eg Blackfoot which are a constant threat, Shoshones (Snake), Bonnack and Crow. Occasionaly I was pleasantly surprised by paragraphs of eloquence and beauty mixed in with the simplistic writing which was the norm. Russell was capable of very good writing when he was inspired or wished to do so. This is also demonstrated by his letters to his sisters which are written with great style and few grammatical errors, completely unlike his journals.There is much which comes to the fore in regard to the period eg the waste and destruction as the parties of trappers even in groups as small as 3 wonder the countryside and simply kill a Bison Cow for a meal and then discard it, or just take the tongue to eat. Incredible disregard for nature is shown at times. The trapper is in continual fear of Blackfoot war parties who harrass them, both white and Indian, constantly. In one instance an enormous group of Blackfeet, thought to number up to 1000 or more by Russell, attempt to eradicate the entire group of Bridger's trappers, about 100. They decide not to due to an unfavourable (omen) display of Northern lights. Even in his day as the story nears the end of the 9 years Russell tells of the scarcity of Buffalo which were not wiped out in total until 1870 or so (80 million -&gt; 1000). Its almost as if it comes upon them suddenly, &quot;5 years ago thousands crossed the valleys of the Yellowstone, now its hard to find any&quot;. Russell even becomes a little conservationist in spirit when he states that maybe its time for the white man to leave this country because the wildlife has been so denuded.An interesting book but with far too few passages describing the trapper's feeling along the way."},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"Osborne Russell paints a heartbreakingly beautiful image of America. What a poignant picture he paints of the buffalo herds and visions of sheep covering the snow capped mountains that he climbed to overlook other endless mountain ranges and prairies rolling as far as they eye could see against the ski, bountiful game and untouched, pristine valleys that may not yet have been visited by any white man. He must have provided some of the earliest information about Yellowstone Park. About an Indian tribe coming to the fort to trade, erecting hundreds of tepees outside the fort -- try to picture what an amazing sight that must have been. What a thoughtful man and unusual life he led. As I was reading this book, I kept thinking of a line from Dances with Wolves, where Kevin Costner's character says that he wants to go to the West because he wants to see the Frontier before its gone forever. I oftentimes wondered what life would be like back then, the people, the untouched areas that are now covered by cities and highways...People and their way of life back then interest me because I wondered if they were at all like us, given their life situations but people are the same in some respects no matter what the era, I noticed this on Page 20 \\"...Here a dispute arose about the part of the country we were in. Our Leader maintained that this was a branch of the Yellow Stone River but some of the trappers had been in this valley before and knew it to be a branch of Wind River, pointed out their old encampments and the beaver lodges where they had been trapping 2 years previous. But our man at the helm was inflexible, he commanded the party and had a right to call the streams by what means he pleased as a matter of course this was called the Yellow Stone. Three of the party however called it Wind River and left us but not before one of them had given our Charge d'affairs a sound drubbing about some small matters of little importance to any one but themselves...\\" Sounds like some of todays's workplaces. Other books I've read made passing references to fur trappers but I never appreciated the rugged, dangerous lives they lived. Theres a poignancy about the solitary existence of an individual fur trapper, going days or weeks without encountering another human in the wilderness. This is a great, great piece of American literature thats surely overlooked but priceless and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"An ongoing account over a nine-year period in the 1800s by a trapper who moved from area to area in the region encompassing (now) Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, north into Glacier National Park and west into Idaho. It was interesting to compare this account with the book &#34;Grizzly Years&#34; by Doug Peacock, which takes place about a hundred years later. In &#34;Journal of a Trapper&#34; the area is teeming with buffalo, elk, deer, wolves, and grizzly bears, and there are friendly, unpredictable and warlike Indians. A hundred years later, the Indians are essentially gone; there are only the descendants of the original buffalo, the bison, in certain areas; and far fewer of the other wild animals. Of necessity, because the book is essentially a journal, the writing can be a little repetitious. Understanding this, I found it a very interesting book."},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"I bought this book for myself but I sit and read in spurts and haven't read enough of this book at one time to really say that it will hold my attention."},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"Osborne Russell spent about a decade in the fur trade traipsing around the Rocky Mountain West in the 1830s-40's. His journal is wonderfully written and gives the reader a sense of this unique living around the larger area that today encompasses the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. All this of course was in pursuit of the beaver, the commodity that first opened up the West in the wake of Lewis and Clark's journey.An adventurous soul, Russell signed up to trap beaver when the West was still raw and new. His journal is a remarkable account of living off the land, encounters with Indians, relations with fellow trappers and mountain men and the wild lands that today encompass northern Utah, western Wyoming and Eastern Idaho and southern Montana. A few well-known mountain men make an appearance and Russell spent some time in Jim Bridger's party which for me made an interesting tie-in. Today's reader will marvel at his life of camping in rugged terrain and living off the land - including cold, snow and rain - for more than a decade (although winters were relieved somewhat by stays in rudimentary forts or encampments). Meals seemed to be plentiful as the buffalo and elk were thick. The area is well drained so water was hardly ever an issue and there are other vegetable sources of food. It is interesting though to read of daily meals of game taken by the hunt. Not a daily occurrence since a buffalo could be dressed and meat packed for a group that would last several days, but almost every time he wanted or needed more food it involved dropping a buffalo, elk, mountain sheep or occasional bear. I like meat as much as the next red blooded guy, but I wondered while reading what a decade of game eating would be like. Steak for breakfast, lunch and dinner; repeat, repeat.Russell's journal contains a lot of entries describing movements, such as: \\"went 13 mls around the mountain and crossed 25 Yard River and encamped.\\" It is, after all a journal. But the gems of this book are his occasional descriptions of the land in all its solitude and beauty - an impression that didn't fail to move this mountain man even after he had been years in the wild. Russell had run-ins with Indians - some friendly, some poor and pitied, some encountered in battle at the end of a gun (which usually described his interactions with the hostile Blackfoot tribe). His fellow trappers were also not to be trusted entirely, as Russell states at one point that trappers as they broke away from the trail in pursuit of streams in which to hunt often wouldn't share with each other exactly where they were going or how far up they were setting traps due to the competitive nature of the beaver hunt.I am constantly astounded at the ability of these early-in travelers to navigate the land and make circuits of hundreds of miles that eventually wind their way to a meeting place or encampment. Although the journal describes occasional forays up a creek or river mistaken for another one, Russell and his fellow travelers seemed very adept at knowing where they were and where they were going over a vast expanse of relatively untrammeled land.The editor (Aubrey Haines) does a very good job of providing biographical and setting information in a helpful forward. He also has an exhaustive series of footnotes and maps (about 10) of the journalist's travels. As the names of mountains, holes and rivers were not settled and have changed to some extent in modern times, these notes are very helpful in placing the trapper's locations on the contemporary map. Particularly if a reader has been over the Grand Teton and Yellowstone area, the notes and maps will take one to places often visited by travelers to the area today through Osborne Russell's eyes (for example, Russell several times camped near the present day location of the Lake Hotel on Lake Yellowstone, a place where I have stayed and can picture readily).I liked this book a lot and it will please anyone who likes to read of mountain men, exploration or the area. The entries have been preserved in Russell's format, so punctuation is not observed to the extent it would be in a professional writing and the entries often run together in long, paragraph-less pages, but I got used to the format fairly quickly and it did tend to lend authentication to the work as I was constantly able to envision this trapper making his entries around the campfire with a pencil stub on well folded manuscript."},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"Osborne Russell was a New England born man who left to find his destiny in the Rocky Mountains in the 1830s and 1940s. He spent 9 years living with friendly Indians, trapping, riding, fighting hostile Indians, working for various fur companies, and keeping a daily diary.This book is his (basically) unedited diary, and it's a treasure. It's hard to read because it's basically a hundred-page long paragraph without much punctuation. It tells of temperatures, and distances, and describes the wonders of Yellowstone. It talks of hunting and cooking, huge herds of buffalo, suffering in winter, the Rendezvous the Mountain Men are famous for, and his fellow mountain men. Punctuation aside, it's one of the most authentic accounts of the trapper days I've ever read.Most useful are the footnotes in the back of the book, which the editor added to help explain places and people Russell refers to. There are also many maps and reproductions of paintings by Charles Russell (no relation to the author) and others which set the tone for the book. I also enjoyed the biography of Osborne Russell, added by the editor, which prefaced the diary part of the book.As you read this book, you will see his attitude towards wildlife change. At first he was happy to shoot multiple buffalo and only take choice parts. Towards the end he writes about the way the Indians kill only what they can use, and that perhaps white men should move on before all the wildlife is gone.When Russell decided to leave the mountains, he wrote a beautiful poem (included in this book) which portrays a gentle, romantic side of the man that wasn't apparent in the rough and tumble of his diary.

A first-person account of experiences in a era long gone, a time in our history seeking to fathom a new land, a time of growing clash between fundamentally different cultures... and Mr. Russell puts you right there on the frontline. You join him at the beginning of his new livelihood in the unknown, and you stay with him, growing in experience and weathering within the raw western realm. The writing is often crude, but his thoughts are hardly so and the total package bursts forth as a true rarity in literature. I consider this journal to be an equal to the recordings of Lewis and Clark, and practically moreso given the fact that it is really the efforts of a lone individual. He was not paid to keep this record, and although he always hoped to see it published, it did not go to print until long after his death, and then only first released in a limit of 100 copies. Aubrey Haines does great tribute to this admirable man by undertaking the task of retracing Mr. Russell's journies and providing us with the maps needed to help us follow him. Working from the original handwritten manuscript housed in The William Robertson Coe Collection of Western Americana at Yale University, Mr. Haines' efforts represent the single most important element in getting this work to the people, and he has done us a great service here in preventing this journal from drifting into obscurity. If you are curious as to what a life was like in a land before McDonalds, MTV, shopping malls, and SuperBowl Sundays, then I suggest you pick up a copy of this jewel and park yourself along with Mr. Russell next to that campfire with its golden sparks wafting up toward that diamond-studded yonder.

Osborne Russell spent eight years as a trapper in the employ of a number of fur companies before becoming an independent trapper working out of Fort Hall. Fortunately, when he first went to the mountains with Nathaniel Wyeth's expedition in 1834, he began to keep a journal. From his journal he compiled a manuscript for publication; it's from this manuscript that the present book is based on. Osborne had a tendency to run sentences together and to practice unconventional language usage, all of which editor Aubrey Haines retains in this edition. One quickly gets used to it, however.Russell was an acute observer and, especially in describing his travels, was careful to mention distances and names (streams, mountains, etc.) when possible. Haines has been able to trace Russell's travels accurately, and ten accompanying maps illustrate his wanderings. (Haines's annotations are also numerous and thorough.) He trapped for a time with Jim Bridger, and some of what we've learned about him has direct bearings on Russell's journal accounts. In fact, Russell's book is the major source of information for a number of important events in the Rockies during this time. He also writes about the Indians (especially the Crows, Blackfeet, and Snakes) and much about the animals found in the West. Most of all, he tries hard to convey the life of a trapper - scouting the country, the laying of traps, hunting for game, dealing with the weather and terrain, the rendezvous experience (Russell attended six of them) - all the everyday routines trappers went through. This indeed is the most valuable thing about the book. Russell left the mountains in 1842 and settled in Oregon City; after an unsuccessful run for governor in 1845, he wrote his manuscript for JOURNAL OF A TRAPPER. He got the gold fever in 1848 and went to California, where he became a merchant. After his partner ran off with the company funds, Russell spent the rest of his life trying to pay off the creditors. He died near Placerville in 1892.This is a must-read book for anyone interested in the fur trade period of the trans-Mississippi West. It's gone through many editions and always seems to stay in print, thank heaven. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"I was in high school growing up on the Snake river Plain in Idaho when I read this book.

It was the best vacation we ever took.This book is a must for western history buffs!"},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"Osborne Russell was never one of the elite of the Mountain Men. He spent most of his time in the mundane tasks of cooking, cleaning, and other camp chores while on trapping expeditions. But he wrote one of the best accounts -- certainly one of the most accurate -- of the peregrinations and the exciting events in the life of a Mountain Man. Osborne was in the Northern Rockies between 1834-1943 and was a minor participant in many expeditions and fights with the Blackfeet.Editor Haines has compiled the routes of Russell's travel in 10 maps and added explanatory notes to his narrative. However, a lot more could be done to make this book more readable. First, there are no chapter or paragraph divisions to ease the task of the reader. It's even hard to keep track of what year Russell is talking about. Secondly, there is room for many, many more footnotes and explanations of what Russell was doing and when and where.We need a new edition of Russell's work which will make it more accessible to the reader. This old edition is invaluable if you are a student of the Mountain Man, but the casual reader will bog down.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"A remarkable firsthand account of how it was back in the 1830's to early 1840's to be a fur trapper/trader in the Rocky Mountains.

It fills in the big gap between the Corps of Discovery trip and the wagon trains. Well written by a resourceful and charming individualist."},{"Title":"Journal Of A Trapper","review":"Trappers were the first to blaze a trail across the wild frontier west of the Mississippi. Osborne Russell's Journal of a Trapper edited by Aubrey L Haines is a first-person must have account for fur trade enthusiasts whether those who read of the era or those who re-enact.Russell's first hand comments, descriptions and discourse concerning the time, the topography, the wildlife and life in general provide a peek into the area we know as Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Oregon long before settlement took place by the pioneers. Russell's book provides much information regarding many of the events in the Rockies during this time. Russell was a discriminating observer who was careful to mention distances, directions, who he was with and names of physical locations, as well as animals, topography and the like in his writing. He describes other fur traders, including some of the 'big' names we know from history, as well as providing description of many Native People in the area; particularly Snake also known as the Shoshones, the Blackfeet and Crow.The hardships faced by the first whites into the country far from the -civilized- East Coast is documented, as Russell provides insight into the Native people already living in the area, and the mountain men who made their way to the Rockies.Russell lived the time of the 1830s and 40s as a fur trapper/trader in the Rocky Mountains he set down a journal to record his thoughts, impressions and what he saw, in doing so he has provided a realistic depiction for those who have interest, but no first hand knowledge. He was not one of the lauded of history, rather he was a simple man, who described in detail the day to day life, survival, excitement and events of the time.Joining an expedition heading into the Mountains during the mid-1800's acquired the skills essential for survival in the mountains, and kept his journal recounting the last days of the beaver trapping era of the Mountain Men who have appeared in movies, stories and books.Rather than the romanticizing of events as is prone in Hollywooded up movies Russell listed the typical commonplace tasks of cooking, cleaning, and other camp chores which all Mountain Men performed while on trapping expeditions and in doing so he offers true insight into what it was that made these men leave the comfort and safety offered in the towns and homes of the Eastern Coastline to tramp out into untried, little known areas where privations were many and ease was hard to come by. He told of laying traps and hunting for game, of scouting the country, and problems that came from weather and terrain, and he described the rendezvous which was the highlight of the fur trapper year as men carried their furs to be traded or sold, re-supplied their food stores, enjoyed the company of others for a short time before returning to the mountains. Russell himself attended six rendezvous before he left the mountains for good.He told of the travels and the exhilarating episodes of the life experienced by the fur trappers. Trapping for beaver in the Northern Rockies between 1834-1943 Osborne took part in a number of expeditions in addition to battles with the Blackfeet who were less than thrilled to find the white men on their hunting grounds.Editor Haines has set down the routes of travel taken by Russell as 10 maps in addition to adding clarifying notes to his account. The maps are scattered throughout the text. Without chapter or paragraph divisions to aid the reader the journal is set down pretty much as a man might do in his own journal.At times it takes a little digging to figure exactly where or when an event is taking place. On the other hand, a true devotee of the era should have no trouble muddling through, as is done when reading the originals of many of the old journals of the time. Leaving the journal pretty much intact in the newer edition provides the reader a better feel for the man and his writing than might be accomplished were the text -cleaned up- with modern paragraph breaks and the like.The landscape of the area changed so much during the decade Osborne describes. Disease, in particular small pox, alcohol, and loss of lifestyle are the depressing legacy left for the Native People. Reading of the decline of populations of Native Americans, beaver in particular, but all fur bearing critters and the near disappearance of buffalo leads the reader on to the last journal entries as the reader follows Osborne. He grimly describes the plunge in buffalo populations and the approaching finish of the fur quest as beaver populations dwindled, the European desire for the fur declined and other furbearers were becoming more profitable.Born in Maine in 1814, Osborne Russell left home at sixteen, and became a fur trapper when he was seventeen. He spent eight years as a trapper working for several of the big fur companies before becoming an independent trapper working out of Fort Hall on the Snake River. Opportunely for us, when Osborne first went to the mountains with Nathaniel Wyeth's expedition in 1834 at age twenty, he began keeping his journal.After leaving the mountains in 1843 to settle in the Willamette Valley in Oregon Osborne used his journal to compile a manuscript for publication. From that manuscript the present book has been built. Osborne wrote in the fashion of the day, despite Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary; spelling rules had not yet been standardized as hard and fast, and writers often used a variety of spelling in the same text. Osborne had a tendency to run sentences together and to present unusual language usage, plus, Osborne as journalists then and now tended to abbreviate and use his own form of shorthand, all of which editor Aubrey Haines has kept in this text. Reader's quickly gets used to it Osborne's style and his style is what makes the text such interesting reading.Working from the original handwritten manuscript housed in The William Robertson Coe Collection of Western Americana at Yale University, Aubrey Haines' edition represents one man's enormous effort for getting Osborne's work to the people. For a step back to life as it was before the Interstate, McDonalds, shopping malls, and rockets in space, Osborne Russell's Journal of a Trapper can carry the reader to the open clear sky of the Rocky Mountains and to the camp of the fur traders who were an important component of our collective history.

Still, I felt the humor was too deliberate and over-the-top for my taste, not to mention a bit on the crude side. A heartfelt francophile, Mr. Sadler tracks a year-long sabbatical spent in Paris with the primary focuses of the book being his quest to bed a married Frenchwoman and his association with a neighborhood group of men who hang out at the local bar and periodically indulge in semi-clandestine meals consisting of unusual French dishes (pig ears, bull testicles, etc.). If the story about the married woman is to be believed as truth, there's an uncomfortable amount of kiss-and-tell, meant-to-be funny detail of their \\"courtship\\" and one 23-minute sexual encounter. The book also contains much extensive descriptions of food and drink and, unfortunately, the negative physical ramifications of his over-indulgences for the author. Much of the book is in or references French and, although he explains the majority of it, I doubt that I would have followed it all if I hadn't been living in Paris for some years myself.

From there the tale follows a twisted path.Joyce is the fianc&eacute;e of Marcus Featherstone, one of Campion's oldest friends. She lives with her great aunt Caroline, a pair of unpleasant uncles and an equally depressing brace of aunts. Uncle Andrew, a singularly miserable fellow, has vanished and Joyce has come to Campion for help. In short order Andrew is found murdered in such a fashion as to implicate his heavy drinking brother William. Campion's presence is commanded by Great Aunt Caroline and he is settled into Socrates Close, their Cambridge home, to act as detective, defender and general factotum.Yes, I said commanded. Great Aunt Caroline Faraday is a true Victorian 'grand dame.' For most of her life she has ruled Socrates Close and much of Cambridge's social life. Even now, in her 90's she is a force to be reckoned with. She has no patience with her dependents, who share little of her and her departed husband's brilliance. She sees no alternative to the ministrations of Campion, with whose mysterious but illustrious family she is well acquainted.It will take the death of one of Joyce's aunts and yet another fatality before Campion is able to meet her expectations. In doing so he will brush with evil at its most petty and spiteful. The lightheartedness that Campion uses to cover his true feeling entertains and delights us, but is never completely able to dispel the pall that lies upon the great house until the very last, when he once again finds a way through.I believe this is the first time Allingham puts aside her Chinese fire drill device and settles in to write true detective fiction. Her talent reveals itself as quite capable of handling the slower pace, which allows here more time to develop a remarkable cast of characters. These are never guilty of tediousness despite any other flaws they chose to reveal.It is a shame that Allingham's books are often allowed to go in and out of print. Too often, Campion aficionados are condemned to rummaging in used bookstalls to fill a gap in their collection. Luckily, most of us like to rummage. Police at the Funeral is a wonderful tale that is reminiscent of Marsh's &quot;Death of a Peer,&quot; although the Faradays are nowhere as near as appealing as Marsh's Lampreys. Except for Great Aunt Caroline, of course, who is a perfect treat. I can only tell you this tale is well worth digging for."},{"Title":"Police at the funeral,","review":"A diabolical murderer has been at work in the Victorian precincts of the manor known as Socrates Close. The formidable Great Aunt Caroline has all her wits about her, but her family does not and they have been dropping like flies. The police are naturally baffled. Only Albert Campion, faintly redolent of the early Lord Peter Wimsey with his fatuous smile and episcopal connections, stands between the criminal and a particularly nasty victory. This is Golden Age crime in full glory: an extremely ingenious puzzle, very well drawn period characters (Great Aunt Caroline is unforgettable), the usual understated English humour and a villain who is memorable in more than the usual ways. I'm not sure if Margery Allingham ever wrote a better book than this, so sit back, relax, make yourself comfortable and get ready to enjoy a mystery the likes of which they seldom write these days. If it's raining outside, so much the better!"},{"Title":"Police at the funeral,","review":"This 1932 novel is the 3rd in the Campion series. 'Albert Campion' (one of his aliases) has been contacted by an old school friend who has asked Albert to look into a matter for his fiancee's family - the Faradays, it seems that one of his future in-laws is missing. As the young lady is filling in Albert on her uncle's disappearance word arrives that the missing man has been found, unfortunately dead.Upon arriving at the Faraday household Albert discovers that his grandmother and the matriarch of clan, Aunt Caroline, are old friends. With this entree into the family Campion begins to unearth old family secrets and scandals. Ultimately the truth comes out but not before the body count rises.Albert Campion has been compared to Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey especially in the earlier novels. The similarities are noticeable in this one but less so than the previous novel, MYSTERY MILE. Campion is still traveling in the close world of upper class old English families and still playing the effete fool. The setting here is Cambridge (as opposed to Wimsey's Oxford) and Campion's police contact Oats, is reminiscent to Wimsey's Parker. Campion though is beginning to remerge from Wimsey's shadow here and developing more of his own style.The mysteries are intriguing, the clues are all present and challenging enough to keep the reader guessing. This is a great entry into the series, one that fans will not want to miss. It would also be a good place to begin if the earlier books are not available."},{"Title":"Police at the funeral,","review":"From 1931 we have Albert Campion solving the murder of a loathed nephew in a country house, a house still living in Victorian times run by the 80 year old matriarch.Its pretty standard whodunnit fare, lots of suspects and red herrings strewn about. All the information is given to the reader to solve the mystery but it plods along so pedantically it gets to the stage where the reader couldn't be bothered.This is the fourth Campion novel by Allingham and evidently the series picked up,so perhaps this one was an off day rather than representative of the entire series."},{"Title":"Police at the funeral,","review":"(1931) The middle-aged Faraday 'children' chafe under the iron hand of Great Aunt Caroline, who never made it out of the Age of Victoria. Allingham's serial detective, Albert Campion steps in when Uncle Andrew turns up dead. This is one of the more claustrophobic Campions, as most of the action takes place in Great Aunt Caroline's Victorian mansion in Cambridge, called Socrates Close.Campion provides a description of himself to his prospective client:\\"My amiable idiocy is mainly natural, but it's also my stock-in-trade. I'm honest, tidy, dark as next year's Derby winner, and I'll do all I can [to help you].\\"Hints at Campion's noble origin and real name are, in turn, provided by Great Aunt Caroline:\\"And now,\\" she continued, turning to Campion, \\"let me look at you, Rudolph. You're not much like your dear grandmother, but I can see the first family in you...as long as that impossible brother of yours is alive the family responsibilities are being shouldered, and I see no reason why you shouldn't call yourself what you like.\\"Rudolph! Oh, my!Inspector Stanislaus, Campion's friend who is brought into the case at Socrates Close believes there's \\"madness with an 'ism' of some sort\\" lurking within the house, most emphatically after a second victim drinks a cup of poisoned tea. He could be right. Allingham dresses up a psychologically fraught mystery with mysterious tramps, vicious cats, and gigantic naked footprints outside a window at the murder victims' house.The solution to this mystery is technically ingenious, and please note that \\"Police at the Funeral\\" (1931) was published eight years before Agatha Christie's \\"Ten Little Indians\\" (1939).Here is a complete list of the Campion novels that Allingham wrote (\\"Cargo of Eagles\\" was completed by her husband after her death in 1966).

This one is dated to the early 1930s, so Campion is still a young adult living in that interval between WWI and WWII that saw society making changes and accommodations necessary after the horrors of The Great War and it's staggering loss of life and fortune. More than anything by the emphasis on the older generations, the book makes it apparent the degree to which society had changed by the time.The book is filled with Albert's off-the-wall witticisms, which I always enjoy. The unexpected substitution of a single word can make a straight forward statement totally funny. Lugg here has much less of a part in the action than he has in the other books, and he's definitely missed. The characters substituted as Lugg's \\"Watson\\" are really not up to the job by comparison. I think the minor changes made by the dramaticists for the BBC/PBS televised version,Campion - The Complete First SeasonandCampion - The Complete Second Season, which gives Lugg more of a part in the action were well considered and appropriate. Inspector Oates also plays a much larger role in the story than he has in others, and his character has become clearer and more human, a part of the reader's family as opposed to a simple representative of the \\"Law.\\"I thoroughly enjoyed the many elderly characters in the book. While each was certainly a \\"type,\\" they were also individuals, which made them more than mere \\"paper tigers\\" to be polished off to further the story. It was rather fun to see an imperious older adult still calling the tune and the \\"younger\\" ones acting much like the children that they had probably been. The murders seemed just what one would have anticipated in this tension and frustration filled household, and the d&eacute;nouement while a surprise was certainly not unexpected. Actually I believe Conan Doyle did a similar story.The plot is well constructed with twists and turns that serve in lieu of red herrings to misdirect the reader's attention, and though the story is mostly about the older generation and their issues, it is not slow or inactive. The elders might remain spectators because of their limitations, but the sleuths do not.A wonderful example of Allingham's work."},{"Title":"Police at the funeral,","review":"Certainly most people who read fiction realize that it is only entertainment and that we must therefore \\"suspend\\" our \\"disbelief\\". I have read only three Allingham books and found that my disbelief was stretched too far in all three of them to be suspended. Allingham's prose style doesn't approach the elegance of Marsh's; her dialogue cannot by any means be compared to Sayers' erudition; she has nothing like like Tey's inventiveness and logic; and she has not a whit of Heyer's sense of humor. The plot of this book is clumsy, and the ending of the one I've just finished (Death of a Ghost) is preposterous. Her first book, The Crime at Black Dudley, is just as ridiculous but it, at least, can be read as parody or perhaps madcap comedy. The other two are simply boring.Albert Campion, Allingham's protagonist, is colorless, given to keeping important information from his Scotland Yard friend, and solving the crimes by a sort of intuition cum omniscience. Allingham tries to make him more interesting by hinting that he is the youngest son of important people -- royalty, perhaps. That whiff of mystery about his real identity is not enough to create an appealing character. There are three decent humans in this book (only one in Death of a Ghost!) and the rest are appalling. The reader is led along by the plot only to have the solution to the crimes appear from nowhere. Allingham had a clever idea in Police at the Funeral but just didn't know how to bring it off intelligently.I've read that Allingham's later books are better, and I intend to read on for a few more, but save yourself the intellectual insult and some recreational time and skip the ones I've mentioned above."},{"Title":"Police at the funeral,","review":"As usual Allingham's writing and plot is tight and equal to the best of today's contemporary writers...P.D. James, Elizabeth George, Ruth Rendell, and Charles Todd. Her books deserve 5 stars, but I personally have a problem with that periods rather casual acceptance...almost jocular attitude...to violent death...more of an 'oh dear' as opposed to O.M.G! Perhaps its just me, but one expects a bit more shock and grief when ones mother, father, child or fiance meets a violent end, but that was typical of the writing and films of the 1930's-40's.

The passages are organized into 30 short sections, each reflecting a different aspect of death: &quot;I am not Resigned&quot;, &quot;Sister Death&quot;, &quot;When You Face Old Age&quot;, &quot;In Paridisum.&quot; These sections can be used as a rubric for a 30 day mourning period or simply read at random as the days pass. As pastor of a church, I routinely give a copy of this book to parishioners who have lost a family member simply because it contains so many sustaining words that speak to the condition of loss and grief in a way that is never sappy, or overly sentimental.

The formatting of the book had nothing to do with my enthusiasm for it!"},{"Title":"Loudmouse","review":"I got this book when I was in elementary school (I'm now a senior in college) and I still love it. I plan on sharing it with the kindergarten class I'm working with."},{"Title":"Loudmouse","review":"This is not the version with color artwork; but the text of the story is the same, and it was a blast from the past for my fiancee!"},{"Title":"Naked Masks: Five Plays by Luigi Pirandello","review":"After reading these plays, I can understand why Pirandello won the Nobel Prize. All of the plays deal with illusion and reality in ways that contemporary writers still struggle with. Both Six Characters in Search of an Author, and Each in His Own Way play with the idea that the audience willfuly suspends reality in order to watch a play (or a movie for that matter). He plays with the idea that what something appears to be is as important, if not more important, that what it really is. Again, illusion versus reality. Although all of the plays were interesting,and entertaining, the two standouts were &quot;Six Characters...,&quot; and &quot;It is So! (If You Think So).&quot; The former deals with an acting troupe that is approached by six characters who have been conceived by a writer, but not fully realized. The Characters attempt to get the manager of the troupe to write their script, and thus give them artistic life. &quot;It is So...&quot; deals with the nature of how we know what we know, and how we decide what to believe in terms of what is real and what is not.The only problem with this collection of plays (and the only reason that I didn't give it five stars) is that in the introduction to &quot;Six Characters...&quot; the editor discusses &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author,&quot; &quot;Each in His own Way,&quot; and &quot;tonight We Improvise,&quot; as a trilogy. He takes the time to discuss the relationship between these plays, and yet &quot;Tonight We Improvise&quot; is omitted from the collection. Thus, we are left with only the first two plays of the trilogy. What makes it worse is that they are both excellent plays (making me wish I didn't have to scrounge up another book to get the third). Other than that, this is an outstanding collection. Eric Bentley (the editor) writes an informative introduction to Pirandello, and adds Pirandello's own thoughts on &quot;Six Characters...,&quot; as well as biographical information on the playwrite, in the appendix. I would recomend this for people who are, or aren't familiar with the work of Luigi Pirandello. It's definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Naked Masks: Five Plays by Luigi Pirandello","review":"This volume is written in an easy-to-read belles lettres style. The majorworks are:o Liolao It Is So (If You Think So)o Henry IVo Six Characters in Search of an Authoro Each In His Own WayThe play entitled \\"It Is So\\" begins in the parlor in the house ofCommendatore Agazzi. There is much small talk leading up to a crescendo\\" No. I am she whom you believe me to be.\\" by Signora Ponza\\" And there my friends, you have the truth!\\" by LaudisiA famous line portrays the human empathy which is a condition precedentfor getting along in this world.\\" Signora Frola [rising] . Oh, yes, yes! But, remember I told you he issuch a good man! Believe me, he couldn't be better, really! We all haveour weaknesses in this world, haven't we? And, we get along best by havinga little indulgence for one another.\\"A beauty of this work is seen in the careful emulation of the colloquialItalian spoken among the working middle class families. In addition,the work is replete with familiar neighborhood scenes, stories and plots.Luigi Pirandello was born in Sicily in 1867 (just after the Civil War) and died in 1936 just under 7 decades. He won the Nobel Prize just two yearsbefore he died."},{"Title":"Naked Masks: Five Plays by Luigi Pirandello","review":"Whenever I see anything either written by Pirandello or edited by Bentley my interest is immediately piqued. This volume, however, goes above expectations. The Nobel Prize winning Pirandello delves into the nature both of theatre and of human beings. My favorite of the plays here is &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author,&quot; which somehow straddles the border between realism and absurdism in exploring psyche and dramatic construct. For fans of modern theatre and renaissance drama alike this book makes an excellent addition to the home library."},{"Title":"Naked Masks: Five Plays by Luigi Pirandello","review":"I would recommend this collection to anyone interested in modern drama. Focus particularly on Henry IV. The play in itself is incredibly bizarre upon the first reading. Upon later readings, however, deeper meanings arise. A worthy read."},{"Title":"Second-best Bride: Book 5 (Wildrose)","review":"I really enjoyed &quot;Second-Best Bride&quot; In fact I've read it several times. It's refreshing to read ficton that challenges me as well as entertains. Miss P, The Lamb children, and Meg Shaw were interesting characters that I could relate to. I'm looking forward to reading more of Ruth Glover's books."},{"Title":"Second-best Bride: Book 5 (Wildrose)","review":"Like the rest of the Wildrose series, Glover introduces new characters and blends them with the familiar ones in the Canadian bush town of Wildrose. Meg has always lived in the shadow of her beautiful, more outgoing sister Marlys. As she watches Marlys toy with the emotions of homesteader Royce Ferguson, she realizes that Marlys actually has no intention of marrying him and moving to the wilderness of Wildrose. Meg, who knows that she will be happy even among the hard life and simplicity of Wildrose, eventually comes up with a plan to mend Royce's broken heart and to get out from under her sister's shadow. Meanwhile, back in Wildrose, &quot;old maid&quot; Miss P struggles with the fact that she is alone and has no family. As she takes care of many of the Wildrose citizens in some form or another, she eventually realizes that God has a plan for her and that some families are not necessarily made up of traditional parents and children. Back in Toronto, the Lamb family struggles physically and financially to be able to join their father in Wildrose, only to find tragedy awaiting when they arrive. For the Lambs, Miss P, and Meg, faith becomes reality as they strive to live out what they believe that God has intended for them. Second-Best Bride is a thoroughly enjoyable book about faith, love, and families."},{"Title":"Gifted & Talented, Math Grade 2","review":"My kindergarten daughter just finished this workbook. She enjoyed this kind of fun and thoughtful workbooks much more than the boring regular ones. Since she could answer over 80% of the questions independently and only needed some help from parents in not more than 20% of the questions, I think this workbook is more likely for kids at first grade level or even lower, and is probably designed for regular kids, not necessary for the gifted & talented. I believe many children will like it and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"To Act Justly, Love Tenderly, Walk Humbly: An Agenda for Ministers","review":"Recently I asked Prof Brueggemann for one of his lesser known writings on Justice or Injustice. This request came for a friend who as a non-violent protester at Ft. Benning GA was convicted to serve a six months sentence at a Kentucky Federal Prison. Without hesitation our good professor came up with the single chapter in this little gem of 65 pages! He simply repeated the names of the writers - Sharon Parks and Thomas Groome and their conference on Spirituality in Portland Maine in 1983. His valued contributions are the Preface written in May of 1984 and the first Chapter with the title of \\"Voices of the Night - Against Justice.\\"Since Brueggemann is the Theologian of three writers he sets the stage with the technical issues and background of Micah's tradition among the Old Testament prophets of Justice, Mercy and Compassion. As only our favorite OT Prof can accomplish he makes the case for Micah's program of poetry as a guide for our ways in education. As in his teaching he outlines the texts with headings of Economically, Epistemologically and Linguistically. Along the way he briefly focuses on Torah of Yahweh and the Exodus Memory: \\"Micah offers a vision of the nations submitting to the torah of Yahweh.\\" He relates theology behind textual interpretation with doing justice, loving kindness, and walking humbly with God. As one of my Chaplain friends notes, \\"most every exposition of Brueggemann comes out like poetry!\\" He is first and foremost a Poet.I will send my friend this powerful, mediating, spiritual force for supporting those who stand-up for the rights of those who are dis-enfranchised. Another parallel book title that comes to mind is \\"Jesus and the Disinherited\\" by Howard Thurman! It was said to have been constantly carried around by Martin Luther King, Jr.Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood"},{"Title":"Lonely Lady","review":"If you're used to Robbins over the top romps you'll realize that this novel is the first time the author uses a woman as the main protagonist. Jerilee Randall is her name, and, boy, does she pay for being who she is. Yep, Robbins doesn't spare one minute in putting her into every sexual situation there is. From dancing in seedy stripper clubs to experiencing many Hollywood casting couches, Jerilee is used, abused, and, alas, affected big time by it all. Suffice to say, the novel is more of a guy book. It reeks of female skin. And like every Harold Robbins effort, the outcome is quite addictive. This one even more so. Probably because the heroine is a likable lost soul despite her aggressive manner, and probably also because the book reads like a B-grade vintage paperback so popular in the 60s. The plot goes back and forth in time, but the present time is the strongest part. There you'll find the sleazy side of Hollywood where Jerilee throws herself in without any parachute. Of course she'll suffer greatly. It's what the reader expects from her. But she'll do it the Robbins way, using every trick in the book to get ahead. THE LONELY LADY delivers what is sets out to do, and the result is a page-turning experience only readers of good camp can enjoy. It is a classic in the genre and should definitely be remembered for what it is.-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"Lonely Lady","review":"Harold Robbins amazingly captured the sexual double standard that young women have faced for centuries and still do today. The dilemma of desire has to do with the social, relational, and cultural consequences for young woman of allowing yourself to experience and express sexual desire. If you show sexual desire, you are promiscuous and a slut, rather than simply a healthy adolescent who is curious about her sexual development. This book obviously is not a classic but it tells an important coming-of age story of a young woman in a very honest, compelling way."},{"Title":"Lonely Lady","review":"Forget about the Pia Zadora flick. This novel is Robbins' classic of the 70s. You'll stay up all night reading the misadventures of JeriLee Randall as she desperately yearns to be taken seriously in a world where men rule. Jacqueline Susann would have loved this one (maybe that's why Robbins dedicated it to her). A genuine page-turner!!!"},{"Title":"Lonely Lady","review":"Started off okay and last chapter was fine but the middle 3/4 of this book is a beating. I would definitely not recommend it to friends and wish I could have those pages back to spend on another book. Waste of my time."},{"Title":"Lonely Lady","review":"Fascinating read. I was completely drawn into the leading character's life; as if I were there experiencing it right beside her.

I've read some other books by H. Robbins and all of them were good but not as excellent as this one. For some reason I thought of this book and decided to check and see if they had it on Kindle version and they had! For $2.99 only so I purchased right away.I do recommend it!"},{"Title":"Lonely Lady","review":"I have never read anything from Harold Robbins that i have disliked. You never know if the story is going to end on a good note or an unhappy note. And the bits and pieces of history he ads to his books just makes them that much better. I have never (and probably never will) come across another writer that even comes close to his way of adding history, excitement,love, hate and all the other emotions that are around. He is and always will be TOPS in my mind."},{"Title":"Lonely Lady","review":"This was my first Harold Robbins, and if this is typical of his storytelling, it may very well be my last. Perhaps it was scandalous and ground-breaking at the time it was published, but the book didn't age well. I never did feel anything for the lead character, JeriLee. I didn't sympahtize for her when bad things happened (and there were plenty), and I didn't cheer for her when something good happened. Perhaps because nothing good ever does happen to her. Robbins needed to lighten up a bit. JeriLee needed some shining moments in this morass of melancholy. Or I should say, I as a reader needed some shining moments. This was a heavy, depressing story."},{"Title":"Lonely Lady","review":"This book is the story of a young, naive woman who wants to be a writer, so heads the Hollywood way.

This book is a real stinker and it's very trashy and just pornography in book form!"},{"Title":"Lonely Lady","review":"And those are the points I liked about it!Seriously, though, don't waste your time. The book is extremely dated, offensive, and poorly written, with underdeveloped characterizations and hardly any insight into the motivations of JeriLee or of the sleazebuckets who people her world.I didn't care about any of the characters (except maybe the stepfather, who disappears after the first quarter), and about a third of the way through, I began to be irritated by the protagonist. By the end, I was disgusted by her hypocrisy and bored by her self-centered and superficial \\"search\\" for herself. The ending was completely moronic.The sex was completely un-erotic in any of its incarnations, the drug use was tedious, and every situation was jam-packed with the same old scenarios throughout.And to think I used to feel guilty about reading Sidney Sheldon novels."},{"Title":"Lonely Lady","review":"THIS BOOK IS SO WONDERFUL.

Indians aren't black and racism only involves black people. Also, I'm white and therefore am tired of all these \\"politically correct\\" attacks on things I grew up with. I mean, come on people, a couple hundred years of slavery followed by decades of social and legal inequality that only began to really wane in the 1960s and now you all have a chip on your shoulder! You'd think \\"Little Black Sambo\\" was a hurtful racial epithet people routinely used against your granparents or something!Seriously folks - I remember this story as a kid too (and I'm only 26) and I used to eat at the \\"Sambo's\\" pancake houses that used the story on their menus and such. I liked it too, it's a decent kid's story once you take the stereotypical illustrations and racist terms out of it - which people have. I don't think the objection is about the plot of a little boy turning tigers into pancakes. It's the fact that this was a story written by a white person about people that her generation thought were inferior at a time when all dark skinned people were called \\"black\\". And the fact that term \\"Little Black Sambo\\" later became, logically or not, a racist term used by white people against blacks.The book shouldn't be banned and older kids and adults should probably read as an example of our history. But little kids can do without the racist imagery that they aren't old enough to process. I don't think it will make them racist, but imagine a classroom with a mixed group of kids. Do you really want them looking at an original version, illustrations and all, possibly making comparisons. \\"Hey sammy, you look just like Sambo\\"There's nothing wrong with modernizing it to make it a little less offensive. Do people sometimes take political correctness too far, absolutely. But do we really have to have an argument over a book that has a title with such a patently racist term?

Adults need to see the world through the eyes of a child again so they too can experience the joy of make believe.

After all the hype, I'd decided to read it myself and amazingly enough, I have no idea how they could come up with the idea the book was racist, because all it is, is just a children story and it's quite harmless to read really.This is a story about a little black boy called Little Black Sambo, the son of Jumbo and Mumbo, who gave all his beautiful new clothes away to the Tigers so they won't eat them. Little Black Sambo practically gave away all his clothes to the Tigers, filling the tigers with pride. With all these pride, trouble it bound to happened. The tiger ended up tryign to over power each other but ended up transforming in butter in which Sambo's parents made into pancakes and they ended up feeling all fulled.Overall, it is more about bullies rather than touching the issues of racisms. This should be read, not banned by the irresponsible book ban-ners."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":".Is there a stronger image in children's literature than the four angry tigers that grab each other's tails, run around the palm tree, faster and faster until they melt into a big pool of butter?The tigers intimidated the little boy (who just happens to be called Sambo) into handing over his beautiful new clothes. He is the smart hero in this classic story.The real lesson in this tale is shown in the fate of the tigers. Their greed and arrogance leads to an argument over &quot;who is the grandest&quot; when dressed in Sambo's clothes. They get so angry with each other that they forget why they are fighting but just go on getting angrier until they chase each other into oblivion. We see avarice, leading to pride, aggression, and ultimately to destruction. This is a profound lesson for all of us.The big jar of melted butter (ex-tiger) that Sambo's dad collected from under the palm tree let Mom cook up a big pile of pancakes to feed all the family.The only criticism that can be levelled at this book is &quot;tigerism&quot;.Make sure you get a genuine re-issue of Miss Bannerman's 1921 original classic not one of the bowdlerized (and supposedly sanitized) &quot;updates&quot;. The 21 illustrations in the original have a delightfully nave quality and form an essential part of this book. Look out for other books in the &quot; Wee Books for Wee Folk&quot; series. They will take you back to the more innocent and less complex world known to our grandparents. There was wisdom to be had back then too."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Yes, I know this story is no longer PC, but I loved this story growing up. I downloaded it to my Kindle the other day to read to my daughter and she liked it. It's a quick little read and you can't complain about the price! The moral of this story is just a basic life lesson... Bad people will eventually get what they deserve. I had also wikipedia the author and read it to my daughter so that she would understand why the characters where named they way they are."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Cretins have deprived children of this classic for too long. The story of Sambo and his clever triumph over adversity with the stubborn tigers is a perfect metaphor for this original work's welcome reappearance and widespread acclaim. The illustrations are charming and simple, with bright high-contrast colors, like a child's view of the world.I suppose the US government and the Census would classify us as a mixed race household, but my children, wife, and I are only reminded of it (and offended by it) when we come across the increasingly rare person who can't get past thinking of people first and foremost as colors, rather than using color only to help in a person's description, as is the case with the characters and narrative in this book.And our children love it, this is a top pick when they choose a book themselves. We've never had any \\"black\\" or \\"white\\" questions from any of our kids from reading it, they simply want Sambo to beat those tigers, get his clothes back, and eat those pancakes!My wife and I couldn't agree more that fortitude, perseverence, and a little luck, and our children's resulting laughter and joy, are the only ideas that are advanced with this marvelous story."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I recall Little Black Sambo from my childhood as well. My Aunt worked as a domestic for a Jewish household and they would give her their children's discarded playthings to take to her nephews. Little Black Sambo was among the offerings. I remember reading with fascination the story of this child and I knew nothing at the time of its racist connotations. Unfortunately, despite the denial of some of the prior reviewers, it cannot be ignored that this book might be considered offensive to some. Just like the black lawn jockeys that were so popular at one time, and the Aunt Jemima pancake box before they took the bandana off of her head, these icons represent post cival rights era reality. I supppose some of you see nothing wrong with the Little Rascal character Farina with the rags tied in his head, or Buckweat either. I would not advocate banning any of the aforementioned symbols, because I think they should be cherished as a sign of just how far we've come. I have mammy salt and pepper shakers, cookie jars, etc., because as a Black man in America, I want to remember and cherish the past. If I find the version of this book I had as child in which Sambo was jet black with white eyes and huge red lips, I'd add it to my collection in a heartbeat!"},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I remember this book from my childhood and am so happy it is still in print. I had figured it had been \\"sanitized\\" out of existence. I was a white child in a black country, and remember reading this book with other children. It was a beautiful tale about Sambo's adventures with tigers, and a wonderous finding of butter! Heck, we didn't know being different colors was a big deal til some paranoid adult told us so. Let kids retain their innocence, and let them dream of tiger butter."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Hannah WaddellPhelps10.6.04Little Black Sambo Persuasive ParagraphThe story of Little Black Sambo by Helen Banneran is a children's book that is number 90 on the 100 most frequently challenged books of 1990-2000, published by the American Library Association. This book is about a family from India. The main character is a little boy by the name of Little Black Sambo. His mother's name is Black Mumba and his father's name is Black Jumbo. In the beginning of the story Black Mumba gives Black Sambo new clothes that she made him, and his father buys him a new umbrella and some shoes. Throughout the day Sambo ends up getting all of his possessions taken away from him by tigers that were threatening to eat him up. Each of the tigers had one of Little Black Sambo's things. They all fought because they all wanted to be the grandest of the whole jungle. The tigers were so angry that they started to chase each other around a tree so fast that they melted into butter. Black Jumbo came across the butter and decided to take it home for Black Mumbo. Black Mumo was very pleased with the butter and then she made pancakes for their family to eat that night. In the end Little Black Sambo got all of his things back and had a wonderful filling 169 pancakes.This story has no reason to be on the most frequently challenged book list because for one, it is a classic, and two, because inside of the cover there is a lesson to be learned for all people who read it. That lesson is that no matter what you have in the long run, you will end up the same way as everyone else. If the book had to do with other characters, then people would not be censoring it because they think it has to do with racism. No books, especially this one, should be banned or censored because not everyone thinks the same things about what is printed in black and white for citizens of all ages to read. Little Black Sambo is a wonderful and entertaining book that lots of children and adults around the world have read and should continue to read throughout the pages of time."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"My grandmother, who was a school teacher, had this book and I remember reading it time and time again at her house. I loved it. I have her copy and I bought one of my own. I still, at age 37, love the book and read it to my children. It is not racist. It is a classic. I see nothing harmful in this book. My children are 3 and 4 and they love it also. If you look at the time the book was written and the story behind why it was written, I think you will absolutely love this classic. I think of my grandmother everytime I read it to my children."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This is a delightful book with excellent illustrations. Anyone who feels this book is racist may be a bit of one themself.I had the book as a child and was always fascinated by the tigers turning into butter. I grew up without prejudice or racism and have friends of all races and nationalities. People need to start being open-minded again and not read bad or \\"politically incorrect\\" things into everything. This is a very good child's book and I would recommend it. I am very happy it is still in print and I could purchase it at such a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I give this book four stars as a historical curiosity.But apparently, as indicated by some other reviews, there are people who still read this ridiculous book to their children because they think it's... um... good. I don't think this book should be banned or anything, but it should be viewed for what it is: dated, racist nonsense.Are reviewers who dismiss charges of racism unaware of the significance of the name \\"Sambo,\\" and how racially charged it is? Could they justify their claims if this tale of a dark-skinned boy was instead called \\"The Story of Little Black N*****\\"? Sambo in this book is indeed Indian, as some reviewers have noted. But again, are the book's fans unaware of the British racism that Indians faced? (If not, I recommend that they at least rent \\"Ghandi\\" the next time they're in the video store.) Bannerman was British, after all. Another important thing to note about the word \\"Sambo\\" is that one hundred years ago, it -- much like the n-word, in fact -- was commonly used by Westerners to describe ANY non-Westerners with dark skin. That's right -- Africans, Indians, Southeast Asians, and even some Native Americans. If you doubt me, get a good dictionary and check the similar usage histories of the two words.Therefore, I see little evidence that it even mattered to Bannerman or readers of this book when it first came out whether it was about Indians or Africans -- as subjects of the British Empire they all served as the White Man's Burden, did they not? The tendency to lump all non-whites into the same supposedly inferior group is itself racist. And this book is certainly guilty of doing that.Don't get me wrong -- Bannerman was no Thomas Dixon. I have no doubt that she had benign intentions when writing this book, but I am unconvinced that her opinion of the Indian race was much higher than the opinion many American whites held of black people around the same time (even if it was less hostile). Her portrayal of nonwhites as primitive cretins shows just how low this opinion was. And as I mentioned above, it's not as if she invented the same of Sambo. It already had a connotation that, at its least offensive, was condescending toward people of dark skin. (We won't even address her decision to name Sambo's parents Mumbo and Jumbo; I think you get the idea.)One thousand years from now, it may be perfectly fine to read this book as an innocent children's tale. But sadly, it apprears that today we live in a world where some people refuse to recognize how ugly the struggle could be to obtain racial equality in the U.S. or to end colonial British rule in India. Frankly, feeding an incendiary relic of these sagas to our children as if nothing bad ever happened only perpetuates this ignorance.If you disagree with me, go ahead -- vote my review unhelpful. But before you do, I recommend reading a few history books. You'll probably learn a thing or two."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I remember my teacher reading this book to me in the first grade. I thought it was the most racist book I had ever seen or heard & could not understand why someone would write something like that & think it was okay or to read it & think there's nothing wrong with it. I am a 32 yr old african american woman now & I wouldn't dream of reading this to my children because it does not depict true african or african american children. It's only a stereotype of how some people, who may have some racism in them, view us. Now if you want to read a better version of this story, then you should read Sam & The Tigers. A retold version of Little Black Sambo, written by Julius Lester."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"When I was a very little girl, beautiful Falcons flew with Thunderbirds and roamed the road with Mustangs, Galaxies and cool Fairlanes. Zenith and RCA were the top names in television and Ford had better ideas. It was an era that predated being politically correct and I remember this story vividly. I remember when I was 3 years old being offended by the title. My exact words were, &quot;If he was anything but black, he wouldn't be called Black Sambo.&quot; I remember I found the part about the tigers melting scary. Although I marveled at Sambo's resourcefulness, I didn't like the part about the animals melting. I found that upsetting.Folks, maybe polical correctness takes a back seat to childhood memories. Here is a memory that is conveniently overlooked. Sambo is a racist term that is used towards persons with one black parent. It is a racist term that is the one bad thing about an otherwise good story. I don't mean to knock anybody's childhood memories, but I just had trouble with the title and the names of the central characters."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Actually, this book deserves a negative rating. This book is racist trash.As a white preschool teacher, I would never allow this book anywhere in my classroom. Even if I taught older children, I would still not allow this book in the classroom. It is unmitigated, racist trash. Until children are old enough to be critical readers and thinkers, this book only perpetuates racism. Of course, it is not designed for older children who have these types of skills.For all those people who rate this book highly, they are only showing their inability to understand how harmful early racist stories with their stereotypical illustrations influence young children. Racism is alive and well in the U.S."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This is racist trash and I find myself alternately appalled and amused by the bizarrely arrogant defense of such insulting tripe, brimming with racial slander. These sentiments are quite revealing. I also notice that both my earlier reviews have been removed although they contained no intemperate language ad hominem attacks or profanity: also revealing."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"absolutely, without a doubt, the most racist book i have ever read... which makes for a quite good laugh at holiday parties!"},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"The illustrations in this book are disappointing! They really depict Little Black Sambo, his mother and dad in a oid-timey \\"black,\\" derogatory way. Given the opportunity, I would not purchase this book again."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This is not, as one reviewer writes, \\"A loving attempt to reach across the racial divide.\\" Unfortunately the historical record contradicts this reading, and this kind of nostalgia for a 'simpler time' erases the history of colonial rule. Maintaining divisions between a ruling class (British) and a subaltern class (colonial subjects) was the whole point of colonialism. The story of a cute native is part and parcel of the same ideology that produces the story of the threatening savage, or the easily scared native. Even if he is clever. This idea supported Western dominance. You may find this character cute and cuddly, but stop and think about that. So are puppies. It paid to maintain that the 'primitive' races were refreshingly childlike, endearingly innocent, incapable of self rule or living in a modern world. They were the 'white man's burden,' and their natural resources could be had for the superior races. You would see this more clearly if you had a look at any of the official papers written by colonial administrators like Helen Bannerman's husband. All of these stories came out of that system of beliefs. Exactly WHO is nostalgic for this past? Certainly not Black and Brown descendants of a conquered people. This was not a simpler time but one in which brutal subordination of a people was sanctioned by the state. If you miss that 'simpler time' I hope you don't live next door to me. My children would not be safe."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This book is a perfect example of a reigning culture ( in this case Western Caucasian ) dressing up it's post-Slavery Era losses and expanding Colonialism as benevolent towards the \\"child-like\\" races that only need simple things to be happy in their subordination to the superior white people and their culture.It stunk of racism to me when I was a child in the 1960s. And stinks of racism now. In a post-Civil Rights era, where we should all know better than excuse this smiling little culturally \\"unconscience\\" evil, there is no excuse for this propaganda."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Whether Sambo is African, African American, or Indian, he still represents a colonized or enslaved people who are nearly always identified as childlike and ignorant. This was true for the Indians who were colonized by the British, the Africans enslaved by Europeans, and African Americans enslaved and held down by structural racism in America. And they continue to be portrayed like this main character. The problem with this book is that the racism is masked within a child's story, and is therefore entertaining. For those of you who don't see the harm in it, imagine reading a white counterpart in this story. What if the character were Polish? How would your reaction be different? It is perhaps easier now to see then that this story may be hurtful to some people? Other white counterparts of Sambo include the invariably inebriated Irishman or Scotsman, the ever questioning and unintelligent Swede, or the ever mob-affiliated Italian--all of which are extraordinarily offensive, though they have been lodged within various forms of entertainment for years such as movies and jokes. The fact that sometimes this book sells off the shelves is no surprise because most people don't understand the racial significance of this book and don't care to know (as seen in such reviews celebrating the greatness of this book). The privilege of calling ones preferences \\"not racist\\" comes with scrutinizing every aspect of things we like, and rooting out anything that is even in the slightest bit racist. If for you this book is a great book devoid of racism, well, you might want to think twice about thinking yourself as a progressive, unbiased person when it comes to race. If you're reading this book for any reason, it should be coupled with a class on racist ideology and how American culture is infused with it in the shape of seemingly benign forms of advertising and entertainment (i.e. Dairy Queen's \\"Moolatte\\", Aunt Jemima, etc). This is therefore not a children's book. For something a lot less offensive, that introduces your kids to other cultures, try Favorite African Folktales edited by Nelson Mandela."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I can't believe Amazon is still selling this trash!!

The story is obviously the same, pictures are fine. Looks like a little kids book instead of a copy you would be proud to put in your book case."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"A few years ago The Story of Little Babaji was published. It was same story as Little Black Sambo, with the same characters (albeit with different names) in the correct Indian setting. It had the same humor (who cannot appreciate a tiger wearing shoes on its ears), the same thrill of victory when the tigers run themselves into butter and a courageous little boy gets his clothes back, the same self-satisfied pleasure when a happy family stuffs itself with buttered pancakes. I enjoyed reading it immensely.Which is why I am disappointed with this volume. When I heard that a new edition of The Story of Little Black Sambo was being published under it's original title, I was anxious to add it to my collection. I loved it as a child, and I was ready to love it again as an adult. Now that I have my copy in hand, though, I find that I'm of two minds about it. One the one hand, it's a visual treat -- the pictures fairly hum with life. The detail work is amazing, from the proper caste mark on the mother's forehead to the south-bound end of a certain north-bound tiger. The reader is left in no doubt that he or she is deep in the Indian sub-continent.And that is the problem. Because if the plants are Indian, and the birds are Indian, and the tigers are Indian, and the buildings are Indian, and the clothes are Indian, and the personal decoration is Indian, why, then, aren't the people Indian? As I look at his illustrations, I couldn't help feeling that Bing knew exactly where his story was set, he just couldn't bring himself to let go of that old, incorrect stereotype that has plagued this story for so many years. The mixture of the two strikes a decidely peculiar note. I found myself noticing the incongruity and missing the story.In the end, then, Bing's illustrations do not so much advance the story, as illustrations should, as distract the reader from it.And that is a shame."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"The children's book was shipped in good order and the prodcut arrived promtly.

I was looking forward to reading to my grandson."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":".. i had this book as a small child, too, and i absolutely loved it; but even at the time i knew that it was astonishingly racist. my mother made that quite clear to me at the time and i think that even very small children understand when they're presented with things that are \\"questionable\\" and are told why such things may be hurtful to others. to me, it was a story about a little boy that i wished i could go on an adventure with. but i also understood that it should be considered backward in many ways, outdated in its thinking and portrayals, unashamedly racist and inappropriate to imitate. if i had not understood those things, the book would not have remained in the house. i don't know if such things still have instructional value or cultural value or historical value; but anyone who thinks that this book is not racist is kidding themselves. it is racist and there is no way for it not to be."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Yes, this is a children's story written in the 1800s at a time when African and Indian people were thought of as mystical interesting or even savage people. I don't think the intent of the story was racist, but of course you wouldn't think of something as racist when you are writing it and it is accepted at the time. 100 years from now people may think that it is racist to use the label African-American in books and many of you may say: &quot;No it's not, I read the story about Little African-American Keisha and how she ate 1,000 waffles and the little Indian boy made all of the lions melt into syrup.&quot; The point is, there is never going to be a time where the meaning of something doesn't change. Ideologies and stereotypes are not consistent and so they falter. The story may appeal to people who grew up reading the book because in that time anything &quot;black&quot; could be used, and abused and as children you don't really value the feelings of other cultures. As long as the story puts you to bed at night, then it's all good. The author used someone clever and he had magical adventures. But to say that it is stupid and ignorant to view some aspects of the book as racist is stupid and ignorant within itself. African people have been portrayed in so many derogatory ways, it's hard to stomach things like illustrations of &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; no matter how innocent they may be. For us it brings back memories of minstrel shows and times when African-Americanscould only get exposure as buffoons just for the enjoyment of European cultures. Those images to us, no matter what text they are put in are UGLY, very UGLY. If you read this book, I recommend following it up with the movie Bamboozled by Spike Lee. Let your children see that also. Maybe then you can understand why people feel the way they do. All the open-minded liberal people shouldn't mind watching it at all, right? After all, &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; isn't racist, right? But the movie will help you to realize that words and pictures do hurt.Peace...Abztract"},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Bannerman, a white Scot living in India, wrote a children's fantasy about a young Black boy and his loving family. Negative attacks of this work reveal people who use the material as mirrors to guilty souls that live in irrational fear. Their solution to handle this state is empty appeasement and shallow references to stereotypical Black history. This ignores the rich heritage of \\"unpopularized\\" Black cultural artifacts. Authors of one race can write about characters of another without being racist. Racist symbols are picked from many non racist sources. The racist use of the word \\"Sambo\\" and the similarity of the illistrations to \\"Blackface\\" style is after the fact and unfortunate.

These \\"knockoffs' were used by those of ill intent to demean and diminish African-Americans for decades.Should you read the story to your children? If done so responsibly, sure. In the eyes of children, who are color-blind, it is a wonderful story.

Used to go to Sambo's Restaurant when I was 5 yrs old. Will never forget the story lit up on the upper walls. As an adult, I still love the story of the boy & the tiger.

I was stunned at how beautiful this book is--the illustrations alone are worth the price but the most interesting parts to me were the two cover and closing pages with Christopher Bing's Indian postcards and trinkets. Stunning edition. My Christmas shopping for next year is taken care of with another order of these books."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I began reading this story as a small child and I really liked it. This was in a set of books my parents got me when I was two.It is a tragedy that a few politically correct knuckleheads have attempted to ban this story.Some claim this story is racist (African-American, or whatever the PC title is currently). IT IS NOT!!!For one thing, this story takes place in INDIA, not AFRICA. I went to school with a number of Indians and Pakistanis, and many of them are dark-skinned, like Little Black Sambo. Toward the end of the story, the tigers became ghee (or ghi), which is an Indian cooking fat, not African.Moreover, if that story took place in Africa, there would be no tigers. Tigers are found ONLY in Asia. The closest any African would be to a tiger would be in a zoo, and there is no zoo mentioned in the story.This politically correct drivel over something that does not even exist has led to misunderstanding of a really good children's story (to say nothing of problems with a restaurant chain with part of the same name)."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I'd say this is a racial book only if you make your mind up beforehand and are very narrow minded. My parents read this book to me as a child and it was always one of my favorites. I couldn't believe that tigers could melt into 'butter'! What a facinating story. I couldn't wait to shareit with my kids and they both love it. They call it the tiger story and they know that it takes place in another country in another time. I have my original copy so my review is based on that.I was thinking of getting it for our kindle Fire also, so I was reading reviews to see if it contains the original photos. That's when I read the crazy reviews about it being a racial book andhad to chime in. I'd say these type of people are the same ones that might ban Harry Potter because it contains magic, but don't have any problem at all reading Grim's Fairy Tales or taking their kid to see a Disney movie with magic in it. If you want a sweet little book that your kidswill LOVE, then I'd say give this one a chance."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This book is TOO small, only about 4*5. The pictures of the tigers running around the tree is so small and some pages don't have any pictures at all. There was no size listed on the book profile. Very disappointed since these were ordered for my mother to give to her grandkids at Christmas and it's too late to return them & get something else."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This is a delightful book with excellent illustrations. Anyone who feels this book is racist may be a bit of one themself.I had the book as a child and was always fascinated by the tigers turning into butter. I grew up without prejudice or racism and have friends of all races and nationalities. People need to start being open-minded again and not read bad or \\"politically incorrect\\" things into everything. This is a very good child's book and I would recommend it. I am very happy it is still in print and I could purchase it at such a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I LOVE SAMBO! My Grandmother read it to me when I was a child, she is gone now but when I see the words on the page I can hear her voice in my head. Sambo is NOT racist. Sambo, as viewed from a child, is black(check your crayola's), he is brave, he lived a long time ago when there was no TV. How many parents have put new clothes on their children and told them to keep them nice and clean. Sambo lived in a different country then then I do, his life, culture, were different. Let us embrace that Sambo has fears and can be brave, and is smart enough as a little kid to outwit those tigers. I viewed him as a hero (in the late 70's) and now I believe he is a hero to my children.Give kids a little credit they know things change and were different before they were born. The original is the way to go, it is a magical story. Don't forget it is a STORY, meant to entertain children, and it does it's job, very, very well."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This book is wonderful. I remember it being read over and over to me when I was a mere child. I remember the pancakes and the tigers. This book has nothing to do with racism. Nothing! It is an incredible story of a little boy who fights for his pancakes and wins! Anyone who is insecure with their nationality should not inflict that on other's joy in this book or any other prejudice in life. The insecurities need confronting not the books or other issues as such. Indeed this book brings fond memories of my childhood."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I found this book exciting and as a child I didn't know of racism and never thought of this book as anything but a childs story. Wasn't this story started in India? I have a copy from around 1930, there is no publishing date, and I would like to hear from some one who knows about this particular book. I also believe this story book was published in England before it was published here."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"For those who think this book is racial stereo typing, you may have a point, but only as far as the pictures are concerned. I can't understand what the controversy is regarding the story itself. You've got an intact black family (I know, they're from India but still basically black). Dad works, Mom stays home with Sambo and makes him cool duds, and Sambo's a sensitive, clever child. You're just looking for a fight if you think this story reflects badly on black people. And have you ever seen how ugly Gary Larson's Far Side WHITE people are?? Blecch."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I had to have this book when I saw it in the store. The illustrations are rich and beautiful, but what really sold me was the look of the book. It's made to look like a hundred-year-old book, with torn pages and spine and worn gilding. It looks like dearly-beloved books I have in my own library, treasures from my childhood. I especially loved the claw mark on the cover; a tiger has been here! And the postcards and letters reproduced on the endpapers take me back to a magical world, the world of Mary Lennox in the opening pages of \\"The Secret Garden.\\"I've loved this story for 45 years, despite its unfortunate connotations. This illustrator has tried to reclaim it. I wonder if maybe enough time has passed and the world has changed enough for that to be possible. I asked for this book at one bookstore, and the young black clerk had never heard of it. Certainly the beautiful, resourceful child in these illustrations bears no resemblance to the bug-eyed stereotype in the original. I do wish that he'd drawn an Indian child, to fit the backgrounds, but I understand why he made the child African. The story is a fantasy; if we can believe that tigers would wear shoes on their ears and turn into melted butter, maybe it's possible to accept this African family in India.I read the book out loud to my husband, and he laughed until he cried at those ridiculous tigers. \\"Now I'm the grandest tiger in the jungle. Grrrr!\\""},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I don't quite know how some people get racial stereotypes out of this wonderful story. It's true that much of the older artwork fell into the racist genre, but the story itself is pretty free of all that rot. It's a charming story for children, and poor Sambo (who is Indian, not African - contrary to uninformed opinion) overcomes comical tigers to triumph over them. Then, of course, he gets his pancakes!"},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This was my favorite story as a child.I am now 55 yrs. old. I had the book and the record. My mother and I spent many good times singing and telling this story. I have lost the book through the years and so have been telling the story and singing the songs to my granddaughter. I thought the book was out of print. I can now share it with my grandchildren. Please don't read anymore into the story than a simple brave little boy who could eat 199 pancakes."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Digging through an old box, I found my tiny, tattered little book of Little Black Sambo, which is very old as it was my dad's before mine! I LOVED this book as a child, I am 30 now, and can't wait to share it with my own children. I remember just staring at the brilliantly colored illustrations and being entranced by the whole story line---even a little scared at the tigers! I really did wonder if tigers running in circles could make butter and I even think I asked my dad if it was real!I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised to see that you can still purchase this book, although in the original format I have no idea. It is too bad that libraries would think to ban a book like this----I am a &quot;white&quot; person who is totally colorblind and I have to say that reading and loving Little Black Sambo as a child never made me want to be racist or gave me racist thoughts. It is a work of fiction, and even as a child I knew that it was just a story.Anyways--this is a great read for grownups and for reading to little ones--and it is a good thing, I guess, that you can also purchase a politically correct version to share with children of any color also--because the story line is the fun part of the book.KT"},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I loved this book as a child and my kids have also loved it.

I found the writing style very old-fashioned. Neither the pictures nor story appealed to me, (and I felt sorry for the tigers).

My intention with this book was to give it as a gift, and when I opened the package I was suprised as to the condition and the missleading representation the book was given. When you first look at the posted picture of the book it appears to be a new publication, there is no description of the age or condition of the book and I think the seller should have included that info.

This book also has an extra feature that adds so much. It has commentary on the history of the book; who wrote it, and comments about the social climate when it was written. It tells of the controversy in the 1960's, and of the person who has created the new illustratons for this re-print. I have always loved this story for the story, just as I love the Jungle Book, and Tarzan, tigers and jungles are in a lot of my favorite childhood stories, the names never meant a thing nor brought any ideas of racial differences to me. I was so disappointed when it was no longer available for my children.Reading the commentary though brought into focus what this book could have meant to other people, and now as an adult, I can understand what was going on in the 1960's.

If you did not grow up with this book and enjoy drifting off now and again to the world of fairytales and children's stories, add this book to your collection and think of it as a gift for a child you know.Incidentally, this 'American Classic' is in reality a British classic written by Edinburgh born (hence a Scot) British author Helen Bannerman. It has been translated into many languages and has been immensely popular worldwide...which doesn't make it a German (or Japanese etc.) classic because of its popularity.I remember it from my early years in Germany and it makes me smile when I run across it here in Spain in bookstores.

As for the name sambo, it was turned into a slur by some bigot and probably would have happened with any name chosen. I'm sure many will be offended when I say \\"get over it\\" you brought more attention to this \\"offense\\" than it ever would have gotten otherwise.

It just so happens that I grew up in Bangladesh which used to be part of India. I knew about the jungle, I knew about the tigers. I had inherited this book from my parents and grandparents and found it a delightful tale, quite similar to some of the Bengalis folk tales. My brother's best friend (Nazrul Islam was his given name)had the nickname by his family and friends of Kalo (in bangla it means black) because he had midnight dark skin. He was a terribly good looking boy (I had a small crush on him as a child) and never once did I or anyone else think of his nickname as degrading or insulting. He was just Kalo. When I returned to the US years later I was shocked to find that my little story book was the center of a great racial controversy. It was so crazy. It was a little book from India where some lady used the local customs and tales to write a story. When people criticize the book for being racist, all they are really doing is criticizing the culture of India. People are given Nicknames as descriptives in the Indian subcontinent. My nickname was Mamonie (little one). It just boggles my mind that people can find horror in even the most innocent simple things. And for those people who claim racism, watch yourself. For you are showing yourself biased against the culture of other people!"},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"As a child I admired Little Black Sambo! I honestly think that reading this book (Little Goilden Book edition) time and again at my Grandparents' home, gave me an appreciation for other cultures. Sambo was very clever and brave.

It never occurred to me that the parents names might be derogatory, if anything the names sounded exotic: Black Jumbo and Black Mumbo. Children are innocent and see things in a clean, clear manner. Whatever is considered &quot;bad&quot; in this book is the manufacture of over-sensitive adults.This is a great classic and belongs in every library along with Grimm's Fairy Tales and Aesop Fables. One can revisit the magic of childhood through &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot;."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"The story of little black Sambo is truly a classic from all who remember it from our childhood.Helen Bannerman wrote this story for her two little children while traveling with them by train across India. If people would LOOK AT THE ILLUSTRATIONS they would see that Sambo is a little Indian boy from India, continents away from America and the Cival war and or South. I ran 2 independant bookstores some 12 to 14 years ago and when I finally found THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO in print again I'd order maybe 60 copies a week and could not keep this wonderful little storybook in stock. Almost every buyer were grandparents who could not wait to introduce their grandchildren to a book we all knew and loved. It is a must have for all collectors of wonderful literature!"},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"First of all I think that racism is learned. I found nothing wrong with this story and in fact it was one of my favorites as a kid. Many a time you would find us playing tigers running around a tree and melting into butter. To me, it is a story about a little black boy who has two parents who love him very much and give him gifts. The tigers try to eat him, he gives them his clothes and then, while they're fighting, he gets them back. I loved how the tigers turned to butter and Sambo got to eat 169 pancakes! Wow, a huge stack of pancakes loaded with freshly melted butter. I know my kids would love that. I asked my kids 12 and 10 what they thought of the story. Did they think it was mean to black people. We all agreed that it was a good story and could be written with any race and still be good. As for their names-since we haven't studied the history of how hated dark skinned people across the world have been in such depth, they don't mean a thing to us. Why wait 100 years to read the story just because some people can't get over the past? I hope you'll read the book and enjoy it with your children-that's what it was written for-and when you're done go make some pancakes together:)"},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Well, it raises enough issues to keep literary scholars blabbing on for years and years. Following in the mighty footsteps of two other recent \\"Little Black Sambo\\" adaptations (one Fred Marcellino's \\"The Story of Little Babaji\\" and the other Julius Lester's complete reinterpretation \\"Sam and the Tigers\\") Christopher Bing's version of Helen Bannerman's original 1899 children's book is perhaps the purest retelling of the tale. Using the author's own words while replacing her pictures with beautiful woodcut-like illustrations, the story is a true labor of love.Where to begin? When Helen Bannerman first wrote the story of Sambo for her children, she had no idea that her Beatrix Potter-like invention (both women began publishing children's books in similar ways) would be the source of so much controversy and contempt. So let's say that we're a child that has stumbled across this edition without knowing a thing about its history. To them, this is a gorgeous story filled with light and color and a young boy beating those more powerful around him. The book has stayed true to the original in that it is set in India but features black characters. So there's some danger that kids will believe some Africans live in an India-like country. Otherwise, there's not much fault (in terms of the book in and of itself) to find with this retelling. Bing has obviously spent an inordinate amount of time researching and questioning his creation. We shouldn't ignore the fact that the great Henry Louis Gates Jr. (the Chair of Afro-American Studies at Harvard, doncha know) not only approved of this work but encouraged its publication. So for me, it's a success (though I'm a little leery of the Bing picture on the bookflap presenting him as a colonist).For some people, however, the very names of the characters (Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo) combined with the history of the tale are reason enough not to approve of this book. To them, a story like this can only make it seem \\"okay\\" that children be called Sambo. For others, the true crime of the original was not the story (in which a black boy outwits nasty predators) but the pictures. Remove the offending articles and replace with far better ones and the problem is completely solved. For me, I dunno. There's little doubt in my mind that Bing's book is breathtakingly beautiful. But every adult I've showed it to so far has been unable to get past the title. I would show them the gorgeous endpapers and faux aged binding (meant, I can only assume, to recreate the book as it SHOULD have appeared those one hundred odd years ago). I would patiently explain that Ms. Bannerman did not intend the story character, Sambo, to be associated with blacks in the United States. But even today the sting of that name is as powerful as ever. It may take one hundred or two hundred more years to undo some of its damage. Maybe at that point people will be able to read this particular edition for what it truly is. A loving work of beauty and skill. If you've any problems with the idea of making \\"Little Black Sambo\\" palatable to members of the 21st century, do not buy this book. If, however, you're a little curious and incredibly aware of the potential controversy engendered by this title, seriously consider buying it. At the very least, it stands as a true testament of how far we've come, and how far we've yet to go."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"When I was young we were read this story a lot. We were read the story so much that the book wore out. After that I had to ask my older brother to tell it to me because I couldn't remember it. I don't understand how this book is racist besides Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo's titles &quot;little black&quot; and the artwork. But the artwork just portrays the views of the time, and I've never understood how calling someone &quot;black&quot; is racist and calling someone &quot;white&quot; is'nt. If you want to read anything into this story it should be how a little boy outwitted four tigers. If you want to read a great childrens story pick it up. But if your looking for a place to unleash your insecurities of yourself leave this book to those who appreciate it. If people don't like it they are free not to read it, and if people like it they should be free to read it."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"When my wife asked me to try and find several classic children's books for her new baby grandson, I smiled at the mention of the titles, recalling with great fondness the stories being read to me by my mother when I was a child. Little Black Sambo was one of those stories. It is, of course, a shame that there arose some time ago individuals who equated the story with &quot;racism&quot;. To the intelligent mind, it is truly a pity that some are so intent to find &quot;racism&quot; that they will envision same where none even vaguely exists.Such is the case with this fanciful, harmless classic story for children; a story that has been told to generations of children who have listened in wonder as the tigers melted into butter for (the little Indian boy) Sambo's pancakes!It is a story that returns one to a simpler time, long before child psychologists, political correctness (and who indeed is qualified to judge what is or is not CURRENTLY &quot;correct&quot;? Perhaps we're better off not knowing their identities, God help us!), shootings committed by school children, and all the other wonders of this wonderful Modern Age.Little Black Sambo is an American classic. As for racism: it can be found wherever one desires to find it. And if it exists not where they look, tis easy enough to invent."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I saw this book in a bookstore this summer. I have been getting other editions from England to give to children as gifts. This is a magnificent book with great illustrations by Bing. I have read the other reviews and trust me that this story stands on its own to delight children. When I taught second grade the class loved to hear it. It is not racist in the least.Sambo worries that he will get into trouble when he loses all his new clothes. And children relate to getting into trouble with their parents. He uses his head to outwit the tigers and children naturally indentify with him; like they do with other hero figures in books and television and movies. He has a loving home with two parents who sit down with him to enjoy a wonderful pancake breakfast at the end of the story. Little Black Sambo is a story of a timeless hero! Stop worrying that the setting is India and the child looks African for Pete\`a sake! Its FICTION!! Children don\`t care about such picky details! This story has been delighting children for generations. Adults should go find something else to stew about!"},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I had this book when I was a little girl and lost it.

This story is a classic and I was thrilled to get a new copy for my son. It was one of my favorites growing up."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"As a person of African descent who was born in England, I read about Little Black Sambo when I was a child. I liked the book and I didn't feel insulted because the book was about a little Indian boy and I wasn't Indian. Besides, Sambo was smart and won in the end so I thought he was pretty cool. Besides, at that time in England, everybody who wasn't white with dark skin was black. However, when I got older, moved to North America and learned about how the story had been twisted, distorted and used to humiliate and degrade people of African descent, my feelings changed. I still remember the book fondly, but I would have a hard time giving it to a child in this day and age. The problem isn't the story, the problem is in how the story has been used. Those people who defend the book and dismiss the feelings of those who are offended by it are the ones who do the book a diservice, in my opinion. As a non-Jew, anti-semitism doesn't affect me personally, but I completely respect and understand the feelings of those that it does. I think the author intended to increase understanding and respect. Those people who use her work to riddicule and trample over the feelings of others destroy her legacy more than any ban ever could."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This story is and was amazing...for many reasons!First, it is amazing how truly beloved this lil' story remains in the hearts of *us* baby~boomers who were so very blessed to have had it read and reread to us again and again and again. As a child, the story was absolutely captivating for me...and I only wish that I could become even half as mesmerized by any of the young children's books being published today, but sadly I am not. Literature has been washed down terribly so in light of \\"all the fuss\\" and controversy over far, far too many books ~ and this is a classic ! Racism ? Hog~Wash !!! The name *Sambo* held absolutely no definition of even the slightest hint of a negative connotation to it when I was a child...zip, zero, zilch, nada !Fault me for loving this book...and you shall fault me for my own definition of the name *Sambo* which, to this day, only evokes wonderful memories of a story about a sweet little boy (who just happened to have black colored skin...no biggy) and instead of being eatin' up by those awfully scary and mean tigers, why he was so smart that he ended up eating yummy delicious pancakes all slathered with tiger butter !!!Oooooh, how many times I WISHED I WAS LITTLE BLACK SAMBO ! Imagine that...a WHITE GIRL from the heartland of Kansas wishing she were a BOY with BLACK skin from the jungle. Why I even remember thinking how very LUCKY Little Black Sambo was to be living IN THE JUNGLE....unlike me. Interesting, isn't it ? How this little story brought to life in me the notion that I was \\"less fortunate and underprivileged\\" simply because I was not blessed enough to be born in the jungle where those tigers lived!!! Because if I HAD...surely to goodness it would have been ME who would have been smart enough to trick all those silly tigers. And if it HAD been me....would this sweet little story have ever been ridiculed and lambasted erroneously by so many ? ? ? ? ? ? ? The answer is clear...a resounding NO !If, based on the beliefs (and beliefs are what we CHOOSE to believe to be *true*....and not necessarily TRUTH itself) that this story could be so powerfully negative and influential as to have warped my view concerning people who have much, much darker skin than myself...how is it that I have, since childhood, held black americans (well, all people for that matter) in highest esteem ???????Did I, as a child, notice that some adults did not hold the same view and opinion of me ? Absolutely YES ! And I well remember that it was mind boggling for me, as a mere five year old child, to watch a nasty old man scold a young black girl away from a drinking fountain. I was confused...and scared...because I didn't understand WHAT SHE HAD DONE WRONG. And so I asked my mother, \\"What did she do?\\", and she simply replied that the sign over the water fountain read \\" NO BLACKS \\". And THAT was my first memory of hatred, racism, harsh and unfair judgement...call is what you will ...but it was NOT because of \\"Little Black Sambo\\". It was by the hand of a man whose view and opinion of human beings differed only because of the color of their skin.And some of my innocence was lost that day. And I became a little more afraid of who might reject me because of something I could not change about myself.A M A Z I N G............simply amazing !"},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Classic story in a nice binding for the price.

I'm grateful its still in print."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Written by a British woman living in India at the turn of the century to entertain her two daughters, Little Black Sambo quickly became a funny classic of children's literature (modern fantasy). It is a tale of a jolly, resourceful little boy who gives away his red coat and his blue trousers and his purple shoes and his green umbrella to the different tigers who want to eat him up. Then the tigers fight over which is the grandest tiger, and chase each other around a tree, not letting go of each others' tails until they turn into butter. Little Black Sambo rescues his clothing and his father takes the melted butter home so his mother can make pancakes. They all sit down to supper and Little Black Sambo eats the most pancakes because he is so very hungry.This book has the language of story-telling which appeals to children. It is also good to let children play-act out the story. The pictures illustrate the story with humor as well. The simple words, and the highly effective repetition, capture the attention of both reader and listener, frightening them just enough to excite them.One of the most successful books ever written for the two-to-five age group, each picture exactly illustrates a moment in the story. The text and pictures present non-white people as living in entirely primitive conditions, and as having no culture. Sambo communicates with animals, which seemed to imply that he is inferior, and close to the animal world. The illustrations are crudely drawn, grinning stereotypes with clownish eyes and huge mouths. The situation &quot;Oh! Please Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up and I'll give you my beautiful little Red Coat&quot; is the picture of the always docile black. Sambo's parents are called Black Jumbo and Black Mumbo, and these names are rather apt to harbor racial and religious intolerance (as in the phrase &quot;mumbo-jumbo&quot;).At the time she was writing the story, black had no unpleasant significance. Indians were quite prepared to talk about black; the derogatory idea crept in later. Bannerman did not have any sort of color prejudice: black was used to make an interesting story for children and a black child was a more romantic figure for a white child to read about. It was inevitable that a woman of Bannerman's background and period would think and write as she did. Her outlook is certainly racist in the context of today, and would have no place in a multi-racial society.This book has been repeatedly challenged as an acceptance of white superiority, and is still banned from libraries, showing an awareness of the deep roots of racism in our history, culture, and language."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"I remember my aunt reading me this book as a child.

This book presents a great opportunity to show children how easy it is to create a lasting negative image of people without being overtly disrespectful of them. It's the false words that are layered on sweetly behind a coy smile that we need to be trained to watch out for, and this story allows a parent to teach just that while sharing a classic piece of children's literature.I do wish the book were larger so you could more easily see the illustrations."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"My daughter inherited this book from her Aunty Vicki when Vicki was having a clear out of all her old childhood books from storage (watch this space for lots of reviews as we work our way through the box of books).

I always think this is a shame where an innocent children's book is subject to a ban due to political correctness. Saying that, I am white British so perhaps I just don't appreciate any offence that someone could take from this story.The story itself is a lovely, simple tale of a little boy. The drawings are just delightful and really help to tell the story. They have certainly caught the imagination of my two year old as she is currently insisting on taking this book everywhere we go in the car to browse through.Ok I guess it is the names of the characters that could cause offence to some - which I have had to delete in my review as apparently amazon review tools believes them to be offensive as well - and I am aware of this when Hannah is carrying the book around in public.If you are looking for a cute little tale to read to a child with delightful illustrations then get this book, but if you are worried about offending someone, then I would suggest that you give it a miss. 4 out of 5 from me."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"We were so glad to locate a hard back copy of this book.

Even though the book does not deal with the African American, the character's names Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo are certainly not Indian but Jamaican.I heard about this book originally from a rap CD Mr. Hood by the group KMD where the words &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; were scratched in with other images of Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street. The rap group suggests that racism notions begin in innocence and progress eventually to stereotypical behavior. However, it points out that African Americans stereotype whites and pokes fun of that using Mr. Hood as the prototypical white businessman who is outwitted by the group members. By using Mr. Hood as a contrast to Black Sambo and the orange colored Ernie and Bert, KMD shows that racism by both white and blacks can be detrimental.I think that this child's book is important as a part of American memorabilia and for understanding the history of racial stereotypical. Whether or not people believe the racism of Bannermann's book, Little Black Sambo is always an essential book to read by both children and adults."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This is racist trash and I find myself alternately appalled and amused by the bizarrely arrogant defense of such insulting tripe, brimming with racial slander.

I like the story, but I wish the race and the color of the child and the child's parents were omitted."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"To me, it is not a matter of being offended or not. But if you can read this without any discomfort you need to review your history. Of course kids can like it, but they like throwing rocks at ducks too. What is disturbing to me is how anyone can be nostalgic for a colonial past. Sambo is very lovable, but that is the point. It paid to maintain that the 'primitive' races were childlike, endearingly innocent. This idea of a paternalistic love actually supported Western dominance. They were the 'white man's burden,' permanently in childlike relation to the West, incapable of self rule or living in a modern world. In exchange for being guided to civilization, their natural resources could be had for the superior races. The childlike, innocent native is cut from the same cloth as the threatening cannibal, or the easily scared servant, or the lazy slave. All of these stories came out of that system of beliefs. This is not an Indian folk tale, however clever and tricky Sambo is. This is not, as one reviewer writes, \\"A loving attempt to reach across the racial divide.\\" The historical record contradicts this reading. Read just a line or two from the official reports written by colonial administrators like Helen Bannerman's husband. This kind of nostalgia erases the history of colonial rule. Maintaining divisions between a ruling class (British) and a subaltern class (colonial subjects) was the whole point of colonialism, of which this tale is a product.You and your children may find this character cute and cuddly, but stop and think about that. So are puppies. It is quite possible to love your mammy or your servant, just as you love your dog. (The mother in this tale is a direct relation of Aunt Jemima and her pancake mix, introduced at the Chicago World's Fair just two years previously) Exactly WHO is nostalgic for this past? I understand how remembering black slaves and coolies as 'happy darkies' is a lot less painful than actually remembering the truth. This was not a simpler time but one in which brutal subordination of a people was sanctioned by the state. If you miss that 'simpler time' I hope you don't live next door to me. My children would not be safe."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"It occurs to me that perhaps we're mixing up the message of the story with the way in which it was presented. Helen Bannerman was a product of her time -- and from her book, which describes a boy in India given the name \\"sambo,\\" a derogatory word used to refer to people of African descent, one can only conclude that she was unfortunately a rather muddle-headed racist with good intentions. That people recall this book fondly as a story that was such an important part of their childhood is natural -- the story in itself, is enormously engaging, and that's what they remember - the triumph of the boy over the tigers. That many grandparents and older adults like this book is also not surprising; but if these same people continue to deny the fact that words such as \\"Sambo,\\" \\"Mumbo,\\" and \\"Jumbo,\\" are at best ordinary words, or at worst \\"politically incorrect,\\" they are propogating a view of the world that we would be wise to distance ourselves from. Let's call things as we see them folks: this is a racist book for the unintelligent, degrading words given to humans. Please, do read this book to children, and please, explain the significance of \\"Sambo.\\" We can't afford to run away from history -- Helen Bannerman's book makes this impossible, and that...in the end, is a good thing."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Like most reviewers, I grew up with this book and loved it as a child. However, even then I had one question: why call him \\"Little BLACK Sambo\\"? Why not just \\"Little Sambo\\"?Many reviewers here have defended this book against the charges of racism. One guy even goes so far as to say if you think it's racist you hate other cultures. I don't have a clue as to what that is supposed to mean, but this book is racist. Just is. However, instead of saying \\"is\\" or \\"is not\\", I'm actually going to explain my opinion.This book was written by a Scottish woman living in India in 1899. The original illustrations, presumably replicated in this edition, feature Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo as having inky black skin and big red lips. Subsequent American volumes had drawing of the characters in blackface. As a result of these exaggerated illustrations, the word \\"Sambo\\" became a racial slur in America directed at African-Americans.Now, as another reviewer noted, this is set in India, not Africa. I'm not sure how that is meant to excuse the book, but I'm guessing that since the word Sambo was directed as a slur against African-Americans, we can safely chock that up to a misreading of the book by Americans. Not so. A glimpse at the history of race, and specifically \\"blackness\\" will show that Indians, Africans, and even the Irish were considered \\"black\\". \\"Black\\" in this sense meaning both a physical characteristic as well as a way of saying \\"other than Anglo\\". It was a claim also that was disparaging to their \\"perceived\\" level of sophistication as human beings. As such, words such as the \\"n-word\\" (I won't spell it out since this is a page for a kid's book) were levelled at Africans and Indians (and Irishmen) equally. It stands to reason, then, that \\"Sambo\\" was a derrogatory term lobbed at all who were looked upon as savage, different, or unequal to \\"white\\" folks.This cannot be ignored, nor excused. Ms. Bannerman's Sambo stories have historically done a lot of damage, and even added a racial slur to American speech. This is not just, as one person says, over-sensitive adults overreacting. If you are an African-American and have been called a \\"sambo\\" it's hardly overreacting to take offense. This book, historically, has had a place in the canon of racist western literature, and no amount of charm the story has can change this unfortunate fact."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"Until I read the history of this book, I thought Little Black Sambo was a harmless story about a little black boy who is clever enough to trick the tigers. Closer examination of the book reveals the use of hurtful stereotypes such as the pejorative name of Sambo. The Oxford English Dictionary definition reads: 1. Sambo is a nickname for a Negro. Now used only as a term of abuse. Also attributed especially with reference to the appearance or subservient mentality held to be typical of the black American slave. The qualities of a Sambo include being shiftless, dolt, lazy, docile, and happy to be a slave. Additional stereotypes can be found in the illustrations. Sambo's skin is abnormally black, like a minstrel player's black face, and he has exaggerated unnatural red lips. Other reviewers stated if you over look these two flaws, this is a good book. There is no excuses for reading this racist book to children when so many equally entertaining books that do not insult other people exist. Unless you are teaching a lesson on stereotypes, this reviewer suggests that you purchase something other than Little Black Sambo. That includes the equally flawed remakes of Little Baji and Sam and the Tigers."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"The pervasiveness of racism in American culture still has the power to amaze me. Reading through the other reviews of this book I was suprised by the overwhelming number of reviews which seek to justify and provide excuses as to why others should read this book. Whether or not the book was originally based in India, \\"Little\\" \\"Black\\" \\"Sambo\\" was co-opted by Jim Crow America as one of the many faces of racism, depicting African-Americans as passive, barbaric, lazy, big eyed, thick lipped, ignorant, smiling jesters. For the many who write that they loved the book as a child, perhaps you were unaware of the pervasive racial messages in the book. Perhaps you didnt care. Who knows. The bottom line is that if you want to raise your children in the belief that \\"all men (including African Americans) are created equal,\\" then you wont allow your children to read this book as a bedtime story. It is a lesson in racist history, as recent as yesterday, that African Americans like myself are forced to contend with. Let Jim Crow die with you. Dont raise your kids with the idea that its acceptable to view African Americans as \\"little\\" \\"black\\" barbaric, ignorant ape-like animals that step and fetch it through the jungle, meekly giving away their clothes because the master told them to."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"This is racist trash and I find myself alternately appalled and amused by the bizarrely arrogant defense of such insulting tripe, brimming with racial slander. These sentiments are quite revealing."},{"Title":"Little Black Sambo","review":"HarperCollins would never publish this little gem if it was titled The Story of Little Jew Josh regardless of how cute and innocent the characters,illustrations, story were.

As a Sociology instructor I would highly recommend utilizing this text for courses dealing with issues of race in the criminal justice system."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I just finished my journey Through Painted Deserts with Don (hope he won't mind the familiarity but I do feel like we are friends) and thoroughly enjoyed the trip! At times it seemed he felt obligated to make small talk with me but that was OK as it was a long road trip and I was just glad to be there. The relaxed conversations really lent well to the atmosphere and the safety of not having to hurry or be anywhere soon. He has helped me to slow down and look at things in a different way. Other times he wowed me with some very profound observations that made me happy to be in this world, this life, this time, all while knowing we are all related and have a glorious Father working all things together for our good.I found myself smiling, and thanking God out-loud, at many points along the pages and spent a few tears at the beauty of it all as he comes to terms with the \\"Why?\\" of life at the end of the journey. I also managed to tuck away some souvenirs: some of my new favorite quotes, all from my new friend Donald Miller. This is a road trip that I will fondly remember and am now looking forward to Searching For God Knows What with him next.Malinda Neisess"},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"At first I was leery that Donald Miller was re-releasing his first book now that he has gained some popularity. Having read \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" and \\"Searching For God Knows What\\" I didn't think he was the type to cash in on success. And, as I found out in the last page of this book, he spent several months retracing his original road trip to help transform his first book into \\"Through Painted Deserts.\\" This shows me that his heart was in it - and I appreciate that.Donald Miller accomplishes what he set out to do -- to offer us \\"a break from the deep theological stuff\\" and take us on a journey. This is a story about a trip. It's quite beautiful, and I've never seen any other author paint with words in the way that Donald Miller does."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Two single twentysomething guys hit the road in their dilapidated Volkswagen van in search of adventure and the meaning of life. While this could be the premise for the latest teen gross-out flick to hit your local megaplex, it is, instead, a thoughtful postcard from America's West, signed by Donald Miller.Miller landed firmly on the Christian publishing radar with his popular book BLUE LIKE JAZZ: Nonreligious Thoughts about Christian Spirituality. This edgy memoir about faith and subsequent releases offering a similar orthodox-yet-not take on questions about the Christian life solidified his position as what Marcia Ford called \\"Captain Trendy Spiritual Writer\\" in her review of BLUE LIKE JAZZ for Faithful Reader.But BLUE wasn't Miller's first foray into book publishing. An earlier book, PRAYER AND ART OF VOLKSWAGEN MAINTENANCE, went relatively unnoticed; it's been revamped and republished as THROUGH PAINTED DESERTS to capitalized on Captain Trendy's popularity. That might not sound like a formula for compelling reading, but this is a case when marketing strategy benefits the general public. This is a book that deserves a second look.In the interest of full disclosure, my idea of a perfect vacation is a road trip. If I can roll down the windows and turn up the music, I'm as happy as a clam (assuming of course, clams are happy creatures). Like the author, I hail from Texas and I recognized much of the terrain and even some of the people he describes in early chapters as the duo heads from Houston towards Oregon by way of the Grand Canyon. While I prefer traveling in vehicles that don't frequently require surgery on the side of road, I'm a sucker for the \\"two guys finding themselves and God on the open road\\" set-up.Having said that, Miller delivers on the potential the premise holds. He manages to take beautiful snapshots of the landscape he's traveling through and the people he meets along the way without succumbing to sentimentalism. And while this journey is largely about knowing God better, THROUGH PAINTED DESERTS doesn't knock you over the head with a new bit of spiritual insight every few pages. Instead, overt spiritual musings are replaced with seemingly mundane details and observations that end up serving much the same function.The humor in THROUGH PAINTED DESERTS is as dry as the high desert air Miller and Paul breathe on their way north. Their ongoing banter covers everything from how to survive a snake bite to what each is looking for in a girlfriend to musings about God; much of it is just begging for a Mark Mothersbaugh score to fade in. I laughed a lot.By the time the duo makes it to Oregon, their friendship has matured and both guys have learned a lot about themselves and, perhaps, God. Basking in the beauty of the Northwest Miller writes, \\"It is a wonder that those exposed to such beauty forfeit the great questions in the face of such miraculous evidence. I think again about this small period of grace, and thank God for it, that if only for a season, I could feel the why of life, see it in the metaphor of light, in the endlessness of the cosmos, in the miracle of friendship. And if these mountains had the ability to reason, perhaps they would contemplate the beauty of humanity, and praise God for the miracle that each of us is, pondering the majesty of God and the wonder of man in one bewildering context.\\"It's enough to make me consider taking a VW van on my next road trip.(Okay, probably not. But read the book anyway.)--- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel"},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Miller doesn't ever disappoint those that love his writing.

Maybe I will revisit it. I think it was just a little slow-going for me. I don't know, have a read and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I&#8217;ve been a mild Donald Miller fan over these past few years, first reading Blue Like Jazz during a trip in Bali. I remember sitting on the balcony of our hotel overlooking a green garden with this book about God and Portland. I liked Miller&#8217;s view of Portland far more than his view of God, a post-modern grandfatherly-type begging for his children to relax a bit. Aside from either of these, I loved Miller&#8217;s poetic prose. He writes with profound description and quiet beauty, a style that makes me pause to consider not his ideas as much as the sentence structure and content.After Blue Like Jazz, I read his next book, Searching for God Knows What, and I thought that most interesting part of the book was its clever title. Miller&#8217;s PoMo poster child status went into overdrive, and I lost interest. In 2009, I picked up A Million Miles in a Thousand Years. In that book, Miller chronicles his post-Blue Like Jazz doldrums while planning a movie version of the book. The producers realize that the autobiography doesn&#8217;t have enough story in it, and work to add more story in his life story. This causes an existential crisis in Miller, and he begins ways to live life more fully, more story-worthy. From the three books, this was by far my favorite. A search for authentic life, comparing our lives to the elements of a story, as well as Miller&#8217;s excellent writing style make an excellent book, one that I plan to reread. I was a fan again. (Side note: I watched Blue Like Jazz, the movie version, and it was one of the worst movie I&#8217;ve seen in a long time.)His earlier book, Through Painted Deserts, appeared as an audiobook on NoiseTrade, so I downloaded it and listened to it last week. It tells his road trip with his friend Paul from Houston to Oregon. I enjoyed reading his first impressions of Portland, a city that he and I both love, as well as his experiences with people and situations along the way. His writing style has developed in later books, but his writing voice is still clear, bright, and insightful. There are moments where the self-reflection feels too overwrought, and I never fully understood the difference between the overarching questions of The How&#8217;s and the Why&#8217;s. but that is no matter. I enjoyed spending a bit of time on this trip, and Miller was an engaging host.I&#8217;m sure my future reading lists will include new books by Donald Miller. He&#8217;s an intriguing writer with much to say and many stories to tell."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Enjoyed this book, it was not too difficult to read, it is an excellent copy. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I love Miller's writing style; effortless and cool but moving on a very real level.

It is honest and funny. It makes me want to take a trip aso I can see who I really am.

Much less cerebral than Blue Like Jaz, this is the story of Miller's trip to the Grand Canyon with good friend Paul. During the journey, God shows his mysterious care for them several times - through wonderful and unexpected turns of events and direct answers to prayers. The book is practical theology - Miller is not interested in theology of abstracts here, it is theology lived."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"This is not a fast-paced book. This is not a book on how to live life. This is not a book of theological principles...It is an artful book, slow in its pacing, but powerful in its subtle message. Don doesn't speak from authority, he just speaks from his experiences as a twenty-something travelling away from home for the first time. His narrative, while simple, is compelling, and urges the reader on until the final pages when you are left with the feeling that you have experienced something altogether wholesome, and your thoughts on the matter are somewhat like Don's. You realize what life is about just a little bit better and are sorry to read the last few pages... wanting the story to go on. It's then that you realize that the story isn't about Don, it's about God... and it's up to you to decide what chapter he will write in your story next."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"While I haven't read this particular edition, I just recently finished the previous edition, Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance. It took me a while to get through it, but I enjoyed reading it. It's a bit of a mix between storytelling and philosophising. The philosophising isn't particularly deep, and the storytelling isn't particularly riveting, which is why it took me a while to finish it, but I did find it entertaining, and was able to relate to many of the sentiments expressed."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"This books pales in comparison to his \\"Blue Like Jazz\\". While a cross country road trip is a great premise for a book- this one just falls flat. The conversations seem wooden and not terribly realistic for two 'dudes' traveling together. The 3rd character, their ancient VW van which breaks down at frequent intervals, should have been given a name to add some texture and imagination at least.I think the fact that they had to travel mostly on interstates and had very little time to actually linger in the towns and backwaters they encountered meant that at best you have a few meaningful encounters but largely time is spent just trying to cover mileage fast and cheap.Average read and I've already put it in the 'goodwill' box."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I recommend this seller to all!

It's so centered on a young man's quest/non-quest/quest to find out whether there's anything to quest for that it didn't speak to this 40ish woman the way his other books have. However, I still got something out of it and recommend it highly. I think it would speak loudest to kids in their late teens. Good stuff."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"This book is by the popular author Donald Miller. I read his book \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" and enjoyed it. I was going to stop with that book, but a fellow blogger noted that this was his favorite of the Miller books. I am not sure I share the same sentiments, but I certainly did enjoy the book. As Donald travels and reflects on his life with God, I seem to join him in reflecting on my own life. I guess there is a part of all of us that desires to travel with the Lord. This is why it seems that people enjoy taking mission trips to various parts of the world and nation. There is an excitement that follows as one journeys with the Lord. I guess I can relate because I traveled a lot with the Lord. Also, I would have enjoyed this book more if I read it in college while I was single. The open road is not the same with two small children crying in the back seat. Nevertheless, the book was good, not so much for the spiritual insight, but for the adventure, the friendships, and the trip. As you travel with Donald, you cannot help but travel through your own life too."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"This is a good book. The humor between Donald and Paul reminds me of Bill Bryson's in A Walk in the Woods. No super deep spiritual findings here but some familiar questions for anyone who's been a Christian for any length of time. It's good to read honesty written without reservations. I'm currently reading Blue Like Jazz and TPD reads more like a narrative than BLJ. My guess is if you like the thought process of BLJ you will like this book. Great book about a road trip to read on a road trip.

I suspect this work may have been rejected by the publishers prior to Miller gaining his well-deserved reputation as a writer, and resubmitted later.MIller's musings here belong to the \\"road/journey\\" genre. In places his words wax poetically and profoundly. At other times he comes across as an immature, self-absorbed, and irresponsible smart-aleck (enjoying God in the \\"here and now\\" by breaking various laws). A young man (and writer) growing up...Miller sums up \\"Through Painted Deserts\\" this way: \\"life is not a story about me, but it is being told to me, and I can be glad of that. I think that is the why of life and, in fact, the why of this ancient faith I am caught up in: to enjoy God... It's all metaphor, and the story is about us; it's about all of us who God made, and God Himself... We are supposed to stand in deserts and marvel at how the sun rises.. We are supposed to sleep in meadows and watch stars dart across space and time.\\" Or a few pages later: \\"You feel like life is always leading up to something, but it isn't. I mean life is just life. It's all happening right now, and we aren't going to be any more complete a month from now than we are now. I only say this because I am trying to appreciate everything tonight...\\"All in all an entertaining read, but I probably won't jump again for his next book."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I'm a fan of Donald Miller, so it's bound to get a good review from me, but this truly was a very good book- not as overtly spiritual in some ways as his other books, but some parts of it had me laughing so hard that I had to momentarily put the book down- those sections were very difficult to read outloud, needless to say.I would reccomend this book to anyone that is a follower of Christ and enjoys a good laugh with a spiritual message."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"An excellent, quick read. To be perfectly honest, I wasn't necessarily expecting apologetics from Don in this one -- based on my other reads at the moment (Jim Wallis, Francis Schaeffer), Don's musings provided a simple, relaxing commentary on the very events that shaped his, dare I say, revelatory style of candid writing. Instead of clamoring at the front doorstep of Borders, like a Harry Potter fanatic, for Don's next novel, I plan on leisurely strolling in, picking up a copy on sale, and relaxing in my living room with a glass of wine in hand. I reckon that's just how he would want me to delve into his next story of hope, heartache, faith, love, and honesty."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I read Through Painted Deserts while traveling to Australia for a study abroad trip. Miller retold the places he had visited with his friend in the West of America, a few of those places I have been. It made me reflect on those expereinces and realize how blessed I am.More importantly, it made me realize that I needed to take the next 4 months I had in a different culture to the outmost extreme. I couldn't judge people (as Miller explains in examples). The key note, however, was that we need to stop for a second and realize the beauty of the simple things in life. When we do that we see a side of God. And that was wonderful advice for me entering a new country, but something I can take home too.The book helped me and entertained me. It will do the same to you!"},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I know, I know...in the Intro Miller is clear that this book is about a road trip, and just a road trip. And I was just stuck on the magic of Blue Like Jazz. So, I loved his storytelling. In fact, he shares a tale of Driving Range-Tag in the middle of the night that had me in stitches. In the end, I was just longing for more.I am not saying that is the authors fault - probably more mine, because I started reading it with unrealistic expectations.It is good, just different."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I have read Blue Like Jazz and found it to be an enjoyable and enriching experience. However, this reprinting of Miller's first attempt at narrative leaves a lot to be desired. The Author's Note which is included in the Amazon listing was intriguing and made me eager to read the book. Unfortunately, what follows is a somewhat forced and heavy handed attempt to make his 'journey' into something accessible and inspiring for the reader. The dialogue is quick and the prose is rich at times, but several of the 'meaningful conversations' between Don and Paul seem forced and somewhat fabricated. A conversation that starts with \\"What would make you most happy?\\" does not seem to scream reliable dialogue. There are also glaring inaccuracies throughout the text from the Grand Canyon (\\"It seems like everything around here is something Indian.\\" Bright Angel Creek was named by John Wesley Powell, not Indians) to the \\"Texas\\" that he portrays throughout (\\"In Texas we eat barbeque and it's good. Restaurants like Luther's...\\" Luther's is fast food, mediocre BarBQ at best, also a Texan should have known that Tabasco was hot: \\"Paul is right. This stuff is hot. This isn't picante sauce. This is flaming hot.\\", Lyle Lovett/Robert Earl Keen sang from their porch to the Presbyterians, not Lutherans) He seems to be wanting to convey expertese and local knowledge but comes up somewhat short. Also, for someone writing in the late 90's and publishing in 2000, the 'phenomenon' of the Starbucks (or other local) coffee shop should not elicit the following response: \\"Coffee is something you order at breakfast, at a greasy spoon. The idea of dedicating a specific shop to coffee is going to take some getting used to. I struggle through an order...I just stand there like a deer in the headlights...I hand her a dollar...\\" These types of experiences are not foreign, and should be familiar to any Houstonian.Most of disappointing of all, the story ends abruptly when after several months of his 'pilgrimage' to find himself, and God, he decides to take a job he had waiting for him all along in Colorado. This would not be as off-putting if he hadn't been praising his bohemian lifestyle, living in the woods, eating leftover food, and experiencing God in nature. It seems like as soon as he reaches the destination of his 'journey' and can chalk it up to experience, he goes right back to the comfortable lifestyle he is accustomed to. The high aspirations for a trip of this nature are quickly dashed and leaves the reader quite disappointed. I am writing this review directly after having finished the book and been left wanting much more.While he may have needed this trip to produce a great read like Blue Like Jazz, I don't think we needed to experience it with him. His description of some of the people and events told herein are more honed and polished in BLJ than they are in this text. Unfortunately, this reprinting of his first book seems to me an attempt to trade on his current success my slapping a new and insightful \\"Author's Note\\" on a text that is somewhat trite.Read Blue Like Jazz! Take a pass on this one, unless you feel you really need to know this author. While there are some great scenes and images throughout the story, and even some solid attempts to convey truth, it mainly accomplishes telling a road trip story, which can be enjoyable at times, but found wanting at others."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I'm normally quite a fan of Donald Miller, but I found Through Painted Deserts, as another reader put it, too self-conscious. While he has some occasional pithy comments (I've been haunted by the \\"how\\" vs. \\"why\\" question since I finished the book), he sacrifices the actual narrative for his own ramblings. As a caveat, though, I've read the original Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance (which this book was an editing of), and found it to be much more spiritually honest and narratively raw. There's more Jesus in it, I thought, which is unfortunately the point that Through Painted Deserts kind of misses."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Through Painted Deserts AKA Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance(First Published in Imprint 2006-07-14 as 'Hate It' in the 'Love It Hate it book Review section.)Some books that failed the first time should stay OOP (Out Of Print), and this is definitely one of them. It should have stayed way on the shelves collecting dust.Back in 2003 Donald Miller published a book called Blue Like Jazz and that book went gangbusters - constantly selling out at bookstores and going through a few printings. It appeared, at the time, that every time you turned around someone was recommending the book. It was a collection of penses, thoughts, and meandering recollections of a man who grew up to doubt religion but could not give up on faith. It was marketed as \`Nonreligious thoughts on Christian Spirituality'. It was so popular it was even turned into a one-man stage show in Toronto, [...] and has toured the country.Then some genius at the publishing company decided to resurrect his first book that had failed. That person is responsible for the unwarranted destruction of thousands and thousands of trees.This book is a classic road trip journey, in the vein of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig. Yet unlike that classic book, this one does not live up to all the hype. This book is a shameless money grab by the publisher and the author. This greediness is seen time and time again once an author has a successful endeavor. Everything they have written, or will write, is considered gold. That was not the case with this book. Not only is the publishing of this book shameless marketing and abuse of success, it also has a shameful plug for a band that the author listened to while \`rewriting' the book. Miller states: \`Robbie's CD Better Days is to me the soundtrack for the revised edition of this book. I am pleased to introduce it to you.'Miller's prose is weak, and his reflections are pedantic. He states: \\"We are one day out, and home seems an ocean away. My watch ticks inside my boot. I don't need it. I'm not late for anything. There is no disgruntled friend waiting for me at a coffee shop or office.' Are we are all suppose to be enthralled with the story of two guys traveling from Texas to Oregon? It was a chore to get through the book and I would not even recommend it for fans of Miller's writings. Another example is \\"But because we were born as babies and had to be taught to speak and to pee in a toilet, we think all of this is normal. Well, it isn't normal. Nothing is normal. It is all rather odd, isn't it, our eyes in our heads, our hands with five fingers, the capacity to understand beauty, to feel love, to feel pain.\\" Ok so what do we do with Miller's thoughts?

This isn't simply a read-through book of sights and sounds but rather about deeper thoughts about the why's of life, how we got where we're at and why we're headed wherever we're going. I particularly found his excruciating journey through the hole of the Grand Canyon applicable to my own life through the various \\"holes\\" that I've traveled, and if we're all honest, the various \\"holes\\" we all have or probably will have traveled at least at some point in our lives. This is a must-read for anyone searching the \\"why's\\" in life."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"If you are a fan of Blue Like Jazz and the writing style of Don Miller, then you should read this book. It's funny, after reading only 3 of Don Miller's books, I feel like I know him (and his great friends)...I would think that would be a great compliment for any writer. Miller is \\"real\\", and I think he \\"really\\" wants his faith journey to help others find God. It's a great book."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I thought this book was enlightening in the simplest way if that makes since. I think that everyone at some point in time should sit down and read this book and really take the time to ponder on what they feel is the moral of the story. It made me laugh out loud at times and at others made me question the road that I am on. Brilliantly written."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I recently saw Through Painted Deserts by Donald Miller as I strolled through a Christian bookstore, intent on adding a few more books to my growing collection. Having read two of his other books (and most excellent, I might add) on theology and life, I figured I ought to read this one as well. I was mesmerized from beginning to end by Miller's (I affectionately refer to him as Don) classic Bohemian writing style, which was especially fitting for this, a story about the journey of life.Through Painted Deserts is the story of Don and his friend Paul's journey (as college-age guys) from Houston, Texas to the forests of the Pacific Northwest. They're going for a number of reasons-Paul because Oregon is where he lived all his life before coming to Houston, and because he loves to travel. Don because, well, because he feels that he's ready for a change in his life. It's also a sort of journal of Don's growth in his understanding of God over the course of the trip.Don and Paul learn to enjoy life for what life is-driving across the country in an old Volkswagen van, eating beans and rice, and trying to live on 5 dollars per day. At times serious, at times hilarious, the book is both deep and filled with humor... and it's about something that I think every guy (even if he doesn't know it) deep down inside wants to do-to have the open road ahead of you, no schedule, no job you have to get back to next week, simply an open, free road. To cure your God-given wander-lust.You can see early on that Don doesn't have a master's degree in seminary, doesn't work for Focus on the Family, and has no real \\"qualifications\\" to be writing theology. He's just a regular guy, writing for regular people. He admits his faults candidly, and at first you have to remind yourself that he's not promoting his faults. He's simply admitting them; he's the most un-self-righteous Christian writer I've ever read.I think Donald Miller's my favorite living non-fiction writer right now; his books all have real people in them, and they all talk about real life, and truly living that life. I live in the bible-belt, and his non-legalistic attitude toward things is like a breath of fresh air with a cool glass of lemonade on a hot day. Expand your horizons. Go Through Painted Deserts, and experience freedom.Warning: could result in an unquenchable desire to travel America in a Volkswagen van."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Through Painted Deserts is am amazingly real tale of one man's journey to find something more. The same way Kerouac's writings portray one individual's search for meaning, and in a similar fashion to Holden Caufield's embark to better understand life, \\"Don\\" and his friends grace us with the chance to join in their similar experience.As someone who loves to travel and would, too, just get up and leave in serach of something new and beautiful, I truly enjoyed this witty read.This book followed me everywhere. I read in the park, at the book store, at the coffee shop, at work, and even in the bathroom. The book was THAT GOOD. I could not wait to find out where Don's desires would take him next.This book is not a \\"typical\\" Christian novel. The strange this is that I did not feel like I was reading a book from the Christian section at B'n'N. At times, I felt moved more by the beauty and honesty of Don's writings. Other times, I just enjoyed the journey. Isn't there a car company that tells us to \\"Enjoy the ride\\"? That is just what Miller does, and I, too, hope to continue to follow in his footsteps. Any type of person will enjoy this book, so the reader does not need to expect to be \\"preached to.\\"While I could sell this book on Ebay or Amazon, I would rather file it in my library along with Kerouac and Thoreau. Miller's writing has transcended the \\"typical\\" Christian novel and has moved him next to the naturalists and the dreamers such as the aforementioned gentlemen.Maybe I will reread this book. I might, as I said, place it in my library, or I might offer it to a fellow Christian. Regardless, this book will change, or accompany, the way each of us lives-wait, enjoys-life.Posted Later That Night-Earlier, I posted a quick review, but, after picking up this book once again, I feel the need to add more.While I did feel a little let down upon completing this journal, this feeling is due to the fact that I enjoyed Miller's work so much. His writing is so clear and honest, and he draws from everyday events to which everyone can relate. From Miller's attraction to a younger girl, to his uneasiness when his friend falls for his old flame who now only offers Don a \\"friendly\\" hug rather than a \\"can't wait to see you\\" hug, I found myself relating to Don's emotions.As I said, this novel left me wanting a bit more, but this urge is only due to the quality of Miller's writing. Pick up this book, and you will enjoy a quick, lively read.-JM"},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"This book was definitely my favorite Miller book. After finishing Searching For God Knows What I was literally itching my index finger, looking for another volume of his work.Miller's brain seems to spill out on the page, and it looks and reads the same way many of us think, staying that way when it is in print form. He seems to be very well read, and has artsy descriptions from time to time, but the bulk of this book is meant to and can be read by an auto mechanic and a fast food worker Joe. No offense to auto mechanics and fast food workers, they solve 60 percent of my problems.It's a friendship book, it's a travel book, it's a live-life-to-its-fullest book. And it's tough to finish this book without pondering something way beyond newsprint ads and movie quotes.Donald Miller holds true to his trademark in the revised edition of an earlier work in which he mentions the mood music used in creating and reediting the pages. You know, just by glancing at the aggregation of songwriters and performers, that he must make some wonderful mix discs for his inner circle. Looking foward to the dragon book."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"i am honored to be the first to review this book. luckily for you all, i enjoyed...\\"enjoyed\\" doesn't seem fulfilling enough...the book is truly amazing. if you are familiar with don's previous titles, great - go buy this one. if you have not read other books by don miller, this book would be an excellent starting point. it reads like a novel as it is the memoirs of a trip by two men from texas to oregon. it is gripping, funny, thought-provoking, and captivating. miller's extraordinary writing skills provide the reader with so much description you are able to see, smell, hear, taste and feel all that is encountered. a genuinely solid read."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Like other Donald Miller books, this is just the same. Miller takes the same prose and describes his unsatisfied life journey from yet another experience. Miller is searching, unsettled and cannot find a place of contentment in life. Every form of tradition or structure is defiant against his utopia of \\"don't fence me in\\". His book can make you laugh at times and reflect on experiences that may compare closely to your own. Miller however, leaves you hanging and searching. He has no real answer. He speaks of God, but touches on multiple god's. He does not speak of a savior or God's plan. He lives a life as a Hebrew in the wilderness. Very disappointed in Miller and his all too common problem that unfortuanately many people today experience. Searching for what's right in front of them and trying to smorgasbord their faith with multiple religions and a \\"God loves me no matter what rules and conscious decision I make for myself.\\"Advice for Mr. Miller: You may make friends along your transient gypsy road, but they in turn think of you as just that."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road by Donald Miller is not the book I was expecting. Miller puts a caveat at the end of the book explaining that he wanted to get away from heavy theological content for this book; I wish he had put it at the beginning so I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Reading the book in comparison with his previous two entries: Blue Like Jazz and Searching for God Knows What will let down the reader. Reading it knowing that it is a book about a road trip and a journey to something more makes it a much better book and thoroughly enjoyable. It takes Miller awhile to get started and at times he waxes a little too poetic, but the rapport between him and his traveling partner Paul is honest and refreshing. Miller's honesty is a bit disconcerting during the course of the book. He shares his thoughts and actions openly, even when they portray him as less than likable. This is really the story of two men relying upon God to take them from Houston, Texas to Black Butte Mountain, Oregon with side trips to the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas in a beat up VW van, and trust me, relying upon God in that van is necessary. The book closes with one of Miller's usual beautifully written piece about the majesty of God and the smallness of man as the two men watch a sunrise over the mountains of Oregon. Most journeys are more about the trip than the destination. In this book, I would say that the book is all about the destination: it's about the peace and faith the two find after their journey."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I'd like to preface my comments by saying that I have read all of Don Miller's other work, and on the whole find his writing very accessible, interesting, and inclusive to non-Christians.You can see how he grows in his thinking in each new book, and the fact that this is an early book, re-released, shows in some of his attitudes. This book was written before his experiences in Oregon and in Imago Dei, his current open-minded and loving church, and it shows in his attitudes towards non-Christians. He seems to dismiss darwinism as the psychotic ramblings of those who believe that aliens \\"seeded\\" the earth. He spends a silly amount of time dismissing darwinism and non-Christians by setting up straw men and then attacking them. I really felt insulted at the way he misrepresented the viewpoints of non-Christians and then spent so much time saying what is wrong with those misrepresented viewpoints. I had come to expect understanding and a loving fellowship from Miller, and felt somewhat attacked and insulted in some parts of this book.That all said, I really enjoyed the loose, flowing style of this book. I love his self-deprecating humor and his honesty, and so many parts of this book really made me think about life and the ways in which sometimes we muddle through it with no sense of the larger picture.So, I appreciated this book a lot, and truly enjoyed it in many ways. I dearly hope that if Miller does another re-release at some point, that he will re-write some of the parts that I mentioned above. He does such a wonderful job of stating his points in a loving and inclusive way in his other books that the clunky writing about non-Christians came as an unpleasant shock to me in this one.If you are new to Miller's work, I'd read Blue Like Jazz first."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I have read each of Donald Miller's first three books (Deserts, Blue Like Jazz and Searching for God Knows What).Deserts was actually the first he wrote (originally published as Prayer and the Art of Volkswagon Maintenance) and I think it shows though, interestingly, not in a bad way. Two main reasons I liked this book: (1) the journal style entries lend themselves to his stream-of-consciousness style of writing and (2) Miller really illustrates the beauty of thinking about where a person has been and how that affects him in the present.In each of the books I've read, Miller writes narrative in a stream-of-consciousness way that allows him to weave his current thoughts and priniciples into his recollections of past events. This book is largely a journal of an extended road trip and it reads as though Miller has done something I think many would do well to emulate: he has read back over his journal, thought about how those experiences affected him and then added these new thoughts to the margins. Simply put, Miller winds together two streams of thought -- old (from the journal) and new (from re-reading and considering the journal) -- into a good story with insightful thoughts and questions.Deserts is a book that is honest and open and not at all a complete theological statement or a travel book; Miller's not trying for either of those. Without the journal stories, his principles are just words, not connected enough to be one coherent thought. Without the principles, the journal is just another road trip story that is funny but not significant to anyone not on the trip. By combining the two, he succeeds at illustrating the beautiful combination of recollection and self-evaluation. We learn a lot about the author, his thoughts on God, and some of the places he went.I'm comfortable giving this book a four. It is not his best work (I'd give that title to Blue Like Jazz) but it is humble and entertaining and I finished it with a new appreciation for the author and his willingness to self-reflect."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I wouldn't say the rambling narrative is a minus, since it is a book about rambling as two guys travel from Texas to Oregon. It is a good book if you want something that doesn't make any serious demands on you.I did find a few things annoying about it though, particularly the fact that the author comes across as a real smart alec. He also seems to enjoy lumping people together in categories, ridiculing them, then showing righteous indignation when they do the same. Maybe he should have spent a little more time on the road reflecting.Blue Like Jazz is definitely a better book, but he did write it later in life so that is probably why. If you read this one before BLJ, don't let your impression of the author keep you from reading his other books, because he really does get better."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Through Painted Deserts is Miller being his usual self. He's candid, probing and relational. This book is a journey to be shared, as Miller assimilates his own thoughts on life and God. While not as deep as his other books, it is worth reading. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a book that allows the reader to enjoy life the way it was meant to be lived."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I was quite disappointed in this book. I forced myself read to page 100 or so, and then I had to abandon this book. The author came across as arrogant as he kept telling the reader about all the supposedly \\"funny\\" things he did and said. For example, while at the Grand Canyon the park service agent asks for his registration, so he gives her his blockbuster card, then some other membership card--and he's telling this story because he apparently thinks that this is funny or clever, while it is just annoying. What I could get through all seemed rambling, boring, and pointless."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I loved Blue Like Jazz, and liked Searching for God Knows What a lot, but this left me very cold. The sort of feigned modern-day Kerouac thing just comes off as pretentious &, worse, dull. Neither Miller nor his travelling companion are very compelling characters. Their adventures are not all that interesting. The insights sprinkled through the narrative are few & far between, and really not all that insightful. It was if he wanted to merge a Bill Bryson travellogue with Blue Like Jazz - but forgot the humor found in both. Instead, we get a couple of really fairly dull guys limping along the American West in a beat up VW van. Miller is witty enough that I can't quite give him only one star, though probably should. Call it 1.5 stars. Not good."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"This is the third and latest book of Donald Miller's that I have read...something about his style of writing draws me in and refreshes me like he is voicing all my random thoughts in life that I have never how to expressed.

He has a simple and poetic way of writing that keeps the reader turning page after page only pausing to ponder a specific passage. I did hesitate a while before buying Through Painted Deserts, though. It looked like it wasn't going to be quite like his other works, and I was a bit turned off when I heard bad reviews of it. But lately I have had an unebbing desire for travel. Lately being the past few years, and I thought this might be a good way to stave off my hunger for the road. I started it while reading another novel and pretty soon I couldn't put it down. It was interesting to read all of what Don and Paul went through on the road. Their adventures and misadventures were at many times hilarious. Don's thoughts and ideas and how his journey shaped and changed them are at the heart of this book. He has a way of raising honest questions that make you think and not judge. It's an interesting look at an author and the events that shaped much of his later work. I reccomend it to anyone who has read Don's work, and to anyone who has dreams of travel. It will inspire and encourage and leave you with the urgency to go out and experience life."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Donald Miller's writings cause one to stop and think about how God deals with each individual personally. One should read this book before reading \\"Blue Like Jazz\\".

Nothing we've created even comes close. So we must have been created and we must have been created for a purpose by something infinitely more intelligent than we are.I read this book, \\"Through Painted Deserts\\" by Donald Miller and that's what I came up with. Miller and his friend Paul travel for three months, with very little money, from Texas to Oregon in an old VW camping van. He questions the meaning of life as they hike into the Grand Canyon and sleep under the stars. He asks the \\"why\\" questions of life instead of \\"how.\\" The \\"how\\" questions are like, \\"How do I get paid, how do I get a wife, how do I make myself happy?\\" The \\"why\\" questions are: \\"Why are we here, why do we feel what we feel, desire what we desire, need what we need, hate what we hate?\\"I like books like this that just make me think. Miller doesn't have the answers, he just tries to make you come up with your own.Written by David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Donald Miller is an excellent writer.

I'm convinced that his conversational and beautifully descriptive style could make any topic interesting; however, the story was interesting enough. It takes us along the author's journey across the U.S.A. with his friend Paul. They have some cool adventures, some detours, and some great conversations about love, GOD, and the mystery of this series of events we call life. I read it in a matter of days because the humor and smooth narrative style make it a quick and easy read. I appreciate Miller's insights on the metaphor that GOD intended nature to be. I think the road trip was taken when he was very young and you can tell in his conversations and philosophical narration (it can be a bit immature at times) but its still some great food for thought in there.In three words, the book is: Hilarious, Inspirational, and Thought Provoking. Well, four words technically."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"\\"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road\\" is a rewritten version of Millers first book \\"Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance\\". Frankly, I prefer the original. Although this new version provides material which was not included in the first version, much of which is interesting and welcom, it was at the expense of other material which was removed. It is almost as if the publisher told Miller that he was allowed only so many words and if he added something in one place he would have to remove something else in some other place. On the whole it is a huge mistake as the material which was removed often outshines the material which was added. A better choice would have been to include the new material without removing any of the original book. Personally, between the two I would recommend \\"Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance\\" instead."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Donal Millers book is very thought provoking and inspirational. A good reminder of what we should focus on our lives and in our faith. It serves as a call for each of us to get out and learn, explore, and discover while we have the chance."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Donald Miller's one of my favorite authors. He's the New York Times bestselling author of Blue Like Jazz. Until this day, I still can't decide which one of his books is my favorite (I've read Blue Like Jazz, Searching for God Knows What, and A Million Miles in a Thousand Years). So when I came across this book, getting it was a no-brainer for me. It's a republished and retitled version of his first book, Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance.It starts out a little slow for my taste, but then it's a road trip memoir, so the pace ends up making sense, at least for me. In this book, Miller writes about a monumental interstate road trip that he takes with his friend Paul-a trip that takes them over mountains, down the Grand Canyon, and under their beat-up Volkswagen van (the latter, many times over).I always wanted to go on an interstate road trip, and Miller does a great job of making the journey real to me. While it started out slow, I'm glad that I opted to keep reading as the story kept getting better and better. By the last couple of chapters, I was reading ever-so-slowly and taking down notes, as some lines went straight to my heart.I really, really liked it."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"i love donald miller. he writes in such an open, honest, and accessible way. reading his books is like having an honest conversation with a friend. i've enjoyed every one of his books that i've read."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"This is yet another great book by Donald Miller. If you like travel, descriptions and reflections of travel, you will love this. It is also a book that you can put down and pick up whenever without feeling lost. The adventure just continues."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I was a big fan of this book's original form, \\"Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance (PAVM),\\" when it came out in 2000. Either way, the premise remains the same: Donald Miller and his friend Paul leave Texas in a beat-up Volkswagen van to seek their destiny in Oregon. Along the way they experience cool places, meet interesting people, and wrestle with various life issues. I'm a Christian who loves to travel, so I liked the combination of a literal and spiritual journey. Five years later, Donald Miller has achieved a measure of fame by writing a couple of other Gen-X Christian bestsellers. Perhaps that gave him the clout to pull a Stephen King and rework a previously published book into \\"Through Painted Deserts.\\" I read somewhere that his purpose this time around was to tell the real story of how the trip went. But there are no momentous revelations - only added flowery exposition, a new anecdote or two, and some cruder male bonding episodes (I sold my copy of \\"PAVM\\" awhile back, so I couldn't do a thorough comparison between the two).The somewhat lofty new title (I liked the old one better) reflects a high-minded literary bent I don't remember from the first time around. There's a serious helping of purple prose about life, nature, and spirituality, especially in the first half or so. It got to be a bit much at times; the writer's admonition to \\"kill your darlings\\" came to mind. And some political comments, coupled with a favorable comparison of Northwest women vs. their Texan counterparts, indicate that he's become the Oregonian \\"granola\\" Paul accused him of being even before he got here. Between such banter (and a tiff or two), they get serious and discuss deeper Christian guy stuff about what they want in a wife, the meaning of a God-centered life, and so on. Within this context, Mr. Miller ruminates on Christianity's \\"why\\" answers to life vs. science's \\"how\\" answers. It wasn't quite a Schaeffer vs. Dawkins level of internal monologue, but it was good and relevant nonetheless.Although I enjoyed seeing how time has affected Mr. Miller, I'm not sure why this book had to be written. Indeed, I wish the original had been re-released instead. Perhaps I've changed as well over five years, but there was something about his virgin effort that made a bigger impression on me. I think those that missed the first release (which I believe is out of print) would have liked following his spiritual and literary progression from \\"PAVM\\" through \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" and \\"Searching for God Knows What.\\" But regardless of edition, the interpersonal interactions are real, and there's gold to be mined out of the expository passages. Plus, it was intriguing to get an outsider's description about my native region. I still trip out on the fact that he and Paul eventually wound up in my hometown and experienced more adventures there than I ever did.\\"Through Painted Deserts\\" is a looking glass into a pivotal formative experience of Donald Miller's life. If you enjoyed his other books, and would like some insights into Mr. Miller's spiritual formation, than by all means check this one out. But get \\"PAVM\\" if you can track it down, if only to see how he was when he first started out."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Retitled and re-released after Donald Miller's more recent and more successful books, this is a chronicle of a road trip taken by a young, searching person (the author) and his friend. They patch together a Volkswagon bus and hit the road, without a timeframe or a destination in mind. Their adventures are recounted here, and even though as far as adventures go they're pretty tame, the journey itself is the real point.The book's message is powerful and struck me on a personal level: Just leave. Most of us don't see how small our lives are, how much we cling to the known, and how much we miss when we limit our horizons to the safe, to what common wisdom tells us is secure. It awakens something in me, the opening preamble of a wistful thought that has not yet found completion. Perhaps it's related to my turning 30 earlier in the year, but here it is, my favorite part and the introductory paragraph that told me I had to take the book home and begin reading it that night.\\"Leave. ... Roll the word around on your tongue for a bit. It is a beautiful word, isn't it? So strong and forceful, the way you have always wanted to be. And you will not be alone. You have never been alone. Don't worry. Everything will still be here when you get back. It is you who will have changed.\\""},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"In this volume, Miller gently reminds the modernist that, in the final analysis, the big questions -- the 'why' questions -- determine whether the 'how' questions are important. Gently is the operative adverb.Although I am not of the generation to whom this books is most naturally directed (older teens through thirty-somethings), and although I am an admitted so-called modernist (which is neither strictly good nor bad, but simply describes most westerners of the past three centuries), I find Donald Miller's observations to be important, consistently valid, and persistently fun. Here's a clip from the second chapter, which should give you a sense for Miller's prose:\\"The trouble with you and me is that we are used to what is happening to us. We grew into our lives . . . never able to process the enigma of our composition. Think about this for a moment: if you weren't a baby and you came to earth as a human with a fully developed brain and had the full weight of the molecular experience occur to you at once, you would hardly have the capacity to respond in any cognitive way to your experience. But because we were born as babies and had to be taught to speak and to pee in a toilet, we think all of this is normal. Well, it isn't normal. Nothing is normal. It is all rather odd, isn't it, our eyes in our heads . . . the capacity to understand beauty, to feel love, to feel pain.\\"If I do lose faith, that is if I do let go of my metaphysical explanations for the human experience, it will not be at the hands of science. I went to a Stephen Hawking lecture not long ago and wondered about why he thought we get born and why we die and what it means, but I left with nothing, save a brief mention of aliens as a possible solution to the question of origin. And I don't mean anything against Stephen Hawking, because I know he has an amazing brain . . . but I went wondering about something scientific that might counter mysterious metaphysical explanations, and I left with aliens.\\"The book is a kind of travelogue of a journey both physical and metaphysical; the details need not be related here. There are fanatical, reactionary 'christian' critics who love to hate Donald Miller, which is quite sad. A friend lent my daughter a copy of Miller's 'Blue Like Jazz,' she read it, my wife read it, I read it, my other two daughters read it -- which is honestly amazing, we have different tastes in books, yet we all enjoyed it and all might list it among our most recommendable. I think you'll enjoy 'Through Painted Deserts' and 'Blue Like Jazz' (unless you're a belligerent, religious nut, or a numb-hearted materialist). Miller inspires introspection, and does so with a light heart and a ready wit.Paul: \\"You can't beat [Lynyrd] Skynyrd.\\"Don: \\"I could if I had a bat.\\""},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Sometimes you hear the cruel, yet funny comment about when a person comes to Christ, it's AFTER they've sung 28 verses of \\"Just As I Am\\". I know when I've heard it said like that, a laugh usually resounds through the crowd of people you happen to be with. That's either because it's the same old story, or because people have heard it one too many times. But every so often, the right person just might sing \\"Just As I Am\\", and you can't believe it is the same song, because it is sung so beautifully. That's how this played out for me. You hear stories of roadtrips, but they wear thin after a time, and unless the right person tells the story, you kind of think, \\"Who cares?\\" But along comes Donald Miller and he makes an ordinary road trip, from Texas to Oregon into a pretty neat read.And so, you spend a few days on the road, eating beans and rice. The Volkswagon breaks down every so often. You run into some interesting adventures. Don and Paul, two friends, traveling. One thing that strikes me is that they never do it alone, they are with each other the whole time. You come across crazy things, such as Don putting chewing gum over the dash where the check engine light is blazing. You feel the triumph of visiting the Grand Canyon, and the simple celebration of it with a bowl of Raisin Bran with ice cold milk. The simple joy of living life. The thought of just having \\"eggs over easy with a flour tortilla,\\" as the Lyle Lovett songs speaks of.Donald Miller speaks of truely living life, not just getting through it. It reminded me in some spots of a Gary Paulsen read. If you've ever read Paulsen, you can't compare too many writers to him. But this had it's moments, and that was worth something, at least 4 stars to me! So, take this pilgrimage for yourself, and get through the bumpy spots. You'll be glad you took the ride!"},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I've got to tell you, I really liked this book. Echoing Kerouac and Pirsig, Through Painted Deserts is the quintessential, archetypal, all-American road story. An easy and flowing read, Miller kept me turning pages as his adventure (shared with friend, Paul) moved from Texas to Oregon. Originally released as Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance, and published by Christian publisher Thomas Nelson, Through Painted Deserts is anything but a religious road trip book. Fundangelicals will not care much for the deeper questions and the deeper spiritualities that are expressed through these lines. And besides that, there is talk of beer drinking, cigarette smoking (and a subtle allusion to smoking something else as well), and some culturally unacceptable language (that would not be unknown to any good student of the old King James Version of the Bible). And there are a couple of hillarious passages which include the term \\"johnson\\" (one which also features an electric fence).This is the great American road story. It's about finding yourself in the simplicity of nature, about being on a pilgrimage, about seeing things poetically, about being happier without all the \\"comforts\\" we can afford. It's about finding God in whiskered old mechanics and in shared conversations and in a box of wine on a front porch and in the stars and in the breeze that moves around an old Volkswagen van in the middle of the night.Miller, the author of Blue Like Jazz and Searching for God Knows What, is a wordsmith worthy of our time and our open hearts.Dr. Mike Kear"},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I first read \\"Blue Like Jazz\\", before \\"Through Painted Deserts\\", so I got Don's history a little out of sync. Normally I'm not a huge nonfiction fan, but I love the flowing style that Don Miller writes in. Plus he likes the same kind of experiences that I do. I have definitely become a fan.The big criticism of Don by Christian theologians is that he is either \\"off\\" on this theology or too postmodern in his theology. I think it's telling that God didn't write a theology textbook, but a series of nonfiction stories that tell a Story--the story of redemption. I see that Don understands this, and wants to tell his part in the epic. And he's gifted at doing just that.Many more of us would benefit if we had Don's authentic relationship with God."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"At first I didn't know why I found this book to be so riveting. Upon reflection I realized it was because I felt like I was actually there with Mr. Miller throughout his trek and sojourn. For me it was just light-hearted and enjoyable reading, not really burdened with weighty or theological content, although there were some meaningful moments along the way. I recommend that you read this book after his hit Blue Like Jazz, even though this is chronologically backward, as it will help you to understand how he got to where he was when he wrote BLJ.RJC"},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I also read the original--Prayer and the Art...--only after the publication of Blue Like Jazz. Actually I never made it through the first edition. While I loved the idea of a roadtrip with Donald Miller, his overuse of the passive voice left me stalling in light of the electrifying conversational buzz of BLJ. I let my copy of PAVM sit around for a couple weeks before selling it back.The new edition--Through Painted Deserts--definitely traveled better and had me all the way through to its Sunrise. C.S. Lewis said, \\"we read to know we're not alone,\\" and I would recommend this book on that basis: anyone longing to hit the road for a while yet lacking the immediate means to do so should find instant companions in Don and Paul and their Vanagon. For bonafide Donald Miller fans it also illuminates this segment of Don's spiritual growth and provides a worthy prequel to \\"To Own a Dragon.\\""},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"If you are looking for another theological book and Christian Spirituality, you most likely will not find it in this book by Don Miller. He attempts to make the book about the 'why' questions of religion and not the 'what' questions - and attempts to answer them with a trip from Houston to Oregon in a VW Wagon with a friend named Paul - but never seems to follow up on this attempt in any way that resolves properly.He has a few 'deep' conversation that don't get very deep, aren't well developed, and leave you believing that the friendship Don and he shared was mostly left on the trail and not placed in the book. The character of Paul is left sounding a little stupid, while being lovingly described as being a greatly deep and spiritual person. Don's character is left sounding like everything in his life is a joke (albeit many of them funny - but some sounding very staged) and that he cannot finish a complete and deep thought to save his life. The deep thoughts are there, all right, and they come out in snippets, but as far as stringing together a coherent thought from concept to presentation - he just can't get the job done.Much of the book is like this. He states early on that he hates journaling and from his recollection of his journey chronicled in this book, you can see that that is very true. The times he had look to be recreated many years and beers after the fact where he is left with a mash of good feeling to sort through instead of the crispness of the moment. Thus, you are left wishing he could take you there instead of tell you about it.With all of this said, if you are looking for a good book about a journey of a young person who is trying to figure some deeper stuff out - this is it. I had a blast with this book and went into hoping for a travel type book. The writing is a little unpolished and newbie-ish - but this seems to leave you with the feeling that this could be you on this trip and writing this book.I think this not only reflects where the writer was in his career (this is a republishing of a earlier book with a different title) as well as his intent. He stated that with the rewrite he wanted to leave the deeper theological books behind and just tell a travel story. He does that fairly well here. It is no opus, but it is a good tune.If you are looking for a spiritual book, Blue Like Jazz, like every other reviewer recommends is you book. If you want a book to make you yearn for getting off your butt and going hiking, or road tripping, this is it.I want to give this book 3.5 stars, but Amazon won't let me. The MAN has held me down. ;)"},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Wow, that was disappointing. I bought this book for a friend because he is an automotive engineer and because he likes road trips and because we had had a discussion of the mechanical problems with VW's recently. (And because a friend whose taste in books I usually agree with liked, \\"Blue Like Jazz.\\") Perfect, I thought. Not so.I read it myself before sending it, and was disappointed at the lack of depth. There are some nice descriptive passages and a few insights that made me stop and think once in a while, but the whole time the narrative felt \\"forced\\" and self-conscious. Too self-conscious. I know it is a self-reflective kind of book, but there's too much reflecting about his own self-reflection. And not at a very deep level.Maybe it's because I am not a 20-something male. Apparently others have found it very enjoyable and insightful. I haven't the slightest desire to diminish anyone else's enjoyment. But I don't think my engineer friend will like it either, I'm afraid. Oh well. Maybe I'll borrow \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" before I buy it..."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"this book was a very open and honest christian memoir. I love his perspective on things and the honesty of searching -but-not-searching-for God is refreshing.He gives so downright funny stories about his trip cross country and the sometimes smart ass mouth that gets him in deep trouble at truck stops.I like how God loves these boys in their mess and Paul is constantly challanging Don to be and do better.Recommend Blue Like Jazz too."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"Just reading the Author's Note was inspiring enough for me.

It had been edited to leave out the raw, to leave out some of the questions, to leave out the whole truth. But when Donald had the publishing success with Blue he gained the clout to rewrite the book with his original words intact.The book is about friendship, about leaving home, about new experiences, long hikes, broken down VWs and Oregon. I read the book during three road trips around Oregon myself. It stretched the reading out over a year and a half, but it was more fun that way.This book is his most poetic, and I can see the seeds scattered on this trip that have blossomed in his writings that followed."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"The best of Donald Miller's work, probably because it caught me at a time when I wanted to be him, traveling the country in search of God."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"This book meanders through the different stages of a fantastic trip that donald miller and his buddy paul took.

Really though they aren't exactly in the same genre. \\"Through Painted Deserts\\" is an account of a roadtrip that miller took and some of the reflections that that trip inspired. \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" is more a book about Christianity and his thoughts on it. If you want a book on Christianity I wouldn't recommend this book, but if you're like me and you love old school roadtrip books then this is a great read. Not to mention it's funny. I read this at the mechanics while I was waiting for my car to get fixed and I kept laughing out loud. I think everyone there thought I was crazy.

I have enjoyed Donald Miller's other books; Blue Like Jazz and Searching for God Know's What, very much and this was no disappointment. This work foreshadows his later writing, but is more of a story about a particular roadtrip. It took me a while to finish listening to the 8+ hours. I like to wait until I can listen for at least an hour or two. I had to start it from the beginning several times so others could listen. Several of my friends and family are at various stages of the book right now and I have just finished it. It brings back memories of my own trips and conversations with good fiends. It also inspired me to plan a little roadtrip of my own later this year."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I appreciated the conclusions drawn by Don and Paul, but got tired listening to the long, overly descriptive narratives about the Volkswagen van.

There was only just enough adventure to keep my attention to the end."},{"Title":"Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road","review":"I love this book -- not only is it stunningly written, it's a story that resonates with almost everyone.

My opinion: of course it is! And it's quite refreshing to see a comic strip that isn't afraid to be. Better yet, the strip is never preachy and, unlike Foxtrot (to which it gets compared frequently), it's almost always funny. I've also seen a lot of comparisons to For Better or for Worse (helped along perhaps by the fact that Lynn Johnston wrote the introduction to this collection) which I find closer to the truth. The big difference there is that unlike FBoFW, Stone Soup is almost never sentimental. Eliot always finds a way to squeeze a laugh out of good times and bad, without dwelling on her storylines or overdeveloping them. While her focus may be on single mothers, her humor is accessible to one and all. And of course, it helps that Val and the gang always manage to keep their sanity intact at the end of each story!"},{"Title":"Stone Soup: The First Collection of the Syndicated Cartoon","review":"I read a lot of comic strips and most make me smile, some invoke a chuckle. Stone Soup is the only one that makes me laugh out loud over and over. My refrigerator is covered in Stone Soup and so is the wall of my cubicle at work. BUY THIS BOOK AND THE SECOND COLLECTION, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"},{"Title":"Stone Soup: The First Collection of the Syndicated Cartoon","review":"Someone below called this a feminist comic strip but I think that's misleading, especially given the current difficulties in just defining that word. Yes, it happens to have several female characters, and yes it's not a stereotypical mom-dad-dog-2.4-kids-wagon-picket-fence family, BUT: This strip is about all of us, everyone of every sex and age and family style, and it's enjoyable to (and enjoyed by) a wide range of people -- even ordinary traditional people and even (gasp) men! My husband loves it, my 60-something dad loves it, and so on. I think the publisher's blurb on the back of the second Stone Soup collection (&quot;You Can't Say Boobs On Sunday&quot;) got it right: &quot;Anyone who's ever had a family, been in a family, or known a family seems to love Stone Soup. ... Readers see themselves and their families in Stone Soup, and they love it.&quot; That goes for people who don't consider themselves family-oriented, and for people who do.Everyone I've known who's read any Stone Soup has enjoyed it and wound up quoting or passing around some of the strips.Recommended reading for everyone except total grumps, I say."},{"Title":"Stone Soup: The First Collection of the Syndicated Cartoon","review":"Finally, a truly feminist comic strip about non-traditional families! I've been waiting for Stone Soup for years, but I didn't realize it until the Boston Globe started running it about a year ago. I had to read it from the beginning, so I ordered this book and read it cover to cover in one evening, then read it cover to cover again the next day.And if you love Stone Soup as much as I do, do yourself a favor and look up Jan Eliot's earlier work in the Women's Glib projects. You can see the seeds of Stone Soup forming, as well as other completely unrelated work of hers with an equally feminist slant."},{"Title":"Stone Soup: The First Collection of the Syndicated Cartoon","review":"Loved this book!!! I'm a big collector of comic strip books....Can not wait until the next one comes to the stores! I enjoy family type comics and its nice to see a different type (but common?!) one portrayed. I've shown this to my friends and they have all seen themselves in one or more of the characters, So Kudos to Jan Eliot for the book!! Let's hope to see the next one soon."},{"Title":"Stone Soup: The First Collection of the Syndicated Cartoon","review":"If your family isn't the typical 2.5-kids-and-a-dog family, you might prefer &quot;Stone Soup&quot;, the first collection of a new comic from Jan Eliot. &quot;Stone Soup&quot; is the ongoing story of a single-parent family. Joan is mom to toddler Max, and to economize she lives with her sister Val, mother of daughters Alix and Holly, and Grandma. Although this family differs from the Foxtrots, readers will be able to relate to the typical problems the &quot;Stone Soup&quot; cast encounters. Joan starts a dating quest, only to find herself talking to Wally the single man living next door. She also struggles with child-rearing issues with Max, wanting to give him all the options and choices (when she leaves the room, Val just tells him &quot;NO!&quot;). Grandma, in the middle of one of the children's three-way tantrums, tells Val and Joan, &quot;Cherish these times. They grow up so fast.&quot; The entire family fights over the small bathroom. Joan struggles to start a home business. Meanwhile, an unwell Val exclaims,&quot;I'm having trouble with my vision. I just can't see myself going to work.&quot; There are few men in &quot;Stone Soup&quot;: Max and Wally are about it. This is definitely the woman's perspective on life. However, that does not mean the humor is inaccessible to men. Unlike &quot;Bloom County&quot; by Berkeley Breathed, which had a decidely male point of view, the issues in &quot;Stone Soup&quot; are not exclusively female. &quot;Stone Soup&quot; is not a militant, women's lib strip; it's a new, mainstream national voice that happens to be female. Get in on the ground floor. Wounldn't it have been fun to have followed &quot;Doonesbury&quot; from its very first publication? &quot;Stone Soup&quot; isn't necessarily &quot;Doonesbury,&quot; but it is good. Jan Eliot's &quot;Stone Soup&quot; will probably be around for a while. ---Mark Levine, reviewer for the Ventura County Star"},{"Title":"Stone Soup: The First Collection of the Syndicated Cartoon","review":"You know what I love most about this comic strip? There's something for everyone. Yes the story starts off with a single mom living with her two daughters, her mom, her sister and her son so it is a lot of females in the beginning...but males appear along the way. And they don't push she the original cast out of the way, instead they compliment it, adding even more depth to the family than there was in the beginning. The stories are down to earth, without being overly sentimental or sappy (like some other comics that I won't name) and you can easily relate to the characters and recognize your own events in your life. It's a genuinely funny strip that I look forward to reading each day.And yep Amazon isn't selling new copies, but you can check here: [...] and pick up a signed copy of the book!"},{"Title":"Stone Soup: The First Collection of the Syndicated Cartoon","review":"A funny look at the day to day madness that every single/widowed mother trying to cope with family, work and friends must undergo.As a guy, I am not sure I should even *have* an opinion about some of the things in here but I will safely say this: \\"It's funny, it's warm, it's human and these are very likeable, very real people.\\" No talking dogs, no aliens living in the basement, no cats who hate Mondays, no penguins with existential problems just reality, but oh such a fun reality.You should buy this book and the rest of the series and settle down for some laughs and a lot of plain old fun. Buy a set for your mom too, even if she wasn't a single mom or widowed, she's been there.If you're a guy, definitely read these. Pay attention too, there'll be a quiz later...lots of quizzes in fact and really tough field problems.

How wonderful and hilarious to see a comic-strip Mom who's got better things to do than become the family doormat -- Val's no-nonsense dealings with the kids is a refreshing change from the usual Mommy-clean-my-mess (from husband as well as kids) in most family comic strips. Of course STONE SOUP is feminist (Oh! I just said the &quot;f&quot; word!) -- it dares to presume that female characters can carry a comic strip all by themselves, and be funny and interesting in and of themselves, and that families come in all shapes and sizes. Naturally it's taken years for Eliot to come out with a *second* collection of these wonderful strips while the bulimia manual CATHY and the formulaic mommy-doormat FOXTROT are on their umpteenth releases -- some people are just so *threatened* by real women, aren't they?"},{"Title":"Heads You Win Tails I Lose","review":"Melissa Hammond has always liked Ted Macdonald.He won't give her the time of day.Melissa is overwieght &amp; a little depressed.Melissa thinks her dad is cheating on her mom with his secretary.Melissa starts to use diet &amp; sleeping pills.Melissa starts to get dizzy after taking 2 diet pills one day.If you want to know what happens to Melissa you have to read the book."},{"Title":"The Reformation (Turning Points in World History)","review":"I have read several of the titles in Greenhaven Press's \\"Turning Points in World History\\" series and this one - \\"The Reformation\\" - is an excellent example of the potential of this series being properly and completely fulfilled. The series is intended to be a broad, but relatively complete overview of each subject. Structured as individual chapters, each with a number (3 - 6) of individual essays by various authors, then followed by an excellent compilation of original texts taken from the period and a chronology of main events, this series is very well structured. In this book, the reformation is broken down into five chapters that delve into 1) the origins of the reformation, 2) the spread of pretestantism, 3) cultural and social context, 4) Catholic Reformation and counter-reformation, and 5) The legacy. With the composition of each chapter as a sequence of relatively short essays, there are always the risks that 1) any given essay may be too terse to fully develop its subject (almost all are taken from longer works, pared down for the books of this series), 2) there may be too much overlap between essays, or 3) the ordering of essays may not be an optimal approach to the subject. However, in this particular volume, the reformation is very well introduced and each essay stands on its own as a very clear and concise introduction to one aspect of the overall subject matter. This book is clearly an excellent introduction and has helped mold my interest in this subject so that I am delving more deeply into various aspects of this history."},{"Title":"Home Below Hell's Canyon","review":"The book was sent on time and in very good condition for a used book.

What a wealth of experience graced the life of Grace Jordan at a cost of work and worry that would put most of us modern women to shame. She was the real deal! Visiting the Jordan ranch after reading this book was the icing on the cake! Oh, you can google earth the ranch if visiting it is not an option."},{"Title":"Home Below Hell's Canyon","review":"Hell's Canyon on the Snake River between Idaho and Oregon is deeper than the Grand Canyon and almost as majestic and awe-inspiring. About 20 miles of the Canyon is roadless and can only be reached by boat. The only people that live there now are park rangers who get mail from the outside world once a week, but the river can be crowded in summer with jetboaters, rafters, and kayakers. Fortunately, the Forest Service protects the river and the canyon walls from development and exploitation.In the depression years of the 1930s the Jordan family was desperate and bought a sheep ranch in the Canyon to try to reverse their failing fortunes. They lived with their children at Kirkwood Ranch -- which can still be visited -- for several years. They had a few neighbors scattered up and down the canyon plus a few employees. This is the story of their life as written by Grace Jordan. It's a lively account, filled with descriptions of domestic activities and the eccentric people that passed through her doors. She tells a nostalgic and appealing story of pioneering life in a very remote place.The Jordan's left the river at the beginning of World War II and Len Jordan went on to become a U.S. Senator, quite a feat considering the hard times he endured during the depression. I suspect, however, that the sheep-herding life he lived in Hell's Canyon was more interesting than his political career.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Home Below Hell's Canyon","review":"The copy of this book is in very good condition.

Oh, how I wish I had read it before! Now I have to go back and spend my time at the Kirkwood ranch poking around and visualizing what it must have looked like when the young family of Len and Grace Jordan and their three young children lived there.What's lovely about this book is how Grace recounts the events of their life, from the small things such as how they cooked and canned, to the big things like close brushes with danger, the harshness and isolation of life in the canyon. The author's tight writing style is down-to-earth and no nonsense, yet still human, warm and insightful. The character profiles she draws are filled with empathy and humor.The only drawback is the lack of images in the book. I would have loved to see a picture of the Jordan family, photos of the horses and the sheepherding life, and images of the grounds and landscape.If you are a fan of slice of life / coping & managing books (like Laura Ingalls Wilder books, pioneer diaries, etc.) then you'll love this.

It covers events from the time Eva got her deportation notice until Theresienstadt was liberated. Eva was fortunate compared to most of the residents of Theresienstadt. She had a good job in the garden (which made her exempt from deportation, for the most part) and this Aryan guy kept giving her food -- enough for herself and seven other people to live on.Unfortunately for the reader, Eva stopped writing her diary for the four-month period during which time her boyfriend and her parents were deported to Poland. I would have liked to have read her emotional reaction during this time and how she coped, but she said she was too distraught to keep up her diary. She resumed it in January 1945, but the later entries were very short and dry.A worthy contribution to the Holocaust diaries collection. It includes several photos of Eva and her family.Here are some other Theresienstadt diaries:A Boy in Terezin: The Private Diary of Pavel Weiner, April 1944-April 1945The Terezin Diary of Gonda RedlichThe Diary of Petr Ginz"},{"Title":"Microeconomics , Study Guide: Theory & Applications","review":"I was taught intermediate micro using this book.

Journal of Economic Issues","review":"Dequech(D)claims in this article that he has developed \\"some new ideas\\"(p.159) that can be integrated into discussions of rational choice or decision making under uncertainty.First,he states that\\"A preliminary discussion of the concept of uncertainty is necessary\\"(p.160).Strong uncertainty is \\"...the impossibility of forming fully reliable probabilistic estimates...\\"Fundamental uncertainty means\\"...that decision makers do not know the list of all possible relevant events\\".However,fundamental uncertainty \\"...does not imply complete ignorance\\".All of these statements were modeled mathematically by Keynes in his A Treatise on Probability(1921;TP) in chapter 26 on p.315(as well as in ft.2 on that page).Keynes defined the weight of the evidence,w,on the unit interval between 0 and 1.Keynes's approach to modeling w is the same as(identical to)his approach to defining probability on the unit interval between 0 and 1.A w=1.0 defines a complete information set.There is no uncertainty.A w between 0 and 1 represents some degree of uncertainty.Probabilities(usually intervals for Keynes) are unreliable guides to action if w&lt;1.Decision makers do not have the complete list of all possible relevant outcomes.A w=0 represents complete ignorance in the TP,complete uncertainty in the General Theory(GT,1936)and \\"We simply do not know\\"(complete ignorance) in his 1937 Quarterly Journal of Economics article,\\"The General Theory of Employment\\".In his 1961 Quarterly Journal of Economics article(see also Ellsberg's 1962 dissertation,published in 2001 as Risk,Ambiguity,and Decision),Ellsberg defined rho on the unit interval between 0 and 1.Rho measures the degree of confidence and/or reliability that a decision maker has in his information set of different possible probability distributions.This set may be composed of evidence that is \\"scanty,vague,conflicting;ambiguous\\".A rho equal to 1 means that there is no ambiguity and the decision maker has complete confidence in using a single,unique ,additive probability distribution.A rho between 0 and 1 means that the decision maker has a set of different probability distributions that he considers relevant.A rho equal to 0 means that he has no confidence in any probability distribution(complete ignorance).In ft.1(p.160),D claims the following:\\"In contrast,the notion of ambiguity...still falls short of fundamental uncertainty.Under ambiguity,people are uncertain about probabilities but know the list of all possible relevant events\\".This statement is simply false.Nowhere in this article is Ellsberg's work discussed or is Ellsberg ever cited.The definitions given by Keynes(w) and Ellsberg(rho) exhaust all possible cases.Nowhere in this paper or in any other paper published by Dequech does he give any explicit definition of precisely what he means by \\"fundamental uncertainty\\".Until D gives an explicit definition that will allow a reader to make a comparison of it with the definitions of Keynes and Ellsberg,there is no way that one can conclude that D has made any advance in this area whatsoever.The meaning of \\"fundamental uncertainty\\" is extremely vague and seems to change throughout the paper.The second major problem is that D conflates optimism-pessimism with\\"... uncertainty aversion(or willingness to face uncertainty)\\"(p.163).Dequech thus confuses \\"pessimism\\" with \\"conservatism\\"(a cool,careful,prudent,measured response by a decision maker when faced with uncertain outcomes).Contrary to D,another variable is needed to operationalize/incorporate optimism-pessimism into the decision context.Keynes was unable to operationalize this variable in a technical manner.Ellsberg successfully did so with the alpha index model originally developed by Hurwicz.The claim that \\"the more uncertainty averse(the less courageous)a person is...\\"confirms D's conflation of conservatism in the face of uncertainty with pessimism in the face of uncertainty.Perhaps D needs to ponder the old proverb that \\"fools rush in where angels fear to tread\\" before he completely rewrites this paper on uncertainty where the only new ideas turn out to be wrong or unclear."},{"Title":"What Bloody Man Is That","review":"My favourites among the lightweight crime novels of Simon Brett that feature actor cum sleuth Charles Parris are those set against a background of the live theatre and What Bloody Man Is That falls into this category.Parris is engagaed to appear in provincial repertory theatre in a production of MacBeth-not,alas for him ,in either the title role or a significant supporting part ,but in a variety of small roles.It is a production for which the omens are not good.The title role is in the hands of an actor whose recent career has been in a television sitcom,and who has forgotten many of the disciplines of the classical theatre;his Lady MacBeth is a promising young actress used to the more leisurely and academic approach of the subsidised theatre and who is aghast at the short rehearsal time and text cutting inherent in the commercial world.Add to this a cast member who is a predatory old roue who turns up dead and there is every reason to believe that Shakespeares play will live up to its reputation an \\"unlucky\\"The mystery is not deep but the brisk pace and jaunty writing keeps things lively and diverting,and there are some wry observations about the way the young generation of schoolkids have to be dragged along to see the Bard,and the unenthusiastic response of the MTV audience to the classics.Brett is especially good on the cameraderie between actors who operate below the level of stardom.One for those who like their mysteries breezy and light and especially if they are devotees of the thespic arts."},{"Title":"What Bloody Man Is That","review":"Simon Brett has always been one of my favorite British crime writers, but only his Charles Paris mysteries interest me because the actor, Charles, is such a funny character, a wreck of a man, but oh, so human, so flawed. He's always nursing a hangover at a crucial time in his acting career or during his murder-solving avocational excursions. The theater backgrounds and the inner workings of acting are fascinating elements in the books. Brett's other crime series are boring and simplistic.He should go back to Charles who is usually drunk, in and out of small acting jobs, and fun to read about because he has the worst agent in England. He's separated from his wife Frances, and is always teetering on the edge of despair, sobriety, and farce.Acting jobs are hard for Charles to land. This time he has a job in provincial repertory in Warminster in that cursed play \\"Macbeth.\\" Because he's a good-hearted, eager-to please, desperate actor, and because the director is a wimp, he gets saddled with ten bit parts in the play, all with different costumes.Warnock Belvedere is a nasty old ham playing only one part, that of Duncan. He quickly becomes hated by the whole cast and eventually ends up as the murder victim. Charles has to solve the case because he discovered the body, and he's the chief suspect. He gives up the booze while on the case. It's an ingenious plot, and the solution is perfectly fitting.The school matinee performances are hilarious, and the cast gets the giggles because a walnut is being passed around the cast to unsuspecting players. Brett doesn't really go into whether the play was effective for adult audiences or whether all the other actors did a good job. He's more interesting in weaving a good comic yarn, setting a fast pace, getting in some telling caricatures, and providing readers with a very enjoyable performance."},{"Title":"Uncle Remus, his songs and his sayings","review":"Most people today know of how the White Georgian Joel Chander Harris was fascinated by the \\"rabbit stories\\" of Black slaves he met at a Georgia plantation in the 1860s, thus eventually leading to this book in 1880. While it's justly famous for the \\"Brer (brother) Rabbit\\" stories (BTW-Harris was not the first to record these tales from ex-slaves, Abbie Christensen did that in Port Royal, SC in 1874), it's mighty rough for the modern reader. For one thing, the \\"Negro dialect\\" used by Harris is almost incomprehensible to today's reader. Additionally, \\"Uncle Remus' views on education for Blacks (not in favor) and black advancement, as well as his occasional use of the \\"n-word\\" will make this tough to swallow in these PC times. One has to remember when this book was written and get past all that to see the actual beauty and importance of these tales.PS-Be warned that if you like the original edition with the wonderful illustrations of Brer Rabbit in overalls smoking a pipe and of the background scenery and other animal charachters, none of these charming illustrations appear in the Penguin version-just so you'll know."},{"Title":"Uncle Remus, his songs and his sayings","review":"I found this book to offer a piece of American history which has since been lost.

I waited YEARS to get a decent copy of Demons, and am a proud owner of several collector's items published not son long ago, but in what appears to be a very limited edition. This book is a journey through life itself, a book of historic value with true fiction and true facts. Yes, both are possible, for Doderer does not believe in a single form of reality, but at least two. Two or more opinions persevere today: one that focuses on his adherence to Nazism and the other who underscores his abandonment of Hitler before his triumph and the Anschluss. It does not and it should not matter to the reader, for this book does not directly deal with Hitler.In any case, buy this book, take a month of reading other books and dig in! Or, as with Musil's Man w/o qualities, read a short paragraph here, a chapter there and savor the marvel of this world."},{"Title":"Dogs: The Ultimate Care Guide: Good Health, Loving Care, Maximum Longevity","review":"As a first time puppy owner of an Old English Sheep Dog, I bought this book to help me through the mystifying world (to me) of dog care, and absolutely loved it.The guide is by far the most comprehensive, yet easy to read, with easy to follow instructions of many books that I have seen out there, some of which I own. Each topic is covered in about 2 pages, yet they contain enough detail and handy advice for the new dog owner to feel confident about his or her new relationship. Building that confidence leads to a well-behaved, confident pet, and the tremendous pleasure of ownership of another being.The guide is divided into several useful sections as follows:1. Getting acquainted - what kind of dog should you get? Coverage on the top 50 breeds in the US (although unfortunately my lovely puppy wasn't in it). How to deal with new puppy, how to read your dog's body language.2. Training - everything from house-training your puppy, through to basic and advanced training. It also has a very useful section on correcting unwanted behavior such as chasing cares, digging, anxiety and much more.3. Essential care - what you need to do to keep your dog fit and healthy. What kinds of toys to buy, whether to leave your pet in or out, and traveling with your dog.4. Food - Nutrition, water, eating problems, snacks and special diets.5. Health watch - preventing sickness and common problems, choosing a vet, neutering, breeding/birthing and caring for older dogs.6. Easing common complaints - what to do about bad breath, bloating, sunburn and ticks, and many other quirks like flatulence and drooling.7. First aid - in case your dog (I hope it never happens to you) needs emergency care.8. Looking good - grooming and washing your dog.These useful and crucial topics are interspersed with dialog boxes (Paws for Thought) that address questions you've thought about but never expected to get an answer on, such as \\"do dogs fake being hurt?\\" (p.300), or \\"why do dogs stick their heads out of car windows?\\" (p.202),The book, not surprisingly, boasts contributors ranging from veterinarians, trainers, groomers and other animal experts.So far, everything I have needed to know, or any questions I had about my dog, has been in this book. It's the first place I look to for answers. In short, this amazing book has been like a bible for me to raise my new puppy (and how to deal with all that long shaggy hair!).

Yes, it's one of the single most amazing pieces of literature in the history of time.I adore Milton, despite his flaws, simply because he dared to express his true feelings. The questions he raises in this book are bold and daring (for the time). And they are questions that remain unanswered.A must read for anyone who questions religion, or for anyone who doesn't."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"First, let me state that I am not a fan of poetry. I find the way it obscures meaning and ebroiders every last thought in metaphor and simile to be frustrating and distracting. I'm so busy trying to figure out what each line means that I forget where I am in the overall scheme of things.After making my way through The Oddysey, Beowulf and the Divine Comedy, I thought I could handle Milton's Paradise Lost. I was wrong.I make it a personal mission that try to I finish every book I start. In the last 10 years, I can remember having failed in this only 4 times:- On The Origin of Species (Charles Darwin);- The Republic (Plato);- The Four-Gated City (Doris Lessing); and- Paradise Lost by John Milton.My major criticisms include the following:- Sentences are drawn out to intolerable length, stacked with metaphor upon metaphor, until I get halfway down the page and I've forgotten how the sentence started!- Although stated at the start of the book that rhyme was deliberately avoided, I found the absence of any rhyme reduced the poetic impact for me.- It was hard to fall into the metre of the verse, which made it more difficult for me to get into the flow of the tale (possibly related to the lack of rhyme stated above).- The decriptions were so flowery and interwoven that I often found that what I thought was a decription of one entity was in fact two or more!In the end, I just couldn't do it.To be fair though, of the small section I read (I got to the end of Book III I think) there were a few passages which were clear enough that I was able to appreciate the beauty of the language. Also, I appreciated the way Milton attempted to characterise the War in Heaven and its aftermath. Such a critical foundation of Judeo-Christian theology is given short shrift in the Bible and other works; giving it some depth was a valiant effort. But there weren't enough of the good parts to keep me engaged, more's the pity.This may be a cornerstone of English literature, but it wasn't for me. If you enjoy thick, dense poetry, and apocryphal theology, then enjoy with my blessing. It was too much for me."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"First off, let me say that we're not talking here about the famous Qi gong instructor named John Milton. We're talking about the famous 17th-century English poet who wrote _Paradise Lost_ and _Paradise Regained_, two of the most wonderfully overlong Christian poems in the history of Western literature.Your English teacher will tell you that _Paradise Lost_ \\"narrates the story of Adam and Eve's disobedience, explains how and why it happened, and places the story within the larger context of Satan's rebellion and Jesus' resurrection.\\" And you know that can't be far wrong, because SparkNotes says the exact same thing.But the main reason everyone should read Milton's grand epic is that it contains certain secrets about prayer.In PL, Milton reminds us how important it is, when we pray, to be absolutely specific. The Lord has a strange, often disturbing, sense of humour (PL, books I-XII). If you leave Him wiggle room, He will answer your prayer in a way you never intended, and then say it was your own damned fault, because your prayer contained seven types of ambiguity.John Milton writes from experience. Example: Almost every time a good-looking woman passed within view of John Milton, he suffered an involuntary erection. Daniel of the Old Testament might well have suffered such a condition without complaining, but John Milton found it onerous. John was both a Puritan and a student of Saint Augustine. He was not happy when he suffered an erection, he hated it, and he especially resented the women who made that thing happen to him.In a Latin letter to his friend, George Wither, John Milton reports that, in his youth, he would sometimes see a pretty woman even in his dreams at night, and suffer, not just an erection, but the whole nine yards, up to and including a nocturnal emission; which he trained himself to handle according to Scripture, thereby to purify himself (Deut. 23:10); but sometimes he was unable to wait that long before he handled it, which filled his soul full of Puritan remorse and self-reproach.At age 33, the poet took to wife a 16-year-old lolita named Mary Powell; and you may already have guessed the reason why, which is that she gave him an erection -- more accurately, she gave him \\"one damned erection after another,\\" without remission. (Giving John Milton an erection was not the girl's conscious intent, but it just happened to him, every time they met.) And since Christian marriage is Saint Paul's only approved method whereby to deal with that kind of torment, John Milton (being an honourable man) thought it best to marry the girl (1 Cor. 7:9).Frailty, thy name is woman! After two years of marriage - after just two years of witnessing those insufferable erections that could not be beaten down, or at least, not for long - the poet's young Puritan bride ran away and skipped back home to live with her mother, Mrs. Anne Powell, who likewise gave John an erection; which is why John Milton resented his mother-in-law as well as his estranged wife.Those were the hardest years of the poet's life - nothing but a daily struggle against involuntary erections, yet here he was, trapped in a loveless marriage to a barely pubescent teenager who lived with her entirely-too-attractive mother. Which is partly why John Milton wrote those four revolutionary Christian pamphlets, correcting Moses' and Jesus' hardline policy on divorce (Mark 10:11-12).In his Latin correspondence, some of which is preserved in the Bodleian Library, John Milton reports that he was fine when alone in his study, or when hobnobbing with Parliamentarians, or even when having a hasty pudding, or a figgy one, over at the Inns of Court; but let just one good-looker cross his path, showing good ankle between the hem of her dress and the top of her shoe, and it was boing! - instant erection, just like a spring-loaded mechanical device; causing John to exclaim bitterly, \\"Oh, God, please, not again! Save me from this penal fire!\\"It even happened to him once when Oliver Cromwell's wife, Elizabeth Bourchier Cromwell, bent over to pick up a handkerchief that had fallen to the floor. On that occasion there was a lamentable accident (\\"an hard mishap\\" [verbatim quote]) with John's ordinarily modest codpiece - an incident so humiliating that John never even wrote a poem about it, although he did apologise, profusely, to Oliver Cromwell, and to Mrs. Cromwell, who saw the whole thing, and then fainted. (John at the time was employed as Cromwell's Latin secretary.)By the way: It was modesty, not arrogance, that moved John Milton, after that embarrassing incident, to wear a baggy codpiece, with plenty of wiggle room.Which brings me back to the beginning, when I was explaining why you should give the Lord no wiggle room when you pray: John Milton took his problem to the Lord in prayer, stating in his journal, \\"Father, I pray Thee, let me not suffer a stiffe joynt when I see a beautifull woman.\\"And here's how the Lord answered that prayer, in 1651: He struck John Milton blind.At first, John thought that his blindness was a punishment for his own bad behaviour - which is how that whole thing got going, in Anglo-American Christianity, about how, if you are a boy who does what John Milton used to do, it could make you go blind. But God revealed to John, by means of a dream, that his blindness was actually an answer to his own prayers - because the poet had said, \\"Father, let me not suffer a stiff joint when I see a beautiful woman.\\"John Milton then said, \\"Lord, that is not what I meant, at all\\" - but it was too late to change the outcome, because the prayer was already answered.The erections that John Milton suffered in the years 1651-1674, and there were many, even after the Lord answered his prayer, were not from seeing a beautiful woman, it was actually because John had a condition that modern physicians call PSAS (\\"Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome\\"). So the chronic \\"stiffe joynt\\" problem was not really the women's fault, and it never was; but John Milton never knew that. Even when he wrote Paradise Lost (by dictation, from 1652-1667), John was still under the impression that women, seen or unseen, were to blame for his condition; which is why he makes all of those snide remarks in blank verse about your mother, Eve, in Books IV-V and IX-X of Paradise Lost. Because whenever he pictured Eve in his mind's eye, it was boing! - the same old problem. And there would come no more blank verse to his head for the next twenty minutes or so, until things settled down. John Milton hated that.But it all turned out for the best: if God had not answered John Milton's prayer in that unusual way, by blinding him, Paradise Lost might never have been completed, and sold to the publisher, Sam Simmons, in 1667, for 5 - which was a tidy sum for a religious poem during the decadent Restoration era.It was while writing the early books of Paradise Lost that John was introduced to Katherine, a ship captain's daughter, a fat woman whom he had never seen (because he was blind); whom he nonetheless married in 1656, but not for the same old reason as before: John asked fat Kate to marry him (a.) because he needed secretarial assistance with Paradise Lost, and (b.) because Katherine did not have the same pernicious effect on him as Mary Powell and her mother Anne had done. John could dictate blank verse to Kate all night long without feeling so much as a tingle down there.Kate's surname was Woodcock. Beelzebub made a little joke about that: he said, \\"The Lord finally gave John Milton just what he always wanted.\\"- L."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"a riveting book for the philosophy of good and evil"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Sufficiency is fluid.

Before the falls, both of the rebel angels and of Adam and Eve, the relation between God and his creations is almost always one to one and direct. God makes his creatures sufficient to withstand any and all evil, but by investing all with free will gives them the choice of whether or not to embrace the evil. Suffiency lies within all sentient creatures to do God's will, but one can only be proved sufficient by doing God's will. In short, to be sufficient in God's eyes is to do his will--no matter what!That suffiency is fluid is vaguely clear through out the poem. There is never one definition of perfectly righteous or good behavior. Satan and the rebel angels needed only to accept Messiah as God and King; Adam and Eve needed only not eat of the tree of knowledge; Michael, Gabriel, and company had to take part in that farce of fight for heaven; Enoch, Noah, Moses and Jesus showed their suffiency by standing up for God against humanly impossible odds. The lists of lesser examples in the poem are too numerous to recite and keep this essay readable, but it is more than reasonable to conclude that depending on the situation anything from indifferent obedience to militant martyrdom will be sufficient. But, constant obedience is always the rule.The same rule of suffiency should be applied to Paradise in a slightly modified form. God is the greatest of planners because he knows all. Knowing all, he makes plans for every consequence of every action. Had Adam and Eve resisted Satan in the garden, then it would have proved sufficient for two beings who did not know good or evil. That would have proved enough of a mockery to the aims of Satan, but after the fall God ordains it necessary to show that everything Satan ever does to mankind is utterly futile and leads only to more punishment and increase of pain. The fact that he will make the supreme greatness of mankind come from evil means shows his power to be without end, and Satan's unwillingness to accept this is what will ultimately destroy him and his host of rebels at history's conclusion.The entire question of suffiency of all virtues is the meditation of Milton from the poem's beginning to the close. What is constantly necessary to remember in this poem is the distinction between virtue, or power, and true virtue, power used to celebrate and defend good. Milton uses this distinction to turn epic virtues on their head by investing Satan with so many of them. Satan is fearless, uncompromisingly defiant, willing to fight by whatever means are provided to him and he is inspiring. We can see shades of Aeneas, Odysseus, Scaevola, the Earl of Kent from King Lear, and numerous other literary and historical figures that seethed with defiance and did everything in their power to defy and defy and defy. What all characters put forth have in common though is that they used their powers in defense of people, home, freedom, and friendship. Satan uses the power still invested in him, his \\"courage never to submit or yield\\" to try to destroy, not create. Comically, he even seems to realize that he can, at best, be a mild irritant to God this way:...If then his ProvidenceOut of our evil seek to bring forth good,Our labour must be to pervert that end,And out of good still find means of evil,Which oft-times may succeed, so as perhapsShall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturbHis inmost counsels from their destined aim. (I, 162-68)This is power so completely abused that it barely requires further explication. Suffice it to say though, this is the same valor that we find in Adam when we are introduced to him for the first time in book IV, and that he disdains using in book IX when he chooses to follow Eve's lead by eating the forbidden fruit. Where the true virtue of the obedient angels and the classical epic heroes lies in their motivation for undertaking feats of violence, Satan's hatefulness, which grows as he further resists God, lies in the fact that he uses all his powers and intellect in the service of conquest, destruction, and wickedness. As becomes clear by the poem's end, when Michael shows Adam the tyranny of Nimrod, valor when in the service of wickedness is not a true virtue. True virtue and greatness can only come through God's favor.Here it seems appropriate to move from suffiency in beings and their actions to the suffiency of Paradise. As Raphael points out in book VII, creation of the world and mankind took place in order show Satan and the rebel angels their superflousness by filling what they could have defined as a void when they were banished from Heaven. God loves all his creatures for the obedience and love they show him. But part of the nature of being omnipotent is that nothing is inexpendible and no thing is outside of his purview. Existence itself is by God's sufferance and for any permanence of good to come of a beings existence this must be accepted as indisputable. Milton's Satan would not be Milton's Satan if he accepted this necessity. He even had a chance to accept it in book II had he advised the Stygian council to accept the advice of Mammon--one who hates God as much as Satan:...Let us not then pursueBy force impossible, by leave obtainedUnacceptable, though in Heav'n, our stateOf splendid vassalage, but rather seekOur own good from ourselves, and from our ownLive to ourselves, though in this vast recess,Free, and to none accountable, preferringHard liberty before the easy yokeOf servile pomp. Our greatness will appearThen most conspicuous, when great things of small,Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse,We can create, and in what place soe'erThrive under evil, and work ease out of painThrough labour and endurance. (II, 249-262)God's wrath is infinite when provoked, and expulsion from Heaven is the punishment for attempting to conquer Heaven. There is no reason to believe that his ire would have been raised had the rebel angels simply accepted their punishment, because the punishment and the concomitant agony that the disobedient angels suffer would have been sufficient. The further disobedience of Satan is what makes more punishment necessary, hence the periodic metamorphosis into serpents the rebels undergo after Satan's return from Earth. Again, suffiency of actions by God becomes defined solely by decisions made by his creations. By seducing Adam and Eve, Satan showed God that banishment was not sufficient to quell his pride. Also, Adam and Eve showed themselves insufficiently obedient to deserve Paradise. It became necessary for God to alter all of their conditions in order to punish Satan accordingly, further dash his pride. For Adam and Eve the punishment was death and the misery of history. They proved insufficient of Paradise, nothing in Paradise itself was imperfect, insufficient, let alone deficient, accept for them after the fall.God is the creator of infinite possibility in all his sentient creatures. He should not be viewed as the writer of a book with a singular vision who preordains events to make a specific conclusion. That would be fate or destiny and God did not impose these upon human existence. God has total foreknowledge of all events, but he explains to Messiah that this is irrelevant because free will gives all his creations choice. They would be worthless otherwise because,Not free, what proof could they have giv'n sincereOf true allegiance, constant faith or love,Where only what they needs must do, appeared,Not what they would? What praise could they receive?What pleasures I from such obedience paid,When will and reason (reason also is choice)Useless and vain, of freedom both despoiled,Made passive both, had served necessity,Not me. (III, 103-111)There needs to be the constant possibility of evil arising for good to mean anything. Good is totally impotent without the contrast of evil, in fact it arguably can not exist without it. Automaton praise would not be real praise of God.When discussion of the suffiency of Paradise comes up in any definition of suffiency we enter into very dangerous territory. Adam and Eve voice no complaints about Paradise; they do not imagine the possibility of being happier than they are prior to their fall. Disobedience to God remains a constant possibility because of the absolute existence of free will. The universe that Milton has created is one where the actions of individuals is never foreordained and one in which absolute obedience to God is the only path through which any good can ever u come to the individual. There is also never an instance where what God asks is even in modest proportion compared to what he gives. At the same time though, Milton makes absolutely clear that obedience to God does not protect either his dutiful from horrors. One need only remember the nightmare of Eve at the beginning of Book V, or the awful description by Raphael of the hollowing that he hears coming from Hell when he is dispatched there during creation. But God never exposes his creations to truly painful tests of their loyalty, not by any standard that fallen humankind. Paradise is perfectly sufficient for Adam and Eve in the state they are in just prior to their fall. Neither one truly aspires towards bettering themselves in a way that would increase their happiness and still maintain their total obedience to God. They proved insufficient to remain in Paradise, but Paradise may have proved insufficient for the beings they were to become had they not fallen.Raphael conjectures when he meets Adam and Eve in Book V, that mankind may one day transubstantiate into a more spiritual being that will be able to cross the boundary between Paradise and Heaven.(493-503) He is not given any information by God save the fact that Satan is hanging around Paradise, so it is purely conjecture to assume that this is possibility. The same is also true of the conjectures that Michael makes about the once possible future of unfallen mankind in Book XI; the progeny of mankind would spread out of Paradise and into the world at large. Eden would have proved not large enough to hold all of mankind. I do not believe though that this is a reflection upon quality of Eden, but one upon its physical size. There is also no reason to believe that the progeny of Adam and Eve would have been just like them. They may very well have been designed to exist in a state closer to our own. Milton's God is the definition of infinite variety and it is impossible to quantify what he would have done if...Ultimately in Paradise Lost questions of suffiency are nearly moot. Milton's initial purpose in the poem \\"to justify the ways of God to man,\\" shows this better than anything else. God asks so little, but the stakes are so high for the fate of mankind that it becomes horrible to see just what happens. Since God is infinitely complicated just as he is infinitely powerful. It seems to me that Milton came to the conclusion that God could not be justified, let alone by human standards. God gives all and asks nearly nothing. When he is disobeyed, no one of his creations has the right to question the actions he takes. Through his ability to show just how simple the arrangement with God initially was, he shows how futile it is to try to justify anything he does prior to the fall."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Some parts of this book are good, some are boring.

I was of course aware that scholars considered it a great work, a classic. But it seemed a bit daunting - long, difficult, dated, and possibly no longer relevant.A few years ago I made two fortunate decisions. I elected to read Milton's Paradise Lost and I bought the Norton Critical Edition (edited by Scott Elledge). I read and reread Paradise Lost over a period of three months as well as the 300 pages of the Norton critical commentary. I was stunned by the beauty and power of Milton. Why had I waited so long to even approach such a literary masterpiece?Make no mistake. I had been right in several ways. Paradise Lost is difficult, it is long, and full appreciation requires an understanding of the historical and religious context. But Paradise Lost is a remarkable achievement. It explores questions regarding man and God that are as relevant today as in the 17th century. And the genius of Milton has never been surpassed.I found the Norton footnotes extremely helpful - definitions for rare or archaic words and expressions, explanations of the historical context, and links to the critical commentary section. The footnotes are at the page bottom, making them readily accessible.The Norton biographical, historical, and literary commentaries were fascinating in their own right. I may well as spent as many hours reading commentary as with Paradise Lost itself.John Milton led a remarkable life. His enthusiastic euology on Shakespeare was included in the second folio edition of Shakespeare in 1632. This was Milton's first public appearance as an author! While traveling as a young man he &quot;found and visited&quot; the great Galileo, old and blind, a house prisoner of the Inquisition for his astronomical heresy. Years later Milton, a close supporter of Cromwell, barely escaped the scaffold at the Restoration and was at risk for some period afterwards. Many considered Milton no more than an outcast, now old and blind himself, a republican and regicide who had escaped death by too much clemency. Within a few years this aging blind outcast created one of the masterpieces of the English language.Milton broke all English tradition by writing Paradise Lost in blank verse. Homer in Greek and Vergil in Latin had used blank verse, but English demanded rhyme. Although others failed to imitate Milton's blank verse (I suspect that none wanted to be compared directly with genius), the praise was without exception. Dryden, a master of rhyme, is attributed with saying, &quot;This man cuts us all out, and the ancients too&quot;.Milton's characterization of Satan, Adam, Eve, the archangels Raphael, Michael, and Gabriel, and even God himself are masterful. The debates and arguments that evolve around free will, obedience, forbidden knowledge, love, evil, and guilt are timeless. And fascinating. And thought provoking.Paradise Lost will require commitment and patience and thought. The commitment in time is substantial. (I enjoy Samuel Johnson's subtle comment: &quot;None ever wished it longer than it is.&quot;) But the return is a personal experience with great literature, one of the masterpieces of the English language. I consider myself fortunate to have made such an investment."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I have read \\"Paradise Lost\\" four times, and took no less than three semesters on it at university. This was the edition we used to work. Modernised spelling, coherent punctuation (plus variations of it in the notes), good introduction, and enormous work in the notes; this edition has all you need for a good reading of the epic poem.As to the poem itself, some people are hard on it for all the wrong reasons. Remember that it is a 17th century poem, that English was not exactly similar as it is today, and that there are many, many words which were first used in English in \\"Paradise Lost\\". Milton was innovative with words, and he gave English new words, and expressions, such as the most famous \\"all Hell broke loose\\", which was first uttered in \\"Paradise Lost\\".A poem like this cannot be read without good notes, and this is what this edition has to offer. Notes aren't enough, though, they have to be good, and in this edition, they are. The poem itself is not burdened by the numbers of the notes, because there are so many, the editor decided not to show them in the text per se, but at the end of the book, you will always have the reference, the lines, which the notes are about.As to the poem itself, if you don't know it, you certainly know of the story of the Fall of Man, Adam and Eve, and the rebellion of Satan in Heaven. I'll only say that Milton's God is one seriously problematic figure in the poem, and that it caused centuries of academic discussion as to whether Milton's God is a good God or a devilish one, whether \\"Paradise Lost\\" was truly a \\"myth\\", in the old sense of a story which explains why we're here and how it got to be, or whether it was an attack on Christianity. Scholars still discuss this today, so make your own mind if you can!"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I love Norton Critical Editions. Or I try to. Gordon Teskey's new edition of Paradise Lost is for the most part worthy of the praise it has received in other reviews on this site. However, it has one unpardonable flaw, which is the editor's tampering with Milton's poetic line. Teskey and the Norton editors have for some reason decided to make it \\"easy to read\\" by adding parentheses to complex syntactical passages that Milton wrote on purpose to be. . . I dunno. . . hard? This move to simplify the syntax alters not only the experience of the poem but, worse, its meaning. Take for example these famous lines of Satan's from Book I, the first words spoken in Hell:If thou beest he but O how fall'n! how changedFrom him who in the happy realms of lightClothed with transcendent brightness didst outshineMyriads, thought bright! if he whom mutual league,United thoughts and counsels, equal hope. . .The meaning of the lines is confusing because Satan himself is confused, and now speaking for the first time a fallen language. The \\"he\\" from line one gets dropped until line four, when Satan remembers what he's talking about after wandering through a few memories of his life before the fall. The reader is supposed to feel the confusion and torment of this run-on sentence. But Teskey uses parentheses to clean up the very mess Milton wanted Satan to make of the sentence:If thou beest he (but O how fallen! how changedFrom him who in the happy realms of lightClothed with transcendent brightness didst outshineMyriads, though bright) if he whom. . .This effectively dumbs down the poem and drastically changes it. And there is way too much of it in this edition. It is common enough to modernize spelling and syntax in editions of early modern poetry, but this is a bit too much. Readers don't buy this book because they want an easy read; most readers, even students, don't mind if it is a little hard and confusing in parts. Mostly, I bet they want to see what Milton and not his editors wrote."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"When John Milton set out to write Paradise Lost, he had every intention of writing a masterpiece of the English language. He felt he was destined for greatness, and his creation does not disappoint. With over 9000 lines of some of the greatest poetry every written, Milton does an incredible job of using classical and biblical allusions within a classical format to create a surprisingly modern and incredibly poignant look at the nature of God and man. Add on to this the fact that he was blind when he composed it, and you cannot call PL anything less than a work of genius.What separates this version from all the others available? The incredibly detailed work of the editors. The annotations of this edition are absolutely fantastic. They are plentiful (sometimes taking up as much as half a page), extremely informative, and surprisingly fun to read. Most annotated works such as this merely clarify antiquated vocabulary, but in this case the editors point out classical allusions, references to current events, and references to Milton's prose works. In addition to the prose and poetry associated with the text, the editors routinely mention the critical discourse (of which there is an unholy amount) associated with Milton. There are even moments where I laughed out loud at their comments. There is also a subtle touch to the annotations, in that there is no indication of annotations within the line. What I mean by this is that there are no bubbles or footnote marks in the body of the poem. The annotations at the bottom of the page simply point to a line number. This allows the reader to ignore the annotations if they choose to do so.Another nice characteristic of this edition is the artwork and illustrations included. There's some really fantastic stuff in there.All in all, this is an excellent edition of an excellent poem."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I have other editions of Paradise Lost, many with lengthy and preachy introductions, but this one has become my favourite. The design is beautiful, with a great cover, blood red inside covers and red ribbon marker.

Even if you studied Paradise in depth, his comments may shed new light on this classic work. As he reminds the readers, these are his views as a fan rather than a scholar, and he tries to clear some cobwebs that gathered on Milton's opus and bring it closer into focus for the modern readers. Among his references are Alfred Hitchcock's movies and novels of Frederick Forsyth. And he tackles that age old dilema- if he is so evil, why do we find Lucifer so damn likeable...?If you want to read Paradise Lost for the first time, possibly after/before devouring Pullman's own Dark Materials trilogy, look no further than this beautiful edition.

Unfortunately there are not many &quot;bad&quot; editions of Milton's poetry, so the decision requires effort, and every editor has their own interpretation (which is more or less valid than others') of their author. (Indeed, editors are always like secondary authors.) First a few quick words about NCEs. All have bigraphical, historical, literary backgrounds, and criticism that are outside the text (in this case _PL_) and are useful, or at the least interesting. But I do not advocate the NCE edition of _PL_ for these reasons though they are rewarding. Rather I encourage those who are interested in Milton, _PL_, and poetry to get a copy of the NCE because of its editor's philosophy on footnotes. The footnotes are what separate one edition of poetry from another, and Scott Elledge's footnotes to _PL_ were made with the following prescription: &quot;No one, I think, should interrupt his or her first reading of a poem, or a substantial part of it, by looking to the bottom of the page for help. The best way to read is to listen to the poet , the way one listens to someone speaking; then if one is attracted to what one hears, or is curious about it, one can go back over the poem, or a passage in it, consulting the notes. In my opinion one should read a poem before one begins to study it&quot; (2).

When I found out that Gordon Teskey, to my mind the great poet's strongest reader in many years, had edited a new Norton Critical Edition, I knew it was time to travel the path again. As his predecessor Scott Elledge did for a previous generation, Professor Teskey has created an edition and charted a reading experience of enormous richness for contemporary students and general readers alike, and forged a tool of unique value for teachers at all levels. The text is well edited, as it must be, with helpful but judicious modernization of some spelling. The footnotes are measured, thorough but never gratuitously scholastic, to serve the process of active reading. This is not an easy poem and no editor can change that, but one travels through it faster, though steady at speed, with Professor Teskey at one's side. The critical apparatus is also strikingly well done, with modern essays usefully divided by topics, such as 'On Satan' and 'On Feminism', in a manner that will serve all audiences well. Along with retaining essays by past titans of Milton criticism, from Marvell to T.S. Eliot, as well as much of the canonical modern criticism present in earlier Norton editions, this volume includes some of the best critical voices of the last twenty years, among them William Flesch, Regina Schwartz, Archie Burnett, Julia Walker and Mary Ann Radzinowicz. But these new contributions have been chosen, it seems to me, with a very judicious focus on their own lasting canonical value, rather than merely on their more recent dates of publication. Whether out of deference or editorial privilege, Professor Teskey saves the last word for himself in a short selection from an essay that has since become a chapter in his new book, \\"Delirious Milton\\" (Harvard, 2006), in which he charts a history of philosophical modernity through an inspired analysis of Milton's view of creation, divine and human. Whether you are coming to \\"Paradise Lost\\" for the first or the twentieth time, make this edition your primary text and make Professor Teskey's new study the next book you read.

Those who have had to plod our way through the excruciating Middle English of the Canterbury Tales, the old English of Beowulf, or the now obscure references of the Roman propagandist's Aeneid are rightfully wary of yet another long tale set to verse.However, I implore the fence sitter to put aside their prejudices and read this book. Unlike all the other famous epic poems, John Milton writes in modern English. Not only that, his writing is absolutely beautiful and enthralling, even for a modern reader. In addition, unlike other epic poems that may have turned off the reader to this art form, John Milton's subject material is approachable and understandable to the modern reader without having to read other books or notes to inform as to the plot of the story. Why is this so? The Aeneid, the Odyssey, and Dante's inferno were written for different times and audiences. The normal reader cannot approach the first two without substantial background reading in Greek and Roman history (and religion). The inferno spends have its time describing the tortures of Dante's enemies (who you don't know of or care about). John Milton, on the other hand, is writing about the Book of Genesis, a story that most in our culture are well versed in. You'll know the main characters (if not all the minor ones), which will give a grounding for Milton's expansion of the story. Aside for the story itself, Milton's philosophical themes are also more modern than any other famous epic poem. Individuality, disobedience, love, redemption, all of these are common themes that Milton expounds upon. You won't spend many pages concerned with the social structure of a vanished civilization.To conclude, Paradise Lost is a work of Genius. This book is important for overall literacy (just think of all the books that have taken titles and inspiration from its lines). That usually means that the book will be a pill, but not in this case.

And it is one of the most amazing works to have gotten through. Book Nine: Satan makes yet another soliloquy (avengers are, in the end, alone). He reflects on his fall, and sees that Eden is better than Heaven, for what omnipotent creator would make a lesser creation? (Milton loved the pastoral ideal: i.e. farmers/ nature, as per Greek Elysium) And Satan laments that he will not (not cannot) stay in Eden or go back to Heaven unless as a conquerer; he laments that he is to destroy Man, whom he admires, and Earth, which he loves, in order to strike at the God who slighted him (he created/appointed his Son as King in Heavan, and Lucifer had previously been #2) and damned him. He reflects on the fact that his former, huge, mighty state must enter the beastial snake, but accepts it as necissary. It's a soloquy that rivals, if not surpasses, the &quot;better to reign...&quot; one. Definitely read this, but it is best read when accompanied by critique/observations from another: it'll really draw out the story, the author, and the subtlties: such as the ideas of IDEAL gender roles."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"What can one say about Paradise Lost?

Never was there a more tantalizing personification of Evil. Yes, he was appealing.

It's imagery, based itself upon 1500 years of previous Christian-cultural imagery, has shaped how the Western world views Christianity, sin, the fall, life, death, heaven, and hell.The open-minded non-Christian reader would do well to read \\"Paradise Lost\\" to become a literate student of Christian imagery. The Christian, willing to work through the descriptive poetry, will gain new insight into Creation, Fall, and Redemption. In many ways, Milton bridges eras (the Middle Ages and the Reformation), cultures (Southern Europe and Northern), and religious groups (Catholic and Protestant).It's interesting how much \\"folk theology\\" owes itself to Milton's \\"Paradise Lost.\\" Modern views of the Devil, in particular, are often unknowingly based upon the poetic images from Milton. Fortunately, Milton is at his best in describing Satan, first as the unfallen Lucifer with all his glorious, God-created brilliance, and then as the fallen False Seducer in all his distorted and tormenting deceit.For example, Milton speaks of how revenge, dark requital, propelled Satan's monstrous motives:To waste his whole Creation, or possess all as our own, and drive as we were driven, the puny habitants, or if not drive, seduce them to our Party, that their God may prove their foe, and with repenting hand abolish his own works. This would surpass common revenge, and interrupt his joy in our confusion and our joy upraise in his disturbance; when his darling Sons hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse their frail Original, and faded bliss, faded so soon (Milton, Paradise Lost, p. 40).Surpassing common revenge, Satan lives to spite the Author of life.By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence, but from the Author of all ill could spring so deep a malice, to confound the race of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell to mingle and involve, done all to spite the great Creator? (Milton, Paradise Lost, p. 41).Milton's depiction of the temptation in the Garden displays psychological brilliance and biblical insight into the nature of the human personality as designed by God and depraved by sin. Perhaps only C. S. Lewis' \\"Screwtape Letters\\" matches Milton's understanding of Satanic seduction.For instance, so whose fault their fall? Milton, imagining God's words to Christ, declares:For man will hearken to his glozing lies, and easily transgress the sole Command, sole pledge of his obedience. So will fall he and his faithless Progeny. Whose fault? Whose but his own? Ingrate, he had of me all he could have; I made him just and right, sufficient to have stood, though free to fall (Milton, Paradise Lost, p. 63).Well put. Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. Made just and right and able to choose. Adam and Eve had all they could have from the generous hand of God, yet they transgressed the sole command, the sole pledge of loving, trustful obedience. Loving allegiance they chose to grant to non-god rather than to Father God.Whatever could possess them to trade their birthright for one bite of the one forbidden fruit? When we last spied earth's Villain, he was tumbling toward hell. Having lost the battle for heaven, his hostility and hate triggers a new plan. Why a second siege on heaven's gates, when earth's shores suggest easier prey? As Milton envisioned it:Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need with dangerous expedition to invade Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, or ambush from the Deep. What if we find some easier enterprise? There is a place (if ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven err not), another World, the happy seat of some new Race called Man, about this time to be created like to us, though less in power and excellence, but favored more of him who rules above. So was his will pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath, that shook Heaven's whole circumference, confirmed (Milton, Paradise Lost, pp. 39-40).Readers also could benefit from his less known work, \\"Paradise Regained.\\" Many have mentioned how difficult it is to write a riveting book about Heaven since the drama of evil is defeated and thus the tension is deflated. Yet Milton captures one possible vision of a future Paradise/Heaven as well as most. (Randy Alcorn's book \\"Heaven\\" is, in my opinion, the best modern book on the topic)."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"The book was entertaining and hard to put down.

He doesn't synthesize as much as he subsumes entire civilizations worth of symbols, motifs and allegories into his own extended riff on the first four books of genesis. He throws together images from greco-roman antiquity, paganism, medieval European mysticism, etc, and churns out this impossibly rich, chthonic view of the divine world that only Dante could keep up with. And unlike Dante, this just hammers you into the ground on each page with sensory and historical overload. Whether you like it or not, it's hard not to acknowledge just how exhaustively ambitious Milton was. And hey, the man can write a really good villain, or anti-hero, or whatever Satan is supposed to be"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"This is a dense, imaginative book, an only-book-to-take-with-me-on-a-deserted-island kind of book. Although the story is mainly based on Christian mythology, it is just as appealing for atheists because Milton mixes Christian and classical mythology and thereby shows the roots of Western culture. It is no wonder that William Blake was so inspired to draw his fantastic art fitting this text. The book's extreme patriarchal views, bearing on repugnant misogyny in some places, will disturb some readers. This issue has nothing to do with the aesthetics of the book, but modern readers would have difficulty ignoring it.Readers are advised to find an edition with detailed and directly adjacent annotations in order to appreciate what Milton is up to in each word, line and book (chapter). There is much below the surface. And yet at times one should just read on and let the art wash over in waves. This is a good way to take on Milton's torturously contorted sentences or to deal with some of the ancient-sounding names that Milton made up for effect. Knowing Milton's biography also helps: the story is also about his frustration with the English who gave up much of their hard-earned liberty after the English Civil War. The circumstances under which Milton created his classic epic were dramatic: after having led a colourful life and helping to lead the English Republic, he was a poor, blind pariah who dictated his prose. Homer is also thought to have transmitted his epic orally.The following paragraph is a citation from Northrop Frye in the edition that he introduces (Rinehart Editions, 1951): Most Renaissance critics regarded the epic as a greater form than tragedy: this fact is to be connected with the humanist sense ... of the encyclopaedic range of knowledge to be derived from the study of the classics. For the difference between an epic and an ordinary narrative poem lies chiefly in the encyclopaedic quality of the epic. The epics of Homer, Virgil, Dante and Milton are vast syntheses of the religious, philosophical, political and even scientific ideas: they integrate not only the poet's own thinking but the whole culture of their times. An epic of this sort can only be written in an age which possesses some kind of encyclopaedic vision. For Milton, the humanist synthesis of knowledge was in its turn contained within Christianity. The Bible, as Milton saw it, transcends all secular knowledge, but comprehends it too, and it is also encyclopaedic, though on a far bigger scale. ... Traditionally, too, the theme of the epic is heroic action, and all the conventional features that Milton takes over from the Classical epic--the similes, the battles, the set speeches, the invocation to Muses, the councils of gods and leaders--are concerned essentially with this theme.For Milton, Christ is the hero of this epic, despite Milton's wooden portrayal of him. Satan is only a mock-hero, but is more interesting. Harold Bloom perceives Milton's Satan as comparable to and inspired by Shakespeare's great baddies. Frye writes: \\"Satan is the haughty Achilles, the crafty Ulysses, the knight-errant who achieves the perilous quest of chaos, and all through the first four books he is surrounded with the rumors and the panoply of war.\\" Because his heroism is based on pride, Satan is doomed \\"and merely by the compulsion of obeying his own nature, is forced to become more and more debased. By the time he has got himself disguised as a talking snake and is congratulating himself on catching Eve alone with the man of the house away, the sombre Promethean rebel of the opening books seems remote.\\" But for Milton, Christianity is deadly serious, so Satan is never comical but a constant threat to man.Paradise Lost resonates, deep and wide. As literature it could conceivably have been effective even if it had been based on a mythology other than that of Christianity, but for readers sharing Milton's Western culture, another mythology is unlikely to have achieved such deep resonance. There is no doubt that the Bible's short creation story was extended with much fantasy and mythologized in popular perception by the medieval Church, but on reading this book one wonders to what degree the popular story was further extended and mythologized by just one individual, John Milton. Furthermore, Milton was perhaps the top creator of English neologisms (over 600, much more than Shakespeare). For a thoughtful analysis of how deeply the \\"Edenic narrative\\" has effected us, see William Cronon's anthology \\"Uncommon Ground\\"."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"When presented with a choice between a free and a cheap ($2) Kindle edition, I usually go with the cheap edition. But here, there was also a \\"moderate\\" priced Kindle edition, with a critical introduction. I chose the third, not for the benefit of the introductory essay or even for the pictures, although both were welcome. I picked this one because it had both hard copy page number and the line counter. There is nothing worse than having someone give you a reference by line number, and you can't find it, because your edition left off the lines. Of course, you can usually find the reference by searching, but for really common words, like \\"Satan\\", for example, that can be tedious. The only improvement I can imagine would be if this were an annotated edition, which it is not. But since it is in English, the main questions are to what events of the day may Milton be referring.

I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Synopsis:Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" explores the fall of man in a semi-epic fashion chronicling the fall of the archangels, creation, Lucifer's deception of man, the original sin and man's expulsion from the Garden.The Objective:It has been said that Milton wrote this semi-epic poem in the desire to explain the ways of God to man. This poem does Jehovah and his drones more injustice than it justifies. Actually, by my perception, Milton displays the naivet&eacute; and gullibility of man's mind. As I read this book I could not help but to lament, with a hint of comedic relief, for society knowing that in 2010 people still ardently believe all of this actually occurred, or at least as the Bible foretells it. Which to be honest with you, Milton's version has no more factual quality than the Bible itself, as pertaining to mythological and paranormal activity, not in relation to the historically relevant parts. Nonetheless, Milton decided to venture into an abyss with naivet&eacute; himself if he thought he would be able to eloquently portray a sound omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient deity while simultaneously retaining a perceptual benevolence, magnanimity and shrewdness in the same character. Here, in this regard, neither Milton nor the author's of the Bible afford success. One of the myriad of problems is that personifying one deity as having all of the above qualities is just oxymoronic. Milton himself knew this, which is why he had to utilize the Son as a metaphoric supplement of the last three qualities to keep the other elevated on its stilts. It is difficult to fuse together the perspectives of two distinct cultural and temporal perspectives of God-in references to the Old Testament and the New Testament- these cannot be interwoven as one; there is just not continuity of character there. Personally, a more accurate representation of a sound omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient deity is manifested in the character Dr. Manhattan from the modern Alan Moore epic \\"Watchmen.\\" I wonder if this character is the epitome of what man will become as a result of our consumption the forbidden fruit?!Just as his counterparts of past and present, Milton attempts to demonize Paganism and has an overt chauvinistic sexism. The interesting quality that I have always found about Christianity, the organized religion not the Christ himself, is that it adopted Pagan customs to convert Pagans, obviously for a larger control over the European population, and ironically demonized it afterwards. Not to mention, Paganism has a very strong emphasis of goddess worship in most of its constituent cultures, but in Judeo-Christian literature the woman is subordinate and inferior, along with these qualities women are further subjected to ridicule and subjugation for committing the \\"original sin.\\"Milton makes it obvious that man can only continue to worship God in ignorance. Once man has bitten of the fruit of Knowledge his perspective changes and an indefinite INDIVIDUAL pursuit of that Essence begins. Actually, this whole \\"interdicted knowledge\\" was more than likely contrived by the powers-that-be rather than the power-that-is. Ignorance was a sure tool for suppressing a population into obedience, submission and guilt, and who were the mediators of those illiterate times? Priests, subordinate to the kings, and in later culture, kings and lords. The whole system was oriented to serfdom, vassalage, submission and control. Why do you think the Protestants presented so much of a stir in the seventeenth century? Milton says it best, \\"[Interdicted] with design / To keep them low, whom knowledge [will] exalt / Equal with [priests and kings]\\" (IV 525-527), slightly out of context but it fits the accusation.As a work of literature Milton did an excellent job conveying vivid imagery in a poetic style, but he corroded it by bloating the book at times with Botoxic irrelevant allusions and descriptions.Before anyone reads this particular print, which is the only one I recommend, particularly due to Gustave Dore's prolific drawings, they should make sure they have an extensive vocabulary as well as some historic reference for the time periods relating to Milton and the Bible. To me this availed my understanding and enjoyment of the book without the inhibitions of footnotes and translations, these only detract from the quality of the story.The Subjective:I have to commend Milton for his efforts, especially considering his condition at the time he wrote this. This work is very admirable regardless of your particular intellectual or spiritual bias. It is a work of art and I feel that we are indeed better off in the arts for having such fictional literature influenced by our most prominent mythology. While I would not compare this to Dante's \\"Inferno,\\" Milton gave us his best effort and for anyone who renders art and literature from their consciousness for all of us to share should be honored and revered, as opposed to solely giving the world physical labor and dying with no other contribution.Lastly, I cannot help but to wonder if the mythological Tree of Knowledge was a psychoactive plant of some sort which we have a symbiotic relationship with. Could this be the catalyst that removed us from the animal kingdom into eventual progression into advanced civilization? Is this story an allegory of that? Milton's rendition seems to point to this from his affinity with the collective unconscious:\\"O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving plant, / Mother of [thought]! Now I feel thy power / Within me clear; not only to discern / Things in their causes, but to trace the ways / Of highest agents, deemed however wise /...[You give us] life / To knowledge [, chaos, creativity and Novelty] (IX 279-287). Not death, but life / Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys, / Taste so divine, that what of sweet before / Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh (IX 984-987). [A]nd shook sore / [Our] inward state of mind, calm region once, / And full of peace, now tossed and turbulent [, but oh how divine] (IX 1125-1126).\\"With a few insertions to sway the context, which has minimal influence to its overall meaning, anyone who has ever had a psychedelic experience sees how ostensible this concoction of words describes the nature of that psychological event. - D.R.Thomas"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Historical significance and beautifully descriptive prose aside, I couldn't get into this book at all.

I can see why Milton's attempt to enlighten his audience as to the events leading up to the fall of man were important and relevant at the time that it was written and can see the significance of his writing on the literature of today, I just did not find Paradise Lost to be personally satisfying or enjoyable.That being said, there are some passages throughout the text that are extremely rich, beautiful and powerful examples of what the English language can be in the hands of a master author.

Sing to me, Muse, of the rage of Tucker, like that of Peleus's son Achilles, of spirited Turnus, or of earth-shaking Neptune, who, upon reading the gaseous opinions of the Arian heretic proto-Mormon poet who does reject the triune God, embrace notions strange of divine progression, draw corporeal spirits bizarre, misunderstand reason's nature and her relation to Faith, hold to a doctrine of imputed righteousness and forensic justification unregenerate, understand perversely law and authority, proudly dismiss hierarchy natural, deny creation ex nihilo, and rebel against the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, did fervently hope for an exhumation of his remains heretical followed by an auto-da-fe.But if you must read it, tackle Books I and II, then jump to the end of Book IV where Satan is captured in paradise, then jump to the middle of Book V where Raphael begins to relate the war in Heaven which continues through Book VII, then maybe read about the Fall in Book IX. This is where all the good stuff is; although mixed with much bad, so be wary lest you be overcome by Milton's bad air and worse theology. Odors to which only the damned should be subject.On the other hand, any guy who posits a Ptolemaic universe (at least in his prelapsarian astronomy) can't be all bad.

For that recommendation I am grateful due to the pleasure that I have received from it. I enjoyed the audio book rather than the printed version, and as one who listens to hundreds of audio books, I can say that this production through the talent of Anton Lesser, produces dramatic results.The book, this epic poem, is so beautifully written that it would be a pleasure to read, or listen to, even if the actual content was in some way lacking. But, the content is anything but lacking. For me, Milton points out that God is vengeful, jealous, and ego-driven, almost as though he were human. What father would pronounce the death sentence on his child for eating fruit from a tree (albeit \\"forbidden fruit\\")? What father would banish their child from Eden for that same offense? None that I know. Milton shows the God of the Genesis to be harsh and cruel while staying true to scripture.If you are looking for a book that is beautiful to read, and thought-provoking to ponder, then look no further.Best wishes, Kevin"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Very hard to read if you are non English speaking man.

First published in 1667, Paradise Lost remains, many contend, the greatest poem ever published in English, and Milton is deemed second only to Shakespeare among the pantheon of English writers.

Happily, this Norton Critical Edition includes hundreds of notes--footnotes, so there is no disruptive flipping back and forth! This edition also offers dozens of critical essays on Paradise Lost, some dating back to its publication, a couple of Milton's prose works and an extensive glossary.

The characterization of Lucifer is unlike any I've ever read, and the most powerful passage in the story is Lucifer addressing the legions of hell, ordering them to do whatever they can to thwart God, while tears of sadness at the loss of heaven stream down his face. Milton played with both typical and atypical views of sin and damnation and created something so timeless that lots of us don't know he imagined it.In any discussion of religion, I wouldn't leave home without it."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Justly placed at the head of the canon of Western literature behind Shakespeare and Dante by Harold Bloom, Milton stands as a towering creative genius in English literature and epic poetry.Milton conceived of his vast epic as a way to justify the 'ways of God to man.' Strangely, the character of Satan is absolutely central to this epic more so even than Adam and the rest of humanity, and often one can't help comparing Satan and his journeys and battles against misfortune as akin to those of other great literary heroes, such as Prometheus, Odysseus or Aeneas. I feel in a way the message of Milton is more than just good Protestant Christian apologetics; if you read his passionate and brilliant defense of freedom of the press and of thought in works like Aeropagitica, I am sure Milton in a way showed the power of free choice and what heights it allows any being to soar to, even those who are damned. I always get a sense from reading Milton a great trust in the human spirit and an expectation to rise against tyranny.While ultimately I feel Milton does not really justify the 'ways of God to man' in an intellectually satisfying way, and his vision lacks the brilliant unity of that of Dante, Milton is certainly a poet and genius of first order and probably the greatest writer in English after Shakespeare. His poetry contains great depth and beauty, not just the Paradise Epics but many other poems as well, and his learning and erudition are immense.In Milton there is a great confidence in human reason and in the individual to prevail in the face of disaster and hardship. One can't help but admire Satan's stubborness and determination in the face of so much which goes against him, and his incredible efforts to achieve his goals. If you ever wanted an example of 'self-help' look no further than the devil in Milton; despite the most hopeless situations he never gives up. Perhaps conciously or unconciously Milton embodies in Satan and also in Samson our own present confidence in our creative abilities and our determination and intelligence to overcome any obstacles in our way, and perhaps in a world as turbulent as ours, that isn't such a bad hope to have after all."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"My Kindle version lacks an introduction and any footnotes or endnotes.

Where in the poem did it say Satan's hair is made out of snakes? or that he has horns that look like elbow macaroni?

Each book in the poem is preceded by Milton's argument, which provides a plot summary of that particular book. To really understand Milton, the dedicated scholar must go above, underneath, around, through and most importantly, beyond the plot. Through this poem, Milton poses alarming questions regarding the nature of God and Satan, Heaven and Hell, Good and Evil. Satan is the hero of the work. By this I do not mean to say that Satan is a hero, but simply that he was the antagonist of this tale, in the same way that Oedipus was the antogonist of his. This is a profound work that will question every belief that the Christian and Jewish faithful hold to be true. It is only through this constant questioning that we are able to find our true faith. If you find that this poem causes you to lose faith in God, you didn't have true faith in the first place. Those who are believers of God will find that questioning their faith will only serve to strengthen it."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"This is easily some of the best prose ever recorded. The stories related are Milton's interpretation of the war of the heavens, and man's expulsion from paradise, on earth. The words dance and sing above the pages, forming phrases that when spoken aloud are akin to your tongue parting your lover's lips for the first time after a lengthy courtship. This demands to be read, re-read-----studied, digested, and especially to be read aloud, for phonetically the lyricism expands dramatically, collapsing to a honed edge, then cuts to the very marrow of your being. It is not necessary to believe in the Judeo-Christian faith to be floored by this book, it kicks English up to the realm of the Romance Languages, pick it up today."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"This is a highly recommended book by practically everyone who has read it.

Perhaps this isn't my ideal genre.I will say that those who created this book did their homework, and made a great attempt to help the reader understand its content.

We're talking about the famous 17th-century English poet who wrote _Paradise Lost_ and _Paradise Regained_, two of the most wonderfully overlong Christian poems in the history of Western literature.Your English teacher will tell you that _Paradise Lost_ \\"narrates the story of Adam and Eve's disobedience, explains how and why it happened, and places the story within the larger context of Satan's rebellion and Jesus' resurrection.\\" And you know that can't be far wrong, because SparkNotes says the exact same thing.But the main reason everyone should read Milton's grand epic is that it contains certain secrets about prayer.In PL, Milton reminds us how important it is, when we pray, to be absolutely specific. The Lord has a strange, often disturbing, sense of humour (PL, books I-XII). If you leave Him wiggle room, He will answer your prayer in a way you never intended, and then say it was your own damned fault, because your prayer contained seven types of ambiguity.John Milton writes from experience. Example: Almost every time a good-looking woman passed within view of John Milton, he suffered an involuntary erection. Daniel of the Old Testament might well have suffered such a condition without complaining, but John Milton found it onerous. John was both a Puritan and a student of Saint Augustine. He was not happy when he suffered an erection, he hated it, and he especially resented the women who made that thing happen to him.In a Latin letter to his friend, George Wither, John Milton reports that, in his youth, he would sometimes see a pretty woman even in his dreams at night, and suffer, not just an erection, but the whole nine yards, up to and including a nocturnal emission; which he trained himself to handle according to Scripture, thereby to purify himself (Deut. 23:10); but sometimes he was unable to wait that long before he handled it, which filled his soul full of Puritan remorse and self-reproach.At age 33, the poet took to wife a 16-year-old lolita named Mary Powell; and you may already have guessed the reason why, which is that she gave him an erection -- more accurately, she gave him \\"one damned erection after another,\\" without remission. (Giving John Milton an erection was not the girl's conscious intent, but it just happened to him, every time they met.) And since Christian marriage is Saint Paul's only approved method whereby to deal with that kind of torment, John Milton (being an honourable man) thought it best to marry the girl (1 Cor. 7:9).Frailty, thy name is woman! After two years of marriage - after just two years of witnessing those insufferable erections that could not be beaten down, or at least, not for long - the poet's young Puritan bride ran away and skipped back home to live with her mother, Mrs. Anne Powell, who likewise gave John an erection; which is why John Milton resented his mother-in-law as well as his estranged wife.Those were the hardest years of the poet's life - nothing but a daily struggle against involuntary erections, yet here he was, trapped in a loveless marriage to a barely pubescent teenager who lived with her entirely-too-attractive mother. Which is partly why John Milton wrote those four revolutionary Christian pamphlets, correcting Moses' and Jesus' hardline policy on divorce (Mark 10:11-12).In his Latin correspondence, some of which is preserved in the Bodleian Library, John Milton reports that he was fine when alone in his study, or when hobnobbing with Parliamentarians, or even when having a hasty pudding, or a figgy one, over at the Inns of Court; but let just one good-looker cross his path, showing good ankle between the hem of her dress and the top of her shoe, and it was boing! - instant erection, just like a spring-loaded mechanical device; causing John to exclaim bitterly, \\"Oh, God, please, not again! Save me from this penal fire!\\"It even happened to him once when Oliver Cromwell's wife, Elizabeth Bourchier Cromwell, bent over to pick up a handkerchief that had fallen to the floor. On that occasion there was a lamentable accident (\\"an hard mishap\\" [verbatim quote]) with John's ordinarily modest codpiece - an incident so humiliating that John never even wrote a poem about it, although he did apologise, profusely, to Oliver Cromwell, and to Mrs. Cromwell, who saw the whole thing, and then fainted. (John at the time was employed as Cromwell's Latin secretary.)By the way: It was modesty, not arrogance, that moved John Milton, after that embarrassing incident, to wear a baggy codpiece, with plenty of wiggle room.Which brings me back to the beginning, when I was explaining why you should give the Lord no wiggle room when you pray: John Milton took his problem to the Lord in prayer, stating in his journal, \\"Father, I pray Thee, let me not suffer a stiffe joynt when I see a beautifull woman.\\"And here's how the Lord answered that prayer, in 1651: He struck John Milton blind.At first, John thought that his blindness was a punishment for his own bad behaviour - which is how that whole thing got going, in Anglo-American Christianity, about how, if you are a boy who does what John Milton used to do, it could make you go blind. But God revealed to John, by means of a dream, that his blindness was actually an answer to his own prayers - because the poet had said, \\"Father, let me not suffer a stiff joint when I see a beautiful woman.\\"John Milton then said, \\"Lord, that is not what I meant, at all\\" - but it was too late to change the outcome, because the prayer was already answered.The erections that John Milton suffered in the years 1651-1674, and there were many, even after the Lord answered his prayer, were not from seeing a beautiful woman, it was actually because John had a condition that modern physicians call PSAS (\\"Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome\\"). So the chronic \\"stiffe joynt\\" problem was not really the women's fault, and it never was; but John Milton never knew that. Even when he wrote Paradise Lost (by dictation, from 1652-1667), John was still under the impression that women, seen or unseen, were to blame for his condition; which is why he makes all of those snide remarks in blank verse about your mother, Eve, in Books IV-V and IX-X of Paradise Lost. Because whenever he pictured Eve in his mind's eye, it was boing! - the same old problem. And there would come no more blank verse to his head for the next twenty minutes or so, until things settled down. John Milton hated that.But it all turned out for the best: if God had not answered John Milton's prayer in that unusual way, by blinding him, Paradise Lost might never have been completed, and sold to the publisher, Sam Simmons, in 1667, for 5 - which was a tidy sum for a religious poem during the decadent Restoration era.It was while writing the early books of Paradise Lost that John was introduced to Katherine, a ship captain's daughter, a fat woman whom he had never seen (because he was blind); whom he nonetheless married in 1656, but not for the same old reason as before: John asked fat Kate to marry him (a.) because he needed secretarial assistance with Paradise Lost, and (b.) because Katherine did not have the same pernicious effect on him as Mary Powell and her mother Anne had done. John could dictate blank verse to Kate all night long without feeling so much as a tingle down there.Kate's surname was Woodcock. Beelzebub made a little joke about that: he said, \\"The Lord finally gave John Milton just what he always wanted.\\"- L."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I took a course on /Paradise Lost/ this past semester.

I'm really satisfied with this purchase."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Milton is hard to read. There's no way around it. He was incredibly well versed in Latin and Greek and the famous epics, and intentionally set out to imitate that style with this Christian poem. Thus, some of the sentences are close to thirty lines or more, and are almost unintelligible at first. I am a Latin scholar, so I am used to seeing this kind of writing, but Paradise Lost could be challenging to the uninitiated. That being said, it is definitely worth the effort. Milton set out not just to tell the story of the Fall of Man but also to \\"justify the ways of God to men.\\" It is frequently remarked that God is a secondary character and Satan is the most well-developed. I think this may be the same technique used by Dante to draw in the reader and have them commit the same sin as the characters. And this is what is most enjoyable about Milton: trying to unravel the many layers.If you are a Christian, this book may ask some interesting questions. Milton was definitely pious, but he did have some interesting personal beliefs that may or may not have agreed with doctrine at the time.If you are just a fan of the classics and great literature, I'm sure you will find Paradise Lost to be among the best poems in history, and certainly the best in English.Finally, the Norton Critical Edition is superior in that it contains about 300 pages of criticisms and background information, all of which aid to one's understanding and enjoyment of the poem."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"With its fine binding, large type, and beautiful paper, this large addition of Milton's Paradise Lost will make a handsome addition to any shelf. Some will say that it is not well suited for the first time reader, lacking the line notes of other annotated additions. I would beg to differ, as such commentary, while deepening ones understanding, can also detract from the majesty of Milton's words. Yes, it is true that the laymen will miss many or even most of the references woven into this, perhaps after Shakespeare's work the greatest piece of literature ever produced in English. However, once captivated by the poetry, readers can always go back and peruse thicker, commentary laced edition. First and foremost, one must dive into the language of Milton, before attempting to wring every drop of meaning from that pool's heady wine.A note, of course, must also be given to the extraordinary illustrations of Gustave Dore included in this volume. Dore's vision, especially the inexorable dissent of Satan from angelic beauty to demonic ugliness can only add to the readers' joy. At less than $20, one cannot go wrong in acquiring this very fine edition."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruitOf that forbidden tree whose mortal tasteBrought death into the world and all our woe,With loss of Eden, till on greater ManRestore us and regain the blissful seatSing, Heavenly Muse...Not a lot people know that 'Paradise Lost' has as a much lesser known companion piece 'Paradise Regained'; of course, it was true during Milton's time as it is today that the more harrowing and juicy the story, the better it will likely be remembered and received.This is not to cast any aspersion on this great poem, however. It has been called, with some justification, the greatest English epic poem. The line above, the first lines of the first book of the poem, is typical of the style throughout the epic, in vocabulary and syntax, in allusiveness. The word order tends toward the Latinate, with the object coming first and the verb coming after.Milton follows many classical examples by personifying characters such as Death, Chaos, Mammon, and Sin. These characters interact with the more traditional Christian characters of Adam, Eve, Satan, various angels, and God. He takes as his basis the basic biblical text of the creation and fall of humanity (thus, 'Paradise Lost'), which has taken such hold in the English-speaking world that many images have attained in the popular mind an almost biblical truth to them (in much the same way that popular images of Hell owe much to Dante's Inferno). The text of Genesis was very much in vogue in the mid-1600s (much as it is today) and Paradise Lost attained an almost instant acclaim.John Milton was an English cleric, a protestant who nonetheless had a great affinity for catholic Italy, and this duality of interests shows in much of his creative writing as well as his religious tracts. Milton was nicknamed 'the divorcer' in his early career for writing a pamphlet that supported various civil liberties, including the right to obtain a civil divorce on the grounds of incompatibility, a very unpopular view for the day. Milton held a diplomatic post under the Commonwealth, and wrote defenses of the governments action, including the right of people to depose and dispose of a bad king.Paradise Lost has a certain oral-epic quality to it, and for good reason. Milton lost his eyesight in 1652, and thus had to dictate the poem to several different assistants. Though influenced heavily by the likes of Virgil, Homer, and Dante, he differentiated himself in style and substance by concentrating on more humanist elements.Say first -- for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,Nor the deep tract of Hell -- say first what causeMoved our grand Parents, in that happy state,Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall offFrom their Creator and transgress his will,For one restraint, lords of the world besides?Milton drops us from the beginning into the midst of the action, for the story is well known already, and proceeds during the course of the books (Milton's original had 10, but the traditional epic had 12 books, so some editions broke books VII and X into two books each) to both push the action forward and to give developing background -- how Satan came to be in Hell, after the war in heaven a description that includes perhaps the currently-most-famous line:Here we may reign secure, and in my choiceTo reign is worth ambition though in hell:Better to reign in hell, that serve in heav'n.(Impress your friends by knowing that this comes from Book I, lines 261-263 of Paradise Lost, rather than a Star Trek episode!)The imagery of warfare and ambition in the angels, God's wisdom and power and wrath, the very human characterisations of Adam and Eve, and the development beyond Eden make a very compelling story, done with such grace of language that makes this a true classic for the ages. The magnificence of creation, the darkness and empty despair of hell, the manipulativeness of evil and the corruptible innocence of humanity all come through as classic themes. The final books of the epic recount a history of humanity, now sinful, as Paradise has been lost, a history in tune with typical Renaissance renderings, which also, in Milton's religious convictions, will lead to the eventual destruction of this world and a new creation.A great work that takes some effort to comprehend, but yields great rewards for those who stay the course."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I made it to the middle of book two before I decided I would go to the library Monday and check this book out.

In short, the annotations, the ancillary texts, and the critical readings are all less helpful thanthe old Norton edition (edited by Scott Elledge). Elledge sometimes could be a bit pedantic, giving too many Latin etymologies and such. But Teskey has simply abandoned the original audience (first-time readers of Paradise Lost). He doesn't gloss such difficulties as \\"ravin,\\" \\"all I,\\" and the odd etymological use of \\"pontifical.\\" He omits such indispensable ancillae as Elledge's 33-page selection from Milton's \\"On Christian Doctrine\\" (and also Doctrine & Discipline of Divorce, and much else). He takes the best critical readings (Lewalski, Fish) and cuts them down to excerpts too tiny to matter much.That really concludes my argument against choosing Teskey. He also commits howlers in Latin, Greek (\\"Greek leukos also means joyful\\"), and English (\\"tradition\\" in X.578 construed as a verb; faulty modernizations like \\"condemn\\" for \\"contemn\\" in IX.306 and \\"shown\\" for \\"shone\\" in X.1096).For a Norton Critical Edition (i.e., the extra primary and secondary texts), choose Elledge; its advantages in learning and help far outweigh any of its defects. Perhaps, though, the most helpful Paradise Lost edition for the target audience (first-time reader, well-annotated) is nowDavid Scott Kastan's generous reworking of Merritt Hughes' edition."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I am not a Milton scholar and my comments need to be understood in that light.Having read the previous Norton Critical Edition (edited by Scott Elledge, (C) 1993;Paradise Lost (Norton Critical Editions)) several years ago, I was looking forward to reading this new one (edited by Gordon Teskey). The new edition is printed on heavier paper, which is nicer to read and less prone to bleed through when I write on it. But to maintain the same size and heft, the newer edition is about 100 pages shorter (587 vs 685). Almost all the critical essays are carried over from one edition to the next. But omitted material includes:A number of Milton's other writings, including 7 sonnets and excerpts from a number of his essays.An essay about the religious and political issues at the time of MiltonA brief biography of MiltonExplanations of Milton's conceptions about the universe, Physiology and Psychology, Reason, the Scale of Nature, Angels, God, Freedom, etc.A more complete set of relevant readings from the Bible (the new one omits the readings from Matthew, Luke, John, Timothy, and James).I found these materials enormously helpful in understanding Milton and Norton's decision to delete them makes the new edition much less useful. I would have preferred, personally, that they delete some of the critical essays about PL, rather than the explanatory materials to help readers get through the book in the first place.Finally, Teskey's notes are not nearly as helpful. About half of them discuss how the syllables of Milton's words should be counted. Here's a comparison of the notes to book one, lines 43-46, in each edition. From Teskey, page 5:44: Pow'r: power, pronounced with one syllable: 'paar.'45: ethereal: has three syllables: 'eth-ear-yal.'46: hideous has two syllables: 'hid-jus.'and so forth. Some of his notes explain odd words, ideas, or allusions to biblical or classical texts. I am certain that his emphasis on explaining Milton's syllabification is important to some readers, but it matters little to me.By comparison, Elledge's notes almost never discuss syllabification. They are full of information explaining the text. From the same set of lines (p. 9):43: Impious. The L word means disrespectful of one's parents or one's country as well as of one's god.44: ethereal: (Gk aithein to ignite, blaze) of the ether, the element supposed to fill the outer regions of the universe; not earth, fire or water, it was not earthly but heavenly, and eternal.46: This image of a meteorite is more distinct in the description of Satan's fall at 745 (\\"like a falling star\\"). hideous: causing dread or horror. ruin (L ruere to fall violently) ruins, rubble; fall destruction. combustion. Cf Combustible. line 233.Elledge's notes are fuller, richer, and far more helpful to me. Knowing what \\"etheral\\" means and how it fits into Milton's cosmology is far more interesting and helpful than knowing that he pronounced it with three syllables.In short, I would encourage folks to look for a copy of Elledge's version of this Norton's Critical edition. I found it far more helpful than Teskey.Perhaps when Norton issues a second edition of Tewsky's work, they will restore some of the missing material; until they do, I will continue to use Elledge."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"It's not too often that one gets to hold a really nice edition of anything.

The advantage of this publication is that not only do you get the poem itself, but you also receive critical essays written on the work by such personages as Scott Elledge (who also edited the book), Voltaire, Viginia Woolfe, John Keats, William Blake, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, Christopher Ricks and Harold Bloom (just to name a few). For the serious student of Milton, the literary criticism that has been written is nearly as important as the poem itself.&quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is the Protestant counterpart to Dante's &quot;Divne Comedy.&quot; That is to say, it is the epic poem of the Protestant tradition just as Dante's work is the great epic poem of the Catholic heritage. Unlike Dante, however, English speaking people do not have to worry about anything getting lost in translation, for Milton wrote in English. Great works written in English were fairly sparse before the time of Shakespeare, and this is one of the few great epic works to be written in English since .What &quot;PL&quot; deals with is the fall of Satan &amp; the subsequent fall of man. Milton attempts to &quot;justify the ways of God to man&quot; as he says in his famous line. Whether he does this or not is a matter of opinion, but what is not in debate is that he wrote an extraordinary piece of literature.Milton uses the famous &quot;free will&quot; defense for evil in the world and gives us a panoramic vision of heaven, hell, the garden of Eden and the entire cosmos. Regardless of whether people accept this position, Milton offers the best example of the free will argument that I have ever read.We also get to meet Satan (Lucifer) and in many ways we get to know him even better than God. It has even been said that Satan is actually the &quot;hero&quot; of the tale even though Satan ultimately loses (sort of like Ahab in Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot;). While this point has come under much scrutiny,what I can say is that Satan is a magnificent fellow. His speeches are generally the most dramatic &amp; powerful and he has the most memorable lines (such as the infamous &quot;It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven&quot;).So, for anyone remotely interested in literature, religion or philosophy, I would HIGHLY recommend this poem. You may just find there some ideas which you have never thought of before.

It's a story most people will be familiar with, and any surprises will involve the beauty of the language or a random, surprising insight into a character's motivation. In the end, Milton deserves to be called the greatest writer in English because of the pure strength and beauty of each individual sentence.This is undoubtedly a difficult book to read. I teach a small bit in a sophomore high school English class, and I tell them, \\"This will be the most complex text you will encounter this year.\\" We have to practice unpacking sentences one at a time and stating them in our own words in order to get their meaning. It's a slow process, and one that most adults will also need to go through.But it's all worth it! Reading Milton might or might not change your view of God and man, but absorbing him will change your love of language. The words are vivid and powerful and beg to be read aloud. If you like your poetry Great in the sense of sounding larger than life and tackling humanity's major questions, Milton is it.

In any case, Teskey's treatment of the punctuation does not correspond at all to the programme he announces here. Far from punctuating lightly, he mutiplies full stops, clogging the progress of the poem, and often cutting Milton's sentences into bleeding ungrammatical segments.He very frequently adds other punctuation marks where there are none in the original, and sometimes the effect of these is to obscure or distort the sense. He puts a comma in the middle of I, 9: \`In the beginning, how the heav'ns and earth', creating the confusing impression that \`in the beginning' goes with \`That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed' (I, 8), whereas the absence of the comma makes clear that it does with the following words as in Genesis 1:1. He puts full stops where the 1674 texts has semi-colons, sometimes bringing the poetry to an abrupt half and breaking its rhythm, as in I, 34: \`Th'infernal serpent. He it was whose guile'; the abrupt three-word sentence is not Miltonic style. The full stop introduced in I, 78 leaves the following three lines isolated even though they do not form a sentence:He soon discerns. And welt'ring by his sideOne next himself in pow'r and next in crime,Long after known in Palestine and namedBeelzebub. (I, 78-81)Milton is a grammatical writer, who does not leave incomplete sentences lying about. Beelzebub is the object of the verb \`discerns', from which it is here brutally cut off.There are some rare exclamation marks in the 1674 text, as in I, 75: \`O how unlike the place from which they fell!' Teskey applies exclamation marks lavishly, giving a cartoon-like emphasis to Milton's lines. Examples: \`Sad task!' (IX, 13)He even introduces italics for emphasis, something liable to alter radically the rhythm and sense of a passage.So much the rather thou, celestial Light,Shine inward and the mind through all her powersIrradiate. _There_ plant eyes. All mist from thencePurge and disperse, that I may see and tellOf things invisible to mortal sight. (III, 52-4)The 1674 text has:So much the rather thou Celestial lightShine inward, and the mind through all her powersIrradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thencePurge and disperse, that I may see and tellOf things invisible to mortal sight. (III, 52-4)Notice that by dividing the passage into three sentences, Teskey connects the closing \`that I may see' only with the purging of mist, not with the more crucial \`shine inward' and \`there plant eyes'. The italicized \`there' is meaningless, since it suggests that the Celestial light might be planting eyes elsewhere instead.I could go on and on about Teskey's rushed revamping of Milton. I urge teachers NOT to used this flawed edition; Lewalski's edition with the original punctuation (Blackwell, 2007) or the richly annotated edition of Alistair Fowler are vastly preferable."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruitOf that forbidden tree whose mortal tasteBrought death into the world and all our woe,With loss of Eden, till on greater ManRestore us and regain the blissful seatSing, Heavenly Muse...Not a lot people know that 'Paradise Lost' has as a much lesser known companion piece 'Paradise Regained'; of course, it was true during Milton's time as it is today that the more harrowing and juicy the story, the better it will likely be remembered and received.This is not to cast any aspersion on this great poem, however.

Here, when among his own kind, we find the much-maligned Fallen One to be noble, honorable, brave, loyal, beautiful, eloquent, intellectual, defiant and determined--mostly exact opposites of all we humans have been told of him. Satan, in fact, is all-but perfect, and yet it is his own arrogance that undermines him and makes possible his terrible exile from the paradise that will ever after be denied him. Satan, defeated in his Heavenly rebellion in which one-third of all the Host of paradise sided with him, will throughout eternity be God's foe, and because of this, he hates man, God's greatest creation, with all his being, hence his efforts throughout history to oppress and ruin man's relationship with its creator.It took me three face-first dashes into this heavier than lead poem, but I'm glad I finished it. Satan is the best heroic villain in English literature, and God is crafty beyond expectations (although He is God, so how can that be possible?) to use Satan's vast pride against him in His plan for man's future. Some say the ebb and flow of Milton's lines here is akin to the notes of a perfectly-tuned pipe organ blasting out music, and I like that description. This is a great tale full of lines so utterly quotable (or at least paraphrased, as in: \\"better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven\\") that it amply rewards the exertion it takes to your force protesting mind through it.Even if you have to take some time off from this HEAVY poem, come back to it. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"January 10, 2013Not a bed time storyBy Joshua SullivanParadise LostJohn Milton396 pp, The Penguin Group, $5.95, (Adults)Gruesome descriptions of an undying, eternal state, agonizing pain, and suffering the likes of which no living mortal can fathom is the tale of what was gained after paradise was lost.John Milton was an English poet as well as a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England who lived in the 1600s. His writing style reflected his deep personal convictions, a passion for freedom and self-determination during a time of religious and political disturbance. He is named among history as one of the most influential protectors of free speech and freedom of the press.Paradise Lost describes the fall of a Heavenly being, named Lucifer, who wanted take over the throne of Heaven and become equal with God. Lucifer's journey began when he believed himself to be in bondage. Legions of Heavenly beings band together with Lucifer and attempted to DE-throne God (46). Lucifer's name was changed to \\"Satan\\" (46). Satan then comes in the form of a \\"serpent to the Garden of Eden\\" (119-120).While in Paradise, he met Adam and Eve in their \\"happy state\\"; however, they were forbidden from eating from the \\"tree of knowledge\\" under the penalty of death (120). Satan devised a plan to tempt them to rebel against God and eat of the \\"tree of knowledge\\"; therefore, causing Adam and Eve to fall from God's grace and there began the fall of man (235). Satan continues to roam common day earth to tempt man to rebel against God. Satan's goal is to bring as many of mankind into his army as he possibly can.In the beginning, God created Paradise for man and woman to live and have all their needs and wants met by Him. Lucifer's fall from the Kingdom of God resulted in man's fall from God's grace and loss of Paradise. This book is recommended for adults who are seeking understanding of the consequences brought about by one's desire for power and control.A fictional elaboration of nonfictional events is a wonderful representation of the religious horror genera recommended to fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S LuisReviewed by Joshua a high school student for which this book was recommend by a friend. Joshua found this book to be thought provoking and increased his desire to regain Paradise in Heaven."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I read this in college as an assignment. I thought that the second time around and a lot more mature look brought out the value of a lay poet's outlook on God's creation.

Now, I know why it is a classic and will always be one."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"If you want to know what \\"classical education\\" means then read this poem. The writing is littered (in a good way) with references to many major (and some minor) classic Western Europenan people and ideas. If nothing else this book will challenge your memory as it unfolds the origins of modern literature in terms of creating an original universe inside a story that we thought we knew.At times Milton's story is hard to follow but at other times, once you find the rhythm, like all good poetry, his words shift you into a deeper consciousness.This e-edition does not come with notes, a glossary or any other supplimental material. The formatting is good. The text is filled with Milton's spelling variations (most of the time the modern word equivalent is obvious).4 stars for this e-edition. 5 stars for the writing; with the understanding that original work like this is too subjective to truely be defined in terms of stars."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I ordered this book for a seminar on John Milton. While I expected it to be dense and hard to understand, I was pleasantly surprised with how the notes are alongside the text, as opposed to in the back, and how the format of the text lends some more understanding to the reader, such as when dialogue vs. monologue is taking place, or when the narrator is speaking.

And as an editor, Tesky seems to disregard this fact. First of all, he omits critical punctuation from the poem, which can seriously alter your understanding of what is going on:\\"[God} made the stars/ And set them in the firmament of heav'n/ T'illuminate the earth and rule the day/ In their vicissitude and rule the night/ And light from darkness to divide.\\" (VII. 348-52)This is clumsy editing, and cross referencing other editions will show that the comma between \\"the night\\" and \\"and light\\" is retained; without it, the sentence makes little sense.This is only one example of the gross injustices done to Milton's poem: parentheses where parentheses do not belong, misspellings, unnecessary footnotes (literally half of the footnotes you will find merely tell you that two words are elided), and omissions of information that could be helpful. It seems as if Tesky delights in telling you things you either already know or can infer from the context. Tesky's modernization of Paradise Lost is awkward and ill-managed, insulting to the unfamiliar student, and to the memory of Milton.Tesky does, however, include a glossary of biblical and mythological terms which may be unfamiliar to many (but which were much more recognizable to Milton's contemporaries), and this is hardly found in many editions of Paradise Lost. Tesky also gives critical articles on subjects as diverse as the character of Satan, gender distinctions, and even the agency of the angel Abdiel. While there is alot to learn from this edition, scarcely any of it comes from Tesky himself; he ends up doing more damage than good. In my opinion, stay away from this edition."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Not only does this book contain the revised Paradise Lost, but excerpts from other Milton works, like the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, Christian Doctrine, Areopagetica, and others.

They are really incredible. While waiting for the third book to be released, I decided to read Paradise Lost, one of Philip Pullman's main inspirations and the source of a lot of the allusions. Paradise Lost is surprisingly readable for a book that was published in 1667. I understood it, even with the older edition I read which didn't have much of a readers' guide, and I'm only 15. Even though you don't always understand every word and every mythological allusion, you can always get the basic idea, especially with some help from the footnotes. If you read it alone, you might find it boring, but I would strongly recommend reading the His Dark Materials books first. They discuss a lot of the ideas in Paradise Lost. (Was Satan right to rebel against God?) Then when you read P.L., you will enjoy seeing where Philip Pullman got some of his ideas. You can't help but like the His Dark Materials books, then when you read Paradise Lost you understand them so much more. Everyone over the age of 14 should read them both."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"This review focuses on the Kindle reading experience of this e-book, rather than on the literary merits of Milton's epic poem.The Kindle experience is fairly mediocre.The book is out of copyright and has been roughly scanned. The poor (non-existent?) post-scan editing of the e-book means it has plenty of typographical and formatting errors.There is little point in offering very cheap classics if the quality is poor - as it is with every one of the cheap classics I have bought from Amazon (see all my reviews).The poem is full of classical and biblical allusions. Some can be looked up in the kindle dictionary with one click, but most cannot. It would be a great help if the kindle came with an encyclopedia as well as a dictionary. Wikipedia is no substitute."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Not owning an actual Kindle, but reading instead on my PC via the Kindle Cloud Reader (and secondarily on my iPod Touch), the Kindle version of the Penguin edition of Milton's Paradise Lost (edited by John Leonard) offers one very substantial improvement over the print version: an indication that there's an endnote for a given line of poetry given by endnote numbers embedded in the poetic text. Clicking on the number sends you directly to that note. This is important because the endnotes by John Leonard are among the best of any lower-cost modern annotated edition of Paradise Lost (his introduction is also very good). Stripped of such annotations, as in the \\"naked\\" texts you can get for free from Amazon or Google, there's little chance the modern reader would be able to fully appreciate Milton's achievement. (Putting the notes at the end is the usual Penguin Classics practice with its printed books and is the principal flaw of its otherwise fine paperback series of Shakespeare plays.)There are also drawbacks with the Kindle edition, however. There is no running header or footer indicating which \\"Book\\" of the poem you are in while skimming through -- it's all one congealed mass of text. Even worse, the original line numbers placed every five lines here also receive a line of their own. This upsets the margins in such a way that it looks like the poem is constructed in 5-line stanzas, which it is not and, equally detrimental, also upsets the visual rhythms of the poetry. These two factors make the poem harder to read out loud (Milton's poetry should be heard, even if only in your mind's ear) or to call up a specific passage that might be referred to in a classroom or in an essay in some other book. For example, getting to Line 263 of Book I (\\"Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav'n.\\") is FAR quicker in the print edition than the Kindle one where you have to go to the table of contents to cue the first page of Book I and then turn pages one by one to get to Line 263. Navigation of a digital book should not be as cumbersome as this. Let this be a warning to publishers and buyers of electronic editions of Paradise Lost and other epic poems (Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer etc.), not to mention other major works with multiple layers of standardized labelled and/or numbered subdivisions, like Shakespeare or the Bible."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"\\"Paradise Lost\\" by John Milton is the definitive English epic poem (even if it does not always read like one). Much more a dramatic tragedy, Milton's extension of the biblical story of the Fall of both Satan and mankind is timeless. For while Milton may have woven the politics of his own time in regards to tyrannical kings and their heroic counterparts into the battle between heaven and hell, it is a situation that lends itself to any century.Many critics have often thought the 'problem' with \\"Paradise Lost\\" was the fact that Satan seems like the epic hero - the reader immediately begins identifying himself with Satan and rooting for him in his fight against God, an uneasy feeling to be sure. However, as the course of the poem unfolds, Satan's true tragic nature reveals itself and the reader can marvel in Milton's keen ability to bring to life Heaven, Hell, and Paradise (the Garden of Eden). The epic begins in Hell with the fallen angel now known as Satan rousing his troops into further rebellion against God, but the only action they can take is to pollute his newfound paradise and its brand new inhabitants, Adam and Eve. Satan undertakes the journey to spy out the land and learn how to tempt these two to sin. And while he is successful in his attempt to do so, it is a victory that gains Satan no glory, since he does not understand that he can never truly win against God.Milton set out to answer the question of what (or who) caused Adam and Eve to sin, tracing some of the blame away from Satan and examining the relationship between Adam and Eve in the garden. Milton perhaps raises more questions than he does offer any answers, but that is partly what makes \\"Paradise Lost\\" a mirror that still reflects today. Milton includes numerous classical allusions that readers of his day would be familiar with, as well as biblical accounts (including apocryphal works) to flesh out the barebones structure of the biblical account in Genesis. While parts of the poem can be tedious (especially the seemingly somewhat unnecessary books 11 and 12), \\"Paradise Lost\\" is a true masterpiece of literature that should be required reading for everyone, regardless of any religious preferences, for at its heart it is an examination of what it means to be."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"This is John Milton's masterpiece, though not the great epic he had intented to create. He actually wanted to write one about his beloved England, something along the lines of Arthurian legend. But what came out in 1667 was the story &quot;Of Man's first disobedience,&quot; an expansion on Genesis 2 and 3. After creating a vast, vivid cosmos and setting up the battle between the two prevailing forces of God and Satan in the reader's mind, Milton puts Adam and Eve at the very center of it all. But its up to them (like all of us) which side they want to be on. This epic is a true classic among the classics."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I don't know what happened to this edition, but I selected it based on 5 star reviews which lauded the introduction and footnotes within it.

It was somewhat large, with glossy dust jacket and preservation of the original poetic form (in terms of margins and such). Unlike previous editions, the text is not hampered by dredging annotations (which in some editions may take up half of a page of the poem), and Pullman does a good job in giving his analysis. If you've ever read His Dark Materials, you can definitely see the connection between Pullman and Paradise Lost. Original woodcuts are included in this edition, however, I feel that their inclusion is not complete. But I can't complain.This is the sort of edition worthy of any scholar (and it's the right edition for showing off in your bookcase too)."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Regardless of edition, Paradise Lost is one of the finest books ever written, and possibly my favorite. While the subject matter is Christian, the book's greatness transcends religious categories, and I would recommend it equally to secular readers. It is uniformly spectacular in describing heaven, earth, and hell, angels and mortals. However the portrayal of Satan is particularly remarkable. At the start, though at his lowest point, he appears an idealistic hero - championing freedom and the power of the human/angelic mind against a more powerful oppressor. However, as it says in the beginning, his \\"high words [bear] semblance of worth not substance.\\" As his situation improves, he's revealed as a hypocrite enslaved by his own pride, who increasingly disgusts even himself.As others have pointed out, this is a beautiful edition of the book, well bound with big type. The Dore illustrations are a huge plus, and for me it's hard to imagine buying an edition without them. Blake's are the only real competition, and done in a very different style.For the text, there are two issues that may be a challenge for first-time readers. One, as noted by others, there are no annotations. Honestly, vast sections of the book go by with nothing you'd want to look up anyway. A couple parts have tricky allusions (part of Book I comes to mind), but they're few enough to look up elsewhere, and Milton usually spends a couple lines giving you the gist of what he's referring to.The second issue is spellings, which are modernized. While unneeded, this generally makes reading slightly easier without altering pronunciation. For \\"ed\\" endings, modern pronunciations (winged) are spelled normally, while the extra-syllable form (wing-ed) is indicated by a grave symbol. When \\"the\\" appears before a vowel, this edition doesn't specify whether to elide (as in, th'Aeonian mount). Hence you either have to infer based on the number of syllables (usually 10 per line) or simply ignore the issue. I was concerned at first, but upon reading it's barely an inconvenience at all. All or most of the other elisions remain explicit.Overall, this is a superb edition, and perfect if you want a nice hardback containing the Dore illustrations."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I reluctantly studied this at university but once I started reading I could see how wonderfully rich the text was. There was so much to it. Milton took a section from Genesis where there was little description and he gave great thought to it. Perfection was not a simple issue, and paradise was not a simple place. Milton, in some ways, \\"filled in\\" what wasn't mentioned in Genesis. Perfection and paradise are complex ideas that we probably can't completely comprehend (since we're all imperfect).And then the all time issue of Satan vs God... I thought Milton did a great job of representing this.All in all, I highly recommend this great epic."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"I am thrilled with this book.

Published by MobileReference (mobi)This is an outstanding edition of Milton's classic work. Paradise Lost is Milton's paean to a vast pattern in the universe, the disruption of that pattern by rebels, and the weaving of those rebellion threads back into an ever more beautiful tapestry."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"First off, let me say that we're not talking here about the famous Qi gong instructor named John Milton. We're talking about the famous 17th-century English poet who wrote _Paradise Lost_ and _Paradise Regained_, two of the most wonderfully overlong Christian poems in the history of Western literature.Your English teacher will tell you that _Paradise Lost_ \\"narrates the story of Adam and Eve's disobedience, explains how and why it happened, and places the story within the larger context of Satan's rebellion and Jesus' resurrection.\\" And you know that can't be far wrong, because SparkNotes says the exact same thing.But the main reason everyone should read Milton's grand epic is that it contains certain secrets about prayer.In PL, Milton reminds us how important it is, when we pray, to be absolutely specific. The Lord has a strange, often disturbing, sense of humour (PL, books I-XII). If you leave Him wiggle room, He will answer your prayer in a way you never intended, and then say it was your own damned fault, because your prayer contained seven types of ambiguity.John Milton writes from experience. Example: Almost every time a good-looking woman passed within view of John Milton, he suffered an involuntary erection. Daniel of the Old Testament might well have suffered such a condition without complaining, but John Milton found it onerous. John was both a Puritan and a student of Saint Augustine. He was not happy when he suffered an erection, he hated it, and he especially resented the women who made that thing happen to him.In a Latin letter to his friend, George Wither, John Milton reports that, in his youth, he would sometimes see a pretty woman even in his dreams at night, and suffer, not just an erection, but the whole nine yards, up to and including a nocturnal emission; which he trained himself to handle according to Scripture, thereby to purify himself (Deut. 23:10); but sometimes he was unable to wait that long before he handled it, which filled his soul full of Puritan remorse and self-reproach.At age 33, the poet took to wife a 16-year-old lolita named Mary Powell; and you may already have guessed the reason why, which is that she gave him an erection -- more accurately, she gave him \\"one damned erection after another,\\" without remission. (Giving John Milton an erection was not the girl's conscious intent, but it just happened to him, every time they met.) And since Christian marriage is Saint Paul's only approved method whereby to deal with that kind of torment, John Milton (being an honourable man) thought it best to marry the girl (1 Cor. 7:9).Frailty, thy name is woman! After two years of marriage - after just two years of witnessing those insufferable erections that could not be beaten down, or at least, not for long - the poet's young Puritan bride ran away and skipped back home to live with her mother, Mrs. Anne Powell, who likewise gave John an erection; which is why John Milton resented his mother-in-law as well as his estranged wife.Those were the hardest years of the poet's life - nothing but a daily struggle against involuntary erections, yet here he was, trapped in a loveless marriage to a barely pubescent teenager who lived with her entirely-too-attractive mother. Which is partly why John Milton wrote those four revolutionary Christian pamphlets, correcting Moses' and Jesus' hardline policy on divorce (Mark 10:11-12).In his Latin correspondence, some of which is preserved in the Bodleian Library, John Milton reports that he was fine when alone in his study, or when hobnobbing with Parliamentarians, or even when having a hasty pudding, or a figgy one, over at the Inns of Court; but let just one good-looker cross his path, showing good ankle between the hem of her dress and the top of her shoe, and it was boing! - instant erection, just like a spring-loaded mechanical device; causing John to exclaim bitterly, \\"Oh, God, please, not again! Save me from this penal fire!\\"It even happened to him once when Oliver Cromwell's wife, Elizabeth Bourchier Cromwell, bent over to pick up a handkerchief that had fallen to the floor. On that occasion there was a lamentable accident (\\"an hard mishap\\" [verbatim quote]) with John's ordinarily modest codpiece - an incident so humiliating that John never even wrote a poem about it, although he did apologise, profusely, to Oliver Cromwell, and to Mrs. Cromwell, who saw the whole thing, and then fainted. (John at the time was employed as Cromwell's Latin secretary.)By the way: It was modesty, not arrogance, that moved John Milton, after that embarrassing incident, to wear a baggy codpiece, with plenty of wiggle room.Which brings me back to the beginning, when I was explaining why you should give the Lord no wiggle room when you pray: John Milton took his problem to the Lord in prayer, stating in his journal, \\"Father, I pray Thee, let me not suffer a stiffe joynt when I see a beautifull woman.\\"And here's how the Lord answered that prayer, in 1651: He struck John Milton blind.At first, John thought that his blindness was a punishment for his own bad behaviour - which is how that whole thing got going, in Anglo-American Christianity, about how, if you are a boy who does what John Milton used to do, it could make you go blind. But God revealed to John, by means of a dream, that his blindness was actually an answer to his own prayers - because the poet had said, \\"Father, let me not suffer a stiff joint when I see a beautiful woman.\\"John Milton then said, \\"Lord, that is not what I meant, at all\\" - but it was too late to change the outcome, because the prayer was already answered.The erections that John Milton suffered in the years 1651-1674, and there were many, even after the Lord answered his prayer, were not from seeing a beautiful woman, it was actually because John had a condition that modern physicians call PSAS (\\"Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome\\"). So the chronic \\"stiffe joynt\\" problem was not really the women's fault, and it never was; but John Milton never knew that. Even when he wrote Paradise Lost (by dictation, from 1652-1667), John was still under the impression that women, seen or unseen, were to blame for his condition; which is why he makes all of those snide remarks in blank verse about your mother, Eve, in Books IV-V and IX-X of Paradise Lost. Because whenever he pictured Eve in his mind's eye, it was boing! - the same old problem. And there would come no more blank verse to his head for the next twenty minutes or so, until things settled down. John Milton hated that.But it all turned out for the best: if God had not answered John Milton's prayer in that unusual way, by blinding him, Paradise Lost might never have been completed, and sold to the publisher, Sam Simmons, in 1667, for 5 - which was a tidy sum for a religious poem during the decadent Restoration era.It was while writing the early books of Paradise Lost that John was introduced to Katherine, a ship captain's daughter, a fat woman whom he had never seen (because he was blind); whom he nonetheless married in 1656, but not for the same old reason as before: John asked fat Kate to marry him (a.) because he needed secretarial assistance with Paradise Lost, and (b.) because Katherine did not have the same pernicious effect on him as Mary Powell and her mother Anne had done. John could dictate blank verse to Kate all night long without feeling so much as a tingle down there.Kate's surname was Woodcock. Beelzebub made a little joke about that: he said, \\"The Lord finally gave John Milton just what he always wanted.\\"- L."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" is one of the all-time classics of English literature. The epic poem begins with Satan just having been expelled from Heaven. Adam and Eve are tempted in the Garden of Eden, and fall. Before the two are expelled from Eden, Adam has revealed to him some of the major events of the Old and New Testaments, culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. The epic has enthralled readers for well over three centuries.One thing that must be borne in mind when reading this work is that Milton's theology was not orthodox Christian theology, but Arianism, as he denied the Trinity and believed that Christ was not eternal, but created by God the Father. Also, the seventeenth century English is difficult to plow through. However, by forcing the reader to reflect on the origin of evil and to consider what they believe about the concept of original sin, \\"Paradise Lost\\" proves to be worth the effort one must make in reading it."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is the best work of literature in the English language, bar none. Christians and non-Christians alike should marvel at the vision presented by Milton. He is not a Satanist, as the Romantics would have you believe. Indeed, he is a devout Christian. This is what makes the work so extraordinary. Milton's vision of the astral world invokes various responses from the reader, all of them genuine and some contradictory. No matter who you are or what you believe, you will thoroughly enjoy this imaginary look into the events surrounding the fall of Lucifer and the beginnings of man in the Garden of Eden."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"OK so an epic poem based on the Christian doctrine of original sin wouldn't be the first thing that popped into my mind when I was looking for a good summer read. But since I heard that William Blake and Edgar Allen Poe thought that Paradise Lost was the greatest poem ever by the greatest writer in the English language, I figured I'd take their word and give it a shot. I trust their opinions in such matters.After finishing the thing, my main thought is that you'd have to be a great writer to pull this story off. This is a long, loud cheer for the Renaissance status quo of stodgy European social hierarchy and ancient Christian beliefs, and to us non-European non-Christians, all this stuff is at best annoying and at worst infuriating. The Almighty Father is smug and self-satisfied, his Beloved Son is a simpering goody-two-shoes, and the angels are the swaggering authority figures we all roll our eyes at. No wonder the romantics thought Satan was the hero of the story.Despite all this, and the fact that you already know the ending, and the fact that none of your friends ever bother to read epic poems, Paradise Lost snaps along pretty well. That alone is a testament to just how great a writer John Milton was. And whether you think the story line is gospel truth or an eye roller, you'd have to be tin-eared to miss the beauty of Milton's language. Take this passage, where everybody's favorite fallen angel is about to leave his brimstoney digs in his quest across Chaos to Earth:Into this wild Abyss the wary FiendStood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,Pondering his voyage (1)This is high art with blank verse. The way the consonants sound together: \\"wild,\\" \\"wary,\\" and \\"while;\\" the cadence of the words perfectly setting off \\"the brink\\" to make it a brink in the sentence; the pause to ponder at the end; all form a powerful image of the devil standing between Hell and primordial Chaos, and put you right there with him- pondering along. Paradise Lost is full of such gorgeous passages, and deserves the praise heaped upon it. Can't say enough good things about the language.But \\"greatest poem ever\\" is a pretty bold claim, and although the language is easily in the realm of masterpiece, the story line has too many flaws to put Paradise Lost up against other great works of English literature. Here's why I think it ranks lower.The original Eden story in Genesis is a revolutionary and powerful myth from the dawn of man's consciousness, and it concerns itself with topics quite different than those which Christian doctrine later associated with it. You have to go back and read Genesis without baggage to see it, but the Eden story is about how people, God, and nature relate to each other, and how mankind transitioned from gatherers to farmers on their way to the Hebrew's preferred profession of shepherding. There's no sex, no Satan, there are several interesting mysteries now mostly ignored, and although God is undeniably angry at being disobeyed, nothing is labeled as evil and there's no mention of sin. (2)As different philosophies developed through the ages, the story of Eden was re-interpreted. Several hundred years after Genesis (3), the pseudipigraphical \\"Life of Adam and Eve\\" (4) added Satan to the story. The idea of the fall of man and the need for him to be redeemed came in with the early Christians maybe two hundred years after that. And the idea of concupiscence and original sin was cooked up by Irenaeus and Augustine after another century or two more. (5) Fast forward a thousand years from there to Milton's time, and people's main theological concerns had progressed to twisted psychological conundrums like theodicy (6) and free will vs. predestination, which were a huge leap from the simple concerns about sustenance and obedience that were most important to the authors of Genesis.Milton attempts to reconcile this modern load of concepts back into the original Bible verses. He adds a few flourishes of his own, including sinless sex in Eden, demonic Gothic architecture, and perhaps the high point of the poem where Adam chooses to eat the fruit out of love and \\"fall\\" with Eve to share her doom. But for the most part, Milton sticks with the standard Christian doctrine of his time. Wherever this doesn't fit into the original story, he bangs on equivocating, apologizing, or just repeating the idea often enough that he thinks you won't call him on it. The result is that Paradise Lost commits the literary sin of too much telling rather than showing. At times this gets downright tiresome.One of the most easily demonstrated examples of this problem is Milton's treatment of God's curse on the serpent. At the time Genesis was written, the serpent was a powerful mythic being in his own right: spirit of primordial nature and guardian of immortality. For the crime of convincing the woman to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge, God curses the serpent to crawl around, eat dirt, and scare women. Genesis leaves it to the reader to interpret the serpent's motivation. One thing is clear: God's curse of the serpent shows that God is in control and has absolute dominion over nature. This was revolutionary at the time when nature was the most powerful thing around, would easily kill you if you didn't watch out, and everybody else worshiped nature gods.Fast forward a few hundred years and mankind had subdued nature to the point that other people posed the bigger threat. So the people of that time invented a humanoid devil and associated him with the earlier biblical \\"accuser\\" (\\"satani\\") from Numbers and Job. In the \\"Life of Adam and Eve\\" from that period, Satan is introduced as the enemy of mankind and (in most versions) the same being as the serpent. In Milton's age, the serpent symbol had so little power left that Milton has Satan as a wholly autonomous being who possesses a heretofore inconsequential snake to disguise himself. Paradise Lost has to spend a verse to justify why Satan chooses this particular animal rather than say, a monkey or a squirrel, and Milton ends up with a weak circular reference back to King James' Genesis:...for, in the wily snakeWhatever sleights, none would suspicious mark,As from his wit and native subtletyProceeding; (7)In recognition of Milton's genius, I must say that once Satan possesses said snake, he proceeds to deliver to Eve 50 lines of as tempting an argument as you could imagine any devil could make, and this is a masterful work of art that powerfully presents the Christian interpretation of the story. (8) Unfortunately though, since Milton laboriously and repeatedly expounds upon Satan's sin and evil nature, when the time comes for God to deliver his curse on Satan, Genesis' original curse of the snake doesn't fit at all, and Milton has to tap-dance awkwardly around the discrepancy:...yet God at lastTo Satan first in sin his doom applied,Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best:And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. (9)Sorry, but you just can't put stuff like this in your poem and still be in the running for the greatest ever. The competition's too stiff. Shakespeare and the Beowulf writer advance to round two.I'm going to complain about one more thing before wrapping this up. There is a passage in book five which dropped my jaw, and not in a good way, where Milton mentions Galileo's telescope in a kind of Renaissance pop-culture reference. To set the scene: the Almighty has just sent the angel Raphael down to warn Adam that Satan is going to try to mess things up in Eden. Raphael looks down on earth from heaven with his super-powered angelic vision and sees Earth's details clearly, even though he is a celestial distance away...As when by night the glassOf Galileo, less assured, observesImagined lands and regions in the moon (10)(Jaw drops here.) So Milton didn't like Galileo? Milton thought Galileo was wrong? This sent me off to research Milton and Galileo. Apparently, Milton visited Galileo once on a European tour. Most of the references I could find emphasize the parallels between Milton and Galileo: both blinded, both political prisoners, etc. (11) Wait a minute. If Milton had such an affinity for Galileo, how come he goes out of his way here to diss Galileo and cast doubt on Galileo's real observations in contrast to his fictional angel's? By calling Galileo's observations \\"imagined\\", Milton is siding with the Inquisition, and putting himself on the wrong side of history.Now I know you can't look back almost four hundred years and fault a person for not seeing things in a modern way, but this is no small mistake for the \\"greatest poem ever.\\" The Renaissance church's rejection of science was among the worst ideas in dozens of millennia of human history, and Galileo got it dead right and Milton and the Church (and arguably, most everybody else) got it dead wrong. Religion had been the dominant institution of culture and knowledge from the dawn of man's consciousness up to Milton's time, when the church, in its power-madness, turned away from striving for competence and understanding truth to a childish because-I-said-so view of the world. Galileo was one of the major innovators of his time who was able to bring revolutionary new truths to western civilization, and those truths were threatening to the stale, orthodox power structure of the Renaissance church.Instead of embracing the new thinking and opening institutions of research and learning, the church made a horrible mistake by rejecting science, and opened the rift we still see today between the faiths that modern people claim to believe and the facts that they know to be true. To earn the title of the greatest poem ever, Milton could have reconciled Christian mythology with the new ideas of empiricism, and turned Paradise Lost into the new Bible. Instead he chose to spend his energies reinforcing the power structures of his time and missed his opportunity.One of the most compelling themes in the original Eden story is the juxtaposition of progress with defiance of authority and negative consequences. You can't gain something valuable without giving something else up. You can't bring in a new idea without disrupting the current order. Adam and Eve lose their life of leisure in Eden by gaining knowledge of good and evil. The Christians lose the meaning of the Eden story when they re-define it as the wholly sinful \\"fall of man\\" to give Jesus something to redeem. If you ask me, I like my Genesis straight up and undiluted; read raw from the original with all its power and balance of conflicting ideas intact.The Genesis authors understood very well the tension between honoring tried-and-true traditions and defying conventional wisdom to innovate and improve their lives. They struck out on their own and rewrote the mythology of their time. In my opinion, John Milton's failure to do the same and his parroting of the mythology of his time is Paradise Lost's primary sin. Genesis is challenging and revolutionary. Paradise Lost is pedantic, overstated orthodoxy. Its relentless emphasis on obedience to authority makes it seem more like political propaganda than spiritual inspiration, and it ignores many of the richest and most illuminating aspects of Genesis.Five stars for the language, deduct a star and a half for degrading the original story and sucking up to authority. Selah.(1) John Milton, Paradise Lost. Book 2:917-919(2) The idea of the Garden of Eden without sex or sin may seem shocking to many readers, and each of the topics mentioned above deserves its own essay. But that would take us far away from a critique of Paradise Lost. Here are two quick, simple points. First none of these elements are mentioned in a literal reading of the story and must be interpreted in. Second, in the case of sex and sin, both are mentioned explicitly quite close to the Eden story in Genesis, but not in it. I assume this was deliberate.(3) There are widely varying estimates on the year Genesis was written. A summary is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_the_Bible. Interestingly, the more conservative you are, the earlier you believe Genesis was written, so the bigger the gap in time between the original and the introduction of Satan. I figured \\"several hundred years\\" was safe.(4) (...)(5) (...)(6) Theodicy means trying to figure out how there can be evil in the world if the world is ruled by an all-good and all--powerful God.(7) Paradise Lost. Book 9:90-93(8) Paradise Lost. Book 9:678-731(9) Paradise Lost. Book 10:171-174(10) Paradise Lost. Book 5:261-263(11) Jonathan Rosen, \\"Return to Paradise,\\" The New Yorker, June 2008, (...). Also see Milton's defense of Galileo's right to free speech in his \\"Areopagitica,\\" (...). To me this doesn't offset the bad judgment of the comment in Paradise Lost, but makes it worse because it demonstrates that Milton should have known better."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"First of all I want to say that reading Milton is very difficult at best and impossible at worst. So if you really want to read this don't be turned down if you have problems. And if you don't like reading this kind of stuff I strongly advise you to try something else first.Second of all this is one of the best books ever written. Not only because of the (my point of view) wonderful and amazing language. But only because this is better than the story told in the Bible !!!Really because the Bible has left us hundreds of unanswered questions and a story that doesn't make any sense at all. While Milton present us a story wish shows us all motives and gives us all the answers. Non of the philosophical are left unanswered. Therefore I can give him only praise for he succeeds there where thousands and thousands of religious people have failed.In the end Milton gives us that what he promised.\\"To explain the ways of God to men.\\" (I don't remember the exact quote.)So be aware of that what you are going to read and remember that before you lays not only one of the greatest epics ever told (I can compare this even to Iliad and the Devine Comedy) but also one of the best religious books (I can compare it even to the Bible and the Dhammapada).This book stands on a lonely height."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost (Odyssey Series in Literature)","review":"A Christian classiic which I had difficulty following.

My only gripes are that in certain areas (as the editor wholly admits) the syntax has been changed, slightly altering the mood and at times the message I believe Milton had in mind.

Mrs. Samuel Lawrence of Santa Monica, a poor but proud widow, hires Archer to find her missing daughter, a young nurse named Galley. Archer goes where the clues lead and soon finds he is involved in something more than a simple missing persons case. Slowly but surely, the hardboiled PI becomes immersed in the sordid world of heroin addicts and dealers.The Way Some People Die contains plenty of good dialogue as well as numerous descriptive passages notable for their insightful detail. The intricately constructed narrative contains several intriguing plot elements that are ultimately tied together in the final pages. A 4 star effort, not quite up to the standard of Macdonald's best work, but nevertheless a worthwhile read for hardboiled crime fans."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die","review":"A master of the noir thriller, Macdonald captures the heart and soul of 1940-50s California, from Los Angeles to Palm Springs to San Francisco, his protagonist at home prowling the mean streets of LA. A former cop, Lew Archer, now a PI, is called to the Santa Monica home of a distraught mother, Mrs. Samuel Lawrence. Her daughter has been missing since Christmas and now, months later, Mrs. Lawrence is willing to invest in outside help to locate Galatea. Galley is one of those few remarkable women that draw men in like a black widow spider, all innocence and fresh beauty, virtually irresistible to the male of the species. Galley quit her nursing job after caring for a gut-shot petty hood, apparently running off with a small time gangster in his employ, Joe Tarantine. Archer resorts to the tried and true techniques that served him well on the police force, gathering bits of evidence until he can form a cohesive picture of the girl's activities and her possible whereabouts, not to mention the men in her lifeThe most likely place to start is with Tarantine's brother, Mario, but he is laid up in the hospital after a terrible beating that leaves him almost unrecognizable. Still Mario is the closest lead to his brother, although Archer gets sidetracked by a local drug dealer with influence enough to corrupt some local law enforcement. Surrounded by a grotesque band of thugs, Dowser, a former boxer, has Lew escorted to his fortified hilltop home between Santa Monica and Pacific Palisades. His intention is to enlist Archer's aid in locating Joe Tarantine, since they are both interested in finding the same man, offering a decent reward; the PI plays along since that is likely the only way he will leave the enclave in one piece. Tracking Tarantine to a bar in Palm Springs, an odd collection of characters spring up along the way, some unsavory, others with questionable motives; but before he has a chance to sort out the various factions, Lew finds Galley in a rented house outside of Palm Springs and is knocked out before her can question her, rescued from the roadside by a middle-aged newlywed.Before long, the bodies pile up, conflicting motives complicating the case, a handsome part time actor found dead in his apartment, a newlywed husband on the lamb, a boat piled on the rocks, fast-talking women, everybody with a hand out or a hidden agenda. With dialog and descriptions straight out of the past, Archer mirrors the stark black and white nature of the crime genre in its prime, tough guys and hoods, beautiful dames, pushy cops and nasty characters you wouldn't want to run into in a dark alley: \\"His face and body had an evil swollen look as if they had grown stout on rotten meat.\\" With a penchant for naming people by their looks (\\"Paleface\\" and \\"Judas\\"), Archer is the epitome of a dedicated PI, willing to work for his money but on edge when people take advantage, especially when they render him unconscious. This is a man with a heart, willing to scrape a junkie off the streets and deliver her to a hospital for treatment but unwilling to be anybody's sucker. For a few hours of escape into the ambiance of old Hollywood, this novel is a great escape into more readily definable days where good and evil were easy to recognize, women wore gloves and both good and bad guys wore hats. Luan Gaines/2007."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die","review":"P.I. work can be challenging, but Lew Archer wasn't prepared.It all started out so simple, an over-protective mother, looking for her adult missing daughter. She hadn't heard from her for a few months and was truly distraught. It was obvious by her humble surroundings that she had little money, but Archer didn't want to work for free. He was reluctant to get involved, but Mrs. Lawrence was adamant and showed him a picture. Galley was her name and she was definitely a looker. He agreed to do a little poking around if Mrs. Lawrence would pay him fifty dollars. But he was sure it would be a dead end.That was a bad call...Galley had left little behind to trace, but it was enough to get Archer started. It appeared she had unknowingly become involved with some unsavory characters. It was quite possible she was in definite danger. The more Archer dug, the deeper he was pulled in. Cross-country searches, illegal activities, and drugs weave a tangled web of deception-but that is just the beginning. Just when he gets close to Joe Tarantine, a major link to Galley, he often slips away.When Galley finally surfaces, Archer is determined to set her free. The stakes are high and the risks are chancy at best, but that's just part of the job. When things really get hot, the police are involved. But will they trust his instincts or write Archer off?Witnesses and sources turn against each other and Archer is stuck in the middle. Some times he's just ahead of the police but the next time he's to late. Sorting out the truth in between the lines is a challenge, will Archer's persistence pay off in the end or will the real truth slip away?This is one of 18 Lew Archer novels published between 1949 and 1976. Ross MacDonald, the pen name for Kenneth Millar, died over 20 years ago. At that time, he was considered the greatest American crime novelist since Raymond Chandler-also a literary artist-not just a detective storywriter.The Way Some people Die is full of unexpected twists and 360 degree turns.Armchair Interviews says: It will keep you hanging until the very last page!"},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die","review":"Being a big fan of Ross MacDonald, I know that his early books (pre-1958) are solid but rather standard hard-boiled mysteries very much in the Hammett/Chandler school. MacDonald didn't really find his voice (and his power as a writer) until his amazing streak of successes that started with 1959's The Galton Case, and beyond.Having known that when I started The Way Some People Die (written 1951), I was still surprised to find it pedestrian and somewhat less than gripping. The plot is appropriately complex, but of all MacDonald's books this definitely comes across as undistinguished and derivative of Chandler in particular. The comings and goings of several characters (especially the daughter who Archer is hired to find at the beginning) make little sense, and the environment of gangsters, thugs and hired goons is not what MacDonald does best, and they're the kind of Hollywood stock characters that make this book feel tired and dated in a way that no other MacDonald books are."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die","review":"Poor old Mrs. Samuel Lawrence of Santa Monica doesn't realize what a can or worms she's opening when she hires Lew Archer to find her missing daughter, Galley. By the end Lew has traveled up and down the length of California and left a string of bodies behind, most of them well-deserving of their morbid fate. And Galley, well, she's not the sweet little nurse her mother thinks she is. This is a swell ride, start to finish. I'm now officially a Ross MacDonald fan and am looking foward to reading everything he wrote."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die","review":"I had read Ross McDonald's novels back when he was in his prime - 50s and 60s. I chose this novel (The Way Some People Die) as I wanted to remember what it was like to read his work. I had not previously read this novel.McDonald's work takes some adjustment for me. He doesn't write mysteries per se. This, and his other works, are not \\"who dun it\\" books as does another McDonald (Phillip) write. And this McDonald doesn't write of action and adventure as does still another McDonald (John D).His works are studies in the human character living in California at the time of his writing (~early 1950s). He digs into personal behavior through his character (Lew Archer) digging into the events of the story as he finds them.There is not a lot uncertainty about who did what to whom here. Archer uncovers evil around the heroin business and this novel is about what that evil is and what it does to the characters in this novel.There is a lot to like about Ross McDonald's work - principally character studies and characterizations of his times, as well as his flexible use of the English language - but I more enjoy novels where what happens next is the attraction which makes me want to turn to the next page. I more enjoy the early Dashiell Hammett Continental Op stories, Anthony Boucher mysteries, Ross Thomas adventures, Don Westlake's comedy-adventure-mysteries, and less enjoy Ross McDonald's character studies. But if they are what you enjoy this is probably a good one."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die","review":"This noir crime \\"mystery\\" novel is in the tradition of a classic Dashiel Hammet novel, but if possible has an even more gritty feel. I felt drawn into character, PI Archer, and his hardboiled take on solving crimes. The plot had enough twists to offer some surprises, and the gritty, period centric style, along with the colorful and flawed characters kept one interested throughout the novel. As is the case with literature of this period it doesn't have any gay, minority or dominant female characters, but the author does a great job bringing his characters to life.While I gave it 5 stars, the novel is still less than a masterpiece, and doesn't always flow quite as well as it should. However, it still admirably matches up, and mostly surpasses other comparable literature in this genre. I recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy a great detective novel with a gritty feel to it."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die","review":"\\"The Way Some People Die\\" is a typical installment in Macdonald's Lew Archer series. Archer, a Los Angeles private detective of indeterminate age, always finds himself involved with denizens of the darker side of life, whether he is working on a case or just running into trouble unintentionally. In this book he gets wrapped up with true criminals--very bad people with malevolent intent.The plot begins with Archer succumbing to a widow's plea to find her missing daughter despite his suspicion that she doesn't really need finding. Searching for the girl leads Archer into a world of mobsters and drug dealers where treachery is the norm. Innocent people, few though there are in this plot, are used handily by the perpetrators of the criminal schemes. Archer is bamboozled at every turn until he finally puts the pieces together.One thing I like about this book is the full denouement, which is much needed for such a complex case. I also enjoyed the settings: the waterfront in Long Beach and a desert town near Palm Springs.One thing I don't like about this book and others in the series is that little information about Archer is given to the reader. He seems to be the vessel for telling stories of the evil in human beings rather than a real character in his own right. I also find it depressing there is no lightness, no relief from human badness, in this book or in any of those I have read in this series, but I guess that is normal for this noir genre."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die","review":"this book is very satisfying. the carecters are well fleshed out and lew archer is at his hard boilest. mcdonald has done it again."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die","review":"Lew Archer is asked to find Galley Lawrence by her mother, and the interesting thing is that he does within the first 50 pages of the book. After that, the story becomes a character study of Galley, and even though by the end Archer is able to pin three murders on her, he is never able to figure out why she committed them. The book also is a searing portrait of the underbelly of Southern California - the world through which Galley moves - filled with prostitutes, dope peddlers, and racketeers. MacDonald writes about this heart of darkness with the toughness you'd expect from a writer working in the tradition of Raymond Chandler. The long confrontational scene Archer has with Galley where he lays out the murders before her, but gets none of the answers he's really looking for, is excellent. The irony at the end involving the use of the $30,000 Galley got after killing her husband is a real kicker. The opening sentence of the book comparing \\"earshot\\" and \\"rifleshot\\" is a gem. Worth looking into."},{"Title":"Secrets of Professional Turf Betting","review":"Chapter 1. Always bet against the public. Betting at a racetrack is a zero sum game from which the track takes a significant chunk of the wagers before anyone gets paid. Further, the people who know the horses best and can easily fix the race, the owners and trainers, are betting against you. At best, only a minority can ever win. The track requires the majority to lose, therefore avoid the majority play. Only bet when two situations occur simultaneously: 1) you have well considered odds in your favor. 2) The public is betting your choice is a loser. Put the two together, and be sure to have 3-1 or better odds in your favor. In other words, always think in terms of probabilities.Chapter 2. Things are easier now since the 'action' is more liquid and public opinion based on weak authorities.Chapter 3. Keep up to date on new angles: read what the professional reads.Chapter 4. The public doesn't lose their fair share. Statistically, they should only have 10% losses. Instead, many lose everything they bring to the track. They do this by allowing emotion to switch their betting style from one race to the next, and always switch at the wrong time. If they just picked 'position 6' every time, they would only lose 10%, but they bet little when they should bet much, and much when they shouldn't bet at all. It is the 'switches' that pull money from the public. Having 'guts' means sticking with your strategy in the face of losses. You can count on the public being unable to demonstrate guts.Chapter 5. Ever changing cycles: The game will only last as long as people see enough winners to convince them they have a chance. If the 'true' odds become obvious, no one would play. Therefore, there must always be long shot winners and ceaseless change in the strategies of the winners. Early in the season, the public badly assesses the odds, the pros bet them and win. Late in the season, the public loads up on the good horses, but this reduces the odds, so the long shots get undervalued and provide the winning odds.Chapter 6-7. Be aware the owners and trainers need not always focus on winning. Know what motivates the owner of the horse to enter the race. Are they building a reputation? Trying to win purses? Trying to turn the public against the horse, then win as a long shot? Understand the rules constraining owners and trainers. Know the claiming rules. Know how to read the weight reports.Chapter 8: Sum the odds. The odds are reported as 3-1, 4-1, etc, so it isn't obvious that the sum should be 100. Convert the odds to percentages and sum the list. If the sum of each horse's chance of winning is less than 100, bet on every horse and you are sure to win. If you are sure a favorite won't win, you can create a sure win by betting on everything else (less than 100 sum). The track is sure to make money if the sum is over 100.Chapter 9: Make your own price lines (100% books) and test them every day (paper workouts)Chapter 10: Pittsburgh Phil's system: buy the stuff that no one wants. It takes guts to stick with the system. It killed Pittsburgh Phil at 52. It takes guts, that is why it doesn't matter if everyone knows the system. Guts isn't the ability to ignore fear, it is the ability to stick to your original goal, process and strategy. (!!!!)Chapter 11: Money management: the obvious, don't spend your living expenses, but also, the important thing is your emotional balance. Without balance, you switch and that is how to lose.Chapter 12: you cannot grind, you must speculate. You can't chisel, you must gamble. Accept and expect more losers than winners.Chapter 13-15: Reading the racing publicationsThe rest of the book is a detailed plan for seasonal betting, January through December, one chapter per month.While reading, I speculated on how to apply this to the securities markets. What is a 'race', a day of trading? In terms of stocks, what are 'claiming races'? What are weights?The notion of 'ever changing cycles' is really interesting. The 'racing game' is clearly a product of some evolutionary process that weeded out less robust 'betting markets'. By looking at the 'game' as a whole, one can see it as an activity perfectly designed, but having no designer. Most will lose, but still find it enjoyable enough to continue the playing. Further, it is impossible to investigate unemotionally, since the attraction perpetuating the games existence is entirely emotional. The opacity is central to the game's survival."},{"Title":"Secrets of Professional Turf Betting","review":"Excellent!!One of the best books on professional speculation around!!

The grammar review is 60 solid pages, and so it takes some time to get through it and learn it, even if you are a good Spanish student. I studied this book for months before taking the test. Be warned that this book will not help you get a great score unless you put a lot of time in studying it (or you already know the material). However, it really does have everything you need to score well.I think the practice tests were slightly harder than the real thing, but they were fairly close. Just a week before the actual test I got a 670 on a practice test. Then, on the actual test, I got a 710. This really isn't much of a difference when you take into account the range of SAT II scores that accompany any score.Rather than including an exact scoring guide after every practice test (which would have been nice, but unrealistic), the book has directions on calculating your raw score and then one chart which gives a range of scores to match the range your raw score fell into. (The only soure of SAT IIs that have actually been given in previous years is, of course, &quot;Real SAT IIs,&quot; published by the College Board.)There were some typos in the book. I found a few in the grammar review and one or two in practice test answer keys. None of them were terrible, but if you think that the book is incorrect about something it may very well be. Overall, I good book to study, especially if you have a lot of time before the test."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for Sat Ii--Spanish","review":"I bought this book about one month before my SAT II: Spanish test. The main reason that I bought it was for the practice tests; I've found that being acquainted with the format calms my nerves and (hopefully!) allows me to concentrate more on the content than the format. The book has ten practice exams that are fairly comparable in difficulty to the actual test. I took four of the practice exams and received about a 78-80 raw score on all of them, which translates into the 750-800 range as the scaled score. On the real SAT II, I scored a 760, which I expected due to my scores on the practice exams. I glanced through the grammar review and vocabulary, and it seems to be well laid out and informative. I tended not to dwell on it because, being in AP Spanish Language, I hoped that I knew enough of the information to spare myself of the extra studying. Overall, I thought the book truly helped me score better and it was a great predictor of my score - which is helpful if you're debating whether to take the actual exam or not because you are afraid of what your score might be. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone considering taking the SAT II: Spanish test."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for Sat Ii--Spanish","review":"As a Spanish tutor, I have to say that this book's best feature is its Listening Comprehension CD. I have used this book to help prepare students of all levels to better understand the Spanish language. The listening comprehension guides are perfect for anyone--from an advanced student to a beginner.. In addition, the practice tests are amazing for their quantity, not necessarily their quality. The downside to this book is that there are several typos and errors that a novice student wouldn't catch. Overall, it is a good book to use, but use it with the supervision of a Spanish teacher or tutor as you may not be able to notice some of the errors."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for Sat Ii--Spanish","review":"This book provides a well-rounded review of grammar and reading comp for the SAT II Spanish Test.

The book does prepare you well for the test though."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for Sat Ii--Spanish","review":"I took the test in November 2001 and bought this book a week before it and the test was way easier than the practice tests seemed to show, and when i finally received my scores, i was amazed, i got an 800 a perfect score, seriously all the books on the Barrons publishins company do help a lot, the same i can say for the Writing test."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for Sat Ii--Spanish","review":"We never received the order.

After all, Kenneth Millar wrote it in the early 1940's. Well before he renamed himself Ross Macdonald and many years prior to finding the narrative voice that characterizes his \\"mature\\" crime novels.So, I was pleasantly surprised when I picked up this early entry in the Macdonald canon and found I could not put it down.The protagonist and narrator of The Dark Tunnel is Robert Branch, an assistant professor of English at a fictitious university located some 50 miles outside Detroit. On the same day he is rejected from enlisting in the Navy because of poor eyesight, Branch becomes embroiled in a fast and furious mission to expose a Nazi spy ring that has infiltrated his school's campus.To describe this compelling novel as fast paced would be an understatement. Much of it consists of nonstop action that unfolds like the TV show \\"24\\". But that's not its only virtue. The dialogue is wonderfully clever and the descriptive passages are remarkably original and evocative.Some readers may object to the insensitive and politically incorrect ways homosexuality is referred to in the pages of this 60+ year old novel. But one has to remember that the social mores of that remote time differ radically from those of today. Hence one has to judge the book as a product of its time.The Dark Tunnel is a very entertaining work of fiction. It demonstrates that Ross Macdonald's considerable talent as a novelist was evident early on and extends beyond the hardboiled crime genre. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dark Tunnel","review":"A fast-paced thriller from a man who is becoming one of my favorites. Good dialogue, full of frustrating dumb-asses who don't want to believe the truth, wiseacre humor. Already with this first novel, Ross Mac had learned to just tell the story and leave out extraneous stuff. There is both a literal and figurative \\"Dark Tunnel\\", and both are interesting. Great setting on a college campus. Far-fetched once or twice, but a really good read."},{"Title":"The Dark Tunnel","review":"This book is not Ross McDonald at his best. It's an early effort.I have several of the old paperbacks of his books still out there I got used from small retailers through Amazon, as well as some of his newly republished classics. I reread them whenever. When I notice them on the shelf.I got The Dark Tunnel because it was something of his that I had not yet read."},{"Title":"Chrono Crusade, Vol. 7","review":"Rosette and Chrono have slipped aboard the Sinner's giant floating fortress ironically called \\"Eden\\" in an effort to rescue Azamaria and hopefully bring Joshua back to his senses. But before they can do that they'll have to make it through Aion's powerful demon allies, and Rosette's lifeforce is at its lowest ebb, so Chrono can't revert back to his true form without killing her in the process. Our duo are not the only ones on Aion's trail either. All the forces of Pandemonium, led by the fierce warrior Duke Daffau, have come to kill the Sinners and end their rebellion once and for all.I was a real fan of the early episodes of the anime version of Chrono Crusade, which brought me to the manga. Unfortunately, the anime got caught up in end of the world scenarios and misunderstood silly religious symbolism right out of Evangelion. The manga version is at once easier to understand and vastly different than the anime. I would have to say that Volume 7 is one of the weakest volumes of the series I have read, because it's mostly one battle scene after another. But I'm ok with that since this is the next to last volume. It just seemed a little too Hollywood blow-em-up to me. The real part of the story to me has always been Rosette's search for Joshua, and mirroring this, Satella's search for her lost sister long ago taken by Aion. So to me, all the demon-killing and comedy is just window dressing that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Even so, the manga is light years better than the anime. A nice bonus story at the end of this volume which really hits on why I like Chrono Crusade is a flashback to Rosette's first acclimation to joining the Magdalan Order and her first friend."},{"Title":"Chrono Crusade, Vol. 7","review":"The last book I needed an awesome series!! Nice plot flow, great cast of characters as we creep closer and closer to the end!"},{"Title":"Chrono Crusade, Vol. 7","review":"The Chrono Crusade series was one of those stories where you hope the characters will all still be together in the end.

But in these final few, the pace is picked up, and I found myself unable to put the book down- even on my third time through! The story flows amazingly well, and the end of this book left me desperate for the next. The characters are well fleshed out, and the emotions are quite compelling. If you haven't picked this book or this series up yet, I strongly encourage you to- you have no idea what a great story you are missing."},{"Title":"Chrono Crusade, Vol. 7","review":"I first discovered this manga while living in Germany. I got up to book 6 before coming back and having to wait for English editions to show up and its been driving me nuts!

Gala, de manera magistral a mi modo de ver, es muy pol&eacute;mica. Lo que me atrap&oacute; totalmente en el libro, desde sus primeras p&aacute;ginas, fueron las reflexiones del protagonista (resaltadas en letra m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;a en el libro) sobre el sufrimiento, el amor y la vida de un hombre de 50 a&ntilde;os. Copio algunos p&aacute;rrafos:&quot;...La vida es una bolsa el&aacute;stica en la que todo cabe, hasta la muerte: a quien no come para no engordarse se le achica el est&oacute;mago; a quien se niega a sufrir, el alma se le achica.&quot;&quot;...No busco ni aconsejo que se busque el dolor, ni que se siente uno a esperarlo. Pero llega; una y otra vez llega. Y los muertos son nuestros. Y el dolor. Y nos arrasa. Y nos reconstruye de otro modo: de eso quiero escribir. Pone al aire nuestros entresijos; nos obliga a mirarlos y a verificar que somos iguales que los otros. La comida sin masticar nos perjudica; el dolor sin sentir nos hace &quot;resentidos&quot;, porque hacemos cr&oacute;nica la enfermedad que debi&oacute; ser aguda. Yo me propongo mirarlo fijamente a los ojos, quedarme frente a frente con &eacute;l, charlar con &eacute;l, que me cuente sus cosas, de d&oacute;nde viene, de qu&eacute; familia es, cu&aacute;nto se va a quedar, qu&eacute; designios lo mueven. Porque cada dolor concreto no retornar&aacute; nunca, y nos trae un recado irrepetible. No me despedir&eacute; de &eacute;l a la francesa y saldr&eacute; por la puerta falsa.

No hay otro modo de que se ensanche nuestra casa, y de que, cuando venga la alegr&iacute;a, si viene, tenga m&aacute;s sitio donde recrearse&quot;...Recomiendo ampliamente el libro para aquellas personas en la madurez que les gusta encontrar profundidad en una novela, y no simplemente una historia para entretenerse."},{"Title":"La Regla de Tres (Spanish Edition)","review":"La regla de tres es la historia de las relaciones entre una mujer y dos hombres, formando un triangulo amoroso, y las complicaciones y reflexiones que surgen de esta relacion.

Who's Having This Baby Anyway?","review":"The raw info about different drugs and procedures is helpful. I have run a lot of info by my mom and she confirms that it is true to life and accurate. Also, the hospital culture stuff is valuable- but check the hospital out because we are learning that each one has its own reputation. Some are terrible, some try to be baby-friendly. The book also has birthing plan worksheets that are handy. The one minor annoyance is something that I am finding with a lot of modern natural birthing literature, which is that it all seems biased in the home birth/water birth direction to an extent. I hate hospitals, so I understand the reaction, but I like feeling informed, and rather get all sides before making my choices. Even so, it's not as bad as another book I read, so it can get worse. This book has most of that info in separate chapters, so at least you can choose to skip it if you are not interested.I have chosen a very pro-natural birthing center that provides a home birth- like experience but has emergency equipment and a hospital nearby, so I am about trying to have the best of both worlds. That said, I know that not everyone has that option, so it's best to get educated on all of your options, and this book will help!"},{"Title":"Hey! Who's Having This Baby Anyway?","review":"I recommend this book to EVERYONE!!! To me, it is a MUST READ if you are planning on having a baby. It is very informative and not bias.

There's an entire chapter on home birth, one on water birth and one on breastfeeding, among other chapters. I have yet to read those but it's next for me.The book reads well and you could easily read it cover to cover or just skip around to what is relevant.

The primary instigator of this momentous transition, the Emperor Constantine, is rendered in a balanced, but somewhat muted, portrait. Beginning with an excellent explication of the root causes of Roman social and political difficulties in the 3rd century, Jones focuses quickly on the religious milieu of the times. In a few well-crafted paragraphs, he clearly illustrates Christianity's parallels and divergences from the other contemporary popular cults. This is combined with a somewhat bland recounting of Constantine's path to power and reasoned speculation concerning his famous pre-Malvian &quot;vision,&quot; acceptance or rejection of which will largely depend on personal taste. Sounds good to me, though. Where the book really shines, though, is in its detailed portrayal of the bitter fractious disputes within the Church, and how they mercilessly frustrated Constantine's wish for theocratic unity. Seventeen centuries later, the Emperor's rage and consternation are still fresh in his letters."},{"Title":"Constantine and the conversion of Europe (Men and history)","review":"in the course of Roman history, Jones aptly threads the line between historical analysis and narrative. He assuredly begins the book with a brief, yet astute history of Christianity in the Roman empire and carries through to the legal decrees establishing Christianity as the most favored religion of the empire. Yet, he does not forget to speculate on the plebeian reaction to Constantine's refusal to sacrifice to the Capitoline gods after his ascension to the throne.This book is a wonderful place to begin the exploration of Christianity's role in the Roman empire."},{"Title":"Constantine and the conversion of Europe (Men and history)","review":"A.H. M. Jones writes an admirable biography with negligible amounts of conjecture. Jones correctly states that we know little of Constantine's personal relationship with God. We possess historical evidence that outlines a vague conversion and details a somewhat sloppy and awkward evolution.Constantine who ruled an ever-growing portion of the Roman Empire until his death, in 337 AD, is best known for being the first Christian Roman Emperor, his Edict of Milan put an end to institutionalized persecution of Christians in the Empire. But, was Constantine a Christian or an opportunist?Constantine was a ruthless politician who killed rivals, subordinates and family members to ensure his own rise to power and popularity. It is his lifelong dedication to personal advancement at all costs that calls into question the legitimacy of his Christian conversion. Was he a Christian or did he simply realize that befriending the rapidly growing Christian population was a great opportunity to advance himself politically?It is known that Constantine was baptized only shortly before his death in 337. Some hypothesize that his \\"deathbed conversion\\" proves he did not walk with Christ. However, Jones points out that Constantine was merely following custom at the time which postponed baptism until old age or death.Constantine personally oversaw the Counsel of Nicea, which produced what we know today as bad theology. However, we must also acknowledge that Nicea produced better and more consistent theology then what existed at the time. A clear step in the right direction."},{"Title":"Constantine and the conversion of Europe (Men and history)","review":"In my book, \\"Astronomical Symbols on Ancient and Medieval Coins\\", I devote an entire chapter to the visions of Constantine, the depiction of these visions on Constantinian coinage, and what Constantine actually saw in the heavens. As part of my research, I read numerous books on the life of Constantine, and I found Jones' book, \\"Constantine and the Conversion of Europe,\\" to be useful.There many items of interest that added to my understanding of the history of his reign, but at times I found this book to be a bit tedious to read compared to some other books about Constantine that I read. Nevertheless, Jones' book is a valuable resource.I recommend this book to all who are interested in Roman history.Marshall Faintich"},{"Title":"Ray Bradbury (Twayne's United States Authors Series)","review":"Ray Bradbury is a writer whose talents are so broad that his work defies simple categorization. Most people consider him a science fiction writer, but that is incorrect. In many cases, the science in his stories is wrong. For example, in \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" he has liquid water flowing in canals on the surface of Mars. At the time the stories were written, it was already known that no such canals existed.As Mogen very correctly points out, the science in Bradbury's stories is often put forward as a metaphor rather than a fact. Stories such as those in \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" describe human situations carried to extremes and the purpose of the science is to provide the extreme. Bradbury also captures some of the standard human fears of the future, mind-numbing routine and the unusual.Mogen's analysis of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is the best I have read. It is a story about a society where conformity is enforced by burning books. Firemen in this story do not put out fires, but set them to destroy contraband books. There is no better moment in literature than when the woman with an illegal library sits on her kerosene soaked books and lights the match herself rather than have the firemen do it. A dystopia in the classic tradition of Orwell and Huxley, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" examines a future where Big Brother exists in a small sense.Mogen briefly examines the primary work of Bradbury: his short stories, screenplays, and poetry. While there is some personal biographical information concerning Bradbury, the bulk of the ink describes his work. I have always enjoyed the stories of Ray Bradbury, considering him one of the very best writers of short stories. Mogen provides us with an analysis of some of his work, and unlike some literary analysis you appreciate the stories more after reading his interpretations than you did before. This book has motivated me to go back and reread all of Bradbury's classics."},{"Title":"Power and Identity in the Creative Writing Classroom: The Authority Project (New Writing Viewpoints)","review":"This book is a powerful contribution to creative writing theory, an anthology that provokes enormous debate about the experience, the utility, and the critical outlook of creative writing workshops in a volatile field.

The aim of the collection is to present possible pedagogical approaches to creative writing. The essays are organized in four sections: understanding the larger influences (referring to the ideas of creative writing students bring into the classroom); the teacher's place, voice, and style; course design; and, in the classroom (anecdotes about specific teaching experiences). While the essays are arranged under these headings, each offers a very specific, individual voice and argument for an approach to creative writing."},{"Title":"A Chimp In The Family","review":"Charlotte Becker's entertaining book about a baby chimpanzee enlightening the life of an urban family is a must read for a child wanting a good laugh and quick joy. I recall reading this short story when I was a lad in the second grade, and I found it to be quite enjoyable and a light reading material that made the time worthwile when I was just beginning to understand the world around me. This book was memorable because I could relate vividly to the title character being the immature and carefree juvenile that I was.The story revolves around a baby girl chimp that is brought to live in an urban apartment by the kind owner of a pet store, Mr. Davis, who introduces her to his family as the latest addition. Maggie, as she is known, quickly becomes attached to her human family and tries her best to become the center of attention. Unfortunately, the family has to keep her presence in the apartment a secret, and they must try to keep a watchful eye on their newest family member. This is quite difficult, as Maggie has the knack for doing mischief, and her antics become more and more troublesome for her adopted family. Mr. Davis comes to the realization that no matter how hard he and his family try, Maggie would never fully be comfortable with her human hosts, and her presence in the apartment could not be hidden forever. The family finally has to reach a decision on what is best for Maggie.The book provided one laugh after another throughout its delightful read. The title character brought out the child in all of us and the importance of how a child can express his/her thoughts and ideas through actions rather than words. Yes, Maggie is in all of us, and she captures the spirit of rejuvination and the magnitude of curiosity. The story provides an excellent learning tool for a young child and is certainly recommended reading. Adults may also find it enjoyable reading it to their kids."},{"Title":"Pocket Interlinear New Testament","review":"In December, 1983, I found this Pocket Interlinear New Testment by Brother Green.

We are all one; we need to accept each other and stop the violence against women worldwide. We must end war and violence in general in order to attain peace.

But Sonia has a passion for what she believes that really makes me want to re-investigate my own beliefs and feelings.She is definitely not the same person now that she was when she wrote \\"Going Out of Our Minds!\\" The last I heard about her, she was living in New Mexico, with some very unusual philosophies that included 1 - Sex is patriarchal, hierarchical, and harmful, even between women, 2 - She \\"divorced\\" her children when they turned 18, and believes that humans should be like other animals and not have anything to do with their young once they can care for themselves, 3 - She has nothing whatsoever to do with men.I love to read the way her mind works, but all of her new philosophies - I can't go there...

Woolf was a major force in the English publishing world after WWI. She wrote, she was a critic, and she published for such famous heavy-weights as Freud and T.S.Eliot. In addition, this book has an excellent introduction to Woolf and an overview of her ideas. The two essays are based on talks that she gave.I read this book three times in order to absorb all the information. The introduction and analysis are simply outstanding. The first non-fiction piece, \\"A Room of One's own,\\" is better than the second. That second essay, \\"Three Guineas,\\" is more of a general commentary. In short, this is a wonderful book with two good essays and one excellent analysis and commentary on Woolf.Woolf claims not to be a feminist. Instead she wants equality for women. These two polemics, especially the first, are opportunities for Woolf to vent all her frustrations about being treated as a second class citizen and to articulate her arguments, i.e.: she faced a barrier in the literary world as a woman. For example, she was denied a college education. The family money was spent on her brother's education, not hers, even though she was a brighter student. She had to learn Greek at home, etc. She describes much of the discrimination that she had to endure as a woman writer.Also, she describes other female writers and how they worked under primitive conditions and sometimes even with these primitive conditions were able to emerge as great writers: George Eliot, Jane Austen, etc.Woolf discusses the question: why was there no woman Shakespeare? That is a question asked by some but answered rather forcibly by Woolf. She points out that Jane Austen did not even have an office; Austen wrote her great novel such as Pride and Prejudice at the kitchen table. Austen worked in social isolation and died at a young age, as did Charlotte Bronte. How would they have developed if they had had longer lives or emerged as social forces?In the second piece she links some of the problems of the world to men and their aggressive behaviour.This is a great and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Room of One's Own (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"Obviously, the main component of this book is beautiful, clear and clever writing. This particular edition has a solid and informative introduction to both Woolf and the respective essays/lectures.

Dreaming, you say? Well, it's easy dreaming curled in an arm chair with 400 beautiful full color photographs detailing the homes-away-from-home for the privileged. These are havens where luxury is not a luxury but the norm and no request is denied.Of the 38 hotels one is hard pressed to select a favorite - they are all diverse, whether castles, palazzos, villas or state of the art modern. All boast manicured grounds so immaculately kept that they resemble Elysium. Eden-like settings give way to rooms decorated in kingly style and offering every amenity imaginable.The Danieli in Venice, Italy, offers a rooftop restaurant with a breathtaking view of St. Mark's Square. A renovated 14th century palazzo, the Danieli is the epitome of elegance with a gilded staircase and chandeliers fashioned from Murano glass. Through the revolving doors is the hubbub of the Grand Canal; inside again one returns to an earlier time of comfort, quiet, and ease.Speaking of views, the Villa San Michele was once a Franciscan monastery nestled in the hills above Florence, Italy. Today with its entryway framed by columns attributed to Michelangelo and private gardens, guests can look down upon the incomparable City of Florence.La Reserve in Geneva, Switzerland also offers a feast for the eyes as well as the appetite with gourmet Chinese cuisine. If Germany is your choice, do stop at The Regent Schlosshotel in Berlin, which was once a private palace.All of these hotels are, of course, five stars. If it were up to me, I'd give each ten.&quot;Luxury Hotels: Europe&quot; is as beautiful as the hotels it presents - a coffee table book to enjoy for years to come.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Luxury Hotels Europe","review":"Hi,I am working in the travel business.

Therefore I will address one thing and one thing alone: style. Mr. Isherwood is a man with style. The numerous new authors and avant-garde emerging today rarely care about sentence crafting; they merely create sentences as short as possible and with minimal punctuation. Their best friends are the comma and the period. Mr. Isherwood is what Bukowski would have called a man with style. Both tales from The Berlin Stories are beautifully written. Read it, please. If not for the content, please read Mr. Isherwood for his beautifully crafted sentences. I apologize to anyone who finds this review incomplete. I merely aim at reviewing one element of Mr. Isherwood's writing. I could, certainly, discuss gender, plot, themes, historical analysis, symbolism, etc., in his writings, but I'll leave the 20+ five star reviews to do that."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"Even with a study of literature you can't get to everything so I've been catching up on those we missed. I found Isherwood a fine author, a writer who has a marvelous way of painting word pictures for you. Unfortunately the mores of the time prevented him from being blunt and honest although with today's sensibilities you can eventually read between the lines. It is good to remember that long before the sun came out and it was 'okay' to be gay there were those daring souls who refused to be repressed.After a while one can almost smell the damp air, aroma of sauerkraut, and the mustiness of these houses where Isherwood slept, lived in and recorded that nihilistic licentiousness of Berlin before the catastrophe of Hitler. It's an indelible portrait of a time and place that perhaps had to go eventually."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"I'm only on page 181 in this book out of 207 but it is absolutely brilliant! Isherwood has a writing style that is uniquely his own. A great book about an older time written by someone who was actually there and it's in modern language which is not something that one sees very often. It's an intriguing look into the dark seedy vast and complicated politicaly and money fueled underworld that was 1930's Berlin. It's truly a fantastic book and I recommend it highly.Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"The Berlin Stories are significant on so many levels. First, it is an introduction to Isherwood as a youth--a man who is charming, pursuasive, discrete, wonderfully able to describe events around him--and what events they are. The book describes, from the ground level, from the mouths of Isherwoods varied friends and their antics, events just prior to World War II. Not political in style, the book instead describes the loveable or not so loveable eccentrics and inhabitants of the Berlin demi-monde and their sometimes comical political attachments. The attachments are mostly of style and expedience rather than of doctrine. The book provides a wonderful depiction of the aesthetic mind--the narrator, Isherwood himself, makes no judgements of those around him, and puts personal loyalties in front of politics. One can see in this style of mind the early predecessor of his later more Buddhist thoughts. And to boot, the story is entertaining. His characters live in the mind years after the reading. The prose is funny, exact, gifted, with a tone remindful of Fitzgerald--a chronicler of another place and time. But mostly, thebook succeeds as a window into a fine and developed literary mind--the externalization of a finely tuned, perceptive, likeable youth who accepts those around him, has a natural grace, sees objectively and without opinion the world around him, and records the tumultuous and sordid years before the Nazi takeover. This book succeeds on many levels, and is one of a kind."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"First, take note that in the New Directions Publications version of \\"The Berlin Stories\\" by Christopher Isherwood, there are a number of type-setting and editing errors which mix up pages and actually delete portions of these stories. This is unforgivable in the 21st Century.That said, Isherwood, of course was a first-rate wordsmith and a total master of the English (British in this case) language. But 400 pages of Isherwood is a lot to absorb! It took me quite a few days to work my way through this book.If these stories are at least in part - if not wholly - autobiographical, then we learn more about Isherwood than we do Germany of the time, but far less of him than of his bizarre and fascinating friends and colleagues. The characters in these stories (Isherwood aside) are beautifully and fully drawn, leaving very few details to wish more of. Isherwood himself, as self-portrayed, is mostly an observer and chronicler of the odd behavior of his friends and acquaintances. He's almost too neutral to like, yet (ego considerations aside) people seem drawn to him as moths to a flame.Make no mistake, however, if you think or imagine that you'll read about tons of scandalous sexual exploits, you'll be 100% disappointed. All \\"that\\" is left to your imagination, with only vague hints at actual dalliances, let alone specific contacts. But, truth be known, Isherwood does not shy away from his own (and others') sexuality; he merely stops short of giving you any details, especially of he himself.Some of his characters (Frl. Schroeder, for instance) become almost \\"too much, too weird, and too German\\" to stomach for 400 pages. I, for one, got often bored with and less and less entertained by these characters as the stories wore on.Isherwood is a 20th Century master of dialogue. An aspiring writer would read him solely for lessons in how to write dialogue. Thus, these stories tell you more about how people in the early 1930s in Berlin talked with each other than about their actual lives. He is very good, also, however, at soaring, perfect description. You really get the flavor of the moment - not the life, mind you, but the moment in which the characters live.During these times Germany's fate balanced precariously between fascism and communism, in part as a reaction to the horrors of the Treaty of Versailles. Mr. Norris, the main character in the primary story here, lives and breathes and works behind the turbulent political scenes - always mysteriously - and on the fringe. Norris wasn't very good at the spying thing, and eventually paid the price for incompetence. Of course, the Nazis won out, and the terrible era of Hitler ensued.One thing missing almost entirely in these stories is humor. Yes, there are funny moments, a cute line or two here and there, and little humorous episodes now and then, but, perhaps on purpose to show the ominous period it really was, these characters and these stories are not at all funny or charming. When I finished the book, I just sat there, more-or-less glad I was done with it.For the writing these stories are 5+. For the stories themselves, it's a 3. On average, then, the book is a 4."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"I am not sure if anyone else posted this, but in \\"The Landauers,\\" pages 176-177, you will find pages 176-177 of \\"The Last of Mrs. Norris\\" (I am referring to the 2008 edition published by Literary Bent with the 2 shadows on the cover).You can retrieve the pages by going to google books and searching for:The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris [and] Goodbye to Berlin'"},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"\\"The Berlin Stories\\" is Isherwood's division of two projects he apparently made while living and employed in the entitled city during the early 1930's.The first book gracefully creates a platonic British formal relationship between Arthur Norris and protagonist William Bradshaw - whose character's vocation, age and background basically match the author's.The first novel could have been published by itself. It has enough length - about 200 pages - and story to satisfy the reader without any reference to or accommodation with the second half entitled \\"Goodbye to Berlin.\\" And, the writing may be better, more thorough, more elusive, and more thought out. I marveled at his creating of a normally unobserved or usually unimportant characteristic: laughter . \\"His laugh was a curiosity, an heirloom, something handed down from the dinner-tables of the last century; aristocratic, manly and sham, scarcely to be heard nowadays except on the legitimate stage.\\"This book involves espionage, British aristocracy transcending to proletariat weakness, and ends in a gallop about Arthur's escapades around the world with his manservant Schmidt at tow (or in chase?). Full of rich dialogue between the cordial British gentlemen, the book reads more like Waugh or Forster than Fleming or mystery writers of this generation. It is great fun - most particularly in the dialogue.The second book is more Hemingwayesque. Almost a journal account of Berlin while communists and Nazis fought to obtain power over the economically disenfranchised German union which was still suffering from the tomfoolery of the Prussian state of 1914-1918. There are about 6 stories - the most richly written being entitled \\"Sally Bowles.\\" She is the character from which Hollywood's \\"Cabaret)\\" created stardom for Lisa Minelli - whose role is of same name. She is sexually free, cavalier, and extremely outspoken. The protagonist is Christopher Isherwood who is smitten by her -as are many other men - in a manner similar to Stingo to Sophie Zawistowski of \\"Sophie's Choice.\\"But, their relationship is platonic. They are best buddies. But, their friendship could go further, if there was money. As Sally says \\". . . if only I could get a really rich man as my lover . . . I shouldn't want more than three thousand a year . . . I'd be absolutely faithful to the man.\\" And, she says \\"I expect we shall look back on this time and . . . think this wasn't such bad fun. . . \\" And, they talked about his book being a hit and she rich - resoundingly like Holly Golightly speaking to her unnamed unmarried neighbor in \\"[Breakfast at Tiffany's]\\"Other books involve the a summer at Ruegen Island with fellow Brit Peter Wilkinson and his male companion Otto Nowak. That relationship is awkward and tumultuous. And, thankfully the story is not long. The following story is about Christopher's living in Berlin with the Nowaks - observing Otto fall into disrepute among his parents and peers while his otherwise doomed-for-poverty-uneducated brother may ascend as his allegiance to the Nazi party increases. After departing from the impoverished Nowaks, we meet the Landauers - wealthy department store owning Jews who give Christopher more introspection of what is happening about them as the Nazis are becoming more known, but are (at this time) unknown. In the end, chaos runs amok in the streets. People idly watch Nazi agents commit battery on the streets, shaking in fear that their protests will warrant their personal demise. And, Christopher leaves the city - knowing it will never be the same.The best offering of these stories is the depiction of Nazis in that time, during their rise. At first, they are not all pathologically perverse Aryan lauders who step on weak people's toes on all occasions. But, passages throughout the book show the writer's involvement in the communist party - so as to lead us to believe he was ignorant of what transpired at the Nazi gatherings - and how the quiet suddenly grew to a loud thunder when Hitler moved into Berlin. The antisemitism of course also grew, but not near its well known full maturity at the time of these stories. That is what makes the passages so valuable, so unique and so important."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"\\"I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking,\\" wrote Christopher Isherwood, at the beginning of \\"Goodbye to Berlin.\\" \\"Recording the man shaving at the window opposite and the woman in the kimono washing her hair. Some day, all this will have to be developed, carefully printed, fixed.\\" In the seven portraits of Weimar Berlin that comprise \\"The Last Of Mr. Norris\\" and \\"Goodbye To Berlin,\\" Isherwood chronicles his life among the demimonde in this gloriously decadent capital city. He lived there, off and on, between 1929 and 1933. These marvelous stories are a fusion of fact and fiction. With each tale, and the passing of time, the sense of foreboding and prophetic imagery intensifies, as Germany prepares to embrace Adolph Hitler.Berlin was still a charming city of broad avenues, parks and caf&eacute;s during this period. It was also a grotesque metropolis of night-people, visionaries, political fanatics - a place filled with intrigue, where vice and virtue were found in abundance - more of the former than the latter. 1930s Berlin was a powerful city of mobs and millionaires. And it was one huge salon, a center of European intellectual life where the arts and sciences flourished. This is the scene which provides a backdrop for Isherwood's stories.\\"The Last of Mr. Norris\\" is an ironic adventure story, of sorts, narrated by William Bradshaw, a Christopher Isherwood-type figure who tutors English in Berlin. An elderly British double-agent, who is a bit of a fool with a cloudy reputation, becomes involved in the bloody struggle between the Nazis and the Communists.The six \\"Goodbye To Berlin\\" stories form a relatively continuous narrative. In \\"A Berlin Diary - Autumn 1930,\\" Isherwood introduces the reader to his landlady, the infamous Fraulein Schroeder, \\"Schroederschen,\\" who calls him Herr Issyvoo. She is able to recite a history of her former lodgers by looking at the spots, stains and spillages left behind on her furniture, carpets and linens. Fellow flatmates include: Frl. Kost, a young woman, plump, blonde and pretty, who makes a living at the world's oldest profession - extremely upscale, of course; Bobby, who is a mixer at a west-end bar called the Troika, has adopted an English Christian name because they are all the rage; a commercial traveler, who is out most of the time, lives in the tiny attic which Frl. Schroeder refers to as the Swedish Pavilion; and Frl. Mayr, with her enormous arms, bull-dog jaw and coarse string-colored hair, is a music hall singer - the best in all of Germany, Schroeder assures with pride.\\"Sally Bowles\\" certainly is divine decadence, and her antics make for a wonderful story. I had a difficult time keeping the image of Liza Minnelli singing \\"Cabaret\\" out of my mind, however. I must say though, after reading about Isherwood's Sally, I have to laud Ms. Minnelli on her performance. Her characterization is indeed recognizable in this Ms. Bowles.\\"On Ruegen Island - Summer 1931\\" describes the author's holiday and the two characters he becomes involved with at a summer resort, Otto Nowak and Peter Wilkinson. Otto is a working class German youth, who uses his attractiveness to freeload off of men and women alike, rather than earn an honest wage. Peter Wilkinson, an Englishman living in Berlin, is extremely neurotic and very attached to Otto, although the two quarrel and bicker constantly.\\"The Nowaks,\\" Otto, (of Ruegen Island), and his immediate family, take Isherwood in as a lodger. As money became more difficult to come by and the effects of hyperinflation take their toll on Christopher's pocketbook, he has to economize and temporarily leaves Frl. Schroeder's relatively luxurious flat, for the slum-like, working-class projects of Wassertorstrasse.In \\"The Landaurers,\\" a wealthy Jewish family is aware of what is in store with the rise of Hitler's Nazism. Natalie befriends Isherwood, and through her so does her family. In this story the perils ahead are obvious and the Landaurers make preparations to leave Germany.And in \\"A Berlin Diary - Winter - 1932-33\\" Isherwood bids farewell to Berlin. He will not return until 1952.These are well written and important stories which paint a picture of a never-to-be-forgotten time. The language and content give a real sense of the period, and Christopher Isherwood's taut and descriptive narrative is superb.

While it certainly has its humour and a certain amount of irreverance and parody, it is a book which captures an age, an epoch, and a culture that was completely destroyed shortly afterwards, and the sense of spiralling into doom is apparent. It is interesting to see how it was not just Berlin, and the way of life there which was on a precipice, but also the English life with which Isherwood had grown up.The style is quite dry, but it captures the characters so well, that I felt that I knew them, or at least wanted to know them and be part of their world.Definitely one of my top books of the year."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"These stories are much more than fiction; they are dramatized memoirs, finely tuned documentaries.

The cycle takes three turns. First we have the Berlin stories, a group of short near comical vignettes about life in Berlin as the Nazis come to power. This is followed by the play ( I am a Camera). With the last turn, the cycle crescendos on a railway station in Berlin, 1929 ( the movie Cabaret.) And when we're through, we have some inkling of what formed the basis of what created Nazi Germany in the first place. We see the true meaning of decadence. And no, it wasn't Sally Bowles garish nail polish. It was the failure of people with half a brain in their heads to stand up and take responsibility, to be adults, to guard the weak and not abuse them. They went to the Cabernet instead.To really appreciate the greatness of the achievement, you have to go through the whole cycle - book, play and movie. But if you do, when you're finished you will be changed. Even though the holocaust is but a shadow hanging over the action, the lives and impending fates of those described will haunt you forever."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"Finely drawn portraits of Berlin in the early 1930's. The author is part of these works, ranging from a pair of novellas to accompanying short stories that describe the living circumstances and political intrusions of Berlin's hothouse cultural stew.What is particularly affecting about these works is the deep character description -- Sally Bowles, the 'Holly Golightly' floating atop the Berlin swamp; Arthur, the manipulative degenerate who bluffs his way through life and always managing to dodge retribution, and the doomed Landauer family as they watch their re-built retail empire crash under the weight of Nazi oppression.This is as close to one can get at 'true' writing -- the author clearly steeped himself in the various strata of Berlin society and doesn't spare the reader the dirty truths, hilarity, and even the slang of the time.Rewarding and revealing, these stories are accessible and well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"Christopher Isherwood captures so perfectly the sense of Germany and the German character in the late twenties and the early thirties. Interweaving the rise of Nazism as a backdrop worked so well to highlight the stories. They are are extremely well written and leave you wanting more. Having lived in Germany in the seventies, the \\"old Germany\\" was hidden under the cloud of the modern Germany but was still to be found. I thoroughly enjoyed his books and highly recommend them to the reader."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"I think I will add this to my favorites. I loved the characters, they all seems to come alive. The part of Sally Bowles reminds me of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\". What's with gay writers and gold diggers? Mr. Norris feels like a real novel. But Goodbye to Berlin feels like loosely connected short stories. There are a lot of funny parts that had me laugh out loud on the plane, but ultimately the undercurrent of rising of nazi's and people's almost ignorant altitude, especially just a \\"Allerhand\\" when violence happens, was very chilling. I found out the author narrator also stayed at Nollendorfplatz, which was where I stayed when I visited Berlin. I thought that was pretty cool."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"After a couple of false starts, I was able to finally finish this book. I read it because I had seen \\"Cabaret\\" the movie and the play. I have not seen the play \\"I am a Camera\\" by Erik Von Deutten. However, I expected a faster moving story and really had to drudge through this. There are moments that you can identify with. However for the most part you feel like a third party. You may not want to identify with some of the characters.Whatever is supposed to make this book good is lost in the details.Well I read it but I am not sure I want to read anymore of his book. I feel a little cheated when one describes his use of English and the book is over before you find this. I feel a little embarrassed at not liking it with the praise it receives, but I guess you cannot like them all."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"Based on Isherwood's real experiences in Berlin, the two novels in Berlin stories both follow the same pattern: they get you interested, and draw you into a fun world, and then they turn tragic . . . and the power of the last twenty pages is surprising."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"The first part of this book is a seemingly fictional account of a narrator's friendship with Arthur Norris, a Berliner living on the shady side of life, leading a fascinating and mysterious existence. Soon the narrator, a humble tutor of English much like the author himself, is drawn into a world of underground organizations, secret missions, and wild parties.The second part of this book is a series of vignettes, focusing on specific people the author met while in Berlin. The characters are bright and vivid, and through their stories the reader is able to get a glimpse of what life was like in Berlin as the Nazi party first started to gain popularity and people decided where their loyalties would lie.I really liked the characters examined in this book, and enjoyed the bit of history I was able to glean from their stories. I think I would have liked the second part more, though, if the author had been able to draw these characters together into a cohesive story. The diary-style writing was detailed and intriguing, but I didn't have the same investment in the characters that I would have had if I'd felt like they had some sort of story that was going somewhere."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"Christopher Isherwood lived in Berlin from 1929 to 1933 as an English teacher. This book fictionalizes his diaries. He calls himself William Bradshaw, which seem to be his middle names, and in the other half of the book he is Isherwood, or Mr. Issyvoo or Chris or Darling. He says in his 1954 foreword that he had planned to write a Balzaquian novel, but found himself not up to it. What he did instead has been published as The Berlin Stories. The result is charming and mostly satisfactory. I just wish this edition were on par with CI's writing: it abounds with printing errors (worst being the repetition of two pages instead of the new pages that should be there), and it provides no list of contents, which is annoying.Here I give you a list of contents, without page numbers:Half of the book is called: The Last of Mr.Norris. This part has 16 chapters and could be seen as a separate novel.The other half is called: Goodbye to Berlin. This consists of the following parts:A Berlin Diary (1930)Sally BowlesOn Ruegen IslandThe NowaksThe LandauersA Berlin Diary (1932-33)Friends of the film Cabaret will recognize the story \`Sally Bowles' as the core of the Broadway play, which became a musical and the basis for the film (which is lovable). (Or was it a musical from the start? Not sure.) The initial stage Sally was, by the way, Julie Harris. Isherwood gives her highest praise in the foreword. (How could you stay the same, Sally, when I aged 20 years? Which, come to think of it, is not all that much of a compliment for Julie Harris, considering the description of Sally that we get in the book.)Don't think that the book Sally is Liza Minelli. She is much less of an accomplished performer than in the film.If you watched the movie before reading the book, you will find that characters and themes have been re-combined, and that the story has been changed quite a lot. I think it has been improved.This edition has an introduction which claims that the book is something like a landmark for gay writing. That may be so, but it would be wrong to expect a political manifest for gay rights. Berlin was and is a center of all kinds of things. Many gays did and do move there, like Isherwood did. His allusions to his gayness are not exactly hidden, but also not written large. Several times he mentions the presence of \`boys', leaving little doubt, but explaining nothing. He ridicules a \`fairy', the baron, but is mum about his own tendencies. Fair enough. He is much more explicit about the SM habits of eccentric Mr. Norris, probably because that is a) ridiculous, and b) not his own problem.As for the structure of the combined book, I would have kept the Norris part much shorter. The man is a curious freak, but his domination of half of the book gives him more weight than he deserves.CI's main theme is people on the fringe: freaks and eccentrics from various subcultures, or outsiders in another sense, like the wealthy Jewish family. He is politically aware, and describes the troubles times, with poverty and street fighting between communists and Nazis, though they don't seem to concern him personally. Norris, essentially a con man, has some opportunistic involvements with communists, which are narrated like all the other exotic events: observations from outer space. That makes much sense, as Isherwood/Bradshaw is from England.There is one communist event in 1931 where Norris turns up as a speaker about British imperialism in East Asia, while most of the other speakers are addressing Japanese atrocities in China. As far as I know, those started only in the mid 30s, not earlier, so we have an anachronism of the kind that annoys me. Unless something happened in 1930 that I am not aware of, possibly related to the former German colony in Qingdao, now Shandong province, which the Versailles Contract, in the smartness of the allied victors, awarded to Japan rather than returning it to China.All in all I liked the film better. At 400 pages in total, the book has some lengths that the film never has. The explicitly bi-sexual orientation of the Michael York character is more convincing than the strangely neutral narrator Bradshaw/Issyvoo.I would give 3.5 stars, deducting for the flaws in the edition and the weaknesses of the book itself."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"Between 1929 and 1933 Isherwood lived in Berlin and, after returning in London, he wrote the novel and the autobiographical sketches that make up this volume. Just how autobiographical these stories might be is left to the reader's imagination, of course, but they seemed to be based on German eccentrics whom the author knew and whom the reader will be unable to forget.The novel that opens the book, \\"The Last of Mr. Norris\\" (published in 1935 in England as \\"Mr. Norris Changes Trains\\"), is a somewhat comic portrayal of a bumbling, vain double agent who wears an ill-fitting wig and operates in the sleazy underworld contested by Communist idealists and Nazi thugs. The narrator, William Bradshaw, is a British expatriate tutoring English to young Germans in Berlin--someone, in other words, a lot like Isherwood himself. He encounters Norris on a train, and they initiate an often bizarre, always uneasy, on-again, off-again friendship that propels them through drunken nights in sleazy pubs and dangerous rendezvous at Swiss ski resorts.In the second half of the book, \\"Goodbye to Berlin\\" (published in 1939), Isherwood drops the alter-ego and presents himself as the narrator. Character sketches alternate with \\"diary entries\\" and feature an overlapping cast, and some of the minor figures from \\"Mr. Norris\\" make important cameos. The most famous story is \\"Sally Bowles,\\" which later became John Van Druten's play \\"I Am a Camera\\" and inspired the musical \\"Cabaret.\\"Equally notable, however, is the homoerotic \\"On Ruegen Island (Summer 1931),\\" which recounts Isherwood living in a lakeside cabin with the effete, insecure Peter and the athletic, sexually ambivalent Otto, whose Nordic beauty seems transmigrated from an Aryan Youth poster. Otto appears again in a subsequent section called \\"The Nowaks,\\" about Isherwood's schizophrenic life while sharing a crowded attic apartment with Otto's dysfunctional family. The final sketch, \\"The Landauers,\\" concerns Bernhard, the presumed heir of a wealthy Jewish family who operate a Berlin department store. Bernhard's airy cynicism and adopted Eastern spiritualism thwart his business sense and ill-prepare him for the political dangers overtaking the country.Both \\"Mr. Norris\\" and \\"Goodbye to Berlin\\" share a comic esprit eventually overwhelmed by the gravity of the Nazi menace. Together, these stories are an ode to the carefree bohemians, flappers, intellectuals, and misfits who enlivened Berlin before they were swept away by Hitler and his bullying monsters."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"Originally published as a separate volume in 1939, GOODBYE TO BERLIN includes SALLY BOWLES, which was itself first published as a separate volume in 1937. Frankly autobiographical in nature (the narrator is here given as Christopher Isherwood himself), the collection at first seems little more than a series of character portraits and random events--but as the work progresses it gathers into a dark, often disturbing portrait of Berlin as Germany drifts into the control of the Nazi party, a riot of personalities and swirl of events laced with references to national anti-Semitism and cultural xenophobia, all of it combining to invite the horrors that will cumulate in the cataclysm of World War II.This is the heart of the book and easily it's greatest part, but it is accompanied by THE LAST OF MR. NORRIS, originally published as a separate work in 1935 as MR. NORRIS CHANGES TRAINS, a work that opens THE BERLIN STORIES. Substantial in and of itself, the short novel presents the relationship between the narrator (here given as Bradshaw) and an elderly and not quite likeable Mr. Norris--a man seemingly engaged in the import-export business but whose covert dealings will ultimate move him to betray even his closest friends. In terms of character and events the novel pales beside GOODBYE TO BERLIN, but in tone and scope it heightens the sense of a society in which anything, no matter how improbable, can happen, and it is very fine indeed.Readers who come to THE BERLIN STORIES with the idea that they will encounter the plot of CABARET are in for a rude awakening; although the characters are similar, the stories involved are not. In the 1950s Isherwood authorized John Van Druten to dramatize GOODBYE TO BERLIN for the stage, and the result was a critically and commercially popular play titled I AM A CAMERA. Isherwood approved of the final result--but he was considerably less fond of CABARET, which presented a love affair between Isherwood and Sally Bowles as the backbone story. Isherwood, unapologetically homosexual, was outraged, telling friends that he had never had any romantic or sexual relationship with that or any other woman. Consequently, it is best to regard CABARET as a grandchild of THE BERLIN STORIES and to read Isherwood's work for its own merits rather than this connection.And those merits are many. Throughout the entire collection, Isherwood shows a talent for creating characters that leap from the page, with the legendary Sally Bowles a case in point; his prose is also quite remarkable, an unexpected mix of the flatly direct and perceptively poetic. He writes in a style quite unlike any other author I have encountered. Many consider THE BERLIN STORIES his finest work; in any case, Isherwood's style and perspective makes it a commanding, fascinating read. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"This review has nothing to do with wonderful written parts of the book. Instead it has all to do with the printed book itself. I have received two different copies of the same edition printed by New Directions Publications Corp. in 2008 and sold here at Amazon. Both of these copies, which I have since returned, have pages 176 and 177 from the first story, The Last of Mr. Norris, duplicated in the second story, A Goodbye to Berlin. I tried to contact the publisher about the problem but received no answer from the two emails I sent to them. So if you don't mind missing the information on these two pages, which I believe would actually have explained something that isn't to be found out later on, go ahead and order this missprinted copy of the book.

The divine Sally Bowles does make an appearance (her charisma and verve are the book's high point), but only briefly, and her story only contains only seeds of what would become Cabaret's plotline. The primary similarities between the musical and its source material lie in the characterization of the aforementioned wannabe diva (who is every bit as vibrant on the page as she is in performance), as well as in the central themes and setting.Berlin, 1930 - 1933: a city caught helplessly in an inexorable rush toward history as warring political factions fight for control and the Nazi party begins its rise to power. Violence and danger lurk in every street, and yet life goes on for the citizens of Berlin - who struggle to keep a degree of normalcy in their lives and food on their tables. They desperately cling to their traditional way of life as Germany's bloodthirsty future in WWII becomes more and more a nightmarish present. They are utterly unprepared for what lies ahead for them and their beloved nation. Could they have stopped Hitler? Almost certainly, if only they had taken the threat seriously. And therein lies the tragedy at the heart of Isherwood's masterpiece: that while it may be human nature to bury your head in the sand and hope for the best when trouble comes knocking, doing so will make you a passive co-conspirator and only allow the worst-case-scenario become a fully realized reality.\\"The Berlin Stories\\" consists of two novellas that have been published together. \\"The Last of Mr. Norris\\" delves into the failure of Germany's communist party and, through the character of Mr. Norris, shows us the war profiteer at its worst. Norris doesn't care who ends up in power or what they do to Germany so long as he can use them to turn a profit and maintain his lavish lifestyle. The one complaint I have about it is that William Bradshaw's immediate friendship with the shifty Mr. Norris requires a suspension of disbelief on the reader's part. Why would he so readily trust Norris when his every instinct reveals him to be a charlatan and a swindler? Perhaps we are meant to see in William's willingness to trust Norris the larger concept that Germans eventually embraced Hitler despite their better instincts, but if that was Isherwood's intention it is a little too vague. \\"Goodbye to Berlin\\" is a series of vignettes with a writer named Isherwood (!) as its central character. The vignettes begin when it was still possible to hope for the best, and end in a cloud of violence as Isherwood is forced to leave Berlin, his once-and-still beloved city, in 1933.\\"The Berlin Stories\\" is, ultimately, an elegy for the lost Germany that Isherwood had once fallen in love with, and the reader will be hard pressed not to mourn with him as the once vibrant city of Berlin descends into chaos and bloodshed. What is truly terrifying is that it actually happened, and it is incumbent upon us to make sure that it never happens again.Grade: A"},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"Together with Evelyn Waugh, Christopher Isherwood has to be regarded as one of the most proficient writers of english this century. His ability to capture a mood, a time and a place is remarkable, his efficiency in doing so is breath-taking.The Berlin Stories stand as a record of the seediness and more fundamental corruption of a city, a state and a people in the late 30s. Isherwood represents the impending shadow of nazism through the abdication of responsibility and self-protection of individual characters. Mr Norris, a Falstaff for the 20th Century, is half cartoon conman and half based on an actual person. His depravity and crookedness is admirable, he is technicolour amid the grey shabbiness of Isherwood's Berlin. We must also remember that this is Isherwood's Berlin and he has shaped and invented experiences to achieve an effect, the camera records, but it always lies. It is the technical brilliance of those lies that sets the Berlin Stories apart from any historical or social record that you'd care to mention."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"As another reviewer implies, Christopher Isherwood is a master of prose. He succiently and subtlely captures a time, places and people in 1930's Berlin. There are some wonderful characters including Sally Bowles, who is the model for stage version of Cabaret. Indeed, Isherwood, himself, in a forward to this book, tells us what happens when he meets Juliet Harris (?), who first plays Bowles on stage around 1959.This is very easy to read; the events are a bit disheartening at times and the characters aren't always admirable--but they're very true to life. The reader, too, really gets a picture of how German people felt during the rise of Nazism. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"While nowhere near as fleshed out as \\"Cabaret\\"--the film that was constructed from this and \\"I am a Camera,\\" THE BERLIN STORIES are still great entertainment and a valuable look into pre-war Berlin and Germany.Isherwood brings to life the squalid conditions and the \\"many families in one place\\" atmosphere that adds to the gloom and doom, and also the human interactions that makeup these stories.If you're planning to delve into the land of Christopher Isherwood, I highly suggest this writing of his, along with his wonderful, though extremely extensive autobiographies. Great fodder about Stravinsky, Los Angeles, Arthur Kallman, and a host of others around the \\"LA roundtable\\" that is also a time capsule of an era we will never see again."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"Every reader seeks some form of entertainment or enlightenment. Whether it is the newest romance novel or the most cutting edge work of science the reader expects to finish a printed work with a sense of fulfillment. Christopher Isherwood more than fulfills his assigned role as entertainer in his work The Berlin Stories. Using the setting of Weimar Berlin he weaves a tale of hope, heartache, and tragedy. However, Berlin Stories is not a novel about Weimar German culture, it is a novel about humans interacting and conflicting with their environment. Isherwood's work is not brilliant as a historical work; it is a brilliant character study not seen in literature of its time. The reserve that the author shows in narrating what the person says, and what he or she does allows the reader to step into the story and analyze the characters that Isherwood sees for ourselves.Isherwood's characters are magical and memorable. Sally Bowles and her eternal search for fame and fortune, Natalia and her naive ways, and the confused Fr&auml;ulein Schroeder, and many others show us the height of the author's art. He has taken the people he has known and loved and eternalized them without any damnation. Isherwood's world is a world of decadence and tenderness, heartlessness and love. All of these qualities make The Berlin Stories a fundamental work of fiction, and an easy read."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"In the early 1930s the British writer Christopher Isherwood lived in Berlin working as a tutor teaching English to Germans. Through fictionalizations, he later documented his experiences in \\"The Berlin Stories,\\" a book that actually consists of two novellas originally published separately, in 1935 and 1939 respectively. Together they cover the tumultuous political and social spectra that constituted the city--possibly the most culturally and technologically advanced in Europe at the time--and which simultaneously tore it apart while human monsters were preparing to bring the world to war.Berlin has been suffering from a dire economy since the first World War, and extreme conditions--high inflation and high unemployment--lead to extreme solutions; Communists and the newly risen Nazis are becoming visible and powerful (but mutually opposing) political entities. To this end, the first novella, called \\"The Last of Mr. Norris,\\" builds itself from a simple meeting between two characters into a literate tale of espionage. Isherwood's narrator, William Bradshaw, meets another Englishman named Arthur Norris on a train en route to Berlin, where Norris claims to operate an import-export business, and soon becomes his friend. Evasive and habitually nervous, Norris is a subtly ridiculous figure with an unconvincing wig, a domination fetish, a duplicitous secretary named Schmidt, and a companion named von Pregnitz, a wealthy baron.The plot proceeds linearly but tensely, as Bradshaw accompanies Norris one day to a meeting of a group of Communists to whom Norris gives a speech about the combined threat of British imperialism and capitalist exploitation. His machinations are more complicated than this display of apparent hypocrisy might reveal, however. The important thing to know about Norris is that he is the most pathetic of opportunists; he has no devotions, no commitments, no beliefs, and no desires but to make enough money to live comfortably if not richly. He has created his own hell, and somehow Schmidt will always be there as his punisher, the devil on his back.In \\"Goodbye to Berlin,\\" the second novella, Isherwood casts himself into the role of narrator in a more personal and realistic series of sketches based on people he had met while living in the city. He introduces us to the unforgettable femme fatale Sally Bowles, a promiscuous English girl who sings in cabarets and plans to become an actress by any means necessary; Otto Nowak, a likeable teenager from a working-class neighborhood, the kind of place where the kids, unlikely to find gainful employment in this economy, could easily be lured to join the Nazis; and the Landauers, Jewish owners of a large department store, who stand as a reminder of the imminence of the Nazi destruction of German Jewry, of a people whose prosperity is coming to a violent end.These are not sad stories, but they convey the transience of friendship and the hardships of life in a city confronting an uncertain future. As I read, I observed that Isherwood portrays almost everybody as younger than he or she appears, indicating that Berlin at this time is a city in which people grow up, and grow old, quickly. As if to allay this unnatural aging, the dialogue is exceptionally lively and witty; Isherwood's characters are involved in what he at one point astutely calls \\"verbal card-playing.\\" As they talk, we can clearly sense their dreams and fears, and we find ourselves concerned about where the forces of history will take them, or leave them."},{"Title":"The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen...Wilkommen, Bienvenue and Welome to the book that started it all: Christopher Isherwood's &quot;Berlin Stories.&quot; This book is what the play &quot;I am a Camera&quot; by Erik Von Deutten wrote...later being adapted into the hit musical known as &quot;Cabaret&quot;, which has a lot of stuff missing from the original book.

When Isherwood returned to Berlin in the fifties, it came to him that he had been heartless and youthful when the stories were written. THE LAST OF MR. NORRIS is dedicated to W.H. Auden. Berlin is mysterious, vibrant, and dangerous. The writing is first rate. The narrator, a stand-in for the author, is youthful and untried. It is noticed that Mr Norris has a wig. There is a story going around that Norris is some kind of a cheap crook. He did spend eighteen months at Wormwood Scrubbs. Arthur Norris is a communist. He receives a notice from the political police. He is questioned about his business activities in Berlin. The narrator, William Bradshaw, gives English lessons. Other characters are Otto, Anni, Bayer, and Helen Pratt who seems to be a forthright sort. Arthur Norris's roommate is Schmidt, and then there is William's landlady, Frl. Schroeder. Norris turns up missing and William receives a letter from him from Prague and another from Paris. Berlin is in a state of unrest and William returns to England. When he returns Norris is staying at Frl. Schroeder's and several adventures ensue involving travel and deception on Norris's part. When last heard of, Norris is in Brazil.GOODBYE TO BERLIN starts with I am a camera, passive observation. The narrator here has the author's name, Herr Issyvoo. As everyone knows, this work portrays Berlin nightlife and the inimitable Isherwood creation, Sally Bowles. Sally sings badly. She seems to know everyone in the place, the place being the Lady Windermere, a bar. Sally moves to Frl. Schroeder's. She has an abortion and Christopher leaves town for a bit, realizing that he has not managed to get any writing done. Returning several month later he finds that Sally no longer lives at Frl. Schroeder's establishment. The narrator spends time with Otto and Peter. Peter is a student of psychology. Christopher moves in with the Nowak family, the family of Otto. When Frau Nowak is to go to a sanitorium, he moves out. Later he visits the sanitorium with Otto. Finally he becomes acquainted with Natalia Landauer and her family and her cousin Bernhard. In May Isherwood leaves Berlin for the last time. The book retains its interest and its freshness.

But, once in the store, Well's takes us into Ruby being Ruby as she tries on several dresses \\"just to see how she might look\\" while Max nods off in the corner of the dressing room. Since I can see myself doing that to my little brother, and since I certainly was the one sent with him to solve problems like worn out pants, I was captured.

It got worse and worse until she though to say, \\"Where's your little brother?\\" We ran to see realizing someone was hit. What a long run, and there was a man hit by a car. My brother however was on the corner watching with everyone else, three years old and in about five minutes lying on the sidewalk in a tantrum he was \\"done\\" ( it all in retrospect calls into question that adult, hum) There is something of that too in the book, as we wonder why Ruby must carry so much responsibility...Great story.

Rosemary Wells captures the essence of how young children think when they are in department stores with her wonderful prose, while her illustrations show the numerous cute expressions that cross their face as they experience something new. This is an adorable new children's book that will be quickly loved by both parents and their young children. Especially if those children are fans of the MAX AND RUBY television show.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great","review":"...that I don't get tired of reading to my 4 year old daughter at bedtime.

Every child can relate to wanting a particular item as much as Max wants his dragon shirt! The pictures in this book are quite complex---full of the hustle and bustle of a busy department store, with all kinds of different folks with different expressions--my boys really enjoy trying to figure out what everyone is thinking! I like seeing Ruby try on all the dresses---some too tight, some too big and some just plain too ugly!

It was brand new. Rosemary Wells writes good stories for children and I like reading them to the students in lower elementary. Thank you."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great","review":"I received my order in a timely fashion and the product was exactly as described. The book has a beautiful hard cover which looks like it can withstand some harsh treatment from little hands. I purchased it for my grand-daughter's birthday, who is a Max & Ruby fan. We've already read it many times over and I'm sure she'll be requesting I read it to her again! If you aren't familiar with Max, he's a 3-year-old bunny brother to older sister Ruby. My husband doesn't always like the story lines for this pair because Max sometimes gets away with misbehaving without consequences. The Dragon Shirt story stays true to this complaint, but I noticed that Ruby contributes to the problem by leaving her brother alone instead of keeping a watchful eye over him at all times. The lesson here may be directed more at care-takers than to those in our care!"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"I devoured &quot;The Unauthorized Version&quot; and &quot;Pagans and Christians&quot;, two towering works by the same author at a later period in his life. This work on Alexander gives us a glimpse of the evolution of Fox's writing as well as his views on the subject which are still fresh and surprisingly valid after all these years.As usual, Fox examines and refers to numerous ancient document, customs of the times, differences in languages and somehow makes clear to the reader even the most confusing of subjects, such as the interplay between clans, tribes, family and nationalities. What is so remarkable about this writing is the universal quality of the prose along with the surprising but perfectly valid conclusions.Many historians seem afraid to offer conjecture or opinions but Fox has deliberately gone out on a limb several times - for example, his conclusion that John, the last Gospel penned, was actually the closest to the the original sources. In this book we are given a picture of the life and times of one of the most influential person in history - as much for what he stood for as what he accomplished. This is history at its finest."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"This is not a review, only an observation of surprise at the uniformly glowing reception for a book which clearly falls short in so many ways. In spite of the general consensus, I have to say that I found it opaquely constructed, tortuously circuitous and needlessly repetitive. Historical characters, Alexander included, were not drawn with anything like the skill needed to help me identify with them. On top of this, my copy of the film tie-in edition (pictured) is littered with spelling mistakes, typos and misaligned characters. Not the author's fault, admittedly, but when you throw in smudgy illegible maps on top you end up wondering why you bothered. To anybody who thinks that this is first-rate popular history I suggest that you read Tom Holland's 'Rubicon' or 'Persian Fire' to see how powerfully the ancient world can be conjured up."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"If you are a history buff, this is a very good &quot;biography&quot; of Alexander the Great.

I found that trying to follow Alexander's route without a good series of maps to be quite a challenge."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"This is the best biography on Alexander the Great.It covers his entire life and a short period thereafter. We find Alexander growing up in Macedonia, being tutored by Aristotle, and his military training in his father's expeditions.Then we are taken on Alexander's military conquest of the known world. Through, the Middle East, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and to India.We have a front row seat on all the known battles.This book is the definitive biography of Alexander the Great.It is excellent."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"This book was a very interesting book and I found it very easy to read. Robin Lane Fox is an excellent writer and made the book very fun to read. I learned that Alexander is one of the most fascinating people of all history. He had a unique childhood and was one of the great generals of all time."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"I did learn much from this book. It helped me to see aspects of Alexander's personality, and what motivated him as a leader. For example, his childhood was surrounded by legends and stories about how he was born. Alexander, since birth, believed he was a god. His parents contributed to his feelings about who he was and what he was meant to accomplish, being a king's son and a god. Stories suggest that major events like the burning of Athena's temple happened because Athena was present at Alexander's birth. In this book Fox shows how Alexander was also motivated by the values that were present in Homer's book. Homer taught the values of glory and honor and taking pride in battle. Alexander took these values and it touched him to the point that he believed that he was part of the story. This is evident from him comparing himself to Achilles and wanting to rival his greatness in battle. While the teaching of Homer was done by Aristotle, Alexander used what he learned in his life.Fox's analysis of Alexander was presented well, and the evidence and sources he used were credible. This book made an impact on me because of the extensive use of historical sources, legends and stories that were told about Alexander, and how that shapes our view of him as a historical figure. I enjoyed how Fox said that much of the information about Alexander is scarce, so by him stating this it gives the impression that what he gathered is sound and reliable information. I would recommend this book, but the information was hard to follow because it was not just a statement of facts from beginning to end, but an analysis of his life. Fox did say that this is not a life story of Alexander and he was correct, because it read more like random facts jumbled together. Despite Fox's organization of the material I found it intriguing. However, I did not enjoy how Fox comes across to the reader as arrogant because of his statement in the preface, in essence, that his other colleagues that have written on the subject of Alexander really do not understand what they are talking about. On the other hand, it was an interesting book to read because the reader gets to understand more about Alexander's life as a person and not just as a military general. I really enjoyed seeing the development of Alexander as he first starts off as arrogant, and slowly begins to develop into a person as the book relates the experiences and situations he encounters. This book is important because it helps those that may have misconceptions about Alexander the Great and preconceived ideas about him to understand who he was more fully. While the order of the book is slightly hard to follow, the amount of time and effort Fox put into researching a subject that he's so passionate about, makes it worth reading to get a well rounded view of the hero, Alexander the Great."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"Very thorough research and detail makes some of this book a bit slow at which is fascinating first. But it leave out nothing of the history"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"Fox nails the life of Alexander better than anyone to date! The importance of Alexander on history is not just present in the level of fame he still enjoys, but in the many kingdoms we still actively study that were a direct result of his death. The Ptolemy's of Egypt to the Ottomans would not been possible with out him.I really enjoyed learning how Alexander was willing to think outside the box in order to achieve his goals. He didn't allow himself to be constrained by conventional wisdom as many of us still do today. One of my favorite stories is when he 'cuts' a knot instead of unties it in order to fulfill an ancient prophecy. He saw what he wanted and he simply took it.The is a long one, but well worth the effort!"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"This book was interesting but there are some distractions and dry areas.

It reads like an historical novel, but it isn't. Sure, there is some speculation, but based only on the author's impeccable grasp of logic and circumstances. If you want to know about Alexander the Great, but want more than a list of dates and events - there is no better book than this IMHO."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"In my view, Lane Fox&#8217;s book on Alexander is the finest in the field (followed by the works of Tarn and Hamilton). Reconstructing any ancient hero is always a daunting task and Lane Fox himself writes, &#8216;It is a nave belief that the distant past can be recovered from written texts, but even the written evidence is scarce and often peculiar&#8217;, yet I find his picture of Alexander very sensible and convincing.From the modern perspective Tarn can be criticized on many counts but among the writers on Alexander - Griffith, Hammond, Badian, Wilcken, Schackermeyr, Green, Engels, Bosworth - he stands as the tallest due to his deep understanding of both the West and the East. Lane Fox&#8217;s scholarship is an extension of Tarn&#8217;s and even though he is not aware of many hard facts about Palibothra, Chandragupta, or the rewriting of the altars by Asoka, his intuition carries him through. Lane Fox takes great care while addressing Indo-Iranian history and religion and a fine sense of balance prevails throughout the book. Although the discovery of Alexander's altars...dramatically changes the scenario his evaluation of Alexander still remains valid.In the New York Review of Books Lane Fox was once harshly reprehended by Badian as having all the qualities of an Etonian aristocrat who missed the true Alexander but this can be brushed aside as a harmless fib. He was the Gardening correspondent of the Times and probably this has added that hidden dimension to his Alexander &#8211; something absent in all other works. In a sense Alexander&#8217;s breach with his compatriots had something to do with a garden (probably in Seistan) where our ancestors opted for knowledge in preference to perpetual happiness. In this garden, as the Bible tells us, there was homonoia, not only between men and women but even among other beings. On the negative side I can point to his awkward system of writing notes which only the very determined readers would be able to master. But then who else could write that there is something fishy in Diodorus&#8217; account of Bagoas the elder&#8217;s death? This in a sense opens up a Pandora&#8217;s box. Again, to my horror, he is almost sympathetic to Harpalus.I would recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"My comments relate to a hardback edition published by the Folio Society but the same as the setting copy published by Penguin.There are notes to each chapter at the back of the book but it is still difficult to source the author's assertions.The error in the following passage ought to be obvious to all:&quot;... New Tyre stood on a walled island two and three-quarter miles in circumference, cut off from the coast by half a mile of sea, shallow at first but soon dropping to a depth of some 600 feet.&quot;If there had been a chasm of 600 feet (a depth equal to the height of a 60 storey building!) it would have required the equivalent of all the stones in the Great Pyramid of Egypt to have filled it even if it were only one-tenth the distance from New Tyre to Old Tyre. The Classical author Arrian says that the sea had a depth of 3 orguias (fathoms) at most: i.e. only about 18 feet or 5.5 metres. Perhaps a typesetter mistook 6.00 metres for 600 feet.But the Folio Society claimed (in a letter to me dated 1 October 1997) to have &quot;got in touch with Robin Lane Fox who said that, although it was impossible to verify, it was correct to the best of his knowledge.&quot; A quick look at the sea depths shown in &quot;The Times Atlas of the World&quot; reveals that one would have to sail at least 5 miles west of Tyre to find a depth of 600 feet!With such a clearly verifiable simple error left uncorrected, how many other more complex errors are there?"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"I finally stopped reading about half way through. This book is just bad. The history itself is accurate enough, considering that writing a history of Alexander the Great is no mean feat from the lack of reliable sources. However, this book transcends that into the territory of badness. First, it is long winded, but I can forgive that in isolation. Second, it is just biased and judgmental, which I can't forgive. Histories should be impartial and factual. For instance, the author dislikes Ptolemy, and makes no attempt to hide that. He's not too enamored with Parmenion either. Third, the author is entirely too interested in the fact that Alexander had homosexual relationships. That was normal, even expected at the time. Let it go. It is not relevant! Finally, I get the impression that the author is a bit misogynistic. There are several times were a conclusion is drawn that a woman is to blame without historical evidence of that, such as the burning of Persepolis. Had the rest of the book been better written it would have been forgivable, but not against the backdrop of the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"I honestly do not understand the accolades this book has received. From the start , Fox gushes how the Greeks invented politics, history, ethics, theater and writing about human drama...no one asked a philosphical question before the Greeks...come on Mr Fox!...what about the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, and other Asian societies? Did the Greeks invent fire, the wheel, agriculture as well? The book reads like a high school textbook- grandiose, superfluous,wordy, out of focus. Many reviewers applaud Fox's psychological insight. I never saw this. For true psychological insight, as well as lucid writing and thoughtful conjecture, read Peter Green's Alexander the Great. The photographs in Fox's book will serve as a useful complement."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"This book could have been considerably better if there was more on the life, more about the man and less narrative, less redundant background information, and less speculation."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"It is amazing to me that Robin Lane Published this biography of Alexander when he was a mere 27 years old. His ability to synthesize the vast of amount of scholarship that came before him and the sheer depth of his work are simply breathtaking.

Many facts have been written about Alexander over the years, some true, some doubtful and much that is pure speculation. This in turn has given Alexander a mythical quality, bordering on god like proportions.The author's writing style is both concise and lucid with no pretensions to the fact that he is the master and the reader by his very nature is the pupil. In a nutshell the author writes for everyone not just the scholar. This book is for anyone with an interest in the life and times of Alexander. The author progresses through the life of Alexander putting a little more meat on the bones with every passing phase of Alexander's relatively short life.This is a book for everyone. For those who have found it difficult, or even impossible in the past to read and I mean read a history book from start to finish, rather than just go cherry picking facts from the numerous pages, then this is a good book to get your teeth into. It can be read almost like a novel, but is far more interesting than any fictional book."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"My son purchased this book but we were both disappointed because it is a tedious read. My observation is that it is both brilliant and boring at the same time. I say this as someone who has read many historical biographies. My son read a book on ancient Rome that he enjoyed, so he purchased this book about Alexander the Great. Robin Lane Fox, the author, obviously thoroughly researched this book but it reads like a complex, boring college textbook at times. The author engages in interesting narrative from time to time but one has to search for it. I started taking it with me to doctor appts and have skipped around enough to find educational value in the book. Some biographical writers have a knack for conveying with ease complex historical material but this author does not and it is really not his fault due to the complex subject matter. I sympathize with the author because this is ancient history, not just 600 year old history. I only recommend it if the purchaser understands that this is not an easy biography to read. If the reader is looking for educational biography in an enjoyable narrative, don't buy this book. If you enjoy the historical complexities to the max of a biography, then you will certainly like this book."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"I worship ATG and feel sooo guilty because I should portend these intense emotions for the saviour, GOD and such but this man....Oliver I do not think u were much present for this direction as your commentary is wonderful but you do not even know how to pronounce your main characters NAMES...JESUS!!

Without a shadow of doubt I can recommend Lane Fox's effort as the best I have yet encountered (for Alexander buffs I include in that list of inferiors Badian, Tarn, Wilcken, Schackermeyr, Green - both of them - Hammond, Dodge, Engels, Bosworth, Hamilton, and Griffith to name but a few). Robin Lane Fox is rightly sceptical of sentimentality when dealing with his subject. Nor does he come to Alexander with his mind already inflexible and set on the King's more cotroversial aspects - a practice deplorably monotonous within the field. On ethical issues he keeps in mind the moral tone of the day - a habit that many modern historians would do well to engage in. He is rigorous in the extreme in his use of sources; he is analytical without being academic to the point of tediousness; and he deals with Alexander as a broad and complex human being - that is to say that he deals with the Macedonian as a ruler, a general, a lover, a patron of the arts, a drinker, a hunter, a reader of literature, a quester after glory, a figure of charisma, and also as a man of complexity and failings. It is in this last respect, his varied view of the Alexander, that he succeeds the most, for many of his biographers tend to concentrate on one aspect to the detriment of all others and consequently fail to give a rounded picture of the King. Lane Fox realises that oversimplifying the personalities of long dead figures does more to cloud them than to clarify them. For this he is to be commended highly. His style is lucid and often pithy. If at times you are lulled into thinking that you are reading a novel, don't be fooled; you are constantly bombarded with scrupulously researched information that is presented in the most easy going style. He gives excellent notes and a comprehensive bibliography at the back of the book for those who are interested in the finer details of source and analysis - some 60 pages of miniscule print. I gather that some have labelled this a 'boy's own account' of the ruler. That is quite simply not the case. It is far more competent AND FACTUALLY CORRECT than most of the more academic texts currently available. If you haven't read this one you simply don't know Alexander. P.S. - If you are coming to Alexander on foot of seeing or reading the recent Michael Woods effort (In the footsteps of A the G), disregard everything you heard. The BBC series was shallow, journalistic in the worst possible way, and on more occasions than one would like to believe was factually incorrect. Fox is by far the better historian. I reiterate, this is a must."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"This is an extraordinary history. Anyone expecting a conventional biography will be disappointed, since the biased and fragmentary nature of the primary sources makes modern biographical treatment for Alexander impossible, even more so than for other ancient heroes. However, one thing about the peripatetic conqueror that seems to be known with some certainty is the itinerary that defined his brief life. Starting from this, Mr. Lane Fox applies his own intimate knowledge of the middle and near-eastern landscape to create a book which, at its most basic, reads like a highly literate travelogue. This is all backdrop, though, for a kind of detective story as the author picks apart the tantalizing fragments of information and disinformation that, once boiled down, reveal for us Alexander's character. The bold military prodigy is clearly apparent here, but that's the standard textbook part of the story. Rounding out the picture, we see him as the cosmopolitan diplomat, beloved egalitarian leader-of-men, bisexual libertine, respectful supplicant to his gods, forgiving victor, gallant defender of women, ostentatious potentate, superstitious fool, charismatic orator, fearless in-the-trenches combat commander, wily tactician, boyish adventurer, child-like animal lover, sophisticated Greek intellectual, reckless gambler, visionary strategist, loyal and generous friend, bloody mass killer, and drunken lout. And the truly remarkable thing about the history is that all these persona somehow hang together, creating a believable portrait that makes it clear why Alexander has fascinated politicians, soldiers and scholars for twenty-three centuries. Stylistically, this book is dense and will deter casual readers. However, some patience through the early pages gives enough time to get into the exotic poetry of place names and the flow of the story. The turgid logic of the character study takes over from there, and the case unfolds majestically. This is a brilliant historian at work and I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"There is no shortage of books on Alexander The Great, but Robin Lane Fox supercedes them all with this grand, highly detailed and impressive work that manages to entertain, educate and excite the reader about the subject. One of the benefits of Fox's \\"Alexander The Great\\" is that he decides to do away with boring, repetitive structures and decides to use both the evidence but basic human experience to tell the tale of one of history's most fascinating kings. History, Fox explains, is motivated much by human emotion, passionate feeling aside from the usual politics. This gives his book a natural dramatic touch, it doesn't have the feel of a fictitious novel, but of a biography that really tries to explore Alexander and those around him as people. One of the disappointments in Paul Cartledge's recent biography is that he relies strictly on tablets and scrolls, and dismisses the human areas, creating characters that are cardboard cut-outs. To Cartledge everything is politics, all true relationships homosexual and any other intercourse purely done for politics' sake. Fox here gives us the portrait of a man driven by a need to discover, to reach the heights of Achilles, but also a haunted man, especially by his mother Olympias. The book is also well-detailed in the culture of the times and in his descriptions of landscapes and even home interiors, Fox manages to completely transport the reader to another time and place. Each chapter is richly detailed with not only the story of Alexander, but his influence on world history and leaders like Julius Caesar and Napoleon. We get fascinating myths, comments, tales of conspiracy and murder and one of the great interchanges of culture ever. Fox educates us about customs and rituals, beliefs and battle tactics in a work of enormous scope. It is an important thing to study the past to better understand the present. Once again we are in a time when the west is going into the east, the story of Alexander has never been more relevant. \\"Alexander The Great\\" is epic and exciting and should be sought out by anyone currently engaged in reading world history."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"As someone who reads few non-fiction books, particularly biography or history, I wasn't sure what to expect. However, since I wanted to learn more about Alexander, I thought this book appeared less intimidating than others. And what a great choice! An extremely enjoyable book that reads like a good novel, and, most importantly, you don't have to be a history buff to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"Robin Lane Fox was only 27 when he wrote his biography of Alexander, but it's twice as good as many Alexander biographies written by authors who were twice Fox's age. Fox was a very young Oxford don when he researched and wrote this book, and his immaturity shows in a few spots when he makes assertions that seem to be based on &quot;because I said so&quot;. But overall, it's a very, very well-researched and well-written biography that presents Alexander in a balanced light, being neither hagiography nor hatchet-job. It should be mentioned here that Fox's speculation that Philip's murder was probably masterminded by his wife Olympias was not original; it's specifically outlined in Mary Renault's &quot;Fire From Heaven&quot; and Renault is mentioned more than once as a resource in Fox's biography. (One might wonder why a biographer would list a historical novelist as a resource, but Renault scrupulously researched her own novels for historical accuracy before she published them.) The one jarring note in this book is Fox's substituting modern place names for historical names; it may be easier to look them up on a map but unless you already know that Ekbatana is the modern-day Hamadan, it gets a tad confusing. However, this is a minor cavil. Fox writes extremely well; his style carries you right along in the narrative, and there are voluminous footnotes for reference at the end of the book. One comes away somewhat awed that someone so young could have written such an excellent biography on one of history's most towering figures."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"R.L. Fox does a wonderful job of weaving his story of Alexander with a mix of interesting anecdotes, balanced intepretations and a critical weighing of classical literature and accounts of Alexander's life. There are few people who have so long held the Western imagination as Alexander and there has been left a myriad of references, biographies, opinions and pamphlets written about him for the past 2300 years. With so much fact and fiction, Fox deftly guides the reader not only through his childhood and conquests, but also briefly outlines some of the major conflicts in the literature and speculation about Alexander's character and major decisions.Fox is equally apt to the task of describing the world, both mythological and political into which Alexander would enter upon following his first footsteps at Troy, giving a solid background to readers who may only have a basic familiarity to the classical world.Fox's gift of description and mellifluousness ties into this book's most glaring weakness, which is perhaps more the fault of its publisher - the lack of maps and their poor formatting. Much of Alexander's feats in Iran and the Punjab are left to the imagination. Countless rivers, cities, place names and engagements that are described with such detail have no secondary visual representation. Some maps also use a topographical shading format which seems to be most effective in obscuring place names that occupy the same space."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"Try as I might, I cannot bring myself to give Fox's treatment of Alexander the lavish four and five stars that others have given. It's not that there aren't some qualities here worthy of praise, it's that there is far too much that detracts from the enjoyment.This is the first biography of Alexander I have read, so I'm in no position to compare it to others out there. I can say, however, that Fox succeeds marvelously in bringing geography to life. Despite reading countless books about events in the Middle East, I never truly appreciated how formidable the climate there is until reading Fox. Fox presents a picture that is literally Alexander against the world - against deserts, mountains, heat, cold, snakes, and disease. For this alone, Fox's biography of Alexander is worth reading. I can think of no other historian who so skilfully matches events to geography.Alas, there are some daunting downsides. While Fox's descriptions of geographic features are amazing, his maps are terrible. This is not entirely his fault; much of the blame lies with the black-and-white reprint. But even putting that aside, the maps given do not completely follow the text and are too few and too far spaced through the book to be much use. Far better to put several maps in one place at the beginning or end of the book for ease of reference. Too, Fox has a depressing tendency to talk in circles for pages on end, retelling the same event over and over and over with slight variations, then giving his own conclusions that sound an awful lot like the original version of the story presented pages before. The effect is to make the reader all the more sympathetic with Alexander's soldiers as they marched through the Makran desert; like them, the reader becomes opressed by the thought that the journey will never end, no matter how worthwhile the result will be."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"This is a well written, but wordy account of Alexander. Since this book was the inspiration for the Oliver Stone movie that may not be a good recommendation for it! What the author tries to do is bring together all the fragmentary knowledge we have concerning Alexander and discusses it in depth. He does bring a wide knowledge of ancient history to support the known views on his subject, and certain topics are debated here far more than in other biographies.At times the book almost reads like an historical detective work where the reader is placed down with the author to try and dig around the known and possibly unknown facts. Its a compelling technecque that I have not seen done before. At times though the narrative strays far from its topic, and analysis often takes over from pure study of historical facts. This can be difficult for the reader not well versed in the history of Alexander's complex life. The auhtor also assumes certain controversial opinions which have become popular recently. For one I do not necessarily agree with his very brief description of the Granicus Battle. Mr. Fox seems to belong to the revisionist school here asserting that the battle never took place as we have supposedly been lead to believe. Alexander and the Companion cavalry did not rush across the Granicus into the teeth of the Persia lines, but instead after some mysterious initial set-back crossed further down and fought the battle on the other side of the river on open ground. This theory was put forth by Peter Greene in his largely negective biography of Alexander's life and Fox seems to buy the same theory here. For sure the ancient sources are vague, as they always are, but I think a lot of reading between the lines may be going on here to come up with something new.Also Mr. Fox asserts that when Alexander invaded India the phalanx infantry discarded their long sarisa spears! All the evidence suggests that the phalanx sarisa was crucial in defeating Porus's elephants at the Hydespes. For such a statement to be made leads one to question Mr. Fox's knowledge on the military aspects of Alexander's career. The fact that footnotes are not included in the body of the text may also bother some scholars.The good writing is what largely holds this work together, and some of the insightful views and opinions, especially concerning the mystery of Alexander's death are certainly worthwhile. Those seeking a military analysis will not find that here. Fox for the most part provides only cursory information on the battles. This is more a pyschological and investigative biography and it does provide many good insights. First time readers may find some of these views and opinions confusing. A good background of Alexander's life is required to get the most out of this book. I would suggest reading one of the older works out there first before tackling this book. That way the reader can see where the difference in perspective are. But for the above mentioned omissions an otherwise promising and well done work."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"This book is insanely great. The author was shockingly young when he wrote it, but then, that's in keeping with Alexander himself. The author is so detailed and so knowledgeable, it's hard to believe anyone under 40 could have read so much. If you're into the period, Robin Lane Fox goes into marvellous detail on many fascinating points, most of which are glossed over by other authors. I wish someone had just told me to read this book and skip the others. The original works by Arrian and Plutarch only really make sense in the context of a work like Fox's.In addition, Fox isn't scared to make a few conjectures - like the one that Alexander's mother was likely the one behind his father's murder. Now that you look at it, it sort of makes sense, but the thought never would have occurred to me.I'm sure the book drives hardcore Alexanderologists (or whatever they call themselves) insane because of these conjectures, but it allows Fox to bring the man to life in a way no other author has - especially keeping in mind that no commentary direct from authors in Alexander's lifetime exists (quite like Christ, a point Fox doesn't fail to mention).I just wish I could read it again for the first time!"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"After a few sittings to Oliver Stone's ALEXANDER (which is really a fantastic and daring work of art), I decided to do some research concerning Alexander The Great. I read Plutharco's, Arriano's, E. Rice's and Claude Moss&eacute;'s biographies concerning Alexander. I recently came across Fox's book and it really conquered my deepest admiration and made me achieve a better comprehension of Stone's movie, his perspective and anthropological emphasis on the character. I highly recomend the book, which was also the prime source for Stone's script, and insist upon the need for our better understanding of the wonderful inspiration the movie really acomplished today, as to provoke so many interesting people to get in touch with this amazing historic character who was Alexander the Great."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"Robin Lane Fox's &quot;non-academic&quot; approach is commendable for being less intimidating than the more &quot;traditionally&quot; scholarly works that have rows of footnotes. Unfortunately, his writing style is much too chatty; by which I mean that he is easily distracted from his main discussion, and all too often includes unenlightening diversions that suck up whole paragraphs that leave me wondering what his point is."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"'Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee/ command the health of it?' (Shakespeare, 'Henry V').You could think of him as the young Jedi knight who, spiritually battered by war-wounds and the loss of those he loved, finally gives in to 'the Dark Side'. I re-read this volume recently, and must admit its greatness. Hitherto I had considered the Peter Green biography ('Alexander of Macedon') the better by far of these two works, now I have to agree that this is almost the equal of the other. However, I still think Green's the better-written book. But Fox's version of Alexander is also plausible - often after presenting exactly the same evidence as Green, but with a different emphasis. This Alexander gets more and more implausible as the book advances - can the Alexander who died in Babylon, after the horrors of the Makran desert (where he lost two-thirds of his army), after the death of the beloved Hephaiston, after suffering multiple wounds (one of which nearly killed him), be the same man who set out energetic and youthful, to engage in games at the site of Troy and go on to recklessly fight the Persians at the Granicus? I do not think so - yet Fox's Alexander seems at the end to be the same 'boy scout' who started the fabulous journey. Did Alexander not confront the indisputable fact that not only could he not conquer the world, but the world is unconquerable?After the incredible victories, after the submission or death of so many eminent men, he still could not save those near him. The dissolution at the end into alcohol and death, seems to me not accidental, but inevitable. A well-researched and well-written biography, if not as lively as Green's, but one which is finely textured and highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"I devoured &quot;The Unauthorized Version&quot; and &quot;Pagans and Christians&quot;, two towering works by the same author at a later period in his life. This work on Alexander gives us a glimpse of the evolution of Fox's writing as well as his insights and conclusions on the subject which are still fresh and surprisingly valid after all these years.As usual, Fox examines and refers to numerous ancient document, customs of the times, differences in languages and somehow makes clear to the reader even the most confusing of subjects, such as the interplay between clans, tribes, family and nationalities. What is so remarkable about this writing is the universal quality of the prose along with the surprising but perfectly valid conclusions.Many historians seem afraid to offer conjecture or opinions but Fox has deliberately gone out on a limb several times - for example, his conclusion that John, the last Gospel penned, was actually the closest to the original sources. In this book we are given a picture of the life and times of one of the most influential person in history - as much for what he stood for as what he accomplished. This is history at its finest."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"Although this book was written almost 30 years ago (and that in the meantime Alexander studies in both academia and the popular press have exploded), it remains a very well done account of Alexander the Great's life and achievements. Robin Lane Fox is a superb classicist who is highly versed in the ancient sources and modern scholarship, and this biography is solidly grounded in Fox's impressive learning. Fox, rather remarkably, wrote this book in his late 20s, and though it betrays some youthful self-assurance in places, it still holds up as one of the best biographies of Alexander.Alexander the Great is one of the few historical figures who is wholly worthy of all the praise and awe that have been bestowed upon in the last 2300 years. His achievements remain extraordinary and probably unparalleled in recorded history. As a man in his early 20s, he led a crack force of around 30-50,000 \\"semi-barbarian\\" Macedonians repeatedly to victory against the sprawling, centuries'-old and immensely wealthy Persian Empire. He led from the front, charging into battle with the first wave of his cavalry, and his fighting abilities and bravery were exceptional. Alexander's father, Philip II, had done much to forge these Macedonian cavalry and foot soldiers into the most capable military force of its day. They trained year-round, executed their maneuvers with perfect discipline, and were armed with a spear of over sixteen feet known as a sarissa. However, it was Alexander's almost preternatural gifts as a military strategist and tactician that enabled his Macedonians to vanquish the largest empire the ancient world had known to that day. Moreover, Alexander's personal valor (he was wounded nine times, twice almost fatally) and willingness to endure all the hardships of his soldiers, provided an example that inspired his troops to follow him confidently against enemy forces sometimes twenty times their size. Many of Alexander's Macedonians effectively fought well into their 50s and 60s.The story of Alexander crossing the Hellespont in 334 B.C. with limited funds and no real navy, going on to seize the seemingly inestimable wealth of the Persian emperor at Damascus and Susa, and ending up in 326 B.C. on the east side of the Indus River in today's Pakistan is a rich and irresistible one, and Fox takes the reader through it with historical skill and style. Fox is especially good in his periodic scholarly digressions, such as on the nature of Alexander's \\"vision\\" of himself as the son of Zeus Ammon at the Siwa oasis in the Libyan desert in 331 B.C. and on the possibilities surrounding Alexander's death at Babylon in 323 B.C.Fox is clearly enamored of Alexander's personality, and depicts him as a leader of vision and often enlightened thinking. Alexander is shown as a man often respectful of the women he encountered (such as Darius's wife and daughters) and open fully to incorporating Persians into his army and administration, as well as taking a Persian wife (Barsine) himself. However, it is in Fox's often favorable estimation of Alexander's personality that I find some problems. Alexander clearly had issues of alcohol abuse, and he often dreadfully regretted such drunken acts as his murder of his friend Cleitus and the torching of the great Persian palace at Persepolis. I do not find Fox's historical rationalizations of these acts convincing, though they are interesting to read and show Fox's knowledge of the primary and secondary sources. Ernst Badian has shown that Alexander did have a despotic streak and that his deeds were not seen in the most positive light by his Greek contemporaries, nor in the popular opinion of the succeeding classical world.Another weakness I find in Fox's book is in its apparatus of scholarly notes and bibliographies. He groups his endnotes by chapter at the rear of the text, but they are not numbered, and are very hard to sort out. I often looked for the sources of quotations in the text, but could not find them in the endnotes. It is frustrating to see a quote from one of the five main Greek and Roman ancient authors (all writing 300-400 years after Alexander) who narrate Alexander's life, and not be able readily to identify it. These later ancient biographers based their accounts on lost histories from Alexander's contemporaries such as Ptolemy and Aristobulus, and Fox often includes a quote which he identifies as coming from one of these contemporaries without indicating which later ancient Alexandrine biographer includes it.In his preface Robin Lane Fox cites the historian of Late Antiquity, Peter Brown, as a particular influence. Brown wrote his renowned biography of St. Augustine as young man only a few years older than Fox, and I can see similarly deep knowledge of the primary sources in both biographies; however Brown's work is the more subtle...AND he also provides numbered footnotes (sometimes ten to a page) so the reader can easily reference the primary sources and secondary literature. This biography of Alexander would be profitably supplemented by Peter Green's, where more of the modern scholarly debates are made clear."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"I thought the book was good, but a little confusing at times. For example when the chapter of Alexander and India it talks about the battle of Hydaspes River and then all of a sudden goes back to the start of the invasion and then talks about the battle again. I learned that Alexander was not only an amazing tactician, but also a kind man to some people. I would recommend this book to those who like ancient history and have enough time on their hands to read it. Yes I would say this book is \\"Important\\" for people who have been able to achieve so much should be remembered and this book goes into great detail of Alexander."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"There is no shortage of biographies on Alexander the Great. This one from Robin Lane Fox, now over three decades in print, may be the best.Fox seeks to retrieve, from the murky depths of the ancient past, Alexander the man, chipping away at the myth and libel that have become part of his towering historical identity to reveal the fundamental character and motivations that drove the greatest conqueror in military annals. This is a biography that dwells more on Alexander's relationship with his mother and father, his early education and fascination with Homer, his lifelong interrelations with childhood friends, and his religious convictions, particularly his personal relationship with Zeus than it does on his conduct and strategy in his epic battles at Issus and Guagamela. A reader looking for the military history of Alexander the Great should be advised to consult JFC Fuller's classic account instead.The author makes much of Alexander's trip to Siwah in North Africa and attaches critical importance to whatever he asked and learned there from the oracle, which is now lost to history. Fox claims that he learned that he was the son of Zeus in the form of Ammon.Fox puts forth a number of controversial assessments, although he concedes that almost nothing about Alexander can be known beyond doubt. One significant claim is that the Persian general Mazeus may have betrayed Darius at Guagamela, which would explain why Mazeus gave up Babylon so easily after the battle and was immediately retained as satrap for the city, one of the greatest in the world. If true, such a revelation would do much to undermine one of Alexander's greatest victories.Later, Fox argues that the burning of Persepolis, one of the most egregious acts of the Macedonian invasion and one that Alexander quickly came to regret, may have been egged on by a woman traveling with his army, Thais, who was Ptolemy's mistress and mother of three of his children, which explains why Ptolemy hid her role in the debacle in his later history. Meanwhile, Parmenion is cited as a brave and competent general who was slandered by Ptolemy ex-post-facto to sully the aged and murdered general's reputation and burnish Alexander's. Indeed, a critical theme of Fox's narrative is the competition between Callisthenes, Ptolemy and Anaxarchus for writing the official history of Alexander, with Ptolemy coming off as a craven self-promoter, but ultimately successful in acquiring untold riches for himself in Egypt and bequeathing to posterity his version of events.In other areas, Fox calms the waters that usually rile in other biographies of Alexander, especially in explaining the impact of his adoption of Persian dress and customs and the nature of both his and his lover Hephastion's deaths. Fox sees the murder of Cleitus as a personal, alcohol-fueled brawl with no political motivations (resistance to the Persian customs) whatsoever. The same goes for the ordered killing of Parmenion after the exposure of the plot of the pages and Philotas' role in it, as well as the execution of Callisthenes. Fox maintains that these were all cases of jilted, older men who saw themselves losing standing in the army, not rebellions against the invidious influence of Asian customs and satraps.Fox devotes much time to uncovering the likely nature of Alexander's untimely death at Babylon. There are two competing versions known to history. The first, a pamphlet written by one of Alexander's closest associates and chosen successor, Perdiccas, that describes an elaborate plot by Antipater in Macedonia to poison Alexander at an elaborate banquet held by Medius, a Companion from Thessaly. Fox dismisses this story out of hand, claiming that there was no poison known to man at that time that would have killed so slowly, as Alexander survived nearly two weeks after falling ill at the party. The second version, from contemporary diaries, claim that Alexander died from excessive alcohol consumption in the month leading up to his death, a perspective promoted by Antipater and his son, Cassander. Fox rejects this tale, too, as highly improbable. Rather, he suggests that Alexander likely succumbed to one of the many fevers endemic to the area, possibly malaria.If you've read every book available on Alexander or are looking to read just one, Robin Lane Fox's \\"Alexander the Great\\" should be on your list."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"I knew something about Alexander the Great before reading this book but it's still full of surprises. Firstly has to be Robin Lane Fox's mass of knowledge (and informed speculation) about such distant events. I never realized the depth of Alexander's Homeric influence or the extent that he adopted the Persian imperial style after his Asian conquests.He shows Alexander to be an interesting blend of detailed practicality and wild ambition. He believed that he was a Greek God and had an endless reckless drive but could still make detailed preparations, careful tactical decisions and work out successful relations with troops, allies and defeated nations. So successful in fact that by age 32 he was by far the richest man in the world with an empire covering some 2 million square miles.One difficulty with the Classical world is that it's so different from own. The Homeric ideal of conquest, valour and generally Might = Right doesn't sit too comfortably with modern ideas of democracy and peaceful co-existence. Lane Fox can see the problem but opts firmly for the glory of Alexander in his Homeric ancient world context."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"I can not offer a history buff's review here, I admit to buying this book on a whim without really knowing that much about Alexander or his time.That said, I have no means of knowing where Robin Lane Fox has his facts right and where he might be wrong.But what I can say is that reading this book you keep forgetting that you're not reading a novel!Biographies -especially those about people and events so far removed from our own experiences and world view- are always in danger of being too dry, too difficult to follow for \\"normal\\" readers who haven't studied history.Sadly that's why most \\"normal\\" readers rarely even try reading a biography and trust movies and such instead.Robin Lane Fox has succeded in writing a biography that is both fascinating to read and (hopefully) accurate."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"I've picked this book up in a Florida mall basicly because the movie just came out featuring Colin Farrell.

Who? I think that he was an explorer of worlds rather than a killer of man.

Mr. Fox takes a cheap shot at the Bible as well by calling the Bible account of Esther \\"a myth\\" all the while acknowledging the accuracy of Persian king's harem problemscontained therein.

I have been a huge admirer of Alexander the Great since my childhood. I thought I would read this book on his life before the movie \\"Alexander\\" came out (which was awful by the way) just to see if the film was accurate in its portrayal. I don't have nearly enough knowledge to dispute what the author wrote, whether this or that event actually happened or when a certain battle took place. The book gets a bit confusing at times since it is so detailed, but it really allows the reader to see all the power struggles and politics of the time. It's not an easy book to read, but it's very enlightening. I can see how it might be \\"too much\\" for some readers, such as myself. I felt it was a bit too indepth at times. The author does a good job at pointing out how one event may have been documented in two or more ways and usually states what really must have happened.

Lane Fox was taught classics at Oxford by some of the century's heavyweights - George Forest, Andrews etc... and is himself a renowned teacher. His book is ten times better than the stilted prose of most modern academics. Homer's influence, his father's legacy, the campaigns, the famous Last Plans all covered. The final few pages show a feel for a subject very very rare in modern academia."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"This book is the 7th book I read on Alexander, and I find it the most thorough one. He looks at events and episodes from all sorts of different angles, both pro and con point of views, and write as many variations of stories as he could get on the same events. For example, on Alexander's death, he writes 3 or 4 different versions told or written by different people back then. Some say the King was poisoned, collapsed during the drinking party, some say he died of unknown fever, some say this and some say that. Fox lists out all the possible versions on the same events, carefully examines them, and writes his comments with good common sense, keeping himself on the neutral ground. He rarely says this is what happened. It is for you to decide.He also added other information such as the way of life back then, the way different peoples thought, lived, believed, treated each other, religions, how they understood divinity and the way they fought in war, in addition to the geography, culture, medicine, plants, food, clothings in various areas of the empire back then. It is interesting to find how all these things affected and related Alexander and what he did.As he says in the beginning of the book, this is not a biography but a search of Alexander the Great. So, there's no straight telling of what had happened.Fox's insight is deep and thorough, makes you think. It's not just a study of one man, but a study of human kind. But if you don't have a logical mind, it may bore you, because sometimes he hangs onto one event, spending 3-4 pages sometimes even more on just one thing, to investigate. Very informational and powerful work.My only complaint is that this edition has such fine print, the font size is so small (probably size 6 or 7), and to read more than 500 pages with the kind of small print wears your eyes out. It made me realize that it's about time for me to get bifocals. I strongly recommend this book, but keep a magnifier at hand, rest your eyes once in a while."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"Biographers of Alexander the Great seem to tell us more about themselves and less about their subjects. Lane Fox is no exception and we can be thankful that he is sympathetic, enthusiastic, courageous, (he was very young when tackling this huge subject,) big minded and scholarly. Compared to A. B. Bosworth (a serious scholar, a historian without a shred of historical empathy, and a dreary lecturer) Lane Fox is pure joy. The mythical general reader will find the scholarship profound but not heavy, the story dramatic but not insincere, and the man accessible but not easy. It is Lane Fox's Alexander and Lane Fox is an aristocratic Englishman, but surely an aristocratic Englishman of Lane Fox's ilk with his martial tradition, his love of hunting, his developed sense of autochthony, and divine favor has more to tell us about Alexander than a republican Australian with a horror of bloodshed?"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great (Library of great lives)","review":"Robin Lane Fox hit the mark with this book. ALEXANDER THE GREAT is not simply the overtold story of the Greek conquest of the eastern known world.

Do not expect to plow through this book in one sitting. Additionally, this book could well do with additional maps. The occasional black and white maps are infrequent and difficult to read. It was difficult to keep pace with the narrative and have a clear understanding of where the action was taking place. This is especially true of the chapters dealing with Alexander's conquests in Persia and India.

Thirteen years later, he would die just a few weeks short of his thirty-third birthday. But in his short time as ruler, he forged an empire that comprised over two-million square miles, stamped the face of Greek culture on the Eastern lands of Persia and Asia, and was never defeated in battle. His exploits have only been surpassed by the teachings of Jesus Christ, and have come to shape the world in which we live in today.Robin Lane Fox has written a glorious account of the life of one of the greatest individuals to ever grace the world stage. He not only covers the most memorable events of Alexander's rule, but even the little-known events in his life. Through Fox's book, we get to know Alexander as a man, as well as a great military leader and king. His accounts of battles such as Granicus River, Issus, and Gaugamela are riveting, challenging even the best of historical fiction with exciting conflict.Robin Lane Fox's book is exceptional, without a doubt one of the greatest biographies ever written. Exciting, refreshing, and at times emotional, this book will give everyone a refreshing look at the man who changed the course of world history.

He would basically say, \\"No, we're not going to talk about it, we're going to screw instead.\\" I paraphrased, of course, but it was pretty much the same result every time. She would want to discuss whatever he was keeping from her, and he would insist on having sex instead. And she would give in. Again.The sex scenes were blah, and it seemed more like some chemical reaction that made them need to rut constantly than a passionate need to touch each other. I get being in love and this wasn't it for me.I got to 83% and finally decided in the middle of a paragraph that I really just didn't care what happened to any of the characters or care how the book ended or care that I was leaving a book unfinished.

So it remains to those who retain their honor, the Black Knights, to protect humanity from their brethren. And Black Knight Jason has lived only for his duty, keeping himself apart from regular humans, until he finds the woman he just can't resist, genetic research scientist Holly Heart, the woman he is assigned to protect, the woman who is in the sight of his twisted former comrades.I stumbled on Underground Guardians Protector looking for Kindle cheapers, and since this story and (Healer) were the books which inspired Jones' new Zodius series (whose first book Michael was on my TBR pile) I decided to give them a shot.Having read other more recent books by Jones (and being a bit into her newest, Micheal, now) it was kind of neat to see by comparision how much Jones has refined her craft in the 7 or so years since she wrote this book. I am not saying this to be negative because even though Protector lacks some of the polish Jones has gained over the years I thought that the idea behind the Underground Guardians had potential so it will be interesting to see how Jones' has transformed her original idea in the new series.My biggest nit with the story looking at it on it's own and not as the genesis of the new series is that the hero is a bit of a coward when it comes to trusting the heroine to choose him and he hides the truth of his nature and their bond from her for way too long, only doling out a bit at a time, instead of laying his cards on the table and allowing her to choose. His rationalization that he's not trying to force her decision to accept the mating between them, and instead allowing her to accept him genetic oddities and all, didn't quite play for me. What did work for me, was the vulnerablity that inspired this behavior, Mason and his best friend and fellow Black Knight Sterling had it in spades, and Sterling has some pathos potential going on, so I am glad that he will be getting a book in the new series, since he got passed over in the old.(FYI for kindle readers, I didn't skew my rating because of this, but there are some minor formatting issues - extra page feeds - in the kindle version that make the story feel a little choppy)flag"},{"Title":"Underground Guardians: Protector (Book 1)","review":"I thought this book had lots of promise and I really wanted to like it. What ended up happening was I got very frustrated and said to heck with it and quit reading.The author clearly knows what is going on with the characters, but kept it ambiguous to the readers, instead of building suspense, it felt clunky. Also because this supposed to be a \\"racy\\" romance, the heroine and hero kept having heavy breathing thinking about sex moments that to me just felt like they interrupted the story line. I get they need to have sex for the story line to progress, but it just did not gel for me. It would be story story story, (oh this guy or girl is so hot and I am so horny for them) oh I lost my train of thought, this hot guy/girl just makes me lose my focus what was I thinking of? Oh yes, the fact that I am watching her for a bigger purpose/the fact that I am a geneticist that needs to be more trusted by government - oh - He/She is so hot, how can I think?I read I don't know how many times about a how perfect a male specimen this guy was, I don't need that multiple times, give me a description, don't tell me.This probably is not a horrible book if you have not read any of these \\"super soldier\\" types before. I for one preferred Laura Taylor's Intimate Stranger - that was a great read and balanced everything nicely.You might like this book if you are newer to the genre and have not read similar stories. I am just at the point where when I read a book I want it to have a good story, and if that is interrupted I am not interested. If you want hot books with good story lines check out Lauren Dane."},{"Title":"Underground Guardians: Protector (Book 1)","review":"Overall, the book was okay.

Before you remind me, I know that I have a serious problem, which is probably a good topic for another post all by itself, so it's safe to skip the lecture and carry on with the review.As long as we're on the subject of problems, I suppose now would be a good time to admit that I have a serious weakness for alpha males. I'm not quite sure who to blame on this, but several authors (along with a long list of loving book bullies who all know who you are) come readily to mind. I'm not exactly sure when this happened either, but it did and now I have to deal with the consequences. *sigh* When I read the description of this book I have to admit, I wasn't sure. I usually like my alpha males with fur and/or fangs. Who knew an alpha with an alien slant would fill the bill? I suppose this means that I now need to add aliens to my list of alphas.Mason was strong, possessive, damaged and considered himself totally unworthy of love. Yet he couldn't bring himself to pull away from Holly. All the traits that make up a perfect alpha. Holly was strong, determined and damaged in her own way. The collision course they were on was inevitable and intense which turned Protector into a surprising page turner.This book probably isn't for everyone. It's steamy almost from the beginning and alphas will be alphas. If you understand the concept and can wrap your mind around the intensity of that type of attraction, then this is the read for you. There was also plenty of action, twists, turns and allie confusion to go along with the hot and steamy scenes to keep your attention.I was glad to find out that this is part of a series. There were a lot of lose ends and places for the story to continue at the end. Not necessarily a cliff hanger, but it did leave me wanting to know and read more. From what I read, the next book doesn't center on Mason and Holly but the story line was left wide open to return to these characters in the future. I will definitely be looking for more installments of the Underground Guardians."},{"Title":"Underground Guardians: Protector (Book 1)","review":"I started out reading this author's Vampire Wardens trilogy.

The plot was pretty good which is one of the main reasons that i kept reading. I think the thing that got me the most is that this book left VERY little to the imagination. There was definitely a lot of heat but at times it felt like i was reading a hardcore porn flick instead of an actual book. The characters were ok but after a while the Holly Heart started to get on my nerves. There were some grammatical errors as well as several unnecessary sentences. Like I said, it left very little to the imagination.Overall, I did like the book because the overall plot was good and I enjoyed the fact that the author focused mostly on the main characters and plots and didnt waste time with a ton of unnecessary side stories. I liked Mason and Sterling and loved their friendship.

The tension between the two -isms, though partially a function of the fact that Capitalism is associated with Protestantism, was for the most part a fairly natural result of capitalism's dependence on individualism and self-interest, as opposed to Catholicism's hierarchical and authoritarian structure and Christianity's requirement of selflessness and charity.The three essays in this collection, originally delivered as the Pfizer Lectures at the American Enterprise Institute, address the future of the corporation, intellectual property rights, and corporate governance. They are unified by the way in which Novak treats business and the corporation as institutions which have important moral roles to play in society. First he discusses the fact that corporations are voluntary associations, which allow individuals to work together in ways that make them more powerful and effective than they could ever be on their own and which serve important social ends :From the point of view of civil society, the business enterprise is an important social good for four reasons. First, it creates jobs. Second, it provides desirable goods and services. Third, through its profits, it creates wealth that did not exist before. And fourth, it is a private social instrument, independent of the state, for the moral and material support of other activities of civil society.In fact, he argues, the effectiveness of corporations in providing goods and services, in creating wealth, jobs, and opportunities, and in providing a counterweight to the power of central government, makes them second in importance only to religious organizations in terms of the role they have played in creating and guaranteeing democracy.In this section he makes the really intriguing point that some of the earliest capitalist corporations were born out of the Catholic monasteries of the Middle Ages. He quotes the great modern Tory historian Paul Johnson to the effect that :A great and increasing part of the arable land of Europe passed into the hands of highly disciplined men committed to a doctrine of hard work. They were literate. They knew how to keep accounts. Above all, perhaps, they worked to a daily timetable and an accurate annual calendar--something quite alien to the farmers and landowners they replaced. Thus their cultivation of the land was organized, systematic, persistent. And, as owners, they escaped the accidents of deaths, minorities, administration by hapless widows, enforced sales, or transfer of ownership by crime, treason and folly. They brought continuity of exploitation. They produced surpluses and invested them in the form of drainage, clearances, livestock and seed...they determined the whole future of Europe; they were the foundation of world primacy.This is ingenious both for the insight that the great innovation that these first corporate entities offered was continuity, of a type that was not available to individuals or even to families, and for the way in which it implicates the Church in the creation of capitalism. Novak's writing is characterized by this unique combination of perceptive analysis on general issues combined with more subtle demonstrations that capitalism and Christianity are and have been compatible.The second section, on intellectual property, is so compelling that it actually made me rethink my position on Napster. Most of us have been tape recording albums, videotaping shows, &quot;borrowing&quot; computer programs, and now burning cd's, for so long that we've become inured to the idea that the underlying products are ours to exploit and that this will have little or no effect on the artists who create this product. Novak draws upon Abraham Lincoln's 1850 Lecture on Discoveries and Inventions in order to make the case that protection for patents and copyrights is one of the central innovations of the American system, one that deserves to be defended. He points out, for instance, that the right of inventors and authors to receive royalties is the only &quot;right&quot; mentioned in the body of the Constitution. It can hardly be a coincidence that the country which affords such creative activity the greatest protection has been the most creative nation. Novak discusses the ways in which these protections, which reward those who are willing to share their ideas and to take risks to develop them into products, have served to benefit not merely the innovators themselves but the society at large, and concludes :Patent regimes recognize the right of inventors and authors to the fruit of their own labors as a right in common law. They do so because this right serves the common good by stimulating useful inventions and creative works from which a grateful public benefits. Far from protecting private interests at the expense of the common good, patent protection advances the common good by means of private interest. The common good is the end, private interest is the means.Here again, we see that although it is often blithely assumed that capitalism serves only individual interests, it is in fact the most effective way for society in general to achieve progress.In the final section, Novak discusses the various threats to the corporation presented by the various efforts to change how they are governed. He cites Michael Oakeshott's differentiation between the &quot;civic association&quot; and the &quot;enterprise association&quot; :The civic association aims at something larger than any particular end, interest, or good: the protection of a body of general rules and a whole way of life; in other words, the larger framework within which, and only within which, the pursuit of particular ends becomes possible, peaceable, and fruitful. Given such a framework, individuals are free to choose myriad activities. The state is a civic association, he thought, or at least should be; so is the church; and so are many kinds of clubs, charitable organizations, and associations for self-improvement.... By contrast, Oakeshott noted, the enterprise association is built to attain quite particular purposes... Enterprise associations are focused, purposive, instrumental, and executive: they fix a purpose and execute it.The problem that corporations (enterprise associations) now face is that politicians and political activists are trying to blur these lines and turn them into civic institutions, with responsibilities for meeting all kinds of political and social purposes. This diffusion of aims, unwise as it may be, is perhaps appropriate for government organizations : if affirmative action and the like are going to be implemented somewhere, better that it be in government which is already moribund. But one need only look at the havoc such social experiments have wreaked on the military [as Stephanie Guttman has done in her excellent book : The Kinder, Gentler Military: Can America's Gender-Neutral Fighting Force Still Win Wars? (2000)(Stephanie Gutmann) (Grade: B+)] in order to see the disastrous effects of making an organization with a single purpose (being prepared to fight and win) try to satisfy a multitude of political purposes (gender neutrality, acceptance of homosexuals, etc.). Such fiddling by the political class has rendered our once mighty fighting forces politically correct, but much less formidable.Corporate America now finds itself prey to these same pressures. Already overregulated on the environmental, labor, and other fronts, business finds itself under attack for not being sufficiently socially conscious. They are being asked to ignore the bottom line, to eschew profits, and to instead focus on their role in local communities. It is supposed that society would be better off if corporations were governed so as to &quot;benefit&quot; their employees and their neighbors, and governed in the way that government thinks fashionable at the moment, rather than being run with mere efficiency and profits in mind. One would have thought that the long and disastrous European experiment with Socialism and the spectacular failure of Japan's once vaunted economic planning would have put this argument to rest, but, alas, such is not the case. There will apparently always be a class of activists, politicians, and bureaucrats who believe that they, if given the opportunity, could run the economy. But having seen how inefficiently they run our governments, we should resist them at all costs.In this book, Michael Novak is really trying to steel business people, to whom the initial lectures were addressed, for this fight. He seeks to warn them that they must not give up the freedom from government interference which has made American industry so uniquely creative an"},{"Title":"The Fire of Invention: Civil Society and the Future of the Corporation","review":"... and the rest of the western world.

Marcia Davenport's superb 1936 novel &quot;Of Lena Geyer&quot; has for its heroine a soprano of spectacular talent, a woman who casts a brilliant spell over her admirers, the ones who adore her unquestioningly as well as those who challenge her. It's not surprising that this was one of Ingrid Bergman's favorite books; she tried for years, unsuccessfully, to have it produced on the screen. The story opens with Lena Geyer's funeral; and the various mourners remember what they know of Lena Geyer, so that the plot unfolds as a series of post-mortem reminiscences. Most of the memories are generous, though this complicated artist's temper and prejudices are frankly described. Lenzka Gyruzkova is a dumpy Bohemian adolescent, a charwoman's daughter, when musically-trained men recognize in her a quick ear and a radiant voice. She masters roles easily, and she eventually becomes an important star in both Europe and America. Her repertoire is formidable, everything from Carmen to Isolde. Though she engages in a passionate, jealous affair with a man of incredible wealth, her marriage is to a protective father figure. In fact, she resembles Maria Callas; but Callas was only thirteen when &quot;Of Lena Geyer&quot; was published. Like so many real-life divas, Lena has many physical problems, and she does not enjoy a long life. But her death bed is surrounded by her devotees, who see her breathing the last words of the Liebestod: &quot; ... ertrinken, versinken unbewusst h&ouml;chste Lust!&quot; The novel is deceptively biographical (you'll find yourself thumbing back to an index that doesn't exist) and technically historical, because the fictional Lena interacts with people who really lived: Lilli Lehmann is her advanced teacher, Mahler conducts when Lena sings Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and Jean de Reszke is her co-star in &quot;Tannh&auml;user&quot;. Needless to say, &quot;Of Lena Geyer&quot; is a cult favorite with opera buffs, but the average reader will certainly be able to appreciate this expertly written novel. A Trivia Pursuit footnote: &quot;Of Lena Geyer&quot; is dedicated to Alma Gluck, a Met soprano of the First World War era (who, incidently, is mentioned in fictional context). As it turns out, Alma Gluck was Marcia Davenport's mother. I have no idea who Mr Davenport was, but Alma Gluck's second husband was the violinist Efrem Zimbalist, with whom she toured in concert. This means that Marcia Davenport, the author, was the half-sister of Efrem Zimbalist Jr, the TV and film actor."},{"Title":"Of Lena Geyer","review":"I've just finished for the 2nd time this old \\"warhorse\\" of a novel, and it really does not disappoint. The other review here (an excellent one, btw) covers most of the highlights, so I won't rehash the rehash.... I highly recommend this nove to all young singers. Thank goodness the character of Lena Geyner is a work of fiction...no one could ever match her standard of perfection, but it is a standard, none the less, it is a noble standard. While she did have an unfortunate early life, she speaks four languages fluently (she had a \\"natural ear\\"), she never struggled with her vocalism, she never struggled (really struggled) with self-discipline, she never realized what a bore she was when it came to music.... she could sing ANYTHING.... oh, she worked hard, but she loved to work hard... She was a great \\"opera actress,\\" a faultless interpreter of all that she sang. And she created a frenzy where ever she sang... She never gave a bad performance. Nope, she saved them all up for a major vocal/physical collapse... Mahler LOVED her, Lehmann LOVED her, Vestri (a fictionalized Toscanini) adored her artistry....blah blah blah... what a bore she is, but you still can't help but love her. She loved to eat, she loved to practice, and she walked for two hours a day.I suppose if she hadn't finally passed away in the novel, she'd still be singing fantastically, looking fabulous doing it, 100 years later....Lena Geyer was a GODDESS OF MUSIC...And an impossibly hard act to follow.Guess I'll remain a legal secretary afterall."},{"Title":"Submarines of the World (Expert Guide S.)","review":"..This is THE book.....whatever it lacks in physical size it makes up for INSIDE the covers!A full history of all major submarines from their inception to the present from ALL countries is what you find.

It helps to have some interest or fond memories for glam rock, but the chapters about performers one may not know that well or never cared for (e.g., Suzie Quatro, for me) are as compelling as those about ones personal faves. While some of the discussion may be a tad academic for the casual reader, I urge the casual reader to read on, because he will learn something and be entertained. The author is well aware that writing a book is a performance of sorts, and does not ignore his obligation to keep the reader entertained even as some sophisticated and/or obscure concepts are dealt with.Full disclosure: the author is a college friend of mine and I am thanked in the credits for having read over a few chapters in draft. - Peter Shapiro"},{"Title":"Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music","review":"Glam Rock was a short lived moment in popular music that essentially lasted only about five or six years, say from 1970 to 1975. In 1970 we were long past the time when Ed Sullivan would only show Elvis from the waist up. The pill has made basic changes in the outlook of the young towards sex. Here in the US, the Viet Nam war, Watergate and Kent state were changing the view of the people.In music the time was ripe for a change and a series of musicians did that with a new form of rock that featured extremely theatrical performances with outrageous (for the time) costume, makeup and sets. This was called Glam Rock. It drew upon the history of previous styles of rock and added a theatrical aspect to music that was minimally modified.This book traces the history of Glam Rock from its beginnings with T. Rex and goes through the advent of Suzi Quatro. It explains what Glam Rock was and a bit about how it evolved into the next phase of music."},{"Title":"Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music","review":"Although I've only recently begun to read up on performance studies, it seems to me that Auslander has chosen a particularly illustrative case study in glam rock. Within a genre so explicitly focused on the construction and performance of identity, it's actually a bit surprising that this book hadn't already been written.While Auslander comes from the performance studies tradition, Performing Glam Rock also serves as a great overview of the genre. The book includes a great deal of history, making it a worthwhile read for anyone interested in the genre. The big guns are profiled in depth to illustrate the glam's traits: Bolan (style), Bowie (theatricality), Roxy Music (gender) and Suzi Quatro (more gender, specifically female masculinity).Overall, an accessible and compelling read."},{"Title":"Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music","review":"Performing Glam Rock does a brilliant job of explaining this elusive moment in rock history. For the first time we have a book which makes sense of glam: pretty boys (and one girl) in lurex and make up who swept away rock's no-performance code. As Phil Auslander shows, glam subverted rock's gender sterotyping too, and opened up the possiblity of new kinds of expression around sex and identity.Along the way we get some engaging, funny and always insighful anlysis of the performance of glam artists from Bolan to Quatro.

He beholds the war-torn Europe after Napoleon and is a witness to the emerging nationalism of all nations. He blends his song of independence for all countries or peoples into a long and rich song of nature that mixes historical references, mythological recollections and all other connections he deems natural and useful to give universality and even some kind of a new power coming from the faith in the ability of men to free themselves and to reach up to the realisation of their potentials. The form is also very engaging : a ballad with some songs here and there. The rhythmic and rhyming patterns are fluid and delicate and Lord Byron reaches a rare power and, should I say, finesse in the use of the form.

Who knew, however, that this seemingly eccentric man would turn out to be nothing more than a deranged killer?Desiring to distinguish himself in the world of competitive athletics as a pentathlete but found wanting, he finally decided to become a patron of competitive athletes. First, he supported the sport of swimming only to ultimately switch his support to that of amateur wrestling. Building a professional complex on his property where such athletes could train, his bizarre behavior and heavy drinking drew notice, but his patronage was too enticing. Consequently, his bizarre behavior, which was to grow more bizarre with time, was rationalized away.By the time serious concerns about the state of his mental health were afoot, it was simply too late. Du Pont's greatest hope for recognition of his patronage in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was through 1984 Gold Medallist, Dave Shultz.

John du Pont did stand trial in 1997 for the murder of Dave Schultz, and was convicted of third-degree murder, instead of the top count of first degree murder for which he was indicted. The jury also found him to be mentally ill. In 1999, du Pont settled a wrongful death suit, brought by Schultz's wife, for thirty five million dollars."},{"Title":"Blood Money: The Du Pont Heir and the Murder of an Olympic Athlete","review":"Great and scary story about DuPont and he's relationship to the sport.First 50 pages are kind of boring if you are looking for a stories about wrestling, because the beginning of the book is about the life of DuPont and he's roots.End of the book is really intresting and you will be reading very crazy and unusual stories what this guy did.Must read book for every wrestling fan."},{"Title":"Polybius: The Histories, V, Books 16-27 (Loeb Classical Library, No. 160)","review":"Great history of Rome, translation is okay. Includes the Greek language text on left page, English on right. Please note: This is one of six volumes! This is not clear from the description of the books.The Penguin version, a better/clearer translation, does not include the Greek. One volume, not complete. May be more accessible for most readers. Is certainly less expensive!"},{"Title":"Polybius: The Histories, V, Books 16-27 (Loeb Classical Library, No. 160)","review":"Since there are so many of these darn things the review shall be divided into three sections. First, a brief description of the Loeb series of books and their advantages/disadvantages. Second shall be my thoughts on the author himself, his accuracy, as well as his style and the style of his translator. This is of course only my opinion and should be treated as such. The final part shall review what this particular book actually covers.The Loeb series date back to the turn of the last century. They are designed for people with at least some knowledge of Greek or Latin. They are a sort of compromise between a straight English translation and an annotated copy of the original text. On the left page is printed the text in Greek or Latin depending on the language of the writer and on the right side is the text in English. For somebody who knows even a little Greek or Latin these texts are invaluable. You can try to read the text in the original language knowing that you can correct yourself by looking on the next page or you can read the text in translation and check the translation with the original for more detail. While some of the translations are excellent mostly they are merely serviceable since they are designed more as an aid to translation rather than a translation in themselves. Most of them follow the Greek or Latin very closely. These books are also very small, maybe just over a quarter the size of your average hardcover book. This means that you'll need to buy more than just one book to read a complete work. They are also somewhat pricey considering their size. The Loeb Collection is very large but most of the more famous works can be found in better (and cheaper) translations elsewhere. If you want to read a rarer book or read one in the original language then you can't do better than the Loeb Editions.There are six volumes of Polybius in the Loeb series. This includes all of his surviving works. Polybius was a Greek soldier who was captured by the Romans during the Roman conquest of Greece. He was a prisoner in Rome for several years where he became the personal friend of Scipio Aemilianus, the grandson of Scipio Africanus who defeated Hannibal and the future conqueror of Carthage. His work was meant to explain to the Greek world how Rome was able to conquer everyone within such a short period of time. He is about as accurate as ancient historians get. He wrote forty books of which only the first five are intact. Fortunately there are very good epitomes for most of the remaining books. There is a newer Loebeditionwhich will be published early next year. These are supposed to be better translations but I'm sticking with the old ones since I already have them and all. The translations are fine and the printing is nicer on the older copies. The Penguineditionis horribly incomplete. The Loeb editions, whether old or new, are the way to go.All of these books are in fragments. They all deal with the wars with Greece."},{"Title":"Legal Studies : Terminology/Transcription","review":"I ordered the book after all the research.

The full-range of mysteries in children's literature, by and large, is not particularly impressive. And the exception to this may lie in a single author of children's books; one Sarah Weeks. Beginning with her debut novel and impressive beginning, \\"So B It\\" and continuing with, \\"Jumping the Scratch\\", Weeks gives kids mysteries that go beyond secrets in old clocks or messages in lemon juice. Her mysteries are the day to day unexplained occurrences that make life so doggone interesting. In \\"So B It\\", a girl unravels the story behind her mother's past. In \\"Jumping the Scratch\\", however, the person holding the key to the mystery is the narrator himself. And he's not going to give up his secrets without a fight.Jamie is miserable with a capital M. When he lived in Battle Creek, everything was \\"normal as cornflakes\\". He went to school with lots of friends. He adopted a stray cat who liked him and only him. Things were great! Then everything went wrong. His cat got run over in the street. Then his dad ran away with a cashier. Then his favorite aunt was involved in a freak accident at the cherry factory where she worked. And NOW he and his mom have gone to live with Aunt Sapphy up in Traverse City in a trailer park far from his friends and school. Oh. And there was one more bad thing that happened to Jaime, but he doesn't like to talk about it. All the reader knows for certain is that it involves butterscotch in some way and a button pressed firmly into a cheek. Now Jamie is going to try to erase the memory of that occurrence entirely from his brain, which at the same time trying to cure his Aunt Sapphy's own short-term memory loss. To do it, he'll have to befriend oddball Audrey, a girl who wears men's plastic glasses frames, and attempt to excise everything bad that he doesn't want to recall from his brain. Either that, or tell someone what happened.Any children's book with even an oblique reference to child abuse is going to have to handle their material with infinite care. For example, Lois Lowry's recent, \\"Gossamer\\", is a lovely little title, but many people have had serious issues with how it deals with a boy's abusive situation. In the case of \\"Jumping the Scratch\\", adult readers instantly understand what it is that Jaime is trying to forget (though perhaps not the details). Children, on the other hand, won't know until Jaime finally flashes back to the horrible moment in question and they see first hand the incident. What adult readers will not instantly understand are some of Jaime's quirks. They won't immediately comprehend why he collects empty cherry cans or walks through snake-infested grass every day after school. Weeks takes infinite care in slowly revealing what her hero has suffered and in describing his elaborate coping mechanisms. At the same time, you feels he's a real kid. This is the kid that impatient adults (his teacher being the best example) have no time to understand and care for.I was a little reluctant to believe some of Weeks' points, however. That after suffering at the hands of an adult male, Jaime would trust an adult male (albeit an author) so soon seemed a bit of a stretch. Then again, Weeks doesn't make Jaime out to be the kind of guy who instantly trusts anyone. I was reminded of a similar children's book, Jane Gardam's, \\"Long Way From Verona\\" (right down to the overly enthusiastic teacher) in which a kid's life is changed by an adult author who visits her class. It's an interesting trope. More problematic is the miracle deus ex machina that allows Sapphy to retain her memory at the end of the book. I'm no doctor but the sheer convenience of it all may ring a little false, even to young 'uns ears.When an author writes a book and it's a hit, people immediately sniff around that author's second with the sole hope of determining whether or not that book is better or worse than it predecessor. They're hoping it'll be worse. With Weeks, it isn't like that. \\"Jumping the Scratch\\" is, to my mind, almost as good as \\"So B It\\", but an entirely different novel. It has a compelling and easily understood protagonist and has the added benefit of taking place in Traverse City (much like this year's other Traverse City tale for kids, \\"The One Left Behind\\" by Willo Davis Roberts). A title well worth checking out from a unique and powerful voice."},{"Title":"Jumping the Scratch","review":"Sarah Weeks did a wonderful job writing this novel. In this novel there is a boy named Jamie Reardon. At the beginning of this book his dad leaves him and his mom at home alone. After that Jamie's aunt has an accident at her work which causes her to loose her memory. So now they have to move to Aunt Sapphy's trailer to be with her. While they live there Jamie makes a friend and her name is Audrey. Audrey claims that she can hypnotize people. Through this story Jamie and his mom try to find the 'magic trigger' to make her remember. They want to help her 'jump the scratch.' Like on a record player, the needle needs to 'jump the scratch.' I really liked this book. Even thought the end it a little bit predictable, it is still surprising. I recommend this book for all young readers because I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Jumping the Scratch","review":"JUMPING THE SCRATCH is best described as a story about forgetting. For eleven-year-old Jamie, it's about forgetting an event that has traumatized him. For Sapphy, his aunt, it's about forgetting anything and everything that happens to her on a daily basis. But let's back up just a little bit...Jamie Reardon has moved to Traverse City, Michigan, from Battle Creek, where he once had a real home, a mom and dad to always fix whatever was wrong, a cat named Mister who knew how to listen, and a normal-as-cornflakes life. But then Mister died, and his dad ran off with a cashier from the MicroMart, and his Aunt Sapphy was injured in a work-related accident. So that year, during fifth grade, Jamie and his mom moved in with Aunt Sapphy in her trailer at Wondrous Acres, and there was no big Thanksgiving dinner or sparkling Christmas tree. There was only Aunt Sapphy, who got hit on the head by a falling pipe during her shift at the Cheery Cherry canning factory, and now can't form any short-term memories. There's Jamie's mother, who took a third-shift job at the same cherry factory because it was the only place hiring. There's Marge, the home nursing aide, who doesn't like anyone, especially Aunt Sapphy. And then there's Jamie, who changed sometime around Christmas, and yet no one seems to notice.While Jamie is busy dodging the verbal bullets of his teacher, Miss Miller, and the crazy questions of Audrey Krouch, a fellow student who also lives in Wondrous Acres, he's also trying to forget. Forget what happened on Christmas Eve, with Old Gray, the guy who sits in the office at the trailer park. It's funny how memories work. While Jamie works hard to find the magic trigger to give Sapphy back her memories, he wants nothing more than to erase his own.It's easy to sympathize with Jamie, especially with the careless adults that surround him in JUMPING THE SCRATCH. Although I would have liked the story to be longer and more filled out, this is a quick, emotional read. It's definitely interesting to watch Jamie's transformation, to read about the intriguing Aunt Sapphy, and to see into the heart and mind of the wonderfully odd Audrey."},{"Title":"Jumping the Scratch","review":"Eleven-year-old Jamie Reardon has had a string of bad luck. First, his beloved cat Mister dies. Next, his father runs off with a cashier from MicroMart. Then, aunt Sapphy has an accident at her job at the cherry factory, and Jamie and his mother have to move and take care of her. Just when Jamie thinks his luck will improve, another bad thing happens --- and it's so bad that all he can do is try his hardest to forget.JUMPING THE SCRATCH begins after all this bad luck. In addition to missing his cat and feeling abandoned by his father, Jamie has to deal with being the new kid at school. He's harassed daily on the bus by Larry Baywood, who calls him \\"Rear-End,\\" and his teacher doesn't even know his name. She calls him James instead of Jamie, but he never bothers to correct her. Plus, he no longer lives in a house. Now, he and his mother live with Sapphy at the Wondrous Acres trailer park. Sapphy can't live on her own anymore after the accident because she has no short-term memory. \\"The blow to her head caused Sapphy's memory to develop a skip, like an old phonograph record with a scratch.\\" Every morning Jamie and his mother have to explain to Sapphy why they are there because she can't remember anything that happened after the accident. The doctors tell them that the only way to solve Sapphy's memory problem is to find a \\"magic trigger\\" --- something that will snap Sapphy out of it and make her memory \\"jump the scratch.\\"As Jamie attempts to help his aunt remember, all he can do is try to forget the last bad thing that happened to him. It's the one that makes him taste butterscotch in his mouth every time he gets upset. It's also the one that makes him avoid, at all costs, running into Old Gray, the creepy manager of the trailer park. One of Jamie's classmates, Audrey Krouch, notices that Jamie is unhappy and that something is bothering him. She offers to help hypnotize him to solve his problems. Little does Jamie know that the solution to his own problems will help aunt Sapphy as well.JUMPING THE SCRATCH is a novel that resonates. The characters are so real, and Jamie's story is simply told yet strikes an emotional chord that sticks with the reader. Sarah Weeks, award-winning author of SO B.

I suppose it could be that I am misunderstanding Vonnegut's strategy[, ideology(?), etc.,] for writing [short stories] if I think that the flatness of his characters is cause for alarm. After all, as the title of this review indicates, I seeWelcome to the Monkey Houseas a series of thought experiments and furthermore I think that these thought experiments are mostly very successful.Yet, unfortunately, they remain at the level of idealized thought experiment rather at the level of comment on the problems of such thought experiments which might take the form of rich characters inhabiting the idealized space and through their presence \\"tainting\\" that space; this sort of story would not only serve as a criticism of certain general, universal, masculine, etc., modes of thought (i.e. by indicating that such modes of thought must necessarily break down in any particular situation) but would additionally serve to show what happens to certain rich characters that we care about when they enter the idealized space.Now, even though I cannot think of a single exception to this criticism, I do not mean that the stories were emotionally dull (and, by the way, I think that they are engaging in the same way that much science fiction is engaging--\\"Whoa! Cool! ...what if..?\\") as several of them definitely got to me and were able to make an interesting statement despite that statement's uncomplicated nature--I think here of the story involving the boy raised in an orphanage in Germany who goes looking for his father in the form of a sargeant in the US army who is also black, of the story involving the new father who is able to appreciate the value of his new son's life despite the crushing indifference of everyone else. But despite the author's efforts to the contrary in the story of the Geman orphan, Vonnegut still creates a situation in which [patriarchal] racist modes of thought are reinforced by the lack of complexity in the emotional responses of the boy and the sargeant. And despite his efforts to take seriously the holocaust in the second short story I mentioned above, he simplifies the situation in a problematic way.It could be that I simply did not take up the short-story-reader's mantle in the way that a friend of mine indicated that I was not only able but obligated to do. It could be simply that I failed to imagine the complexity of the characters. But I believe that the short stories--which permit and obligate the reader to imagine and empathize--my friend had in mind are those in which enough is said so that one can begin to imagine the characters' depths after having brief glimpses of those depths revealed by the author; the stories in this collection are not of that sort--rather, they are of the sort in which the reader would have to imagine those depths in entirety on her/his own because those depths are not spoken and, I suspect, not even thought by the author."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"This is a collection of Vonnegut short stories that many, maybe all, were published in magazines in the 50's 60's and possibly later.

I read the story Harrison Bergeron when I was in 7th grade and it changed my life forever. Seriously. I no longer thought of Star Trek and Star Wars as being the entire scope of sci-fi, to which I wasn't interested. I eventually have seen all episodes of the original ST, STNG, STDS9, and some of STV but that's neither here nor there. ST and other series like Dune and Hitchhikers have their place, and I've come to respect them, but to me there still is no better sci-fi than that of alt civilizations that play off of mans greed and/or what if things were different. If you've read other Vonnegut classics like Slaughter House 5 or Mother Night, this book gives you a little different look at his interests. This collection has a range of his views, hopes, and some zany characters like Cats Craddle and some subtlety of Breakfast of Champions put into short delightful stories.

Well, I did enjoy the stories. My favorite would have to be &quot;Unready To Wear&quot;. The thought of being able to leave your body and enter dead bodies to use whenever the need arose (say, if you might want to be in a parade), sounds like a pretty good way to extend your life some. Also, I've discovered that since I began the book, I've been thinking in a more abstract way. This is a good thing. A freeing feeling.Kurt Vonnegut wrote in a way that makes you think of possibilities. I appreciate that."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Monkey House. I really do not care for this writing style and will never buy another book by this author. I could not even finish reading the book."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"The reason that I gave the review this title is because of the cover. I actually wanted the book with the brown cover and the monkey reaching out. The one I got has a creamish color and at the top a small picture of a gorilla in a cage. I was trying to duplicate a copy of the book that has been lost and the picture of the book in the listing matched so I thought that was what I would get. I wish the seller had actually shown the book he was selling. The content is the same but the book feels heavier (I think it may have more pages which means that the type face or printing margins must be different."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Great Stories! Kurt Vonnegut is a master at understanding human behavior and can really have fun with it in his writings. The story 'Who am I this time?' was made into a short 1-hour movie back in the early 80's and Christopher Walken played the main character and he was fantastic. I saw the movie on PBS one night years ago and loved it. This was before I ever heard of Kurt Vonnegut and his talent for creating memorable characters. I also like the George Helmholtz (over-the-top, dedicated band director) character he writes about in some of the stories. This character is also in some of the Bogambo Snuff Box collection of short stories. So many of Vonnegut's characters are just like someone you've known, only a little more maladjusted."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Kurt Vonnegut has a very unique writing style. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is not your regular book. This is a collection of short stories. All of them are classic Vonnegut. They include humor, and off the wall plots. A lot of the stories remind me of Fahrenheit 451 (Ray Bradbury).Some of the stories are set in the future, others in the past. They are all captivating and encourage imagination. A lot of Vonnegut stories have a lesson to them if you look hard enough. This book's short stories definitely show some of the lessons he tries to teach.If you have never read a Vonnegut book this would be a great one to start with. Because the stories are not very long, if you lose interest you can easily move on a different story. The actual story, \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" is great. Vonnegut shows us how warped our world could be. Many of the stories are like that.Vonnegut continues to show us new possibilities in the realm we live in. None of his stories are so outlandish that they could never happen. He always includes enough reality to never make it impossible. What he does include makes us take a look at what we really want to allow the government to control and what could happen. Only Kurt Vonnegut could make a story that is about \\"ethical suicide.\\" I loved it!!!! You will love this book, it is wild, it is crazy, and it is totally VONNEGUT."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"This book opened something in me that I wish more would: the desire to write. While reading Vonnegut's varied works, I felt myself itching to grab the wp and start writing--anything! Perhaps his imaginative stories or the fact that each one was so different from the other brought this on. Whatever the reason, the book exposed a deep mental level that few others even scratch. If you want stimulating enjoyment, buy it."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I honestly can say that literature like this can go along way in re-affirming your faith in the human race. For all the horrible stories in life we hear about horrible people doing horrible things; to know that there are human beings within our midst who are capable of presenting words on a page in a manner in which Kurt did here, it just makes you forget about all that other stuff."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Vonnegut was one of my favorite authors when I was a teen. His writings were integral to shaping my sense of the absurd. I wanted to impart this to my own teen and Monkey House seemed a perfect choice as an introduction to Vonnegut since it is short stories, but my own copy was long since lost or desintegrated. Amazon to the rescue! Great book, great price, fast shipping, and I didn't spend more time and money than I can afford."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Kurt Vonnegut blended literature and science fiction into a genre all his own.

I like being able to share books that I remember fondly with my children."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Welcome to the Monkey House was the first Kurt Vonnegut story that I read. It was published in Playboy back before the dawn of time. I've read most everything that this Indiana author has published but this is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"If you find Vonnegut heavy sledding, perhaps there are some pleasant surprises for you among these short stories.Normally I find reading his work very similar to a class assignment."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I bought it for grand daughters high school project, arrived on time as advertised, will purchase from this vendor again"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Vonnegut's portrait of the universe is painted with every emotion, every hope, and every fear that man can have. Welcome to the Monkey House contains some of the best short stories ever written. When we journey into Harrison Bergeron we feel the possibilities of our very demise, fear our own greatness, and triumphantly remember what it is to be free. Who Am I This Time?, (My personal favorite) brings a whole new perspective to real life. It asks us who we really are and questions our ability to change. This is a good quality in any book. And finaly, the title story, Welcome to the Monkey House. This story is a celebration of our sexual drives and our true needs as human beings. It sheds the proper negative light on those who oppress sexuality in all its forms. Billy the poet (the main character) goes around and frees women from the strongholds of sexual oppression by depriving them of their birth/pleasure control and then teaching them about sex. The story is amazing. It brings to light so many American ways that we may not even realize we have. I recomend this book to anyone who likes sex, poetry, love, drama, and to anyone who has a brain and a heart. Thank You"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I know the title of my review sounds exaggerated but it isn't. Allow me to explain. Ten years ago I had Postpartum Depression. Postpartum Depression is such a small phrase for the crushing mental agony I experienced. Each day seemed worse than the last and I counted the hours until my husband returned home so that I could retreat from myself for a few hours by walking around the block.I know there are support groups and a lot more women have come out and talked about their experiences, but at the time I lived in a smallish, conservative community and for the first month all I had was my husband, a psychologist I met with once a week and Kurt Vonnegut.Vonnegut probably sounds like a strange choice of reading for someone who is depressed and anxious, but this short story collection sustained me through one of my darker days.Here's what I did, I read the first story. The story seemed a little slow to me, but I forced myself to savor each word and every sentence. I promised myself that if I could read one story, I could get through the next hour. Sometimes I lost the thread and had to go back and reread entire paragraphs, but the stories are so engrossing that soon I felt the tortuous shadows hovering around me retreat until I came to the end. Then I started all over again. I read Harrison Bergeron three times, sometimes I read aloud as I fed my baby. My voice was weak and scratchy at first but as the story progressed, I could hear myself speaking in a more normal tone.I know what your thinking. Therapy by literature? That's ridiculous. But I'm not trying to prescribe this for everyone, not even one person, I just wanted to share my experience of this amazing little book.Anyway, I'm not saying that people should read this because it is a great work of American fiction or because everyone should read Vonnegut, at least once, before dying, I think it is worth reading because it is good. The stories are as fresh and innovative as when he first wrote them (my opinion) and they are fun, sad, scary and thoughtful."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"But I have to say Vonnegut would cringe if I, like another reviewer on this page, wrote that I feel like I'm watching TV when I read his stories. The way Vonnegut feels about TV, this is not a compliment. Speaking of TV, read Vonnegut's &quot;Euphio Effect&quot; in this collection. It's a nice satire, I feel, on TV's addictive quality. Second only to Harrison Bergeron."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"The errors introduced by the OCR scan were not removed. It's not even that they missed some, they must not have checked at all, because the name of the main villain in the story \\"Harrison Bergeron\\" (one of the all time great stories ever) is horribly botched (Diana Moon Glampers, the US Handicapper General, is now \\"Diana Moon dampers\\" [no capitalization!]). Worth $1.99 as today's Kindle special deal, a rottenvalue at its regular price."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I was first introduced to Kurt Vonnegut in high school when my creative writing class was assigned to read \\"Harrison Bergeron\\". I was captivated, and since then have read nearly everything that Vonnegut has written. These stories are an excellent introduction to Kurt Vonnegut, as they cover a wide range of the themes present in his work. My personal favorites are \\"All the Kings Men,\\" about an army officer and his men who are trapped in a deranged dictator's game of human chess; \\"Harrison Bergeron\\", a story of a young boy blessed with the physical and mental prowess of a god who lives in a society that insists upon extreme equality for all its citizens; and \\"The Foster Portfolio\\", about a man who has hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank but won't spend a dime of it while his family lives in near-destitution - all to hide a secret he doesn't want his wife to know. I've reread this collection many times and it never gets old."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"This collection of short stories written during the 1950's and 1960's before the author was well known is easily worth reading. Kurt Vonnegut delves into human nature, prejudice, oppression, hypocrisy, militarism and greed in this varied collection. One story introduces us to the first super weapon with a conscience. Another involves a chess game where the expendable pieces are live humans. \\"The Foster Portfolio\\" is a mystery about why a man would choose working poverty over wealth. \\"The Long Walk to Forever\\" shows young adults that almost accidentally discover the depths of their feelings for each other. There is also politics, hypocrisy, and of course, science fiction. Many of the stories are excellent; while a few don't measure up. Overall, however, this is a first-rate collection from a great writer."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"From the wonderous humanity of EPICAC, the computer who loved a girl, to the simply yet imaginatively told story of &quot;Thomas Edison's Shaggy Dog&quot;, to the black American soldier's relationship with a certain displaced person (&quot;D.P.&quot;) to the title story's grim view of the future population (see also &quot;Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow&quot;, the last story in the collection), Vonnegut surprises with his humor, and then delivers a knockout punch with his pathos. *SPOILER* The story about the boy who cannot tell his parents that he didn't get in the School, and &quot;The Kid Noone Could Handle&quot; *END* Is the &quot;fifty-year man&quot; the real &quot;Deer in the Woods&quot;? One of my favorite stories has always been &quot;More Stately Mansions&quot; about the woman who yearns for a more perfect abode as collected and clipped from many home decorating magazines. The realism of his stories is kind of spooky sometimes. His prose writing is amazing--a master of the quick turn of phrase, the one-sentence description that reads like a book, the presence behind the prose somehow is able to make complex, profound ideas more simple, and vice versa. I first read this volume in 1974 on airplanes and while traveling to Africa at the age of 12. Some of it escaped me then, but by now I think I get it. And I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"even if you don't buy buy this collection of vonnegut's short stories (which you should) at least read &quot;harrison bergeron&quot;. that story changes you."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I have read a couple Vonnegut books and was hesitant to read his short stories. However, I was far from let down. I planned on reading one a day...but couldnt put it down. I really wanted to stop but they was such an assortment I couldn't wait to see what I was going to happen next. My personal favorites were &quot;A Long Walk To Forever&quot; and &quot;Who Am I This Time?&quot;. These stories make you feel like you are there because Vonnegut has such a beautiful style of writing that sets the atmosphere!! I'm not into love stories and I knew what was going to happen, but &quot;Long Walk&quot; it gave me a great feeling to read the story and really got an awesome reaction out of me. &quot;Who Am I&quot; was incredible because it makes us think about ourselves as having some attributes of the characters in that we all serve as actors in our own life. It really made you look at the influences on your actions and who you really are and WHY YOU ACT THE WAY YOU DO!!!"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I just want to note that there are two Kindle editions: the Rosetta OCR edition, selling for $2, and the publisher's edition, selling for $12.The low-star reviews talking about a host of aggravating typos are referring to the OCR edition. If you don't mind spending the money to buy the publisher's edition, you'll get a Kindle book without those errors."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I read this book back in high school, and it was my first introduction to Kurt Vonnegut. My friends were all literary nerds and always sang the praises of the man, so one day, they let me borrow this book. I was hooked after that. Vonnegut had such a brillant mind, and could think of the most intriguing stories. From any other author, they may have been said to be too \\"out there,\\" but with Vonnegut, it fits perfectly.One story that is placed near the beginning was my absolute favorite, and definitely the shining star in the book. \\"Harrison Bergeron\\" was a completely unexpected story for me, and I remember finishing it and feeling as if somebody had hit me with a frying pan. I immediately read the entire story over again, and yet again, there was the frying pan again. I was shocked, amazed, bewildered, lost, and deeply saddened at what one story could do.That being said, it's not Vonnegut's best work. It may be a great introduction to him that will let you ease into his unique books, but there will be stories that are just simply boring and hard to read through. There are forgettable ones, but like I discussed earlier, there will be stories that will always stay with you. That's the important thing to take back from this book."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"If you are a Vonnegut fan I would recommend giving this book a whirl. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"A varied and uneven collection of Vonnegut's short stories. Some read like Yankee Magazine or Saturday Even Post stories: boy home from WW II gets girl stories, or \\"hometown\\" stories of Barnstable, Massachusetts.

A must read!"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I recently discovered Vonnegut when looking for books to read this summer and I have to say these are some of the best short stories I have read in a very long time. Each story is short and simple, but explores a large variety of topics and leaves the reader thinking at the end. I have yet to read any of his other books so I can't compare them for you. However, compared to the many other short stories collections that are out there, this book is definitely in my top 3 favorites."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I had heard of Kurt Vonnegut before; but, had never read any of his work.

The title story---about a future society that has outlawed sexual pleasure---and \\"Harrison Bergeron\\"---a brilliant satire of egalitarianism (which is strange, considering Vonnegut's own egalitarian leanings)---are great, and there are several other good stories, and none that are really bad.

Of course this was way back in the 70's.

That alone makes this book stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"This book is among my 10 favorite. This book has a story for every mood. Harrison Bergeron debates true equality, Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow focuses on the aged and their overwhelming numbers, and Firehouse Harris just discusses a man who is satisfied with his arrangement with life.

Mr. Vonnegut creates a perfect blend of comedy, drama, action and suspense. He has a certain way of having tons of detail but not so much that it bores you. You feel as much a part of the story as the characters. One of the stories, &quot;Epicac,&quot; takes place when the first super computer is created. One night, a man stays late and talks about his love life with the machine. The computer has great solutions for him that work out for the man. Then, the computer burns out trying to figure out why he can't be loved. Another story, &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House,&quot; takes place when the population is so massive that sex is outlawed. When a man refuses to take his hormonal pills, the police look for him. He then kidnaps a girl and takes her to a hidden place where he has sex with her. It changes the woman's feelings in the process. This is a great book for any reader. I was hesitant as many when about to embark on reading it but don't regret it at all. I suspect many who read it will also have a problem putting it down as i did."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Don't bi-pass &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; just because it's a short story collection. Next to &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot;, this is easily the most necessary Vonnegut book to own. Here, he sets free both his imagination AND his senses of humor and adventure to come up with some of the best short works published in this century. Just look at this list: &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;, &quot;Thomas Edison's Dog&quot;, a truly hysterical piece on assisted suicide and a truly suspenceful piece on a game of chess played with real people. Most of these styles have since, of course,been copied to death. But has anyone really cut as deep or as precisely into the public consciousness as did Vonnegut here? One wishes he would have continued writing short stories, at least occasionally, and we could have more collections as diverse, entertaining, and thought provoking as this is. By itself, though, &quot;Monkey House&quot; is one residency to make sure you visit"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"The best of Vonnegut's stories (Harrison Bergeron) transcend the era of their author. Most of them are beautiful dioramas. A few of them are stinkers. However, even most of the stinkers have plenty of redeeming quality.Some of the stories are plotful; others open with a scenario ... and then nothing happens, just a slow, sublime revelation of character. That's all right. It keeps me guessing whether each new story will have a plot twist or not.I have to take off two stars: one star for the uneven quality of the stories. I would have enjoyed this collection more if it were a few stories shorter. However, for real Vonnegut fans, a few more marginal stories are a plus, not minus. Enjoy!The other missing star is for the OCR errors in the Kindle edition. Vonnegut worked very hard on the sublime presentation of his sentences. Dozens of OCRs typos stand out like cell phones ringing in the audience at a Shakespearean play -- starting with the name of the villain in the lead story of the book! Even Project Gutenberg has better proofreaders than that."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"First of all, the stories here are great. There is a great variety so if you don't like some of the far out Vonnegut novels you will find some normal fiction here.

Many free Kindle books have better editing than this one. It is very frustrating."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"One of my favorite authors. I can't help loving everything this man has written. His stories are painful to read, sometimes, but everything that is painful has underlying truth. I have never found a Vonnegut story that didn't resonate with me."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Vonnegut's vision of the future in the story \\"Harrison Bergeron\\" has haunted me since I first read it in 5th grade. So it's surprising to me that I hadn't read anything else by him until this year. Luckily, many of his other stories in \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" were just as fascinating or twisted or surreal.Several of the tales included seemed to be autobiographical, and were often very simple, without much point but with a lot of feeling. One involved a play which he directed when he cast someone from town who nobody would ever think would be able to act and a girl who looked perfect for the role, and the night of the play he gets quite a surprise from both. It was written simply and very fun to read.Of his fiction, many stories stand out in my memory. There was on that was narrated by a man who could leave his body and inhabit others, and it tells of a war between the people who had this ability and those who did not. Vonnegut boiled down a complex world into just a few pages and was able to convey the perspective perfectly so that I felt as though I knew exactly what it would be like to live outside of my own body.My absolute favorite involved a chess match where the pieces were real people commanded by a general who was the king piece. Without giving much away, anytime a piece was lost to the other side, the person playing as that piece would be killed. An incredibly intense story, it had my heart beating out of my chest as I tried to force myself not to flip to the end and find out how everything was resolved.Of course, as with nearly every compilation of short stories I've read, there were a few tales that didn't quite jive with my tastes, but thankfully the writing was still descriptive and colorful and efficient enough that I whizzed through those fairly quickly and was able to get on to the stories I enjoyed more.One thing I know for sure after reading \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" is that I'll definitely be reading more Vonnegut in the future."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Glen Williamson (Google him) has been performing two of these stories for years as a one-man play: \\"Who Am I This Time?\\" and \\"The Kid Nobody Could Handle.\\"\\"Cheers and congratulations again!

If that is true then Vonnegut is a true master. \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" is a true masterpiece. The short stroies are a study of our society. The story that is the name of the book shows how a society can go wrong with the idea of doing good. The hero is a rapist who lives in a society that actually encourages suicide. The women who work at these suicide centers have sex with their clients before they die, but the women cannot feel anything below their waist so they cannot enjoy sex due to \\"medicine\\" they take. The \\"hero\\" lets the drug wear off then rapes the women so they can feel for the first time sexual pleasure. The study is the rapes of women by one man as compared to the societal rape by making women not be able to feel pleasure. Tough stuff. The story ends with the explanation of how the idea of anesthetizing the pleasurable feel of sex started, which is the name of the story.Harrison Bergeron is every bit as scary because it is what happens when the law makes everybody equal. There is always someone that has to run the show and they can't be equal. \\"All of the Kings Men\\" is about a game of chess where captured soldiers are the actual pieces and their leader has to make tough choices.Not all of the stories are so depressing. \\"Who will I be Tommorrow\\" is about a couple who fall in love by never being themselves. It is fun and light although it does explore the deeper meaning of relationships.\\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" is a masterpiece and should not be missed. It is a thinking man's book, but at the same time so well written that is it is truly enjoyable as it is on it's own. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Myself, I've never read any Vonnegut in the past. As a matter of fact, I have not read many books at all before. This collection of short stories is just perfect for someone like me. The stories vary from about five pages to twenty pages apiece, making them easy for anyone to ascertain in a short amount of time. After getting about half-way through the book I decided to go out and purchase SLAUGHTER-HOUSE-FIVE, SIREN OF THE TITANS, and GODBLESS YOU DR.KEVORKIAN. That is what is so beautiful about this book, the fact that someone who never reads, can easily peruse a story or two with out missing a beat. Kurt will capture your attention in every tale.Vonnegut came way before my time, but now I see what all the recognition was about. His ideas on government and modern society were way ahead of his time. His notions of peace, shifty politicians, and clandestine activities are what make him an excellent addition to any radical library. He writes science fiction, with a dash of harsh reality. These ideals, of an overpopulated world in which every aspect of our lives are governed, are presented with extraordinary detail in Vonnegut\`s writing. Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, Harrison Bergeron, and Welcome to the Monkey House (The story) are lurid representations of the way the future could be. This book has it all romance, tragedy, and triumph. Every story is not just science fiction, as you may imagine. Most of the stories are set in the past and have no portrayals of an automated society or a talking dog that helped to invent electricity. In fact, one of my favorite stories, The Foster Portfolio, is one that contains no special effects at all. Like many of Vonnegut's other stories, The Foster Portfolio just deals with simple human characteristics like pride, ambition, and happiness. The presentation that Kurt puts into his characters is marvelous. When you get done reading one of his stories you'll feel as though you know the characters."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"True, some of his earliest works were in this book, but it's just as essential to Vonnegut's catalogue than one of his acclaimed novels like Slaughterhouse-Five and Bluebeard. Most of the stories in here kept me very interested and a lot of them had very brilliant storylines. Essential reading."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"this book was amazing. All his stories land right on target and and with incredible accurecy. Vonnegut understands the human condition more then any other writer out thier today. A must read for any fan of Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"C'mon..How could &quot;The Long Walk to Forever&quot; not be one of the best short stories ever written? The way it ends, kind of abrubtly, with the clipped, &quot;She ran to him, put her arms around him, could not speak&quot; is at once beautiful and natural. I dunno. I'm a huge fan, so I'm probably likely to enjoy most of his stuff, but this especially made me remember the book. Other highlights include: Who Am I This Time, and Epicac. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"This book was just fun. I couldn't stop reading it.

Really."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Well, most of the 54 previous reviewers raved about this collection of stories, but I did see one reviewer who felt the story, Monkey House, seems to encourage a certain illegal behavior. I agree with that observation, and while I was reading the story I was certain people today would notice that point: Maybe in 1968 (the publication date), people didn't notice?Some of the stories seemed like &quot;starter&quot; stories, something a &quot;wannabe&quot; writer might write. But some really do make you think. What if you were forced to be &quot;equal&quot; to everyone else (Harrison Bergeron)? What if an anti-aging concoction was discovered and the population explosion covered the earth with people of all ages (Tomorrow etc.)? These kinds of questions are certainly relevant today, and that may be one measure of their worth: longevity.I could not read this book like a novel, with growing interest as the plot unfolds. For me, it was the type of book one would have to put aside from time to time, to kind of &quot;digest&quot; the contents, before reading more. That could be another measure of literary worth: it doesn't go down like cotton candy but kind of &quot;stays with you,&quot; the way a good meal should. Diximus."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Truthfully, Kurt Vonnegut scares me. This awesome collection of his shorter works definitely captures his warped imagination in all of its glory. The topics of this collection range from religion to birth control to government censorship. From the first story to the last, it is very hard to put down. He{Vonnegut} has an odd way of describing things. In the title story, there are many situations that require a sense of humor. I don't want to give away too much, though. I acn't say enough good things about this book."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! When I picked it up I thought that it was not going to be as good as Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse-five\\", but it deffinately was. Vonnegut has once again proved himself to be a magnificent author in this collection of short stories.In this book, there were a few parts that I beleive may have been adapted from the past. If this is the case, Vonnegut has deffinately done a good job reproducing them, as well as make up brilliant tales of his own.This is one of those books that you'll read once and contemplate for a while. Then you'll find it lying around a month or two later and pick up a totally new perspective on its initial meaning. This is book that MUST be read, no questions asked. :-D"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"My wife, son, and daughter really got a kick reading this. Unlike most fictions, this one really has a great plot. In fact, my son took it to school and read it to the whole class. I strongly recommend this for everyone who enjoys great porn."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Don't get me wrong, there are moments of brilliance in this book. The story about the human chess match comes to mind, but many of the stories are conventional and sappy. None of the biting dark humour that you find in his better works like Cat's Cradle and the Sirens of Titan. Still, it's better than a lot of books, but all in all I was very disapointed. ..."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"What's not to like. Vonnegut is a treasure and this is filled with little gems."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I received my book promptly, however it was missing its front cover, which had not been mentioned in the description.

I would have been happier to get a book with a cover, but a prompt refund was a good response from the seller."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"&quot;Monkey House&quot; is a reminder that even the greatest artists had humble beginnings. This collection of Vonnegut's early work is shallow and boring and almost made me forget the great joy he has brought. I would recommend it neither to the Vonnegut novice or fanatic."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"All fans of Kurt Vonnegut's literary genius will love the short stories included in this compilation. The stories themselves are pure Vonnegut, but the work done by each of the narrators makes them even better. This is not an audiobook of short stories read by a bland voice artist. The narrators make each story their own, with different voices for different characters, injecting full personality.I'm very glad I found this gem."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Like most writers who got their start before or shortly after WWII, Kurt Vonnegut began his writing career as a short story writer. Consequently, this collection includes some of his very earliest work, as well as several truly classic short stories that rank among the best of the second half of the 20th century. As one would expect from a collection housing many stories from a writer in his infancy, the collection is not consistently stellar: some pieces are unquestionably wonderful; others are of lesser quality, and at least one -- Where I Live -- is pointless. Vonnegut himself is quick to point out that this is not his best work: in the introduction he states that the stories were written to finance the writing of his novels. Indeed, as with many beginning writers, they constituted his very livelihood; writing them was often a matter of necessity, and not always necessarily the calling of artistic craft. Don't expect the Vonnegut that you're familar with from the novels. Several of these stories hit a moral note, as Vonnegut inevitably does, while others are attempts to strike an emotional chord. Vonnegut, at his short-story-writing best, was a master of what some of the greatest practitioners of the art -- Edgar Allen Poe, among others -- have cited as the key element of any short story: evoking one specific feeling, emotion, or tone. Vonnegut achieves this in many of the stories contained herein, and uses far less humor in doing so than we are accustomed to from him. Some of the best stories include the title story, which lays out a highly provocative and imaginative future scenario; Harrison Bergeron, a truly classic story that really strikes a moral chord; Tommorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, a bleak, darkly funny satirical piece; All The King's Horses, a highly suspenseful and dramatic rendering; Unready To Wear, a thoughtful slice of science fiction; Report On The Barnhouse Effect, Vonnegut's first published story and a science fiction classic; and The Manned Missles, an emotional shocker. Many of these stories are science fiction, a genre under which a lot of Vonnegut's early work fell. Science fiction, at that time, was not even considered a real literary genre, and many literary elitists disparage Vonnegut for having mined it. The author himself has also distanced himself from the field in intervening years, due to the bad press it got him, which has caused a rift between Vonnegut and the science fiction community. Let it be said by me, then, a long-time reader of science fiction, that Vonnegut wrote very well in the genre, and that most of his best short stories were, indeed, SF. Though he never purveyed the so-called &quot;hard&quot; science fiction, full of complex technicalities, that made writers such as Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov famous, Vonnegut was continually full of great ideas that were well-suited the genre. I wish he had written more SF stories. Overall, quite a good collection of short fiction, certainly far superior to the more recent Bagombo Snuff Box -- do not avoid reading this book if you weren't a big fan of that one -- though it does not rank among the best of Vonnegut's work. I recommend it highly to fans of the author or enthusiasts of the short story art form."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"~ * * * * ~~I'd love to give this book 6 ****** Stars!This book made such an impression on me as an adolescent, and as an adult, I still love it. The short stories are very different, they are unique in that many show a more optimistic and hopeful Kurt Vonnegut than we see in any of his other books.These stories were written at various times for publication in different magazines. The title story \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" is no less thought provoking 30 years later! My favorite story \\"D.P\\" for \\"displaced person\\"- about a little black orphan in an all white post-war 'German\\" orphanage - was heartbreakingly sweet.Although he disparages the story, \\"Long walk to Forever\\" shows a caring and hopeful side of the author he rarely reveals.All the stories are absorbing, and deceptively easy to read. This book was one I'll never give away, I need to reread the stories too often!"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I've read all but one or two Vonnegut books, and I think this short story collection is a good representation of his style and typical plots, if you're looking to try Vonnegut out. If you've already read Vonnegut before and liked him, you'll probably love this one too."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"This story shows us that we're not all created equal and there will always be others that want us to conform. Be what you want to be but be aware that &quot;others&quot; may not agree!"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"First, I want to say I give this collection 5 stars despite the datedness of some of the short stories. I can't fault Vonnegut for when he wrote them. They are like a series of really clever Twilight Zone episodes. It's been literally decades since I first read these. The most memorable is Harrison Bergeron, about a society where the playing field is so levelled that anyone possessing an unfair advantage is given a handicap to prevent them being competitive. It's actually a very Republican story (I'm being funny, a little). The next is the title story, and again it suggests that society has overcompensated for a problem, in this case providing \\"ethical suicide\\" for people in order to overcome overpopulation rather than...well, I won't ruin it. Other stories have just stuck with me all this time, like \\"Who am I this time?\\" about a man who has no personality except when he is acting in town plays. The thing about all these stories is that they are reminiscent of the Player Piano era. Player Piano is Vonnegut's excellent but outdated story about a society where machines and machine-thinking take over. In the story, there is a checker-playing machine that represents technology gaining ascendance over man. All of the stories in this collection have that 50's feel. If you can overlook that, the morals of the stories are what's important, and they are frequently unexpected. That is the power and beauty of this collection."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Having just finished Welcome to the Monkey House, I must admit that I prefer Vonnegut's lengthier works. I know this may make me a grand candidate for a good stoning, as Mr. K is reputed to be one of the best short story writers around, but this one just didn't do it for me like Slaughterhouse or Hocus Pocus or even Slapstick. Don't get me wrong, these stories are good, they just aren't any better than other famous and well read sci-fi short fiction writers like Asimov or Bradbury.I think, oddly enough, the constriction of the medium has to do with some of the similarities I see between these stories and, say, the works of Ray Bradbury (who came to mind a number of times while reading this work). While Vonnegut's novels are sprawling and conversational with enough room for a doodle or two, these small pieces are forced into a beginning, middle and end format that doesn't play as well with his style.I have devoured a number of Vonnegut works in a day or so, and sometimes I have read a them back to back, but Monkey House took me almost two weeks to read. I stalled out a few times, sometimes after two pages of a new story, and put the book down to finish it later. I ended up reading a story a day for the last week, just so I could finish without getting burned out.Like I said before, these stories aren't bad, they just seem to be standard for both their age and their genre when Vonnegut tends to be anything other than standard on every other occasion. I wasn't terribly disappointed, but I will stick to the novels from now on."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"This is the coolest book of short stories that i have ever read, and i have read a lot. Certain stories, especially the foster portfolio and harrison bergeron."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"A short story is a great format in that it allows a writer to focus in on a single idea or episode, then forces the writer to make their point quickly and concisely (or at least that's the hope). In the instances when Kurt Vonnegut executes that formula well in this collection of short stories, you get some of his clearest and most insightful work. At the same time, there are a few turkeys thrown into the mix, but they don't take much away from this book.One thing I'd recommend to readers is that they read a story or two at a time, then read something else before returning to this collection. The stories start to sound and feel quite similar after a while and begin to lose their impact. I wish I could go back and space out my reading more than I did.In my opinion, the best stories come early in the book with weaker tales bringing up the rear. However, another reviewer makes exactly the opposite point. Maybe I was just worn out on Vonnegut stories by the end, or maybe that's just the fun of reading something and having your own reaction to it. In the end, that's what makes Vonnegut so good: he makes you react as a reader.Essential reading for the Vonnegut enthusiast."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Eau de' Vonnegut is discernable in each Monkey House short story. They are simple and conceptual, Vonnegut doesn't bog down his stories with specifics. These are meditations: Brief, fun to read, interestingly cast plots. It has been a long time since I read (or watched) Slaughterhouse 5, or Cat's Cradle. I remember how familiar but demented character types were thrown into oddly improbable circumstances, with surprising outcomes. My favorite story was \\"Who Am I This Time\\". Or, perhaps it could be \\"Harrison Bergeron\\", or even \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\"... you'll understand how hard it is to choose a favorite, as you randomly skip from the end of one short story to the beginning of another."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"If you don't already know Kurt Vonnegut's work, this may be the best introduction to it -- especially considering that short stories are the art form that Vonnegut started out with, where he developed his craft.And if you already know Vonnegut but don't know this book, then think of this as the author in delicious bit-sized chunks.But read the book!I would not say that Welcome to the Monkey House is Vonnegut's best book -- in fact, it may not even be in the top five by my calculations -- but it is the one book of his I would keep if I had to give all the other away, simply because of the diversity of the stories he tells and the simple writing skill they illustrate.And I might argue that the best single STORY Vonnegut ever wrote is \\"Harrison Bergeron\\" the riveting and still-relevant tale about human nature that effects me as much today as it did when I first read it 20 years ago. Vonnegut without a doubt proves with this story that all writers are not created equal."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I'm not a huge fan of short story collections since I'd much rather sit through a single story throughout all those pages instead of a series of tales that at best tend to be hit or miss and wildly inconsistent. However there are some writers that I will acknowledge are masters of the form, Theodore Sturgeon, Ray Bradbury and of course Kurt Vonnegut (that's not even counting the &quot;classic&quot; short story masters who I haven't read) who's novels sometimes come across as longish short stories anyway. Most of these stories were written early in his career, in the fifties or sixties and it looks like someone actually made an attempt to sequence them instead of just dumping them in chronoloogical order, thus there's a bit of a procession as you move along, finally ending with the darkly hopeful 'Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow&quot;. Along the way you'll find that the quality is quite high and many of these are very much vintage Vonnegut. He mixes around with genres and so SF exercises such as &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; (classics both) sit comfortably next to more typical stories such as &quot;Manned Missiles&quot; (which gets my vote for most effective story in the collection and surprised me the most). There aren't really any clunkers here, some are simpler than others and will pass you by without much impact, but the majority all have some moment or theme to recommend them as keepers and give you something to think about long after you've finished them. Sure, most of the stories were written in a different time but regardless of the SF or the Cold War backdrop or whatever, these are essentially timeless and deserved to be read again and again."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Having never read Vonnegut before, I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. The title led me to expect some degree of science fiction. What I found was a collection of rich, wonderfully written stories about a wide assortment of subjects. Vonnegut is a great writer, pure and simple. Many of the stories dealt with the future and the state of society, and Vonnegut struck me as having a somewhat cynical yet witty view of the subject. I found the themes of his stories to be somewhat akin to my own fears of life as we will some day know it, in a world where the government attempts to create utopia on earth. Two of the more memorable stories found in these pages are &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House.&quot; In the first story, we find the type of society that I fear the most, a socialist republic where all people are required to be equal; those who possess intelligence and pose the danger of actually thinking are controlled by implants which forcefully disallow any thought from entering their minds. In the latter, we find a Malthusian world of overpopulation where everyone takes pills to numb the lower halves of their bodies and people are encouraged to come to Federal Ethical Suicide Parlors and voluntarily remove themselves from the crowded world. Other stories deal with massive overpopulation troubles.On the other hand, we find more simplistic stories in which Vonnegut conveys individuals in a deep, touching light, striking great chords of sympathy in this reader's mind. A woman who is obsessed with redecorating the houses of her neighbors yet cannot afford to buy decent furniture for her own house; a young woman who comes to a strange town, captivates everyone with her beauty, is criticized and publicly humiliated by a young man for being the kind of girl he could never win the heart of, and is richly shown to be an innocent, lonely soul; a teen who acts horribly because he has never had a real family but is saved from a life of crime by a teacher who makes the grand effort to save the boy--these are some of the many subjects dealt with by the author. There is even a heartfelt story about a young Russian and young American who are killed in space but who inspire understanding and d&eacute;tente between the two superpowers by bringing home the point that they were both young men with families who loved them and who had no desire for anything but peace--written during the height of the Cold War, that story really stood out to me.All of the stories are not eminently satisfying to me, but the lion's share of them are; a couple of stories seemed to have been written for no other reason but to make the author some money, which is okay (especially since Vonnegut introduces the stories by saying he wrote them in order to finance his novel-writing endeavors). I may have been less than satisfied by a couple of stories, but even the worst of the lot was written wonderfully and obviously with much care, and I daresay that few writers could do better on their best day than Vonnegut does on his worst. Sometimes, as one ages, one fears that he will eventually have read all of the best books in the world, but then one discovers an author such as Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., and it is one of the best and most exciting things that can happen to that person."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Welcome to the Monkey House takes me to places both mentally and emotionally. I have never been a big reader but a friend had mentioned the book. He said that it was a good read. I have to disagree with him. It was an ecellent read! I loved the first story to the last. Kurt hits every string with perfect cord. I feel like I'm watching T.V. when I read his stories. He describes in great detail the surroundings but lets you feel the emotions for yourself. &quot;A Long Walk to Forever&quot; is a great example; the magazine she is holding when he comes to the door, to the orchard they walk to; yet the ending takes you to the point that you know exactly what happens without Kurt having to tell you a thing. I truly believe that this is the best I'll ever read!"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"If you like Vonnegut this collection of short stories is a must. This is the only book of short stories that I have ever read cover to cover. This is the only book I reread almost on a yearly basis.I have give this book as a gift often to people suprise they say that it is Vonneguts best work. Unlike other short story writers, Vonnegut short stories different from one another and do not repeat the same boaring gimmics over and over.&quot;All the Kings Men&quot; is about an insane game of Chess&quot;Eipac&quot; is about a computer who becomes more than a computer.&quot;Who will I be today&quot; is about two people who fall in love by not being themselves.&quot;DP&quot; is about a half black / half German orphan who stumbles on a unit of american GI's during WWII&quot;Slow walk into tomarrow&quot; is about an AWOL soldier who goes takes a walk with only woman that he could ever lovethe day before she is to marry another man. (THIS IS THE BEST)There are about ten more each unique as Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I just read this book last year, as a tenth grader. It might sound as though I'm exaggerating if I say it changed my life, but I believe that almost everything you read changes you in a small way. Well, this book changed me in a big way. I'll still be thinking about these stories months after I read them. They're the kind of stories that make you want to close your eyes and think for an hour after you're done reading them. This book was my introduction to Kurt Vonnegut, and it remains my favorite.I also think its amazing how a book read by somebody 30 years ago can still have the same effect on a young person today, and I hope that 30 years from now, this book will still change people."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Unlike his later novels (\\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\", \\"Bluebeard\\", \\"Jailbird\\"), where he utilized a biting economical style, the short stories in this collection are comprised of a more standard prose. That being said, they are still Kurt Vonnegut stories, and thus offer a mixture of radical sci-fi ideas and character creation that goes down just as easily in smaller chunks as it does in the longer novel form.The stories here that made his reputation as a sci-fi writer (a reputation that doesn't come close to covering his oeuvre) are startling in their originality and awe-inspiring in their execution. \`Harrison Bergeron' is a quick drawing of a \\"utopian\\" society, where the strong and smart wear handicaps to level the playing field. Vonnegut manages to create a unique world, and then destroy it, while saying much about our world. I'm sure anyone who has seen the film version of this story wonders why they tried to stretch it out to an hour and a half, when all was already said in those seven pages. The title story is another futuristic utopia, where overpopulation has created the need for voluntary suicide clinics and a complete repression of sexual desire. It's a society ripe for rebellion, and that's just what it gets. \`Unready to Wear' follows a society in which those who have learned to transcend their physical bodies are at odds with those who haven't. None of these tales follows any long, drawn out narrative. They all tend to make their point, quickly, and move on with other business. Vonnegut never gets lost in his creations, or bogged down in trying to make them sound credible. He has an incredible knack for simplicity within complex ideas.There are other stories here besides the sci-fi tales. My favourite is \`Miss Temptation', which shows us a small town, mesmerized by the daily walk up Main Street of a hermit-like woman of startling beauty. The twist near the end is heartbreaking, and manages to not only indict the characters in the story for their objectification, it indicts the reader as well. \`More Stately Mansions' is a tale of modern suburbia, which says something about one woman's obsession with decorating, as well as all of our obsessions with \`looking the part'. \`All the King's Horses' is loaded with dramatic tension, as an American Army Colonel, captured by a Communist guerrilla chief during the Vietnam war, is forced to play chess using his battalion and his family as pieces. Any captured pieces are executed. Besides the tension of the game, Vonnegut manages to slip in some criticism of xenophobia.These stories are just a few of my favourites. The book is filled with wonderful pieces, each of equal strength, all showcasing Vonnegut's early-career skills as a writer."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"&quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut is probably the best collection of short stories I have ever read. It has a great combination of comedy, drama, suspense, and action. Mr. Vonnegut has a way of including a lot of detail but not so much as to bore you. You often find yourself getting so caught up in the story that you feel almost as if you are there. The story &quot;Epicac&quot; was among the best in the book. It takes place in the fifties and the first super computer has been built. A man tells the computer about the problems in his love life and the computer actually has an answer for him. He and the computer continue to have these conversations until one day the computer develops emotions. He feels the need to be loved and burns out trying to figure out why he can't be. &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; is another good story in the book. It takes place in a future where sex is outlawed. Then this man comes along who refuses to take his hormonal control pills. He persuades many women to join him on his quest. He then kidnaps a woman and takes him to a hidden place where they make love. &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; is a fast paced book for any reader. It will keep you enthused with its detail and entertained with its humor."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Please note that my rating is about the quality of the Kindle edition, not the quality of Vonnegut's writing.On the one hand, the short stories are wonderful and showcase some of Vonnegut's earlier writing. On the other hand, the Kindle edition would likely embarrass any author, and particularly one whose precision of language was equal to Kurt Vonnegut's. Specifically, the book appears to have been created by scanning a hard copy and then using optical character recognition (OCR) software to convert the images to letters, without making an effort to even so much as electronically verify that the OCR got it right (e.g. even a Word grammar checker would have turned up most of the obvious mistakes). This results in an almost verbatim rendering of the original, but not quite. In the Kindle version it is quite jarring to find, for example, the word \\"mat\\" appearing nonsensically in the middle of some sentences where the word \\"that\\" was plainly intended. Two examples: \\"It was in this news mat Nancy perceived a glint of hope\\" or \\"Why, honey bunch, they call mat truth serum.\\" Mostly, \\"that\\" shows up correctly, but not always. Perhaps the most obnoxious example is in the short story \\"Deer in the Works\\" where a character's name is first given as \\"Lou Flammer\\" then inexplicably switches for a few pages to \\"Lou Hammer\\" and then switches back to last name \\"Flammer\\" again. Vonnegut doesn't make those sorts of mistakes. Kindle does, and it is a shame to do it to a writer of such ability. Nevertheless, what Vonnegut writes in these short stories are entertaining, thought provoking, disturbing, and somewhat of a time capsule for the mindset of America in the 1950s and early 60s. My only suggestion is to buy a hard copy version and read what Vonnegut actually wrote, instead."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Worth the money just for &quot;Harrison Bergeron,&quot; the greatest science fiction story of all time, and my favorite of all genres. It's the perfect story: short, funny, makes its point obvious without being preachy, and includes a scene (where the two main characters, freed from society's imposed handicaps, literally reach for the sky) that stays in your mind forever.

I never worry when I order with this vendor!"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Vonnegut locates his characters in unlikely, self-contained environments, and through wryness and the steady accumulation of detail he makes the whole plausible. His narrators are often plain-speaking, decent, imperfect people confronted with some paradigm-changing development, such as the bodiless souls in 'Unready to Wear'.The science fiction stories are uniformly surprising, tender, perspicacious, laden with jokes, and, like all of Vonnegut's work, distinguished by his unhurried eloquence. For me, however, the real surprise lay not in these humanist parables but in more straightforward stories like 'The Lie,' a sad-eyed, third-person account of a family outing to a private prep school; not alone the best story in a dauntingly good collection, it also supplies further proof of Vonnegut's oft stated admiration for Richard Yates."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Amazing selection of short stories. A great way to pass the time. I would recommend this book to anyone, Vonnegut lover or not. Works especially well as a travel book- plane, train, etc. The stories go quickly and pass the time very well."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Over the years, I had encountered a few of these short stories before. But I never sat down and went through the entire collection. I enjoyed at least 60% of them and a few seemed a bit like filler. My favorites are when Vonnegut tackles the absurd and really uses his wit to challenge our notions of ourselves. I Found that I enjoyed the title piece, \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" more this time than in the past. However, somehow \\"Harrison Bergeron\\" was less compelling to me now that I am older. Additionally, \\"All The King's Men\\" remained a solid work even if the cold-war is over and my reaction to \\"The Kid No One Could Handle\\" was the same. I very much enjoyed \\"Manned Missiles\\" as well as \\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\\". I would suggest skipping or at least skimming: The New Dictionary, The Long Walk to Forever, Miss Temptation and Who Am I This Time? But none of the stories are very long and none are unbearable to read so reading them all is of course and easy option."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I was very pleased with this purchase. This book truly shows Vonnegut's mastery of irony and creativity. I have a Bachelor's degree in English; that doesn't mean anything really, but I'd hope it means that I can tell bad writing from good... anyway, in creativity, this book rivals Vonnegut's masterpiece, Slaughterhouse Five. Even when approaching a sensative subject (rape, in the story \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\") he manages to make the \\"rape\\" a beautiful, just thing. It's pretty frickin' incredible. I'd recommend this book to everyone and anyone!"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"In my mind, Kurt Vonnegut is the writerly equivalent to an eccentric, sarcastic, but kindly old uncle, the one you can always count on to take the stuffing out of your more puffed-up, less agile-minded relatives at family Christmas parties, while giving you a sly wink. In an important way, he was a voice for America in the 1950s and 60s, both a counterpoint to and a commenter on \\"mainstream\\" attitudes. He could do zaniness, anger, sorrow, and gentleness equally well.This collection is a fine intro to what made the man great. A few stories fall a little flat, and a few feel dated, but most still resonate in one way or another. In style, they range from memoir to science fiction to allegory to absurd satire to\\"straight\\" fiction, which make them interesting as a prismatic breakdown of the eccentric, eclectic voice Vonnegut uses in his longer works. My own favorite story was a poignant piece about a half-black German orphan who encounters a unit of black American GIs in post-WWII Europe, and the friendship he forms with a particular soldier."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"You know, this book paints Life. It looks at society just like with the title story, and Harrison Bergeron and also looks inside the hearts of individuals. There is too much here. Buy this book and read a story a day. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Terrific reading material for a raining afternoon. Among my favorite short stories wereTom Edison's Shaggy Dog, The Euphio Question, Deer in the Works (which must have been an obvious influence on Terry Gilliams Brazil and a satire of big business and mindless capitalism) and Unready to Wear."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"We had to read the short story Harrison Bergeron, one of the stories in this collection. This was the first &quot;meaningful&quot; short story I ever remember reading. Symbols &amp; metaphors came alive--I concluded (and I remember this over 20 years later) that &quot;society always crucifies its messiahs.&quot; I couldn't leave it alone after that. I hunted down my own copy of Welcome to the Monkey House.If you're not ready to tackle one of Vonnegut's novels, take a shot at this collection of stories. Each one is a gem, faceted to challenge the spectrum of your thoughts. Not a book I recommend to &quot;staid&quot; folks, unless I want to see them shaken."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"This book was excellent, it was a Kaleidoscopeof different imaginative stories, and was not boring for one second. I would recomend this book to anyone who does not know how much fun it can be to read."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Welcome to the Monkey House is one of the best collections of short stories to date. It is an incredible read."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"My favorite Vonnegut book, of those I have read so far (including some of his non-fiction essays, which are terrible, his most well-known novels, which are mixed, and a couple of other short story collections, which are okay). The title story---about a future society that has outlawed sexual pleasure---and \\"Harrison Bergeron\\"---a brilliant satire of egalitarianism (which is strange, considering Vonnegut's own egalitarian leanings)---are great, and there are several other good stories, and none that are really bad. Definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"The book was in perfect condition and arrived promptly. The book even smelled new! I'm super happy with my purchase. As a soft cover book, I was worried about a few imperfections but there were none"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"The item I am reviewing is 5 BY KURT VONNEGUT which I ordered for my son. As the picture and copy stated it was 5 books in original slipcase. My son received one book. It was the book pictured which was \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\". I contacted the seller and he said it was his \\"suppliers\\" fault which only brings me to the conclusion that I should make sure that I'm buying from vendors that KNOW exactly what they are advertising,what they are selling, and what they are shipping.This is really my first poor experience buying through Amazon but it brings to mind a very important \\"proverb\\"in \\"let the buyer beware\\"."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I've loved Vonnegut's books, but never read his short stuff until this. According to the introduction, these stories were written to finance the novels. Anyway, it's full of the wit and challenging ideas Vonnegut is known for. Science fiction, but not really. Incidentally science fiction is all. Loved The Eupio Question."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"the novel is good but the shipping time was very lengthy wanted it sooner other than that the product was as discribed"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Collection of short stories, some within the science fictional mold, others more mainstream in content. A rather focused way for me to look at the strengths and weaknesses of Vonnegut as a writer, and assess my own ambivalence with him. I've enjoyed almost all his books yet have rarely made an effort to seek them out, generally picking them up when I'm around. I find him amusing but less insightful than he seems to think he is, creative but often too awkward in what he's trying to do that the larger project falls apart. By fame and general influence he's certainly a major figure in twentieth century writing, but on the strength of my own reading I wouldn't place him in that category, as with Gunter Grass but to a greater extent I find him lacking some quality that would allow real excellence. Part of that has always been my dislike over his self-marketing and scampering away from genre lables 'yes my books have time travel and aliens but they're literature, not that science fiction trash'. As with Margaret Atwood, there's something about that basic attitude that I see as either very calculating or very ignorant and dislike in either case. Strictly speaking that's not a valid issue to bring against their writing, which should be assessed for its basic effectiveness and not the labels attached to it.The stories in Welcome to the Monkey House are a mix, and a lot of specific stories I'm deeply ambivalent about. They're engaging, maintain a fast pace, and a very good talent in quickly establishing character and situation. At times they also provide some great creativity and imaginative use of some unconventional setups. At the same time I've got more than a little kickback to most of them. They often seem too impressed with their own cleverness, for one thing, playing up thier position as hilarious in a way that sets my teeth on edge. Additionally, in terms of actual stories the sequence of events is rather predictible, I was frequently able to predict the next step several pages in advance. Vonnegut has significant skills, but the way he uses them I don't find altogether fitting, and after a number of stories in a row I grew rather alienated from the (consistent) tone of the narrative voice. I definitely prefer Vonnegut's novels, and this reading has made me interested enough to try to finish reading his main corpus, but I retain some sizable reservations.Worse than: A is for Alien by Caitlin KiernanBetter than: The Deceitful Marriage and other exemplary novels by Miguel de Cervantes"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I love Kurt Vonnegut- I have read just about all of them. I really enjoyed this one cause it offered a different perspective on his genius--a unique experience compared to reading Cat's Cradle and Hocus Pocus. I'm not sure that I would recommend it for a first time reader, but only cause I don't want to spoil the experience for you!! Definitely, in this case, save the best for last. It is essential Vonnegut, but with a fresh twist to it."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"This is definitely one of my favourite books of all time. It might 'only' be a collection of short stories, but it is definitely the best introduction to Vonnegut's work, and is definitely some of his best."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Welcome to the Monkey House has something for everyone. Vonnegut does a masterful job wrapping you up in the world and lives of each story and character. Each of the stories drops you into a different time and place and makes you feel like you are truly there. After each story My view on the world was changed just slightly, So that when I was finished with the book I was looking at life with all new eyes. Pick this one up you won't regret it"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"My favorite book of all time. This is a book which is rich with invention thought provoking ideas and is hilarious all at once. This book always leaves me blind with tears of laughter 'til I can't read anymore. My favorites being the short stories Harrison Bergeron and Thomas Edisons Dog. Funny as it is, it is a book that evokes many emotions. I never have a copy of this book as I tend to give it away. It has become increasingly hard to find as few people know about it. Perhaps because it is a collection of short stories it is passed over for his more well known novels. But in my opinion you will not find a finer treasury of great stories than Welcome to the Monkeyhouse"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author, and I think it is fabulous. Let me just say, this book rolls"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I really enjoyed the bulk of the stories. They were definitely thought provoking, often dealing with the issues of technology"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Vonnegut in my opinion is both a genius and a madman. Ever since reading Slaughter House 5 in high school I have held Vonnegut in high regard and this collection of his short stories only strengthens my conviction that he is one of the greatest SF minds of his time. His stories are comical, fantastic, dramatic, and each one draws you in. Each story has something different to offer each with its own twists and turns. The story that gives this collection its name is my personal favorite though I enjoyed every single on of the 25 stories that make up the collection. So I invite you to step through the wacky yet masterful mind of Kurt Vonnegut and into the monkey house."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Once ubiquitous as sitcoms, the short story has almost become an endangered species. The genre now barely ekes out an existence in obscure literary journals. That's too bad, because one read of \\"Welcome to The Monkey House\\" reveals just what short stories can do. From humanist science fiction to askew romance, Kurt Vonnegut mastered the form before he became one of the most popular writers of the twentieth century. Back when books and magazines were television, these stories were submitted to big time magazines such as Collier's, Atlantic Monthly, and The Saturday Evening Post. They printed them. And they paid handsomely in those days. One could once live off of a steady stream of submission income. Those days have, of course, vaporized like so much warm milk. Vonnegut blamed television for the collapse.Released in 1970, this collection contains some of Vonnegut's earliest work. Elsewhere he wrote that \\"Report on the Barnhouse Effect,\\" from 1950, was his first published story. It's here, along with at least three absolute classics. \\"Harrison Bergeron,\\" one of Vonnegut's most cited works, begins with the unforgettable line: \\"The year was 2081, and everybody was finally equal.\\" Think PC gone completely hogwild. The protagonist of \\"Tom Edison's Shaggy Dog\\" argues that the light bulb was invented by Edison's dog, not by Edison himself. It's as hilarious as it is poignant. \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" depicts the future only as Vonnegut could. Everyone has been unsexed, meaning that they possess no feelings whatsoever in the vital areas. A rouge gang seeks to remedy this existence devoid of pleasure, inspired by a certain zoo monkey's inappropriate public actions. Vonnegut seemed to fear well-intentioned totalitarianism. \\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\\" and \\"Unready to Wear\\" share this paranoid theme. The rest of the book contains themes as various as Pok&eacute;mon characters. Stories about war, denial through interior decorating, corporate life, beauty, music as healer, computers in love, a machine that produces endless euphoria, and even a strange romantic tale from \\"Ladies Home Journal.\\" Pick and choose. Everyone should enjoy something between these covers.This collection alone would justify bringing back the short story as a popular form of entertainment. But it seems too late for such rabble-rousing. Technology, one of the things the self-proclaimed Luddite Vonnegut feared the most, played an enormous role in ending the golden age of reading. Apart from providing food for thought and laughter, this collection transports readers back to a time when the written word reigned."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"A good collection of short stories requires a vivid imagination and a wealth of various ideas, and Vonnegut shows off both of these traits in this anthology of his short works. He is truly a creator of worlds, capable of developing a colorful setting quickly and effectively in this brief format. As many of these works were written soon after the Red Scare, there are is an underlying theme involving cynicism towards structured society in general and communism specifically. However, this compilation is certainly a diverse blend of concepts - there is everything from a world in which the human mind has evolved to shed their physical manifestation to the creation of a device that produces a euphoric sensation. Vonnegut's tales and the characters found within are deep and meaningful as well, and there his wit manifests itself in every story to make each one enjoyable and distinct. One account tells about an actor who is shy, not really knowing what to say without a script, but who can completely become the characters he plays. A sense of irony can also often be found throughout this collection, with many things turning out different from what the society worked towards or from what we expect as readers. \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" is truly a multifaceted gem with much to offer; I wholeheartedly recommend to all readers as a joy to read, whether done in extended sittings or one story at a time."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Kurt Vonnegut has written some realy funny short stories. he has made them all fun to read and very intellectual. he has really made himself a true master of literature"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"It's interesting that most of the reviewers who give this anthology a high rating appear to be male, because only men (or adolescent boys) could fail to realize that the title story is, appallingly, about rape as a \\"good\\" thing. Vonnegut's premise in the \\"Monkey House\\" story is that in some future over-populated society, all sexuality will be suppressed by chemical means, and euthanasia will be encouraged in \\"Ethical Suicide Parlor\\" franchises. A renegade named Billy the Poet has been kidnapping the beautiful female operators of the suicide parlors, forcing them off their sex-suppression pills, and \\"deflowering\\" them in the name of freedom. What Billy actually does is rape these women, telling them that they should be grateful and that he only has their happiness in mind when he does this! That Vonnegut should present a rapist as a hero, someone who's trying to liberate the world from a sexually oppressive government/society, is simply ghastly and offensive! Billy's explanation that in Victorian times all women were in effect raped by their husbands on their wedding night is both historically inaccurate and just plain stupid. It's some kind of sick, sadistic male fantasy that a virgin will suddenly start to like sex when her only sexual experience has been a violent violation by a stranger! (Small wonder that the story was originally published in \\"Playboy\\" magazine!) Maybe if Billy had wooed the women and made them want to have sex with him (granted, he'd still have to kidnap them to keep them off their sex-suppression pills), Vonnegut could make the case for Billy as some sort of hedonistic, freedom-loving hero. It's a shame, because early on in the story there are flashes of humor and satiric barbs at American society; Vonnegut ruins it all in the truly repellent ending to his tale. As for the other stories: the science fiction ones are rather crudely written, somewhat jerky and forced, and often dated, although the story of \\"EPICAC\\" the computer is cute. Vonnegut does better in the real world: \\"The Kid Nobody Could Handle,\\" \\"All the King's Horses\\" (admittedly a tad fantastical), and \\"Who Am I this Time?\\" are poignant and interesting."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"I was surprised at how bad some of these are.

However, these short storie are absolutely terrible. All critiques of the writing style aside, the thing that got me the most was the the short story from which the anthology got its name advocates rape. I understand that these are stories that Vonnegut wrote to support himself and his family and to fund his novels, and as such can not particularly be seen as his 'vision', but they truely are terribly written and often ideoligically insulting."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" is a surprisinvly relevent set of short stories.

It is all real, or at least vividly imagined. These are the short stories Vonnegut sold while he worked on his memorable novels, which are all readily available here at Amazon. They are all worthy of our attention as historic narratives of a cultural epoch of our lives from one of the 20th century's most vigorous and lasting literary voices. He continues to speak to our dreams and fears and leaves it to us to decide which is which.These snippets offer insight into a culture little known elsewhere. It is, at turns, insightful into human nature or irreverent, even simultaneously when it suited the author's perception of his world, focused mainly on the middle of the last century. An exhilarating thing about this collection of short stories is you get servings of farce ricocheting through decades of life on parallel paths with tidbits of poignant ordinary existence and the occasional stark truth of the ignoble mindlessness of such things as how war is often conducted.Savor these emotional sojourns one at a time or in a sitting or two: enjoy as snacks or feasts. Browse until you're satisfied. If you love language, read them aloud -- to someone you care about or just yourself -- for the pure joy of the sounds.

And, as other reviewers have noted, there's been absolutely zero proofreading.

As it turned out, I liked all of the stories and finished the entire collection quite quickly. I found it interesting that I had read one of the stories, Harrison Bergeron, back in high school. As I reread it, the scenes I imaged all of those years ago came back to me. I have thought about the story from time to time over the decade and a half since I read it, so I think that speaks for the quality of content. I also found Welcome to the Monkey House highly amusing.

Dumping prisoners on an empty planet is a fairly old Si-Fi concept and has been used many times, but never with the angle Longyear takes on it.

Although I have never been very interested, or had many opinions on 'Justice', this book has helped me form some of my opinions on it. I found the book to be very realistic portrayal of the criminal mind/society and I would recomend this book to EVERYONE!!!!! I have already recomended this book to my history and psycology teachers after hearing concepts in their classes that this book could apply to. Please give the book a try. I garenttee that you will be glad you did! I was! :)"},{"Title":"Infinity Hold","review":"In 2115 Bando Nicos is a twenty-seven year-old inmate of \\"The Crotch\\", the Union of Terran Republics' prison for incorrigibles in Greenville, Mississippi. Like many other prisons, The Crotch is shut down and the entire population deposited on the planet Tartaros, named for the lowest level of hell, the galaxy's dumping ground for the unwanted. Soon after they are abandoned in the sandy desert of Tartaros, the seventeen thousand-plus population is reduced to three thousand. The remaining \\"sharks\\" decide they must band together if they want to survive, and elect a leader who makes Bando the first police officer of the newly-christened Razai gang. With the help of pre-teen killers, homicidal maniacs, and political dissidents, Bando makes up the brutally simple Law of the Razai as they travel in search of a place of refuge. In between trials and fights for survival against the gangs already in residence, Bando and his compatriots must think about the meaning of justice, and Bando examines his own heart to see if he is worthy of the trust placed in him.This edition contains all three books in the series: INFINITY HOLD, KILL ALL THE LAWYERS, and KEEP THE LAW, and features a lengthy introduction by the author (in which he hints that there may be more Tartaros books in the future)."},{"Title":"Infinity Hold","review":"There are substantial edits in this version of Infinity Hold (the first of three stories in the book). In my opinion the edits do nothing to improve the story and in some instances steal the heart from the story to the extent that they make what is one of the greatest SF stories of all time rather poor and unejoyable to read.I would strongly urge owners of the first edition who love the story never to read the reprint in this book.As to the second and third stories they are well writen but I feel they lack the soul of the original"},{"Title":"Infinity Hold","review":"It's not spectacular literature, but it is well written. In Enemy Mine he took on prejudice and war, in Infinity Hold Longyear takes on Prisons and Justice. Major thematic ideas and they are well executed. Realistic criminals, with a plot reminiscent of transporting criminals to Australia. But the story is more about the creation of Law and justice from nothing, and the redemption of themselves. It's not about how it turns out as much as how it begins."},{"Title":"Infinity Hold","review":"I have only read part I so far.The book definatley deserves at least 4 stars, as it is well written, but there is more to the book. To understand this book, read the dedicaton of Infintity Hold part I. It is dedicated to NA and those who died along the way.The book IS NOT about a group of prisoners dumped on a planet, thAt is just the setting. (A digression here. NA is a 12 step fellowship, like AA.) Most people are familiar with the fact that AA has 12 steps, but there are also 12 Tradtions and 12 Concepts.Using those it is possible to set up a society, and that is what Barry is doing.Meanwhile Nicos is getting into recovery from his rage.(\\"I didn't get into trouble every time I [fill in the blank] but every time I was in trouble I was [***ing]\\"). There is also a saying in the rooms, \\"Some of us may die, so that others can recover\\". Find it in the novel. Barry has actually written the meditation book he talks about \\"Yesterday's Tommorrows; Meditation for Hard Cases\\". Available on Amazon."},{"Title":"Infinity Hold","review":"I hadn't read anything new by Longyear in probably two decades. To see that he turned Infinity Hold into a trilogy was pretty cool. He not only did the original justice but improved the whole thing. The sense of hope I was left with when I completed the reading is a testament to the author's gift as a writer and his compassion as a human being.Victot"},{"Title":"Infinity Hold","review":"Red this book at the request of a colleague. I can see why he liked it, simplistic solutions for very complicated problems, much like ... Well then, a quick read, nothing complicated here, and an alright story but fails a deep understanding and complexity of societies problems. Read the history of places where prisoners have been dumped, e.g. Georgia & Australia, and as Paul Harvey says, \\"Here is the rest of the story.\\""},{"Title":"Infinity Hold","review":"I've been reading cheap science fiction ebooks for months, looking for good writers. It hasn't been easy - the Amazon rating system is practically useless. I read a lot of classic science fiction in my younger years, and I came to take certain things for granted - the writer understood the English language, understood how to drive a plot, could build a character, understood that a really good book should present some kind of moral or philosophical problem that would cause thought to happen in the reader, whether he knew it or not, etc. Restricting my reading pretty much to 4 and 5-star books, I have not found a single new writer who could do more than one of these things.That's changed. Infinity Hold is a book that would have taken its place along with the classic writers of 50 years ago, had it been written then. Barry Longyear - if Infinity Hold is a fair sample - is a better writer than China Mieville. He's a better writer than Neal Stephenson. He makes S.M.Stirling seem barely literate (of course I thought that before I read Infinity Hold, but now I know I don't have to settle).So, excellent book. Known Universe decides to dump its prison population on one terrible planet to fend for themselves. One bunch of losers somehow manages to stay together, survive, and reinvent law, justice, and personal responsibility. Nicely done. Five stars - not because it's on par with the best books I've ever read, but because it's damn good and four stars would put it on the level of some writers who aren't worth a minute of your time."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],H={key:0},W={key:1};function P(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",L,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const q=d(M,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-20c42fb8"]]),C=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/39.md","filePath":"quotesmag/39.md"}'),G={name:"quotesmag/39.md"},j=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{C as __pageData,j as default};
